      "text": "Cop who killed George Floyd 'stabbed by another inmate' in federal prison and 'seriously injured'\n\nDisgraced former Minneapolis, Minnesota police officer Derek Chauvin - who was convicted in 2021 for the murder of George Floyd - was just stabbed at a federal prison in Arizona.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Chauvin was \"stabbed by another inmate and seriously injured\" in the attack around 12:30 PM local time, and taken to a local hospital for further treatment after prison staff performed \"life-saving measures.\" Chauvin is roughly a year into both a 21-year federal prison sentence for depriving Floyd of his constitutional rights, and a 22 year state-level sentence for second-degree murder.\n\nChauvin was sent to FCI Tucson in 2022 after serving time at a maximum security prison in Minnesota, where he was largely kept in solitary confinement for his own protection. The AP reports that FCI Tucson has been \"plagued by security lapses and staffing shortages,\" and that this is the second such incident in roughly a year.\n\nPOLL: Should Trump be allowed to hold office again?\n\nIn November 2022, an inmate pulled a gun and attempted to shoot a visitor, though the weapon misfired and no one was hurt. This is also the second attack on a high-profile federal prisoner in the last five months. At a separate federal prison in Florida, former sports doctor Larry Nassar, who is serving time in prison for serial sex offenses committed against gymnasts, was stabbed by an inmate in July. He survived the attack.\n\nOn May 25, 2020, Chauvin was recorded on video kneeling on the neck of Floyd for approximately eight minutes and 15 seconds, who was being detained for allegedly paying for a pack of cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill. Floyd was heard on the video screaming \"I can't breathe\" and crying for his mother in the moments before his murder. The video outraged protesters, who took to the streets both in the US and around the world in a summer-long wave of anti-police brutality protests, with \"I can't breathe\" as a rallying cry.\n\nAccording to a New York Times analysis of the events of that day, Chauvin \"did not remove his knee even after Mr. Floyd lost consciousness and for a full minute and 20 seconds after paramedics arrived at the scene.\" Chauvin and several other officers present during Floyd's murder were all fired the next day, and subsequently charged by Hennepin County prosecutors. Tou Thao, who was acting as a \"human traffic cone\" at the time of Floyd's murder, was sentenced to four years and nine months in state prison."

      "text": "DC police officer 'privately shared' internal information with Proud Boys leader: report\n\nPolice officers were among the Washington, D.C. residents who were violently attacked when a mob of Donald Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol Building on January 6, 2021 in the hope of preventing the certification of now-President Joe Biden's Electoral College victory. According to federal prosecutors for the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the far-right groups that were involved in the Capitol insurrection included, among others, the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers and QAnon.\n\nYet activists who monitor far-right extremist groups have been warning about their efforts to ally themselves with members of law enforcement. According to the Associated Press , Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio was, in late 2020, fed information by an \"intelligence officer\" for the Metropolitan Police. The Miami-born Tarrio is facing federal seditious conspiracy charges along with four other members of the Proud Boys.\n\nAP journalist Michael Kunzelman, in an article published on February 15 , reports that Metropolitan Police Lt. Shane Lamond - according to the prosecution at Tarrio's trial - gave Tarrio \"internal information about law enforcement operations in the weeks before other members of his far-right extremist group stormed the U.S. Capitol.\"\n\nFederal prosecutor Conor Mulroe, Kunzelman reports , \"privately exchanged\" messages with Tarrio \"in the run-up to a mob's attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021.\"\n\n\"Lamond, an intelligence officer for the city's police department, was responsible for monitoring groups like the Proud Boys when they came to Washington for protests,\" the AP reporter explains . \"Less than three weeks before the January 6 riot, Lamond warned Tarrio that the FBI and U.S. Secret Service were 'all spun up' over talk on an Infowars internet show that the Proud Boys planned to dress up as supporters of President Joe Biden on the Democrat's inauguration day.\"\n\nWhen Mulroe asked FBI special agent Peter Dubrowski - one of the witnesses at the trial - how common it is for police officers to share internal information in that way, Dubrowski replied , \"I've never heard of it.\"\n\nTarrio, who lives in Florida, wasn't among the Proud Boys members who was in Washington, D.C. on January 6, 2021. Tarrio, in fact, had been arrested on January 4, 2021 in connection with something unrelated to the Capitol insurrection: the burning of a Black Lives Matter banner taken from an African-American church during a December 2020 protest. Federal prosecutors, however, allege that Tarrio helped coordinate a seditious conspiracy.\n\nKunzelman reports , \"In a message to Tarrio on December 25, 2020, Lamond said Metropolitan Police Department investigators had asked him to identify Tarrio from a photograph. He warned Tarrio that police may be seeking a warrant for his arrest. Later, on the day of his arrest, Tarrio posted a message to other Proud Boys leaders that said, 'The warrant was just signed'.... Tarrio and his four lieutenants are charged with seditious conspiracy for what prosecutors said was a plot to stop the peaceful transfer of presidential power and keep former President Donald Trump in the White House after the 2020 presidential election.\"\n\nRead the Associated Press' full report at this link ."

      "text": "'Obviously gun happy': Cop who killed Breonna Taylor rams car, pulls gun on residents\n\nFormer Louisville, Kentucky police officer Myles Cosgrove is now being accused of aggressive behavior in his new role as sheriff's deputy in a nearby county.\n\nAccording to the Louisville Courier Journal , Cosgrove, who was hired on as a sheriff's deputy in Carroll County this April, allegedly \"barreled into Happy Hollow trailer park at a high rate of speed without his emergency lights on,\" then rammed his police cruiser into a resident's truck so hard that the vehicle ricocheted into a nearby building and broke off two cinder blocks. He then reportedly damaged the rear end of another resident's car and proceeded to point his gun at the owner of the truck and several bystanders.\n\nThe owner of the truck, William Joshua Short, was eventually charged with wanton endangerment of a police officer and with fleeing and evading police. However, witnesses to the incident told the Journal that Short made no attempt to run away from Cosgrove.\n\nPOLL: Should Trump be allowed to hold office again?\n\n\"[Cosgrove] hit him pretty hard,\" said witness Jackie McCormack. \"He just straight rammed him.\"\n\n\"He is obviously gun happy,\" McCormack added.\n\n\"Josh could have been killed,\" Alexus Mobley, who was a passenger in Short's truck, told the Journal.\n\nCosgrove was fired from the Louisville Metropolitan Police Department (LMPD) after the botched no-knock raid that killed Louisville resident Breonna Taylor in March of 2020. Cosgrove himself fired 16 bullets into Taylor's apartment, including the shot that the FBI said killed the 26 year old medical technician in her sleep.\n\nFour other officers who took part in the raid - Joshua Jaynes, Kyle Meany, Brett Hankison, and Kelly Goodlett - are all currently facing federal charges of civil rights violations, conspiracy, use of excessive force offenses and obstruction. Officers Jaynes, Meany, and Goodlett are accused of lying in order to obtain the warrant that led to the raid.\n\nKentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron (R), who is the Republican nominee in Kentucky's 2023 gubernatorial election, oversaw the grand jury proceedings that ultimately led to no state charges being filed against any of the officers involved."

      "text": "police brutality\n\nA law enforcement training company that held a summit attended by roughly 1,000 police officers nationwide has been accused of encouraging cops to adopt violent, discriminatory and unconstitutional behaviors, News From The States reports.\n\nInvestigators with the office of acting New Jersey Comptroller Kevin Walsh said that the training firm Street Cop - which held a 2021 conference in Atlantic City, New Jersey - promoted \"views and tactics that were wildly inappropriate, offensive, discriminatory, harassing, and, in some cases, likely illegal,\" according to the report.\n\nWalsh's office also called for a separate investigation by the state attorney general's office.\n\nPOLL: Should Trump be allowed to hold office again?\n\n\"The fact that the training undermined nearly a decade of police reforms - and New Jersey dollars paid for it - is outrageous,\" Walsh said in a public statement.\n\nIn the 43-page report , Walsh's office detailed how Street Cop instructors encouraged conference attendees to profile drivers when conducting vehicle stops, noting that many of their recommendations violated directives from the state attorney general and flew in the face of the Fourth Amendment. One instructor reportedly told session participants to \"be the calmest person in the room but have a plan to kill everyone.\" Another boasted that he was \"batting .500\" when shooting people in the line of duty, killing four people while shooting in eight in 13 recorded instances of excessive force. An Oklahoma sheriff leading one session said \"sometimes you have to shoot folks\" when talking about police officers having an affinity for firearms.\n\nStreet Cop founder Dennis Benigno initially sued to stop Walsh's office from investigating his firm, but lost in court. He told the New Jersey Monitor that he planned to \"impose stricter standards on colloquial and jocular language occasionally used by some instructors\" in future training sessions, and that some of the comments Walsh's office highlighted in his report were \"an attempt at humor.\"\n\n\"[T]here is not one single instance in the OSC Report where we have advocated any practice that is inconsistent with quality policing,\" Benigno said. \"Isolated excerpts taken out of context from a week-long training are not reflections of the overall quality of the education that Street Cop provides.\"\n\nWalsh said during a press conference that Street Cop is just one of several firms he wants to investigate, saying \"systemic risks seem to extend far beyond Street Cop, and Street Cop and this particular training provides an example of what can go wrong, and went very wrong there.\"\n\nThe full report is here .\n\nA new document released this week reveals first-hand accounts of a Portland police officer's racist remarks that led to his firing. But despite the disturbing comments documented in the newly revealed letter, he will still be getting a $100,000 settlement payout.\n\nThis article was produced in partnership with the South Bend Tribune , a member of ProPublica s Local Reporting Network . It was co-published with the New York Times.\n\nPolice outside of Charleston, South Carolina, don't believe that high school students should read about police brutality. So even though two books on the subject were assigned on a summer reading list for a high school freshman class, local police made sure to express their objections . The Hate U Give is a book about a teenage girl dealing with the shooting of her unarmed best friend at the hands of police. All American Boys chronicles the experience of a teenage boy who is wrongly accused of stealing and then is beaten by a police officer. Both are award-winning books that made it on to the New York Times bestseller list. Neither book is required-they are two on a list of eight and students are only asked to choose one to read.\n\nEphraim Casado was pulled over for littering in 2017. His lawyer says Miami-Dade authorities committed assault after Casado exited his vehicle with hands raised.\n\nPresident Donald Trump endorsed the demands of Chicago police officers in their conflict with the city's mayor in a tweet Friday night, saying they have \"have every right to legally protest\" - a sentiment seeming to conflict with his push to punish black athletes in the NFL who protest silently during the national anthem.\n\nA Louisiana woman was arrested on homicide charges after an off-duty police officer crashed into the car she was riding in and killed her baby daughter.\n\nWhat the public gets wrong.\n\nBaltimore City Police officers of the Gun Trace Task Force (GTTF) Evodio Hendrix, Maurice Ward , Daniel Hersl, Marcus Taylor , Wayne Jenkins, Thomas Allers, Jemell Rayam and Momodu Gondo are guilty of a plethora of crimes falling under their racketeering convictions, ranging from robbery and selling drugs to fraud. All eight men are currently awaiting sentencing.\n\nAs I've been following this case, listening to opinions and collecting information­, one common narrative I've heard is this: \"Those cops only targeted criminals. They had to use special tactics to keep up with the everyday evolving world of crime, and everyday citizens weren't affected by their actions.\" This claim is problematic for a number of reasons. Let's use the case of April Sims as an example.\n\nSims, a successful hair stylist in Baltimore, was targeted by the GTTF back in 2016. Her flashy car caught the attention of Jenkins, and he started watching her apartment, excitedly reporting suspicious activity to Gondo, according to the Baltimore Sun . Jenkins then crafted a plan to raid her home in search of cash and other goods. He told Gondo that only they and Hersl would be involved in this mission. He thought there would be $40,000 to $50,000 inside that the three could split. Hersl responded, \"I can use the money, I'm in the process of buying a house.\"\n\nThe officers were caught on tape entering her complex. They were denied access by security until Hersl came in with a piece of paper and some police gear. The trio found no cash; however, they did retrieve 390 grams of heroin, gel caps, a digital scale and a Chanel bag worth $5,000. They turned in the drugs, along with the rest of the paraphernalia, and Gondo gave the purse to a woman he was dating. Reporting the drugs wasn't an example of good police work - it was a petty attempt to make Sims pay for not having cash in the house for the police officers to steal.\n\nThe counterargument I'm hearing revolves around the 390 grams of heroin that came off of the street as a result of the officers' break-in; however, that neglects the fact that the officers were not looking for drugs. Finding heroin was not a part of their agenda. They were looking for cash and stumbled across the heroin by mistake during a botched robbery, while using their badges as a shield. There's also the question of where the drugs actually came from - they could have been planted in Sims' home, as the racketeering investigation proved the members of the task force had done so to frame others.\n\nRemember, finding drugs was never a part of their mission. That means that they were the bad guys, too. Actually, the GTTF are worse than the bad guys, because they stole after pledging to protect and serve the people of Baltimore. Meanwhile, our taxes paid their ridiculously high salaries and their fraudulent overtime .\n\nTrue police reform will never happen as long as we continue to make excuses for police officers when they break laws while celebrating every time they accomplish something they get paid to do. Our low standards are evident when we applaud cops reporting a drug bust, even after we find out their only true intention was to steal.\n\nOn Thursday, Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee, with the support of four Democrats, recommended a Senate vote for Kurt Engelhardt, a district court judge in Louisiana who has been nominated by Donald Trump to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. That means Engelhardt will likely be up for confirmation very soon, despite his history of disturbing rulings on cases involving racial violence and injustice, as well as cases involving sexual harassment and workplace discrimination against women.\n\nThe linguistic gymnastics needed to report on police violence without calling up images of police violence is a thing of semantic wonder. Officers don't shoot, they are merely \"involved\" in shootings; victims are not victims, but \"suspects\" \"fleeing\"; human beings become premortem cadavers as bullets \"enter the torso\" rather than the chest of a person; guns and bullets act on their own as they \"discharge\" or \"enter the right femur,\" rather than being fired by autonomous individuals with agency and purpose. Headlines become 14-word, jargon-heavy tangles where a simple five-word description would suffice.\n\nIn September, Chicago Police Officer John Catanzara made headlines after posting on Facebook a picture of himself, in uniform, holding an American flag and a homemade sign that read, \"I stand for the anthem. I love the American flag. I support my president and the 2nd Amendment.\"\n\nProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom.

Creighton vigorously attacks 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in the ad, which the Washington Post's Glenn Kessler fact-checks in his September 16 column .\n\nIn the ad, Creighton says of Harris, \"Four years ago, in this alley, rioters threw a brick at my face and knocked out my teeth. Why? Because I was a police officer. And what did Kamala Harris do? While America's cities were burning, Kamala was defending peaceful protests. She raised millions to help bail rioters out of jail. And supported defunding our police, making us all less safe. Kamala Harris is dangerous.\"\n\nBut according to Kessler , Creighton \"ignores that Harris condemned the riots, even as she said people had a right to peacefully protest.\"\n\nCreighton, Kessler emphasizes , glosses over the fact that Harris was quite forceful in her condemnation of violent rioters in August 2020.\n\nFormer prosecutor Harris, then a U.S. senator, said, \"It's no wonder people are taking to the streets, and I support them. We must always defend peaceful protest and peaceful protesters. We should not confuse them with those looting and committing acts of violence.\"\n\nWhen riots took place in Portland, Oregon, Kessler notes , Harris tweeted, \"I join @JoeBiden in condemning this violence. This cannot - and must not - be who we are. Americans deserve a president who will heal our country and bring people together - not fan the flames of hate and division.\"\n\nCreighton's claim that Harris \"raised millions to help bail rioters out of jail,\" according to Kessler , \"cannot be verified.\"\n\nHarris, Kessler points out , supported a group called the Minneapolis Freedom Fund, which raised bail money for nonviolent Floyd protesters.\n\nGlenn Kessler's full Washington Post column is available at this link (subscription required)."

He particularly blasted the incoming president for referring to jailed January 6 rioters as \"hostages,\" and reminded CNN viewers that many of those who would be let out of jail assaulted law enforcement officers in an effort to violently overturn an election.\n\n\"You know, I followed the cases. I've testified in a few. I went to a lot of the sentencings. I stood by officers as they gave impact statements,\" Dunn said. \"Let's be clear: They broke the law.\"\n\nDunn clarified that despite personally confronting participants in the deadly riot that resulted in the deaths of police officers like Officer Brian Sicknick and injured roughly 140 others , he was on the side of criminal justice reform and that \"the punishment needs to fit the crime.\" However, he added that those who were found guilty of carrying out acts of violence on January 6 are fully deserving of their sentences.\n\n\"They were there unlawfully and they kept us from doing our job and securing the Capitol grounds that day,\" Dunn said, adding that he has \"no sympathy\" for people who attacked his colleagues.\n\n\"Even if they were there to protest a stolen election or they got caught up in the moment, that's no excuse for the crimes that they committed, and they need to be held accountable,\" he continued. \"It would be a slap in the face to me, to law enforcement, to the American people if Donald Trump would come in and just overstep the Justice Department, but it shows that he has every intention of doing so. And I don't think it's okay.\"\n\n\"Those people that committed those crimes that are sentenced to multiple years, they assaulted police. They conspired to overthrow the government. They impeded police while they were doing their job,\" he added. \"Those people, I believe they've been properly sentenced.\"\n\nTrump has specifically mentioned that he wants to pardon January 6 participants incarcerated in the Washington, D.C. jail. And as New York University's Just Security publication reported earlier this year , many of the rioters in the D.C. jail are there specifically for assaulting law enforcement officers. While some were found guilty by juries, others pleaded guilty of their own volition.\n\nSome participants in the insurrection have already changed their legal strategy in light of Trump's reelection. An attorney for defendant Christopher Carnell asked U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell last week to postpone a scheduled status hearing due to the \"expected scope of clemency\" from the president-elect.\n\nWatch Dunn's segment below, or by clicking this link."

According to the Denver Post, Jon Geiger was hired to a small police department in the rural town of Nunn, Colo., home to only 500 residents.\n\nWhen Joe Klingan hired the longtime police officer, he thought he was making a sound decision. Although Geiger had pleaded guilty to harassment in 2018 after an infraction with an inmate and the Colorado Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) board had decertified him, things still managed to work in Geiger's favor.\n\nBy the time he'd submitted his employment application in Nunn, Colo., the POST board had reversed its decision. In fact, Geiger made such an impression on his new job, he was promoted to interim police chief just one month after being hired. However, everything came crashing down on Monday, July 19 when the Denver Post exposed the so-called \"loopholes\" that allowed Geiger to be rehired to a law enforcement agency despite his questionable past.\n\nNow, Bruce Brown, the former Fifth Judicial District Attorney, is sounding off about Geiger's rehiring. At the time of his previous conviction, Brown praised his decertification describing it as \"weeding out 'bad apples' in law enforcement.\" Speaking to the publication, Brown shared his reaction to learning about Geiger's new role in Nunn.\n\n\"This is a man who should not be wearing a badge,\" Brown said, adding, \"And it discredits the integrity of the criminal justice system, as well as the hiring practices of local law enforcement agencies, who obviously are not doing thorough background searches or who are not making decisions in the best interest of their communities.\"\n\nTaft Yates, the former chief of police of the Ellis Police Department, also echoed similar sentiments.\n\n\"This is why agencies get a bad name,\" Yates said. \"How overall law enforcement gets a bad name. Because I will tell you like this: What I saw on that video and what I had heard, I don't know how he can be working for any agency.\"\n\nBrian Ahern, the former chair of the local police watchdog organization Citizen Advisory Board and a nightclub manager in Telluride, Colo., also sounded off with his opinion of Geiger having employment opportunities in law enforcement despite his checkered past.\n\n\"He should have never been allowed to wear the badge after he left Telluride,\" he said. \"But because he was given a free pass, this is what happens.\""

I think the verdict was just.... It was an open-and-shut case.\"\n\nThat was when Carlson grew angry and defensive, asking Gavin, \"Do we enforce the law?\" And Carlson implied that police will no longer be able to protect the public, telling Gavin, \"The guy who did it looks like he's going to spend the rest of his life in prison.

      "text": "Why Police Officers Rarely Change Jobs\n\nWhat happens when officers feel stuck in a department?\n\nSubscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts\n\nIn 2020, the law professors John Rappaport and Ben Grunwald published an article called \"The Wandering Officer,\" where they found that police officers who had been fired earlier in their career were more likely to be fired again-and more likely to receive a \"moral character violation\" complaint. The research has informed the debate about police reform in the years since.\n\nFour years later, Rappaport-along with Jonathan S. Masur and Aurélie Ouss-has published another article , revealing that, on average, policing is a stagnant job, meaning that police officers very rarely move between jobs and departments. The researchers got access to 20 years of data and found that roughly 70 percent of Illinois officers in their sample had held just one job, and another 21 percent had held just two. And it's not necessarily that they're choosing to stay in one job. A lot of policies have made it costly to switch agencies.\n\nWhat the researchers found is that when police are stuck in the same law-enforcement agency, stuck with the same peers and commanding officer, they are also more likely to adhere to the \"blue wall of silence\"-an unwritten code to never implicate another officer of wrongdoing. As the authors write, \"Unlike in other professions, it is terribly difficult for police officers to quit in protest or even to object to the orders they receive. If the policies and priorities of senior law enforcement management are misguided, the entire law enforcement organization is stuck with them.\"\n\nIn today's episode of Good on Paper , Rappaport joins me to discuss both of his papers and the factors keeping police locked in place.\n\nThe following is a transcript of the episode:\n\nJerusalem Demsas: On July 6, Sonya Massey was shot and killed in her Illinois home by a Sangamon County police officer, Sean Grayson. Grayson and another police officer had come to Massey's home after she'd called 911 about a prowler . Once inside her house, Grayson asked Massey to remove a pot on the stove-an interaction which rapidly ended with him opening fire. He claimed to have feared for his life because of the pot of water. And, as a result, the 36-year-old mother of two is dead.\n\nThis is a horrible and all-too-common story. And in the weeks following Massey's death, one additional fact came to light: Grayson had held five jobs in four years, all at different police departments in central Illinois. Now he's been fired from a sixth. The AP reports that at one of those jobs, as a sheriff's deputy in Logan County, \"he was reprimanded for ignoring a command to end a high-speed chase and ended up hitting a deer.\"\n\nWhy do police officers like Grayson keep getting hired?\n\nPart of the answer comes from today's guest, UChicago law professor John Rappaport, whose research on \"wandering officers\" revealed the extent to which previously fired officers find jobs in new departments and the structural incentives of small departments to keep hiring them.\n\nBut Rappaport's newest paper complicates the thinking around police-labor mobility. While his earlier research shows that wandering officers are more likely to act improperly in their new roles, his new research reveals how other officers actually find it very difficult to move, exacerbating norms like the \"blue wall of silence\" that keeps police from reporting on each other.\n\nMy name is Jerusalem Demsas. I'm a staff writer here at The Atlantic , and this is Good on Paper , a policy show that questions what we really know about popular narratives. Today's episode explores how we should think about the problem of police-labor mobility. Are there ways that police are too stagnant? Would there be fewer instances of police brutality and misconduct if it was easier to leave one police job for another?\n\nAll right. Well, hi, John. Welcome to the show.\n\nJohn Rappaport: Hi to you. Thanks for having me.\n\nDemsas: Yeah, of course. So I feel like this paper is kind of interesting. I love talking about-in my reporting, I report about the law, I report about economics, and I report about political science. I feel like we found all three in one place. And so I'm really excited to have this conversation.\n\nBut I want to start with the paper you wrote four years ago. And the context of that paper is that often police officers who are credibly accused of heinous acts of murder or corruption are revealed to have been previously fired or let go from other agencies. Not always, but this happens at a level where it started to cause a lot of questions: How often is this happening? Is this something that really explains a lot of police misconduct or just the police has bad employees in these instances?\n\nSo you wrote a paper called \"The Wandering Officer,\" and you and your co-author published this at The Yale Law Journal . And I'm hoping we can start there, and you can walk us through that paper. How many wandering officers are there, and how did you find that out?\n\nRappaport: Sure. So we were using a statewide dataset from the state of Florida, and we had read, like a lot of other people, all sorts of anecdotal accounts about these wandering officers, and we were really curious just how common they were. And when we ran the numbers, we found that about 2 to 3 percent of all police officers in the state of Florida at any given time are wandering officers. That is about 1,100 officers, give or take.\n\nTo be clear, we defined wandering officer in the paper as an officer who's actually been fired before and then obtains another job. So that defined that way, we found about 2 to 3 percent.\n\nDemsas: Are there ways that you're worried Florida might be an outlier, or are there ways that you checked it against other states?\n\nRappaport: We're just starting to do that, actually, and work here in 2024. I'm starting to try to look at other states. The data is not as good, but maybe we can find out a little bit just to see whether Florida seems way out of line. And the preliminary results suggest that it's not way out of line. There's, of course, a range from state to state, but I don't think Florida is out of the mainstream in any respect.\n\nDemsas: So your main finding, as you said, is that, in any given year, roughly 1,100 officers who had been previously fired were working for Florida agencies. It seems like a substantial number, but you also say that's just 3 percent. How should we think about that? Is that a lot of people?\n\nRappaport: I think it's in the eye of the beholder. When we wrote the paper, we genuinely didn't know whether people would read it and think, Oh, they've just proven that this is not really a significant problem , or, They've just proven that this is a significant problem. And it seems to me, from the reception that the paper has received over the last few years, that people think it's a serious problem and that even 2 to 3 percent is way too many.\n\nDemsas: Well, what about you? What do you think when you see that number?\n\nRappaport: I mean, I think it's high if you think about 1,100 officers, and then you think about all the different interactions that any given police officer is going to have over the course of, say, a year. I think we multiplied it out somewhere in the paper and said, This is probably hundreds of thousands of civilian interactions in the year .\n\nAnd another important finding in the paper is that wandering officers go on to get fired or be subject to serious complaints of misconduct at about twice the rate of other officers. And so once you have that finding in mind, then you think, Eleven hundred sounds like a lot, and a couple hundred thousand interactions with people who are going to go on to get fired or commit serious misconduct at highly elevated rates is too much .\n\nDemsas: I've been at this job for a little over two-and-a-half years now. That's the longest job I've ever had in my life. And most of my friends who are either Millennials or younger, or even a little bit older than that, are very used to job switching. We're used to hearing adults and employers say in the media that job switching means that you're lazy or you're bad at your job. But that's not something we take, usually, very seriously. Why would that be different with police officers?\n\nRappaport: Well, I think it depends on what kind of labor mobility we're talking about here. To shade into the newer paper a little bit, I think we may have too much of the bad kind of mobility and too little of the good kind of mobility. So I agree; I think that changing jobs is not inherently a bad thing, but when we're looking at something like the wandering officer, it's a little bit different from your just typical, average Millennial.\n\nWe're looking at officers who've been fired. It's hard to fire a police officer, so if they've been fired, that already says something significant about them. And if they're then bouncing around in subsequent agencies, I think that looks a little bit different from you and your friends changing jobs.\n\nDemsas: You also find that officers who were fired tend to move to smaller agencies with fewer resources in areas with larger communities of color. Why is that happening? Why is that an easier place for them to find work?\n\nRappaport: I think there's just a greater demand and a smaller supply of officers in those areas. We've been hearing a lot in the news, especially over the last four or five years, about the hiring or the retention crisis in policing. I don't know how real that is or how ubiquitous that is, but I know there are a lot of places that don't have a ton of good applicants, and they're the ones that tend to be reaching to hire these wandering officers.\n\nDemsas: Should we expect to see in smaller agencies just higher rates of police misconduct? Is that what we see when we look at the literature?\n\nRappaport: That's a good question. I'm not sure that we really know the answer very confidently to that question. But it's a reasonable hypothesis based on what we do know.\n\nDemsas: One thing that got me thinking, especially when you were talking about the need that smaller agencies really have, is the trade-off that they might have to make, right? Because if you're a small, cash-strapped agency, and your choices are to hire a police officer that's been fired before-but maybe he seems fine in the interview, and you want to give him a chance-what's the risk of hiring that individual person versus the risk of not having an officer, which we know can often lead to also high rates of crime and victimization? How do we weigh those sorts of things?\n\nRappaport: Right. It's not an enviable position to be in, I think. Especially before the research came out, you might even think that some managers and small-town agencies would think that a guy who has been fired before is going to behave better because even though it's, in general, very hard to fire an officer, Here's one that got fired, so he knows he's not invincible, right? And he's going to fall in line when I hire him this time. And that's what he's saying to me in the interview , as you suggested. But now, after seeing the research and realizing that, at least on average, wandering officers get fired and receive serious misconduct complaints at twice the rate of other officers, it's hard to follow that line of thinking any longer.\n\nBut there are other trade-offs, as you say. You have to think about hiring this guy or hiring a rookie. Now, he may be more likely to commit misconduct than a rookie, but he might also be cheaper than a rookie because we have to train a rookie. It's going to be a long time before a rookie can be out on the streets by himself doing the same kinds of things that this veteran officer might be able to do.\n\nYou posited that we're a small, cash-strapped agency, so that's another trade-off I have to make. And then, as you say, there's even a third trade-off, which is: Should I hire this guy or hire nobody? And that's going to be, obviously, very context dependent, but there are situations in which you could imagine a reasonable manager concluding it's better to have somebody than nobody.\n\nDemsas: The main reason you're here is because you also wrote a new paper very recently. And when I first heard about \"The Wandering Officer\" paper from a few years ago, and it got a lot of attention-I don't really focus on criminal-justice reform as an issue I report on-but what I generally took away from it is that we should kind of be suspect, very suspect of any officer trying to get a job in a new area, any officer that's been fired before.\n\nAnd I don't know if I formed the strongest policy beliefs off of it, but it did feel like the main takeaway was that police mobility was bad. Is that how you saw it? Did you feel like others read your paper as sort of an indictment of police-labor mobility?\n\nRappaport: I think some people might have, but that's, maybe, over-reading the paper to some extent because we are talking about mobility just among a very small segment of the policing profession, rather than mobility of your average officer.\n\nDemsas: I'm hoping you can talk to us about this new paper, then. You have a new paper out. It's called, \"Labor Mobility and the Problems of Modern Policing.\" What's the top line of that? What are you trying to do? What did you find?\n\nRappaport: Well, first of all, we do a couple of things in the paper. There's an empirical part of the paper, and then there's a conceptual or theoretical contribution. In the empirical part of the paper, we wanted to just try to figure out: How much lateral mobility is there for police officers? I had heard, anecdotally, from someone in the policing world that, Hey, it's really hard to change jobs if you don't like your job in policing.\n\nAnd this was news to me, maybe partly because of the wandering-officer research. But this was news to me that there are these police officers who are at agencies, and they really don't like their job, but they feel like it's really hard for them to move.\n\nAnd so I wanted to figure out whether this was, first of all, accurate and whether it was a general phenomenon and, second of all, try to think a little bit about why that was the case and think about: What are the implications of that phenomenon if it turns out to be real? And so that's what we try to do in this paper.\n\nDemsas: How do you do it? I know you're looking at Illinois data now. Does Illinois also have a good dataset available? Or why'd you pick them?\n\nRappaport: Illinois has pretty good data. Actually, in an appendix of the paper, we replicate most of the results using the Florida data to try to stave off any concern that this is something unique to Illinois. There was one good thing about the Illinois data that's not true of the Florida data, which is that we can see officers' ranks-police officers, detective, sergeant, and so on. There's not really one specific way to measure labor mobility, so we look at it from a few different perspectives.\n\nThe first thing we do is just look to see, Well, how many different jobs do police officers in our dataset have? And it turns out that 70 percent of the officers in our dataset have only one policing job in Illinois, and another 21 percent have only two jobs.\n\nDemsas: Wow.\n\nRappaport: And this looks very similar in the Florida data. And so right away that tells you that most people are finding a job and they're staying put, or they're making one move in their career and that these officers who are bouncing around from agency to agency to agency are something of an anomaly.\n\nDemsas: Why aren't they moving? Why aren't they moving more?\n\nRappaport: This is a big question, right? This is a big part of the heart of the paper, is to try to figure out: What are the causes of this friction that keeps officers from changing jobs? And I think there's a lot of different reasons here. We sort them into what we call nonlegal and legal reasons. In terms of the nonlegal reasons, we're talking about all sorts of different things-like, for example, the fact that most police departments are natural monopsonies. They are the only game in town when it comes to policing.\n\nIf you work in a small city in Illinois, there's only one police employer in your city, which is very different from if you were a mechanic or you were a plumber or you worked in health care. There's probably lots of different jobs that you could get even in a small city. But with policing, there's very few, often only one option within your commuting zone.\n\nIt makes it really hard to change jobs, especially when you couple with that residency requirements that a lot of police departments have, that you have to live in the city where you work. Those might be a good thing for a lot of reasons, but they do make it harder to change jobs, because it means that changing jobs means you must move your home.\n\nDemsas: To me, there's obviously a lot of research and push to get police to live in the places they work, right? There's a lot of people who argue that it makes people more grounded in the communities that they're in, that it's really good if people have been there for a long time. There may even be domain-specific knowledge that they're getting, whether it's the knowledge that they're getting of walking that community, knowing the people, knowing what the hotspots are on their own, feeling comfortable in it, not feeling on edge.\n\nBut then also, even on just a more practical level, regulations might shift from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Is it the case that this sort of stability might outweigh the costs? Like, there are a ton of benefits that might be accruing that are, maybe, difficult to measure?\n\nRappaport: It is possible. We raise this as a potential concern. But we say in the paper that there are both costs and benefits to limited labor mobility for police officers, and we're not exactly sure which one to weigh out. We are concerned about the potential costs of low mobility. But there are benefits, as you say. You might attract a certain kind of candidate who wants to make a commitment to that neighborhood or that town.\n\nThere's actually research-Elizabeth Linos at Harvard has done some research about what kind of job announcements attract people into the policing profession. And she finds that people are more attracted by job announcements that talk about job stability than they are by announcements that talk about public service, and that this is especially true for women and people of color. So we don't dispute at all the fact that there are lots of potential upsides to having limited mobility in the profession. But there are some downsides, we think, too.\n\nDemsas: And what are those downsides? If you're staying in place, what is the big cost that's happening there? For some people, that feels like the dream, that you get to have a job that you get to stick in for a long time.\n\nRappaport: If you like it.\n\nDemsas: ( Laughs .) Yeah.\n\nRappaport: If you like your coworkers. If you like what you do. If you like your superiors.\n\nI think, again, there are multiple costs we could talk about. The first thing that comes to mind is just this question of stagnation-the idea that you may well have a lot of mismatch in your agency. You have a lot of officers who aren't necessarily well matched in terms of the skills that they're being asked to use, but they can't make that lateral move that would allow them to get a better match.\n\nThis kind of thing could lead to burnout. You could have officers who are unhappy on the job. They don't like their job. Maybe they don't like their coworkers. They don't like their partner. But it's very hard for them to move, and so they may burn out. They may decrease their effort. They might even start breaking the rules more often.\n\nI also think that-although it's true that job stability might attract certain candidates into the profession-limited lateral mobility might also deter other kinds of candidates from entering the profession. And maybe the type of people who want a career that's going to allow them to bounce around and be upwardly mobile-maybe those people are not entering the profession to begin with.\n\nDemsas: It feels like some of the things that you're talking about that are restraining police mobility seem almost just insurmountable. Like, the fact that there are going to be large gaps in distance between different police jurisdictions just seems like it obviously has to be that way. You can't really have a thick labor market for policing. You're not going to have the Chicago [PD], the Atlanta [PD], the LAPD all in the same spot for someone to be able to bargain between for jobs. So is this something that's just insurmountable? Or how much of it are factors that are just a part of policing's function and form in America?\n\nRappaport: Yeah. I think there are some factors, some sources of friction that are insurmountable, to use your word. But there are others that we didn't get to yet that I think are much more malleable. There's a whole set of laws, I think, that make it more costly for police officers to change jobs.\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind is the pension system. Unlike a lot of private-sector workers in this country, police officers don't have 401(k)s. They don't have defined-contribution retirement plans. They have defined-benefit plans, which are also called pensions, right? And pensions typically have a very long vesting period-could be something on the order of 10 years.\n\nIf you change your job-you start working at one agency. You don't like it. You want to change. If you change your job before the 10-year mark, then everything that your employer contributed to your pension is going to go up in smoke. It's just gone. You can't take your service credit with you, meaning if you start over at agency No. 2, you don't get credit for the hours that you put in at agency No. 1 toward your pension. You have to start over at zero.\n\nYou also are going to lose your rank. So if you're a sergeant at agency No. 1, and then you move to agency No. 2, you start back as a police officer. You're also going to lose your seniority. So seniority is a little bit different from rank. Seniority is usually governed by a collective-bargaining agreement, and it gives you access to benefits like vacation days and equipment and good shift assignments, right? Who takes the graveyard shift? That's determined by seniority. These kinds of things are legally created, and I think they are potentially changeable.\n\nDemsas: Why do these things exist, right? Why is it not possible to port your rank or to port your seniority or to bring your pension along? And you would imagine there might be a lot of variation across a country of 90,000 different localities. Why is there so much stagnation here?\n\nRappaport: Yeah. So here, too, I think there's a host of different reasons at play. One way to think about the question is: Why do police officers tolerate this limited mobility, right? They're thought to be politically powerful-they're a politically powerful lobby, politically powerful unions. And limited mobility is typically, all else equal, thought to be bad for employees. It's good for employers because it suppresses wages and it reduces turnover costs, but it's bad for employees because it suppresses wages. And so why do police officers put up with this?\n\nI think the first thing you have to see is that the very same rules that make it hard for an officer to lateral out of an agency also make it hard for other officers to lateral into the agency and compete with that officer for promotions, shifts, resources, and so on. And so these rules that restrict lateral mobility are fundamentally protectionist rules.\n\nNow, why would police officers want protectionist rules? I don't know exactly, but we can think of a couple of hypotheses. One is that maybe police officers think that they're unlikely to want to move. They think of themselves, like you say-they've found the dream. They've got a good public-sector job. They're serving the public. They have a pension coming to them if they stay put, and they think they're unlikely to want to move. If you think you're unlikely to want to move, then you don't really care about rules that make it hard for you to lateral out. You do still care about rules that make it easy for other people to lateral in and compete with you. And so you want to clamp down on that.\n\nBut even if it's not the case that cops believe they're unlikely to want to move, there's a sort of jurisdictional collective-action problem going on where I think police officers, in the aggregate, on the whole, would collectively be better off with more mobility because it helps to increase wages, among other things.\n\nBut for any given officer, the scope of her influence is really limited, meaning she can have sway, at most, over the rules that are in place at her agency or in her state. She could potentially put pressure on the relevant decision makers to change those rules. But she can't do anything about the rules in the neighboring agency or the neighboring state. There's no way that she can put pressure on them to try to make those rules more welcoming to potential transfers like her.\n\nAnd so when you're in this kind of scenario, it's in each individual police officer's interest to seek those protectionist rules that decrease external competition. And the officers in the other jurisdictions are all going to make the same decision. And so we end up with this sort of protectionist equilibrium that is understandable for any given officer but might be making officers, on the whole, worse off.\n\nDemsas: I want to throw another potential hypothesis at you, too, which is that: Is it possible that the police unions are not, maybe-there's a principal-agent problem here?\n\nThere may be some people-if you're already in the police union or the police union staff themselves are maybe more responsive to the people who have been there a long time, of course, they themselves feel seniority. The people who staff police unions or who are elected are going to be long-term players there too. And so they have an interest in maintaining their status as a player in local politics and also a player in maintaining power and bringing resources to people who have been there for a long time, and they're less interested in police officers as individuals or the larger labor sector or labor market of police officers?\n\nRappaport: Yeah. I think that's completely plausible. Maybe to restate it slightly would be to just say that the people who have the power in terms of lobbying and influence, that subset of people think they're unlikely to want to move, because they've got it made, right? And so maybe they're not thinking about what your typical officer in year three wants; they're thinking about what they want.\n\n[ Music ]\n\nDemsas: All right, time for a quick break. More with John when we get back.\n\n[ Break ]\n\nDemsas: One implication of your paper also plays into these questions about police misconduct, right? Because if you feel like you can't move, or you feel like you're probably going to be stuck at this agency for the rest of your life-and the people around you are going to be responsible for your promotions; how your day goes; what shifts you get; how great your everyday, day-to-day career feels-you're much less likely to report on your fellow officers. Did you find evidence of this? Or how do you think about that and the potential impact of keeping officers stuck in place?\n\nRappaport: We don't find empirical evidence of this. This is not something we were able to test with our data. But as a theoretical matter, I think it's very plausible that, when officers have limited mobility, they're basically, as you say, tied to their employer and their colleagues. And they take on a very strong, self-interested incentive not to rock the boat and to comply with whatever their superiors want and to conform with the norms that are created by their peers or the peers who came before them, right?\n\nAnd that's true even when those norms are pernicious and even when those norms look like the blue wall of silence, right? The blue wall of silence is a norm pursuant to which officers refuse to inculpate each other and potentially even lie to protect fellow officers from allegations of misconduct. Even if you join an agency and you think the blue wall of silence is a terrible idea, it is incredibly risky for you to push back against that norm. If you do, you might be ostracized. You might be put on the graveyard shift. You might have people not respond when you call for backup. And then you're stuck. There's nothing you can do about it, because it's so hard to change jobs and start over.\n\nDemsas: Yeah. And it seems like here is a place where there's an interplay between your first paper and this one, too, in that you also know that if you leave, there's a high likelihood that you're seen as a bad apple to other agencies. And so it actually kind of implicates you, too. Even though it is true that the average person who gets fired from a police station or is likely to have police-misconduct problems, people also might feel like, Oh, just leaving might give me that stench of being a bad apple , as well.\n\nRappaport: Yeah. That's exactly right, especially in a world in which it's difficult for potential future employers to really verify these things.\n\nDemsas: So what should the policy response be for someone reading both these papers? If you're a state legislator or maybe you're even the head of a police agency-you're chief of police-and you're hiring other officers, right? When you look at both of these papers, what sorts of things would you want people to be doing?\n\nRappaport: I think one potential reform that implicates both lines of research is improved information flow. As I said a few minutes ago, sometimes I think agencies hire a wandering officer because they don't even know that they're dealing with a wandering officer. Either they didn't have the resources to do a good background check, or the records that they were looking for weren't available, or maybe the officer is not technically a wandering officer, because he was allowed to leave voluntarily in the face of misconduct accusations rather than being fired. And it's really hard to know what's going on, because there's no centralized database that keeps track of police misconduct.\n\nI think if you had a centralized database at the state level or even at the federal level, this kind of information flow would do a couple of things. I think it would make it easier to identify wandering officers or officers who raise some of the same concerns as wandering officers, but it would also bolster confidence in agencies when they're looking to hire lateral transfers. Because right now, as you said a few minutes ago, we might assume that, Well, this person's on the lateral market. They must have done something wrong. Why else would they be leaving? But the more information we have-the more transparency there is-the more comfort we can take that we really know about this person's background.\n\nDemsas: I wonder, too-because I think you touched on this in one of your papers-about the efficacy of using a national database here. How much would it solve if you actually had a lot more information about why people were leaving? And is that something that would cut against the interests of a lot of these local players?\n\nRappaport: I think it depends on what's in your database. There is already one kind of national database, which is called the National Decertification Index. So something we haven't really talked about yet is the fact that police officers are a licensed profession, just like a lawyer is licensed or a barber is licensed. When you want to be a police officer, you have to be licensed in the state where you want to work. This is something that creates some friction on interstate moves because if you want to move to a new state, you have to get a new license.\n\nThere is a national database that keeps track of-or tries to keep track of-officers who have been decertified, meaning they've committed misconduct that's serious enough that they actually not only were fired but had their license pulled. So they were told, You can never be a police officer in the state of Florida again , right? That's put into a national database-sometimes-with the idea being that before Georgia, let's say, certifies that officer, they'll look in the database and see that the officer was decertified in a prior state.\n\nThat's not a lot of information, because not that many officers are decertified. That's really only the worst of the worst of the worst. And I think to achieve the kind of benefits that we're talking about here, you would need to have a more inclusive database that covers all terminations and maybe even misconduct that doesn't lead to terminations.\n\nDemsas: I'm curious here, again, about the demographics because, in your paper, you find that there's greater mobility for white officers and also for less-educated officers. And you say that those are principally attributable to voluntary rather than involuntary moves. Why would there be greater mobility for those two groups, and how does that fit into the story you're telling here?\n\nRappaport: We don't really know. And we suggest that those findings be interpreted with some caution because they don't exactly replicate in the Florida data. They're sort of directionally similar, but the magnitude of the results is different. You could tell a lot of different stories about why white officers or white-male officers have more mobility. They might just have more labor-market power in general. I don't know why less-educated officers would have more mobility. It's a mystery to me.\n\nDemsas: You've referenced this a little bit in your last couple answers here, but I've been thinking about how much of this is just a classic occupational-licensing story leading to declining mobility. We know that there are tons of jobs that require licensing-public-sector jobs but also private-sector jobs-and that's led to a serious decline in interstate mobility.\n\nFor me, I'm trying to think through because you're offering a lot of different reasons why you would find these frictions in the labor market for police. And I'm trying to think about how you would order your concerns, like which ones you would find to be most binding for police officers. Is this a classic occupational-licensing thing-if you were to just make it a lot easier for people to switch between jobs, and maybe you would have standardization across states about what the job was and the laws that exist across jurisdictions-to be standardized? Or is that a very subconcern that you have when it comes to the frictions that exist in this market?\n\nRappaport: My sense is that certification licensing is one of the smaller concerns. Partly, I get this from message boards. We spent a lot of time, when writing this paper, on police-officer message boards to try to figure out: What are police officers talking about? Either current police officers, prospective police officers, and especially police officers who are talking about changing jobs or thinking about changing jobs-what are they concerned with? What do they say is holding them back from changing jobs? And the thing is that certification really only comes up when you're talking about interstate moves. And I think the number of potential interstate moves is probably dwarfed by the number of intrastate moves. And things like pension portability and rank-and-seniority portability, those are implicated even for people who want to make intrastate moves, and I think those are probably more important on the whole.\n\nDemsas: Did you find anything else interesting from perusing those? Did you learn anything you didn't expect?\n\nRappaport: When we started reading them, it was all new to us, and so I think we didn't know what to expect.\n\nDemsas: What sorts of things are they talking about on there, mostly?\n\nRappaport: They're talking a lot about pensions and about rank and seniority, and using all sorts of metaphors like, Getting a job in policing is like being married; you should only do it once and expect it to last a long time , this kind of thing. Or, you know, My wife wants to move to Georgia, but I can't take my pension with me, so I'm going to veto that , right? This kind of thing. And so it was actually really satisfying confirmation of what I think the theory would predict.\n\nAs lawyers, we sat down, and we identified these sources of law that seem to be creating these frictions, and then to go onto the message boards and see that, Hey, this is the same stuff that the cops are talking about on these message boards , was really a nice confirmation of the real-world applicability of the theorizing we were doing.\n\nDemsas: So I write about local government a lot, and the main critique I've had about it is how local government's lack of accountability to the mass public has allowed interest groups to fill the void and basically set the agenda for local politics. There's a political scientist at Berkeley-her name is Sarah Anzia-and she finds that these local groups are very present and influential in local politics. For example, she finds that police and firefighters' unions' influence correlates with greater spending on their salaries, and cities with more politically active police unions are less likely than cities with less-active ones to have adopted body cameras.\n\nAnd, as you've laid out clearly, a lot of what's happening in policy governance here is happening at the local level, and police unions seem to play a large role here. Is a big part of the reform you would want to see to do with police unions? Is there something to do here with, maybe, moving a lot of the governance of policing up to the state level? Do you have thoughts on that?\n\nRappaport: That's a really good question. I have some other work about police unions, where we find that collective-bargaining rights increase the incidence of violent misconduct. That's a reason separate from all the others that I have concerns about police unionism.\n\nIt's a really good question whether it would be a good idea to move more of the governance up from the local to the state or even, you could say, federal levels. I think some things-it would make a lot of sense. For certain reasons, it would make a lot of sense to do that. I do think that greater standardization could help a lot.\n\nRight now, we have about 18,000 law-enforcement agencies in the country, and there's very little standardization in most states. So the type of paperwork that a police officer has to fill out when he engages in a certain kind of policing activity is going to differ from agency to agency to agency.\n\nThis also creates friction. It creates a drag because now if I want to change jobs, I go from Agency 1 to Agency 2, I have to relearn all of Agency 2's paperwork and all of their policies, which might look very different from Agency 1's, right? And so I do think that increasing standardization-it would reduce the value of this agency-specific knowledge and make it easier, less costly for officers to change jobs, which might have some of the benefits that we talked about earlier.\n\nSo I also think that we might think about siting responsibility for training at the state level or even federal level because one downside of mobility is that when there's more mobility, the employer is going to be less likely to want to invest a lot of resources into training, because they know they would be training an employee who might pick up and leave, right?\n\nAnd similarly, actually, from the employee's perspective, they're going to be less likely to want to invest a lot of resources into learning agency-specific knowledge if they know that they might pick up and leave in a few years.\n\nBut if training is orchestrated more at the state level or even the federal level, well then, the benefits of that training can be internalized within the entire state or within the entire country. And so you don't have to worry as much about employers and employees failing to invest in training.\n\nDemsas: Well, our last question always on the show is asking: What is an idea that you had that you originally thought was a great idea, but it turned out to only be good on paper?\n\nRappaport: Okay, so I do have something in mind, which is: floating.\n\nDemsas: Okay.\n\nRappaport: Have you ever done this?\n\nDemsas: No.\n\nRappaport: Do you know what I'm talking about?\n\nDemsas: You mean down a river?\n\nRappaport: ( Laughs .) No. It's a very specific kind of floating. This is a relaxation type of activity. Actually, what's especially bad is that my wife got it for me for my birthday. But you go to this place that looks kind of like a spa, and they have these pools of water that are highly salinic, so they're full of salt. You're very buoyant in the water, and they're body temperature.\n\nDemsas: Okay.\n\nRappaport: And then they turn out all the lights. And you get down in this pool of water, and you float on your back, and it's kind of like a sensory-deprivation thing, right? You're not seeing anything. You're floating. You feel weightless.\n\nDemsas: Yeah.\n\nRappaport: Turns out this sounded good on paper to me, but I thought the whole thing was terrifying.\n\nDemsas: Yeah.\n\nRappaport: I learned for the first time that I could be claustrophobic. I never thought of myself as someone who was claustrophobic. But when you lock me in a little room with no lights, floating in a tiny, little pool of water, I felt very claustrophobic. I ended up sitting up in the pool of water, just waiting for the session to be over.\n\nDemsas: ( Laughs .) How long were you in there?\n\nRappaport: It was an hour.\n\nDemsas: Oh my God. Are you able to just leave, or does someone have to let you out?\n\nRappaport: You could have, but I was playing mind games with myself and trying to-again, this was a birthday gift, so I was trying to find a way to appreciate it.\n\nDemsas: No. I do understand. I can totally see how someone gets me-I'm like, Oh, this is gonna be very fun. I'll lie in a pool . But I just feel like it would be better if the lights were on. Wouldn't it be nicer if there was some, like, lovely little light? Like, why is that better?\n\nRappaport: It's supposed to be meditative, you know. You turn out all the lights. You close your eyes. And a lot of people fall asleep, actually, while doing this. You're that buoyant that you could actually fall asleep. But yeah, it didn't work for me at all.\n\nDemsas: Well, hopefully John's wife is not one of our many listeners on Good on Paper .\n\nRappaport: Maybe for this episode she is. I don't know.\n\nDemsas: Well, thank you so much for coming on the show. We really appreciate it.\n\nRappaport: Thanks for having me. I appreciate it.\n\n[ Music ]\n\nDemsas: Good On Paper is produced by Jinae West. It was edited by Dave Shaw, fact-checked by Ena Alvarado, and engineered by Erica Huang.

      "text": "What I Learned at the Police Academy\n\nOfficers are trained to see the world as a violent place-and then to act accordingly.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nSonya Massey was just holding a pot of water in her own kitchen when an Illinois sheriff's deputy, Sean Grayson, threatened to \"fucking shoot\" her in the \"fucking face.\" The body-camera footage from that night shows how quickly an interaction with a police officer can become deadly: In a matter of minutes, Massey's call for service turned into a murder scene. Throughout the interaction, Massey followed Grayson's commands. Despite her compliance, Grayson drew his pistol, aimed it at her, and shot her three times. At 36 years old, Sonya Massey became another Black American needlessly killed by the police. (Grayson has pleaded not guilty to charges of first-degree murder.)\n\nEach time the name of a new victim of police violence enters the public lexicon-Michael Brown, Sandra Bland, Eric Garner, Philando Castile, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, and now Sonya Massey-there are questions about the officer's response. How could that officer have mistaken a cellphone for a weapon? Why did that officer shoot someone who was running away? Did that officer really have to shoot so many times? One answer to all these questions is that officers are trained to see the world as threatening and to respond accordingly.\n\nTheir training happens primarily at a police academy, where cadets spend months learning how to be a police officer. I studied this training at four large municipal police departments to gain a better understanding of what kinds of skills cadets learn, how they are evaluated, and why some cadets make it to graduation while others wash out. (As part of my agreement with the departments and my university's institutional review board, I cannot identify the specific departments.) This was in 2018, just four years after the uprising in Ferguson, Missouri, following the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown and two years before the Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin killed George Floyd by kneeling on his neck for nearly 10 minutes. I, like so many others around the world, wanted to know why the names and stories of Black Americans killed by police just kept coming, and I thought that finding out who was allowed to be an officer and how they were trained to do their job could help answer that question.\n\nSue Rahr: The myth propelling America's violent police culture\n\nI observed and participated in the academy training myself, which meant that, alongside the cadets, I woke up early, sat through hours of dense lectures, ran miles in formation, learned basic drill commands, did push-ups, lifted weights, shot guns, and learned how to punch, kick, use pressure points, apply handcuffs, and take someone to the ground. (All of the academies knew that I was there as a researcher, and I introduced myself as such when meeting cadets and officers.) I had a front-row seat to academy training, and what I saw was cause for concern. As I later wrote in my book, Before the Badge , violence was everywhere I looked. The result, I found, was that many of those who made it into the institution, through the training, and out onto patrol were competent in, and eager to use, violence.\n\nMy study of police training practices was, of course, not exhaustive. It is certainly possible-and, indeed, I hope this is the case-that some academies are doing things differently. And many of the officers and trainees I met aspired to join police departments because they wanted to help the vulnerable and serve others. But in my experience from studying these academies, the weight of the training tilted strongly toward violence, again and again.\n\nTo even gain admission to the academy, applicants needed to demonstrate a willingness to engage in violence by recounting prior physical altercations to the hiring officers. I observed parts of the hiring process at all four departments, and watched the full application and interview portion at two. At these two departments, the interview included a question explicitly asking whether the applicant had ever been in a physical confrontation and, if so, to describe what happened. The preferred answer to this question was Yes, I've been in a fight, but I did not initiate it . When candidates responded that they had no experience fighting, the hiring officers expressed intense anxiety and wariness about their suitability for the job. In one interview, for example, after a 43-year-old white applicant said he had never been in a fight, the sergeant told her colleagues that she thought he would \"crawl into himself and disengage\" if a fight presented itself, adding, \"He's gonna have to get angry.\"\n\nOnce they got into the academy, cadets were bombarded with warnings about the dangers they would face on the job. There was a war on cops, instructors insisted, making policing more dangerous now than ever before. Although empirical evidence shows that policing has actually gotten safer over time, the academy instructors repeated these warnings, often vividly, showing disturbing, graphic videos of officers being brutally beaten or killed. On several occasions, instructors designed morbid exercises requiring that cadets envision their own violent death. On the very first day at one academy, a commander encouraged the cadets to study the wall of honor located in the main hallway of the academy building, where portraits hung of every officer at the department who had died in the line of duty, along with a description of how they died. Reading their stories, he explained, will \"keep you alive.\" At another academy, following a tactical exercise, the instructors directed any cadet who had lost their gun during the fight to write their own obituary. \"For all those who got your gun taken,\" the instructor explained, \"you have to write your own obituary ... write about everyone you're leaving behind.\" A war was being waged, the cadets learned, and the stakes could not be higher.\n\nSurviving this war, instructors stressed, depended on cadets' ability to adopt a warrior's mentality, which demanded hypervigilance, heightened suspicion of others, and a willingness to do whatever it took to make it home at the end of each shift. Equally important was the ability to identify their enemy: \"bad guys,\" who were described as ruthless, malicious, immoral, and unpredictable. Although ostensibly race-neutral, the \"bad guys\" concept was steeped in language that invoked race. Instructors told cadets that although they should never racially profile, they should absolutely profile \"criminality,\" discerned through clothing, cars, mannerisms, gait, and neighborhood. \"We do not racially profile,\" one instructor explained during the multiculturalism class, but they do profile based on \"body language, appearance, and mannerisms.\" \"If you can't profile someone who wants to hurt or kill you,\" he explained, \"that's a problem.\" Racial profiling, he continued, is a form of discrimination, and police \"don't do that.\" Police officers at their department do not profile based on \"skin color, gender, or language,\" he clarified, \"but if [someone looks] like a burglar, then that's good profiling.\" These discursive gymnastics enabled instructors to officially condemn racial profiling while simultaneously encouraging it under a different name.\n\nFrom the July/August 2021 issue: The authoritarian instincts of police unions\n\nOnce they learned whom to fear, cadets trained themselves to react to these threats, spending hundreds of hours practicing techniques designed to control, incapacitate, hurt, and kill other people. These skills did not necessarily come naturally, and learning how to use the appropriate amount of force required practice. Cadets sometimes used too much force, and sometimes too little. These two mistakes, however, were treated very differently in the academy setting, where instructors calmly acknowledged when cadets used too much force but became irate when cadets used too little. During a tactics drill at one academy, for example, when multiple cadets used lethal force in a scenario against their unarmed partner, the instructors were not visibly upset and did not punish the class. In contrast, during a different tactics exercise, in which three cadets lost their gun, re-holstered it, and reengaged in a physical struggle with their opponent, one instructor threw his face guard in the air and screamed, \"What the fuck!\" Following the exercise, another instructor repeatedly pressed the cadets, asking them why they hadn't shot, reminding them that in this scenario, \"it's you or him or her, and we want it to be you.\" If they were going to make a mistake, cadets learned, it should be the one where they walked away alive.\n\nEven in classes focused on techniques meant to mitigate violence, such as de-escalation, the instructors still underscored the importance of remaining vigilant, prepared for violence, and prioritizing officer safety above everything else. During the de-escalation class at two different academies, the instructors shared the 1998 video of Laurens County Sheriff's Office Deputy Kyle Dinkheller's murder. The three-and-a-half-minute video shows a traffic stop gone wrong that culminates in Dinkheller's guttural, panicked screams and strained breathing as he dies at the side of his patrol car. Before playing the video, one instructor explained, \"Even though we're talking about de-escalation today, I'm not watering down officer safety. Do not drop your guard.\" After the video was over, another instructor warned, \"I hate going to funerals. Don't make me go to your funeral because you were using your words when you shouldn't be.\" Although using words was great where possible, these lessons highlighted, if used incorrectly, they could be your last.\n\nBy the time the cadets reached graduation, they had spent hundreds of hours hearing that they are at war, that the \"bad guys\" should be identified through profiling, and that gaining competence in violence is the only way to survive. Cadets' bodies are physically conditioned to assume that everyone is armed, to act swiftly and decisively, and to shoot as soon as they perceive a deadly threat. Given this training, it is not hard to understand why some police officers end up shooting unarmed civilians who run away, turn around suddenly, or reach into their pocket to grab a phone or wallet; that is what they were trained to do."

      "text": "Stop Training Police Like They're Joining the Military\n\nIf policing is to change, the spotlight must turn toward police academies, where new recruits are first inculcated into the folkways of their profession.\n\nUpdated at 9:56 a.m. ET on August 12, 2020.\n\nWhen I entered the Washington, D.C., police academy in 2016 as a recruit officer in the district's volunteer police reserve corps, I quickly discovered that I was joining a paramilitary organization. My classmates and I practiced drill and formation, stood at attention when senior officials entered the room, and were grilled on proper boot-polishing methods. \"Brilliantly shined boots are a hallmark of police uniforms,\" an instructional handout informed us. \"They indicate devotion to duty and attention to the smallest detail ... You are required to maintain boots that are polished to a luster ... In the most exceptional cases boots can be shined so that a person's reflection may be seen in the finish.\" We had instructors who rolled their eyes at this sort of thing, but we also had instructors who seemed to be channeling the Marine drill sergeant in Full Metal Jacket , bawling insults and punishing minor infractions with sets of push-ups.\n\nAs a law professor and writer with a long-standing interest in the blurry boundaries between war and \"not war,\" my experiences with the paramilitary aspects of the D.C. police academy-and, later, my experiences as a reserve police officer on patrol in some of the city's poorest neighborhoods-were part of my research. (My next book, Tangled Up in Blue: Policing the American City , is based on my experiences as a D.C. reserve officer.) But even as a recruit with a quasi-anthropological perspective, I found the academy more than a little intimidating. I don't think I've been yelled at as much since high-school gym class more than three decades ago.\n\nThe nation is now debating how to \"fix\" American policing, and much of the criticism of current police practices relates to the paramilitary aspects of policing. It's an important critique, but one that often focuses narrowly on police uniforms, weapons, and equipment, rather than on underlying issues of organizational culture and structure. If we want to change policing, we need to also turn the spotlight onto police academies, where new recruits are first inculcated into the folkways of their profession.\n\nTracey L. Meares and Tom R. Tyler: The first step is figuring out what police are for\n\nIt's not hard to see the link between paramilitary police training and the abuses motivating the past several weeks' protests. When police recruits are belittled by their instructors and ordered to refrain from responses other than \"Yes, Sir!,\" they may learn stoicism-but they may also learn that mocking and bellowing orders at those with less power are acceptable actions. When recruits are ordered to do push-ups to the point of exhaustion because their boots weren't properly polished, they may learn the value of attention to detail-but they may also conclude that the infliction of pain is an appropriate response to even the most trivial infractions.\n\nMany police recruits enter the academy as idealists, but this kind of training turns them into cynics, even before their first day on patrol. And although most police officers will go through their entire careers without ever firing their weapons, others will inevitably get the wrong lessons from their paramilitary training, and end up like the fired Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin .\n\nD.C.'s police academy has changed a lot in the short time since I graduated, and even in 2016, it was relatively relaxed compared with the rigid spit-and-polish atmosphere that prevails in many other training programs. The majority of law-enforcement academies in the United States are loosely modeled on military boot camps. Proponents of this approach argue that cops are a lot like soldiers: They have to follow orders regardless of their personal feelings; they have to run toward gunfire, not away from it; and they have to remain cool and professional in the face of chaos, threats, and harassment. In this view, paramilitary training takes undisciplined young recruits and turns them into lean, mean fighting machines, ready to handle the rigors of street patrol.\n\nIn most police departments, paramilitary traditions extend well beyond the academy. Senior police officials commonly refer to patrol officers as \"troops,\" chain of command is rigidly enforced, and it's undeniably true that many departments have made enthusiastic use of federal authorities such as the Defense Department's 1033 Program , which provides surplus military equipment-including armored vehicles and grenade launchers-to domestic law-enforcement agencies. (Since its inception, the program has transferred more than $7 billion worth of military equipment to more than 8,000 U.S. law-enforcement agencies; ironically, small-town and rural agencies , rather than large city departments, have been most likely to request heavy equipment such as mine-resistant vehicles.)\n\nThe paramilitary aspects of police culture are so deeply entrenched that most officers and police chiefs take them for granted, rarely questioning the need for boot polishing, drill and formations, and rigorous mandatory workouts as a central part of police training. But the paramilitary model is as pernicious as it is ubiquitous, and any meaningful approach to police transformation needs to confront it head-on.\n\nNothing about paramilitary policing is inevitable, and historically speaking, the vision of policing as a paramilitary enterprise is of relatively recent vintage. In early colonial America , police departments as we think of them today did not exist. Public safety was a communal responsibility, and in many New England towns, appointed sheriffs were supplemented by a town watch comprising ordinary citizens. In the frontier towns of the American West, sheriffs made do by deputizing citizens into temporary posses when needed. In the southern United States, policing was also seen as a shared public responsibility, albeit one distorted by the brutal institution of slavery: Many southern towns and counties established volunteer \"slave patrols\" charged with capturing runaways and returning them to their owners, dead or alive. As one slave patroller put it, his job was to \"apprehend any negro whom we found from his home, and if he made any resistance, or ran from us, fire upon him immediately.\" The toxic legacy of these patrols remains alive today.\n\nTa-Nehisi Coates: The case for reparations\n\nIn the mid-19th century, industrialization, rising income inequality, and the growth of cities led to increases in both violent crime and property crime. As communities became more populous and urbanized, the relatively informal mechanisms of social control that had prevailed in colonial America and the early years of the republic began to be perceived by elites as inadequate, and police organizations were formalized and professionalized in most major American cities. New York established its first police department in 1845, and in 1861 Washington, D.C., followed suit with the creation of the Metropolitan Police Department. Policing quickly ceased to be viewed as a collective obligation and became, instead, the work of a permanent body of paid specialists.\n\nFrom their inception, and in contrast to earlier models of law enforcement, these newly created police departments in the 19th century were paramilitary in nature. In Washington, D.C. , for instance, President Abraham Lincoln insisted that General George B. McClellan be consulted on the appointment of the first police superintendent. Ultimately, William Webb, a major in the D.C. militia, was chosen, and Webb quickly recruited several other Union soldiers into the department's ranks.\n\nAmerica's new police departments adopted military-style titles, rank structures, and uniforms. In Los Angeles, for instance, the first citywide law-enforcement officers, the Los Angeles Rangers , were citizen volunteers authorized by the city council in 1853; they wore no uniforms, but sported white ribbons identifying them as \"city police.\" By 1869, however, the city had hired its first paid professional police, kitting them out in surplus Union Army uniforms , and as in D.C., many early recruits came from a military background. (The path from military service to law enforcement remains well trod; currently, almost 20 percent of police officers are military veterans , although veterans make up just 6 percent of the general population).\n\nToday, a century and a half after the emergence of professional police organizations, American policing is in crisis. As the protesters pouring into the streets are reminding the nation, police in the United States fatally shoot roughly 1,000 people a year, a per capita rate of violence unparalleled in other democratic countries. * Relative to their representation in the overall population, a disproportionate number of those killed by U.S. police have been black- or brown-skinned.\n\nPolice killings are of course not the only fuel for the mass protests. Beyond the deaths of Americans such as George Floyd and Breonna Taylor lie countless other large and small indignities-the massive stop-and-frisk program practiced by the NYPD until a court order declared it unconstitutional, the needlessly aggressive execution of warrants-that also fall most heavily on people of color and the poor.\n\nBut many of the most egregious police abuses are avoidable, and the anger over them has created an opportunity for real police reform. The nation must jettison paramilitary approaches to policing. That means moving beyond shallow critiques of \"police militarization,\" most of which focus narrowly on federal programs allowing the transfer of military equipment to police, and looking at subtler and more entrenched aspects of police culture as well.\n\nWesley Lowery: The breaking point\n\nTo be sure, federal military-surplus transfers like those through the Defense Department's 1033 Program do little good, and much harm: Police departments obtaining used Army filing cabinets at cost isn't cause for concern, but there's no earthly reason for small-town cops to wear military fatigues, ride around in mine-resistant Humvees, or carry bayonets. Studies suggest that police departments that receive such equipment see no measurable improvement in officer safety or crime rates, but greater quantities do seem to correlate with higher rates of officer-involved shootings and reduced public trust .\n\nFederal programs that allow the provision of military equipment to domestic police departments are only part of the problem, however. Although tightening the restrictions on such programs would be a good first step, the training that police recruits go through must also be reformed.\n\nWe're living in a dark moment: President Donald Trump's threat to send in active-duty federal troops to quell protests further blurred the line between policing and the military. But some hopeful signs have emerged.\n\nFor one, some progressive police leaders are questioning the value of paramilitary academies. In Washington State, for instance, former King County Sheriff Sue Rahr , now the head of the state's Criminal Justice Training Commission , has pioneered an academy-training approach centered on a vision of police as guardians, not warriors . Rahr calls her training method \"LEED,\" for \"Listen and Explain with Equity and Dignity.\" Instead of an emphasis on yelling and standing at attention, her recruits are trained to engage others in courteous conversation, and are evaluated during role-play exercises on their ability to listen, show empathy, explain their actions, de-escalate tense situations, and leave everyone they encounter \"with their dignity intact.\"\n\nIn another hopeful sign, Washington, D.C., police training is also moving in the right direction. The Metropolitan Police Department has brought civilian teachers and adult-learning specialists into many senior police-academy positions, instead of staffing the academy solely with sworn officers. More and more, D.C. police recruits are being encouraged to question and debate policies instead of just memorizing them, and the academy's commander has welcomed a crucial range of diverse voices into the recruit curriculum.\n\nAdam Serwer: Bad apples in Buffalo\n\nThe department has also partnered with several local universities, including Georgetown, where I teach and co-direct the Innovative Policing Program , to develop programs designed to push both recruits and more experienced officers to critically engage with the history and practices of their profession. All officers now visit the Holocaust Memorial Museum and the National Museum of African American History and Culture, and spend a day discussing the role of police officers in perpetuating-or ending-atrocities and injustice. Meanwhile, a select group of young D.C. officers take part in the Georgetown program's Police for Tomorrow Fellowship. The fellows participate in intensive workshops on many of the toughest and most controversial issues in policing, including race and the legacy of racial discrimination, over-criminalization, alternatives to arrest, poverty, addiction, and homelessness. Officers visit prisons and homeless shelters and meet with local teens, and each fellow undertakes a capstone community project. In New Orleans, a similar fellowship program for young police officers, the Crescent City Corps , launched in 2019.\n\nSuch programs can be transformative. In D.C., many of the young officers who go through these programs credit them with changing how the officers think about their role-and their thoughtful feedback has helped fuel internal changes within the department, including some recent changes at the police academy itself. Last October, the Metropolitan Police Department, the New Orleans Police Department, and Georgetown's Innovative Policing Program teamed up to host a national gathering of police-academy directors from more than 20 major police departments. First up on the group's agenda: considering alternatives to paramilitary approaches to police training. The topic was controversial, and the discussion is continuing, but it was a start.\n\nA diverse, democratic society needs police officers who engage thoughtfully with their profession's troubled history and value meaningful, equitable interactions with members of the communities they serve. If the past few weeks have taught us anything, it's this: America needs brave, empathetic guardians-not martinets in shiny boots.\n\n* This article previously stated that roughly 1,000 people are killed by American police each year. In fact, this is the number of people who are fatally shot by police.\n\nThis story is part of the project \" The Battle for the Constitution ,\" in partnership with the National Constitution Center ."

      "text": "The Police Can Be Reformed. These Two Books Lay Out How.\n\nIn the aftermath of Tyre Nichols's killing, it's easy to despair. But two new books show how police departments can alter their behavior.\n\nM ost Americans want to see the police reformed. A Gallup poll conducted in May, two years after the murder of George Floyd, found that 50 percent of adults favored \"major changes\" to policing, 39 percent wanted \"minor changes,\" and only 11 percent thought no changes were required. Despite this general consensus and a patchwork of recent policy shifts in communities across the country, injustices continue to accumulate, and it would be easy to see the problems with policing as intractable.\n\nThree high-profile deaths just since the start of this year would seem to confirm this feeling. On January 3, Keenan Anderson, a 31-year-old Black high-school teacher (and cousin of Patrisse Cullors, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter), died after Los Angeles police shocked him repeatedly with a Taser. The next day, cops in Cambridge, Massachusetts, shot and killed Sayed Faisal, a 20-year-old Bangladeshi American college student who allegedly approached them with a knife. And less than a week after that, another Black man, 29-year-old Tyre Nichols, died following a beating by Memphis police officers. Video footage of the incident, released this past Friday, led to mass protest in many cities and an anguished response to yet another senseless death. Nothing we're doing to fix policing seems to be working-or so it might appear.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, two new books chronicle horrific incidents of police abuse, cover-ups, and intransigence. But they also offer something else: light pouring through the cracks, concrete evidence that police departments can change for the better.\n\nIn The Riders Come Out at Night: Brutality, Corruption, and Cover-Up in Oakland , the journalists Ali Winston and Darwin BondGraham tell the story of Oakland, California's police department. The title refers to a small group of officers who allegedly brutalized residents of impoverished, high-crime, largely Black West Oakland starting in the late 1990s. The actions of these cops became known only because a rookie named Keith Batt was assigned to train with one of them. Batt was deeply troubled by what he observed-behavior that Batt said included kidnapping, assault, and filing false police reports. He contacted internal-affairs investigators and became the main witness in a criminal case against the officers (three of whom stood trial; none was convicted).\n\nRead: No such thing as a bad apple\n\nIn harrowing detail, Winston and BondGraham describe the terror that Batt said Oaklanders endured at the hands of the Riders, as well as the ostracism Batt faced when he refused to honor the \"blue wall of silence\" that has long characterized cop culture.\n\nWhile the Riders' actions may have been extreme, Winston and BondGraham view them as symptomatic of larger issues. As Oakland underwent deindustrialization in the 1970s and '80s, poverty and crime rose. Turning away from local jobs initiatives, city leaders embraced ill-fated redevelopment efforts and pressed their often-racist police department to \"clean up the streets.\" When rogue cops took things too far, their supervisors looked the other way, knowing perfectly well what their marching orders were.\n\nThe Riders were significant in another respect: A lawsuit brought by the group's alleged victims became the catalyst for a consent decree, a potentially powerful weapon for effecting change within police departments. Consent decrees are legally binding settlement agreements. In the usual course of affairs, after the Department of Justice has investigated a police agency and found that it has systematically violated people's rights, the feds spell out changes in policy and procedure that the agency must undertake, changes that would bring it into line with established best practices. An independent monitor reports periodically to a judge on whether the department is meeting its marks.\n\nAlthough the DOJ never investigated Oakland, the consent-decree model appealed to the civil-rights attorneys John Burris and Jim Chanin. In 2003, representing victims in the Riders case, they were able to maneuver the city into an unusual \"negotiated\" consent decree, which committed Oakland PD to a range of tasks, from better documenting the use of force to enhanced field training for young officers.\n\nConsent decrees have been used to improve policing in cities such as Detroit and New Orleans, but they are expensive to administer and don't always work. Winston and BondGraham show how the Oakland police resisted the required reforms at every turn. Top brass, middle management, frontline officers, and the police union displayed an \"obstructionist mindset.\" Oakland cops continued to shoot people at a furious pace. A poster in the department's firing range was captioned You shut the fuck up. We'll protect America. Keep out of our fucking way, liberal pussies .\n\nThe Riders Come Out at Night is a longish book, and its story is largely a condemnation of the Oakland police. But readers who stick with it to the end will discover something surprising. Although change was slow to come to Oakland, it did come. The turning point was the ascension of a reform-oriented police chief. Under Sean Whent, a longtime Oakland cop who led the department from 2013 to 2016, internal-affairs complaints dropped dramatically, the police did a better job protecting protesters' rights, and the agency tackled racial bias.\n\nWinston and BondGraham don't put it in these terms, but Whent was arguably able to make progress because he helped shift the department's culture. My own research on other cities suggests that the key to successful police reform is to pair sensible legal and policy restrictions on police behavior with new models of what it means to be a good cop , so that the hyperaggressive, \"us versus them\" culture of the profession bends in a different direction.\n\nWhent believed not only that Oakland residents had a right to respectful policing, but that such policing would help the department control crime; the resulting trust would lubricate the all-important flow of information between cops and the community. Unlike his predecessors, he leaned into the consent decree (there was also intense legal pressure on him to do so), and enough of his cops followed suit that on the streets, things began to change.\n\n\"The reforms that began in 2003 ... have profoundly changed the Oakland police, and the city, for the better,\" Winston and BondGraham conclude. \"Today OPD officers are involved in far fewer deadly use-of-force incidents.\" What's more, where \"Oakland cops were once known for abusive, explicit language,\" now \"audits of police body camera footage rarely flag instances in which officers curse or show impatience or anger.\" The police have also \"been able to steadily dial back their most problematic enforcement activities,\" so that \"Oakland is one of the only law enforcement agencies in America that could actually show (before the George Floyd protests) that it took action to reduce racial profiling.\"\n\nA similarly hopeful lesson might be drawn from Shielded: How the Police Became Untouchable , by the UCLA law professor Joanna Schwartz. Many cops perform their difficult job admirably, but part of the problem with reforming the police is that when this isn't the case, officers aren't always held to account for their misdeeds. Schwartz's focus is on understanding why this should be, and she lands on 11 areas where law, policy, and politics have converged to make it hard for victims of police abuse to get justice.\n\nAmong Schwartz's insights: There aren't enough lawyers with the expertise to file federal civil-rights cases against police, especially outside large urban centers. This is partially a function of the fee structure allowed by the courts; only rarely can plaintiffs' attorneys recoup their full costs, so relatively few lawyers find this kind of work financially viable.\n\nSchwartz's special expertise is qualified immunity. This arcane legal doctrine dictates that a public official can't be held responsible for violating someone's rights unless the courts have already established that the particular circumstances do in fact constitute a violation. Although that sounds reasonable-you shouldn't hold an official liable unless they knew that what they were doing was wrong-judges have interpreted this in a bizarro fashion.\n\nSchwartz describes a case from Hawaii. A woman in an argument with her husband asked her daughter to call the cops and was Tasered when she accidentally bumped one of them. The Taser was used in so-called dart mode, where the weapon shoots out electrified probes. Her case against the officer ended up getting dismissed because, according to the appellate court, there had never before been a relevant ruling concerning Tasers, much less Tasers in dart mode, and therefore the officer couldn't be held liable. Dart mode or not, the officer should have known not to do it.\n\nSchwartz's research shows that qualified-immunity defenses are raised in about 37 percent of lawsuits against the police. Although they're successful only about 9 percent of the time, they gum up the litigation process because each qualified-immunity claim must be resolved before a case can proceed. The doctrine is a farce in any event, because police officers aren't regularly updated on the intricacies of federal case law. Schwartz favors ending qualified immunity and argues that this won't open the door to endless litigation.\n\nFar more common than plaintiffs winning cases in court is cities settling with the victims of police abuse. (Settlements and legal awards cost Chicago nearly half a billion dollars from 2010 to 2020.) Usually cities pay these settlements out of their general funds. Police-department budgets don't take the hit, so departments have little reason to retrain their officers and improve operating procedures. Schwartz urges cities to change this budgeting practice, giving police departments a financial incentive to learn from their mistakes.\n\nWhere's the cause for hope? Schwartz observes that several of the changes she favors around qualified immunity were enshrined in state law in Colorado in 2020. It's too early to tell what the effects of the Colorado law will be, but in theory, greater legal liability should deter police abuse. Other states may soon follow Colorado's lead.\n\nRead: The state where protests have already forced major police reforms\n\nMany more levers need to be pulled to get police accountability to where it should be, but we are seeing progress. Even Schwartz, a fierce critic of law enforcement, acknowledges that over the past half century, \"departments as a whole have become more professional and have improved their policies and trainings,\" if only \"to a degree,\" in part because civil-rights attorneys and others in the community have kept the pressure on. The cops who were seen beating Tyre Nichols last month in Memphis? They were promptly fired by Memphis Police Chief Cerelyn Davis. They've now been arrested and charged with second-degree murder. There was a time not long ago when neither of those things would have happened so quickly.\n\nThe narrative that nothing ever gets better in policing isn't just wrong; it's an abdication of responsibility. It's easier to lose oneself in resignation and despair than to bear down-motivated by a belief in the possibility of change-and put in the hard work of reforming a flawed but essential institution.\n\nWhen you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

      "text": "Life of a Police Officer: Medically and Psychologically Ruinous\n\nThe intensely challenging job of law enforcement is linked to many health issues. I met a former officer who tried to protect my high school friend and learned the effect her death had on him.\n\nPolice officer Brian Post recognized the 16-year-old girl lying face down in the grass at the Whispering Pines apartment complex in Lynnwood, Washington. He had gotten to know her in recent weeks, helping her obtain a restraining order against her abusive ex-boyfriend. Now, here was Sangeeta Lal, unconscious, with two bullets in her chest.\n\nHe knew she was a good kid. Brian had spoken to Sangeeta over the phone just a few hours earlier. He knew her mom worked the early shift, and she would be alone. He promised he would come immediately if anything went wrong.\n\nThe call came into 911 at 4:18 a.m. that someone was breaking into her apartment. James McCray, 21, had arrived dressed in dark clothes and a red and black stocking cap, according to police reports. He chased Sangeeta outside. \"Please don't,\" neighbors heard Sangeeta scream, before he shot her.\n\nBrian didn't make it to the complex in time. He found her sprawled just beyond the sliding glass door of her neighbor's apartment. He looked up and saw a little girl peering through a window at the teenager in the grass. He felt Sangeeta's neck. It pulsed, and pulsed again. Then, no more. He touched her face.\n\n\"I know who the guy is, and I know where he went,\" Brian told his partner. As the officers moved in on apartment 265 with weapons drawn, James looked out of the window and killed himself with a single bullet.\n\nIt was 1995, and for the next 19 years, Brian would blame himself for not being closer to Whispering Pines, for not saving Sangeeta. Brian was 31 when she was killed, and had been an officer for five years.\n\n\"She was in the worst environment, and she was trying,\" said Brian, now 50. \"You never know when you've saved a life, but you know when you've lost one.\"\n\nSangeeta's death marked the beginning of a downward spiral in Brian's health, spurred on by a psychologically and physically challenging law enforcement career. Brian had been a healthy and fit ex-airborne infantry soldier when he began his policing career. But he eventually developed hypertension, anxiety, peripheral neuropathy, hearing loss, arthritis, and post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nWhen he was starting out, Brian says he wasn't warned of how the career could do such damage. In 2012, an unprecedented study of 464 police officers, published in the International Journal of Emergency Mental Health linked officers' stress with increased levels of sleep disorders, Hodgkin's lymphoma, brain cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and suicide.\n\nOther studies have found that between 7 and 19 percent of active duty police have PTSD, while MRIs of police officers' brains have found a connection between experiencing trauma and a reduction in areas that play roles in emotional and cognitive decision-making, memory, fear, and stress regulation.\n\nIn squad rooms full of cops, Brian would compare blood pressure meds with his colleagues. Most, if not all, of the police he knew with more than 10 years of service were dealing some kind of medical or psychological issue.\n\nAt night, Brian would hide his drinking from his wife. He went from sipping whiskey, to downing cheap 100-proof vodka.\n\n\"You see nothing but bodies, I swear, dead people,\" he said. \"Car accidents, hangings, suicides, murders, SIDS deaths.\" He remembered a diabetic who killed himself by overdosing on chocolate. And then there was the conversation with a tongue-pierced meth user with an enlarged heart who had told Brian, \"I'm white trash until the day I die.\" He assaulted people in a parking lot and died in custody after deputies restrained him. The next day, Brian found himself close to fainting after viewing the autopsy photos of the same kid's esophagus, and pierced tongue.\n\n\"I was so angry at this one woman for dying, that I yelled at her,\" he said. \"I just didn't want to see another dead body...I should have recognized at that point, it's time for me to back up.\"\n\nYears passed, and every once in while, Brian would Google Sangeeta Lal's name. He wondered who else remembered her. He wondered if anyone had memorialized her.\n\n*  *  *\n\nEvery few years, I would Google Sangeeta's name too.\n\nShe was my friend, and high school classmate. We were the same age. Like the rest of her friends, I had known about her abusive boyfriend, who was gang affiliated, and how she had broken it off, which only enraged him more.\n\nSangeeta had the face of a child, round and cheeky, with long wavy black hair that she smoothed down with coconut oil. She usually showed up to school in lipstick the same shade as her nails, and jeans four sizes too big for her 5-foot frame, cuffed at the bottoms and held up with a long belt. Her family had relocated from Fiji to our town 22 minutes north of Seattle.\n\nOur campus sat between a grove of evergreen trees on one side, and a run-down mall on the other. It had all of the makings of a public school caught in the throes of a changing urban city. Gangs had begun infiltrating the area, and with them came the occasional drive-by shooting, drug deal, or murder. My freshman year, murders, robberies, rapes, and assaults jumped by 18.4 percent in our county from the previous year, according to The Seattle Times , and our 29,000-resident city of Lynnwood had the highest crime rate in the county per capita that year-about 110 crimes committed for every 1,000 residents.\n\nSangeeta's apartment complex was about five minutes away from mine. Police referred to Whispering Pines as \"Whispering Crimes,\" Brian later said. On slow nights, officers would drive through the complex and inevitably find someone breaking the law. Sangeeta's single mother worked an early shift at the Nintendo of America headquarters in Redmond, Washington.\n\nSangeeta was killed on the same day that Timothy McVeigh blew up the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, killing 168.\n\nThat afternoon, I waited for news of Sangeeta's death to come over the television set. But all channels went back to firefighters and frantic parents in Oklahoma. When the newspaper mentioned the murder-suicide the next day, it printed her age wrong. It said she was in her late teens, or maybe 20. It didn't mention her name at all. So I wrote a front-page story about Sangeeta for The Royal Gazette , our high school newspaper. She was the first person I had known and cared about who died violently, and the first death I ever covered as a journalist.\n\nI would go on to become a national reporter, covering many more shootings, deaths, and high profile news events. Sixteen years after Sangeeta died, I ended up writing about a college class on death. It was in New Jersey, taught by Dr. Norma Bowe , a registered nurse who also held a master's degree in health administration, a Ph.D. in community health policy. I also became a student in her class.\n\n\"Most of you are here for a reason,\" the professor said on the first day. \"Maybe someone's story in this room, or someone's experience, might press on some scar tissue for you. So that's okay. We're sitting in a circle right now because we're really beginning a bereavement group.\"\n\nShe gave out the first assignment. Everyone opened up their notebooks and waited for her cue to take notes: \"Write a goodbye letter to someone or something that you've lost,\" she said. \"I'd like you to say whatever you need to say to that person and then I'd like you to sign and date the letter. Whatever popped into your head first when I said those words, that's where you should go.\"\n\n\"Any questions?\" she asked. Students shook their heads and began zipping coats and bags. \"Alright, have a good week.\"\n\nA few days later, I opened a blank page on my computer screen and sat there for a moment remembering what she had told the class. Then, I began to type: Dear Sangeeta...\n\nI held on to the letter for a couple of years, and then, last December, at the suggestion of the professor, decided to post it online.\n\n*  *  *\n\nIn the years after Sangeeta died, Brian continued to self-medicate with alcohol. He sealed off her death, and all of the others, in a mental chamber he tried not to open.\n\n\"By sealing off, I mean I let it fester,\" he said later. \"I went through a very dark time.\"\n\nHis job continued to plague him. Brian was one of the officers who closed in on Lonnie Cedric Davis , who went on killing spree in Shoreline, Washington, in 1999. Davis stabbed his mother and 18-month-old nephew to death in their home, before driving 100 miles per hour on the I-5, and crashing into a 64-year-old motorcyclist who lost part of his leg. Davis escaped into a Shoreline neighborhood, breaking the neck of an 82-year-old woman and beating a 63-year-old retired nurse to death.\n\n\"He went into a house that had guns in it,\" Brian recalled. Police would later find five weapons, including a semiautomatic assault pistol, and lots of ammunition. \"Then the fight was on. It lasted a couple of hours... fragments of my round hit him.\"\n\nLonnie fired up to 50 shots at police, until a sniper round finally killed him with a gunshot to the head.\n\nBrian's drinking worsened. While he was on the force, his mother had died of cancer, his sister had committed suicide, and his father had died in a skydiving accident. His marriage ended.\n\nAll of the death. All of the misery. \"What's the point?\" He thought those words would be carved into his tombstone.\n\nAfter 10 years with Lynnwood Police, Brian spent seven years in the sheriff's department, until one day in 2008, when he came to work drunk.\n\nThe sheriff fired him .\n\nHe could have given up on life right then. Instead, he gave up on alcohol. It was the last time he drank.\n\nBrian got counseling. But it was too late. He couldn't get his job back. He went to work for an organization called Safe Call Now instead. Established in 2009 by former police officer Sean Riley, it is a confidential 24-hour crisis referral service for law enforcement and emergency services personnel, which also works with the FBI National Academy Associates Inc. to do mental health training for first responders.\n\n\"How do you prepare or train an individual to see 26 children who have been murdered?\" Sean said. \"Those tragedies. Newtown. Aurora. For any human being, how are they supposed to handle that?\"\n\nSean had previously worked as a homicide and sexual assault detective, and got to the point where he was taking 40 Vicodin a day. Too often, officers will try to cope on their own,\" Sean said. \"In the profession, they often have been trained to think, \"I can't show weakness, I can't break down.' You've got this shield, this bullet proof vest, because you have to do your job. Where is your outlet?....You think, 'Is someone going to report me? Am I going to lose my job?' You have to keep up this façade.\"\n\nLast month in Nevada, Sean led \"emotional body armor\" training for 30 police and correction officers, dispatchers, and military personnel. Similar trainings take place around the country. After two-and-a-half days, these normally guarded professionals were \"crying, reflecting down on their knees in the program,\" he said. \"We can break them down in about the first hour.\"\n\nFive years since Brian was fired from the sheriff's department, he now answers calls from struggling law enforcement personnel across the nation. The organization averages 70 to 150 calls per month. He can relate to their concerns of not wanting to appear weak.\n\n\"You see these bright shiny faces in the academy, and you think, 'Oh, you poor bastards. You have no idea how fun and how bad this is going to be for you,'\" Brian said. \"They get to play cops and robbers for real. They get to shoot bullets and drive fast.\"\n\nThey have no idea yet which lives they will lose.\n\nIn February, Brian Googled Sangeeta's name again.\n\nIf she had lived, she would have been 35 years old.\n\n*  *  *\n\nI got an email in my inbox on Feb. 12. It read:\n\n\"My name is Brian Post, I'm a \"retired\" former Lynnwood police officer who knew [Sangeeta]. I was the officer who talked with her about the Protection Order, I tried to stay close to the apartments, and I made sure the other officers on the crew knew about the situation. Unfortunately, I was also the officer who found her and felt her last heart tremor.\n\nThere's more I suppose, and I've felt enormous guilt for being so far away... until now I've always been so saddened that there was apparently nothing to memorialize her. It was a lovely letter, I'm glad people will know her name.\"\n\nA week later, I met Brian at a Starbucks in Lynnwood. \"It's not Mayberry,\" Brian said, referring to the idyllic small town from the Andy Griffith Show. But Lynnwood is a different city now. Crime rates have dropped, and gangs have been quelled. The mall has been upgraded and beautified. The old Lynnwood High School, demolished. A bright, modern high school built not too far away. Wealthier residents have hung on. Families from Somalia, Ethiopia, West Africa, India and beyond have moved in.\n\nBrian towered over me, a barrel of a man with close-cropped blondish-white hair. I could see how he might be intimidating if you met him in a dark alley with his gun, but on this rainy day he seemed gentle.\n\nAbout two-and-a-half years ago, he went through a period of mourning. He'd thought about trying to reach out to Sangeeta's mother.\n\n\"I don't think I will ever accept it,\" he said. \"In my perfect world, I would have been closer...I knew exactly where her apartment was. I've thought about how I would have approached him.\"\n\nIf James had shot at them first, Brian would have swiftly killed him.\n\nSangeeta's death changed the way he policed, and he carried her memory with him in every domestic violence case that he encountered. Losing a domestic violence case at trial, or when a victim declined to prosecute, became almost more than he could take. \"I became unreasonably frustrated,\" he said, \"almost panicked, feeling that I'd failed again.\"\n\nBrian now teaches firearms and tactics classes, in addition to working with Safe Call Now and Code 4 North West , a similar program aimed at first responders in Washington State. He attends regular therapy, has remained sober, and has overcome his PTSD.\n\nOften, he feels lost in the civilian world. \"I still have to admit, I do struggle,\" he told me. He still thinks of Sangeeta. He still doesn't know whose life he may have saved over the years.\n\nBut he saved his own, and I am so grateful that he did.\n\nSome sections of this essay have been adapted from the prologue of Erika Hayasaki's book, The Death Class: A True Story About Life ."

      "text": "We're Underfunding the Police\n\nImproving our criminal-justice system means spending the requisite money to address America's horrific and long-standing problem with criminal violence.\n\nWhy is the United States so exceptionally violent? In 2021, for example, more than 26,000 Americans were murdered-a homicide rate that would be unthinkable in the affluent market democracies of Europe and East Asia. There are any number of explanations for America's outlier status, including deep-seated cultural characteristics and the prevalence of firearms. But we suggest a different, more parsimonious perspective: This high level of violence is a policy choice brought about by insufficient action. We are so violent because we underinvest in our criminal-justice system.\n\nThat may seem counterintuitive amid claims that the U.S. spends excessively on public order and safety, and a movement to \"defund the police.\" But across all levels of government, the U.S. spends less than 1 percent of its GDP on policing, a share that has declined since the Great Recession. Our level of spending and the number of police officers we employ per capita put us in the middle of the pack relative to our OECD peers, even though our crime rate is far higher. And police-employment rates are declining, a concern police leaders were raising as early as 2019.\n\nThen there is the structural fact that U.S. police departments are far more fragmented than those of our peer countries-the U.K. has 43 distinct police departments, whereas the U.S. has about 18,000. One result of our idiosyncratic approach to financing law enforcement is that poor and nonwhite jurisdictions have far less police protection than richer and whiter jurisdictions do. All this \"under-policing\" contributes to higher murder rates, especially in predominantly Black communities.\n\nThe problem doesn't stop with policing. Court backlogs ballooned during the coronavirus pandemic, but even before then, courts were already taking too long to clear cases: According to research from the National Center for State Courts, just 30 percent of felony criminal cases were disposed of within 90 days, compared with the national standard of 75 percent. Our data on crime are in disarray too-in 2021, the FBI was forced to statistically guess at nationwide crime rates.\n\nAlec MacGillis: The cause of the crime wave is hiding in plain sight\n\nSome might object that the United States is home to a large and well-funded network of prisons, at least as measured by the number of people we incarcerate in them. But by other measures, we surely don't spend enough. In-custody deaths are at shockingly high levels. A quarter to half of former prisoners reoffend within five years of release. And ex-offenders are massively overrepresented among the homeless population-a reflection, in no small part, of the inadequacy of the services available to people transitioning out of prison. Our penitentiaries house a large number of offenders, but that doesn't mean they have the resources to protect and rehabilitate them.\n\nOne could trace this chronic underinvestment at least as far back as the Jim Crow South, when underfunded law-enforcement agencies were strikingly indifferent to violence against Black Americans. In The Collapse of American Criminal Justice , the legal academic William J. Stuntz observed that whereas killers of white Americans in that era could generally expect a vigorous response from the criminal-justice system, killers of Black Americans, regardless of race, were very likely to go free. And, as the journalist Jill Leovy observed in Ghettoside , that era's absence of effective crime control in Black communities gave rise to vigilantism: Many Black individuals who found no recourse in turning to the law felt compelled to take matters into their own hands.\n\nThat pattern reverberates even now. In 2020, for example, Black Americans were the victims in 61 percent of all gun homicides, most of which go unsolved and unpunished by the law. Assuming they are apprehended and punished at all, offenders whose victims are Black can be expected to receive lighter sentences than those whose victims are not Black. In some zip codes in the United States, young Black men are more likely to be killed than if they served in wartime Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThis endemic violence has devastated the civic infrastructure of many American cities. Lawlessness gives rise to middle-class flight, which in turn shrinks the tax bases that finance local law enforcement. The isolation and deprivation that result are nothing less than a moral scandal.\n\nNicholas Dawidoff: Poverty is violent\n\nThe criminal-justice system affects millions of people every year, yet this crisis of underinvestment has been largely overlooked. Indeed, recent years have seen renewed liberal support for dis investment in the criminal-justice system, propelled by the widely held view that we over-police communities of color and over-incarcerate.\n\nThe woefully unpopular \"defund the police\" movement is only the most visible manifestation of rising liberal support for disinvestment. It has also appeared in the push to shift many functions-including traffic enforcement and public-order maintenance-out of the criminal-justice system and often into the (less accountable) NGO sector, and in the imposition of unfunded mandates on police departments and prisons in the name of reform.\n\nThis approach is perhaps best understood as a sort of progressive version of \"starve the beast,\" the conservative theory that slashing taxes forces cuts in government programs. Advocates of criminal-justice reform argue in effect that because the system is broken, we should defund rather than fix it. They point to police misconduct and violence as evidence that policing doesn't work, not that policing needs more resources. They point to slow courts as a reason to release suspects pretrial, rather than asking how to ensure speedy trials. They point to the worst conditions in America's prisons and jails as a reason to decarcerate, but they don't talk about how to make incarceration more humane and less criminogenic.\n\nThis \"starve the beast\" approach is particularly peculiar from the left, which usually identifies government dysfunction as a product of underinvestment. In this case, that prescription is correct: Improving our criminal-justice system means spending the requisite money to address America's horrific and long-standing problem with criminal violence.\n\nOne leader who seems to understand this is President Joe Biden. The White House has pushed back against \"starve the beast\" progressivism, floating a $37 billion public-safety plan . Some of its investments-including $13 billion for the COPS Hiring Program and investments in court case-management tools-are smart steps in the right direction. But it also spends billions on alternatives to the criminal-justice system, including community-violence-intervention programs whose efficacy is at best unproven , and alternative responders who address just a fraction of police calls for service. It's worth researching how these programs work at scale, but handing them $20 billion before that's done seems unwise at best.\n\nWhat could and should garner bipartisan support is a more focused package, one that concentrates federal dollars on improving the institutions we know keep us safe. Hiring tens of thousands of police officers, as Biden wants to do, is a good start. So is funding to help courts expedite case processing, particularly by modernizing case-management software and practices-which would in turn help bring backlogs under control. An obvious third area is rehabilitating failing prisons and jails. In addition, funding for research, evaluation, and statistics-which pays for both crime data and criminological research- has plummeted in recent years. Charging the Justice Department's research arm, the National Institute of Justice, with making creative investments would make our system both smarter and tougher.\n\nWhy are these more traditional tools of crime control the right way to fight crime? Because decades of evidence show that they work. Studies of federally subsidized police-hiring grants consistently find that cities that receive the grants reduce crime compared with those that don't. One study found that the burst of hiring overseen by the Obama administration prevented four violent crimes and 15 property crimes for each cop hired. For every 10 percent increase in police-force size, another estimate suggests, violent-crime rates drop by 13 percent and property-crime rates by 7 percent.\n\nThe benefits of funding don't stop with police. The speed with which courts dispose of cases has been considered central to criminal deterrence for centuries . Supporting this, probation programs that impose what experts call \"swift, certain, and fair\" sentences-a short jail stay-have been shown to deter drug offenders in Hawaii and drunk drivers in South Dakota . And it's intuitive that worse prisons engender more crime: Research from Colombia finds that as-if-random assignment to a newer, better prison reduces an offender's risk of reincarceration within one year by 36 percent.\n\nIn short, spending on our criminal-justice system's capacity offers palpable, proven returns. This is particularly significant against the enormous costs of crime, estimated at more than $600 billion in 2017 alone-mostly due to violence. If we have a pressing problem, and tools that can address it, how can we not use one to resolve the other?\n\nSome conservatives may blanch at expanding federal spending amid soaring inflation and a looming debt crisis. But a small increase in the federal government's already limited outlays for public safety-about $66 billion in 2021-could be compensated for with spending cuts on less-effective programs. And although state and local policy makers should lead the way, the federal government has long used the power of the purse to backstop the provision of the state's most basic function: public safety.\n\nStanding up to \"starve the beast\" progressivism makes sense electorally. But it is also the right thing to do for our too-violent nation. Every year, tens of thousands of people are murdered. We can do more, much more, to stop the bleeding, if only we spend what's necessary to meet our most basic civic obligation: protecting public order and safety.\n\nWhen you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

      "text": "American Police Are Inadequately Trained\n\nOfficers in the United States don't get as much instruction as police in other rich countries.\n\nIn response to the high rate at which American police kill civilians, many on the left have taken up the call for defunding the police, or abolishing the police entirely. But some policing experts are instead emphasizing a different approach that they say could reduce police killings: training officers better, longer, and on different subjects. \"We have one of the worst police-training academies in comparison to other democratic countries,\" Maria Haberfeld, a police-science professor at John Jay College, told me.\n\nPolice in the United States receive less initial training than their counterparts in other rich countries-about five months in a classroom and another three or so months in the field, on average. Many European nations, meanwhile, have something more akin to police universities, which can take three or four years to complete. European countries also have national standards for various elements of a police officer's job-such as how to search a car and when to use a baton. The U.S. does not.\n\nThe 18,000 police departments in the U.S. each have their own rules and requirements. But although police reform is a contentious subject, the inadequacy of the current training provides a rare point of relative consensus: \"Police officers, police chiefs, and everyone agree that we do not get enough training in a myriad of fields,\" Dennis Slocumb, the legislative director of the International Union of Police Associations, told me.\n\nSmall police departments are already straining to provide officer training for just a few months, and might struggle to extend that initial training period, much less provide the ongoing education and refreshers that some experts recommend. Additional training would require devoting more funding to policing, at a moment when activists are calling to defund the police.\n\nThe mix of instruction given in police academies speaks volumes about their priorities. The median police recruit receives eight hours of de-escalation training, compared with 58 hours of training in firearms, according to the Police Executive Research Forum , a think tank for police executives. But despite the initial focus on firearms, American police don't receive much ongoing weapons training, either. Slocumb said that when he was an officer in the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department, pistol requalification went from happening once every 30 days to four times a year, and then to three times a year. \"That's not because the sheriff or anyone else wants us to become less proficient,\" he said. \"It's just a financial consideration.\"\n\nRosa Brooks, a Georgetown University law professor, trained as a reserve police officer in Washington, D.C, while writing a book. After the first few weeks of firearms training in the academy, Brooks said, \"twice a year you have to requalify, and you get some little refresher training, which usually consists of a bored instructor going through some PowerPoint slides. And he's like, 'Okay, you guys know this stuff. Okay? Good.'\"\n\nAmerican police training resembles military training-\"polish your boots, do push-ups, speak when you're spoken to,\" Brooks told me. In an article for The Atlantic last year , she described practicing drills and standing at attention when senior officers entered the room. \"I don't think I've been yelled at as much since high-school gym class more than three decades ago,\" she wrote. Reformers worry that this type of training teaches recruits that the world runs on strict power hierarchies, and that anything short of perfect compliance should be met with force and anger.\n\nThough he generally agrees with the push toward less militaristic police academies, Slocumb thinks the stress of military-style drills can be a useful proving ground for new officers. \"You don't want the first time that you have to make a decision while people are screaming in your face to be out in someone's living room,\" he told me. \"It needs to be something you've been accustomed to during training.\"\n\nMany policing experts recommend that officers be trained to slow down when they are able to do so, giving themselves time to decide the best course of action. \"Police are taught in the academy [that] police always have to win,\" says Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum. But sometimes it's okay not to win, particularly if it means saving a life.\n\n\"So many of these bad cases are a result of an officer incorrectly perceiving a threat,\" says Sue Rahr, the former sheriff of King County, Washington, who now serves as an adviser to police-reform organizations. Rahr has developed a method to train recruits to be courteous, show empathy, explain their actions, and preserve everyone's dignity. Police should be trained \"to be sympathetic, to be guardians, rather than warriors,\" Wexler says.\n\nThat might mean adding new subjects to the curriculum. Few American officers receive much education about the history of policing or the role of police in a democratic society. \"The officer coming out of one of the European training programs, he's much more likely to have a much broader perspective on what the job is, what your role is, what your society is like, how do you fit into it,\" says David Harris, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh. \"Those things are just not really part of what's going on in most American police-training programs.\"\n\nAmerican police academies are also light on training in \"soft skills,\" such as how to communicate or use emotional intelligence to see a situation clearly. \"We didn't talk about any of what you might call the big issues in policing: race and policing, policing and excessive force, what is good policing?\" Brooks said. (The D.C. Metropolitan Police Department's curriculum has been updated since Brooks's 2016 training and \"now includes these areas,\" according to a police spokesperson.)\n\nAmerican cops are poorly prepared for trauma on the job, too: They get just six hours of training in stress management, compared with 25 hours in report-writing, according to a 2016 study by the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nAnd after officers graduate from police academies, such deficits in their training are difficult to make up. \"Once a person is out, and picks up habits and gets acculturated, it becomes harder to change directions,\" Harris says. \"How do you shift their worldview and their way of doing the job that they've been in already?\"\n\nNew officers are often paired with field-training officers, but many of those officers learned the wrong techniques themselves, and are passing them along to their trainees. Derek Chauvin , who was convicted on Tuesday of murder, was acting as a field-training officer when he killed George Floyd. Kim Potter , who shouted \"Taser! Taser! Taser!\" before fatally shooting Daunte Wright with her pistol last week, was also acting as a field-training officer at the time.\n\nThe Marshall Project recently looked at 10 big-city police departments and found that most allow officers who have faced allegations of aggressive behavior to become trainers; one academic study found that officers whose trainers had a history of citizen complaints were more likely to draw complaints themselves in their first two years on the job.\n\nBetter training alone can't solve every problem with American policing. But because officers are licensed to use force against their fellow citizens, they should at least be equipped to use it wisely."

      "text": "What Trump Did to Police Officers\n\nOn January 6, 2021, Trump's supporters attacked scores of law-enforcement officers as the president stood by.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nSign up for Trump's Return , a newsletter featuring coverage of the second Trump presidency.\n\nFour years ago, scores of police officers were attacked only yards away from where Donald Trump will swear to defend the Constitution and faithfully execute the duties of his office. The scene, in the words of one officer, was \"a non-stop barrage\" with \"weapons and things being thrown, and pepper spray, and you name it ... You could hear them yelling. You could hear them, screams and moans, and everything else.\" One officer later said that he was certain he would die the moment he entered the crowd: \"You know, you're getting pushed, kicked, you know, people are throwing metal bats at you and all that stuff. I was like, yeah, this is fucking it.\"\n\nAll of this happened because Trump, according to Special Counsel Jack Smith's report, could not accept his loss in the 2020 election, and so he tried on January 6, 2021, to \"direct an angry mob to the United States Capitol to obstruct the congressional certification of the presidential election and then leverage rioters' violence to further delay it.\" The crowd that attacked the Capitol, Smith wrote, \"was filled with Mr. Trump's supporters, as made clear by their Trump shirts, signs, and flags,\" and they \"violently attacked the law enforcement officers attempting to secure the building.\"\n\nThe ensuing riot was one of the worst days for law enforcement since 9/11. More than 140 officers were injured on January 6, but we know only the names of some of the most famous victims of the mob, such as Officers Michael Fanone, Aquilino Gonell, Harry Dunn, and others who have testified to Congress or given interviews. Their injuries were severe. Fanone was beaten to the point of a concussion and a heart attack; Gonell was attacked by more than 40 rioters and assaulted with his own riot shield. He has since undergone multiple surgeries and suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nIn his campaign for reelection, the man who conjured this violence against his own government-and then stood by as police from multiple jurisdictions were attacked-portrayed himself as the guardian of law and order. (One of the themes of the 2024 GOP convention was \"Make America Safe Again.\") This strategy worked: Trump yet again nabbed the endorsement of the National Fraternal Order of Police. The FOP vice president, Joe Gamaldi, said in November that police see Trump's victory as a mandate from voters who are \"tired of all the chaos and disorder we're seeing in our streets. We are tired of the 'defund the police' talk, and basically we're just tired of the crap.\"\n\nRead: Trump's empty promise of 'law and order'\n\nThe new president's supporters may be tired of what they mistakenly believe is a rise in crime in the streets, but they've memory-holed Trump's willingness to throw a swarm of raging insurrectionists against the same police forces that will be protecting him at today's inauguration. Nothing, however, should be allowed to erase the truth that the party of law and order is now led by not only a convicted felon, but one who callously looked on as outnumbered police officers did battle for hours to protect the lives of the members of the United States Congress.\n\nI understand the anger that some police officers feel when the public assumes that they're all corrupt bullies, potential killers no better than the men involved in the ghastly 2020 murder of George Floyd. My father and brother were both police officers (Dad in the 1950s, and my brother from the 1960s to the 1980s). Our next-door neighbor when I was a boy was a police officer, and I grew up among cops in my small New England city. Most of them became \"law and order\" Republican voters when Richard Nixon was able to turn riots-including the mess at the 1968 Democratic National Convention-into a campaign issue.\n\nTrump has done the same through his three presidential campaigns, depicting America as a lawless hellhole. At least Nixon, however, had the advantage of pointing to the other party, and to his political opponents, as the source of danger to Americans and their armed protectors. Trump has managed to erase from millions of minds the fact that the people who attacked the police on January 6 were his own supporters , acting on what they believed were his wishes.\n\n\"I would like to see January 6 burned into the American mind as firmly as 9/11,\" the conservative writer George Will said in 2021, \"because it was that scale of a shock to the system.\" But like so many of Trump's outrages and scandals, the attack on the Capitol has faded into the noise of the 2024 campaign. Trump today will likely thunder on about the return of law and order and swear to make America's streets safer, but American voters, no matter their party, should remember what actually happened to dozens of police officers because of Trump's own actions.\n\nPolice officers at the Capitol were being attacked with an assortment of weapons-bear spray, flagpoles, even their own equipment. (\"My helmet came down and felt like someone was on top of me and I couldn't see anything,\" the Capitol Police officer Winston Pingeon told ABC News in an October 2024 interview . \"And I remember just thinking, I have to protect my gun, because they stole my baton.\") During all of this, Trump, as usual, was tweeting: \"I am asking for everyone at the U.S. Capitol to remain peaceful. No violence! Remember, WE are the Party of Law & Order-respect the Law and our great men and women in Blue. Thank you!\" Meanwhile, the mob pressed on. One officer recounted that rioters dragged him into the crowd, where they beat and tased him while yelling things such as \"I got one!\" and \"Kill him with his gun!\"\n\nTom Nichols: Trump's dangerous January 6-pardon promise\n\nTrump now refers to many of the rioters who have been convicted and jailed as \"hostages.\" He has promised to pardon some of them upon taking office. \"Most likely, I'll do it very quickly,\" he said on Meet the Press last month, adding that \"those people have suffered long and hard. And there may be some exceptions to it. I have to look. But, you know, if somebody was radical, crazy.\"\n\nThe once and future president seems to have a forgiving definition of radical . On the campaign trail, he lauded a choir formed by some of the jailed insurrectionists. He even lent them his voice; their song, \"Justice for All,\" includes Trump reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, and Trump regularly played it at his rallies. \"Our people love those people,\" Trump said last May.\n\nFour of this \"J6 Prison Choir\" were charged with assaulting a law-enforcement officer. One rioter, Julian Khater , had already pleaded guilty to assaulting multiple officers before the song was recorded. He was sentenced to almost six years in prison. Another choir member, Shane Jenkins, was also sentenced to six years in prison after being convicted of seven felonies and two misdemeanors, including throwing makeshift weapons at the police. \"I have murder in my heart and head,\" he wrote to an associate in the weeks after the riot, according to the Justice Department.\n\nTrump has described January 6 as \"a day of love.\" The police who were there know better. Many of them live with physical and psychological scars. Four of them committed suicide within a year. \"Tell me again how you support the police and law and order when all these things are happening?\" Gonell asked last spring.\n\nSafely back in the White House, Trump will never have to answer that question. But every time he and other elected Republicans claim to be the party of law and order, Americans should remember the day that the 47th president was willing to sacrifice the men and women of the thin blue line on the altar of his own ambitions."

Fortson's family says the police had arrived at the wrong home and that Fortson had grabbed his legal firearm as a precaution. Police body-camera footage shows Fortson answered the door with his gun at his side, not posing an imminent threat to the officer, who immediately shot Fortson six times. \"The Second Amendment applies to Black people, too,\" says Crump, who has represented victims of police violence in many high-profile cases. The police claim that officers were responding to a domestic dispute is contradicted by the fact that Fortson was home alone, Crump says. \"They need to go ahead and admit that it was the wrong apartment and quit trying to justify this unjustifiable killing.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : A warning to our listeners and viewers: This next story includes video and descriptions of police killing a man in his apartment.\n\nIn Florida, the family members of a 23-year-old Air Force member killed by a sheriff's deputy May 3rd are demanding justice. Newly released body-camera footage shows Roger Fortson answering the door of his own apartment and immediately being fatally shot by an Okaloosa County officer.\n\nSHERIFF'S DEPUTY : Sheriff's Office. Open the door! Step out. [gunfire] Drop the gun! Drop the gun!\n\nROGER FORTSON : It's over there.\n\nSHERIFF'S DEPUTY : Drop the gun!\n\nROGER FORTSON : I don't have it.\n\nSHERIFF'S DEPUTY : 312, shots fired. Suspect down. Do not move! 312, get EMS my location.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Roger Fortson's relatives say the deputy arrived at the wrong apartment, which authorities have refuted. This is Roger Fortson's mother, Chantemekki Fortson.\n\nCHANTEMEKKI FORTSON : So, to this sheriff department, that took my gift, that had so many, so many accolades inside of him, to err is human, and to forgive is divine. I need you guys to tell the truth about my son.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : For more, we're joined by Ben Crump, civil rights attorney representing Fortson's family.\n\nBen, welcome back to Democracy Now! So, if you can really take us through what happened here? What happened when - the airman was on Zoom with his girlfriend, sitting in his apartment?\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : Yes, Amy. It is tragic on so many levels. U.S. Airman Roger Fortson was an American hero. He was a patriot. He was a young man who was doing all the right things. He was trying to provide for his mother, his 10-year-old sister Harmony, his 16-year-old brother André. He was highly intelligent. He was special ops. He was the best that we had to offer America.\n\nAnd on this day, there was a call about a domestic disturbance. Well, we know it was the wrong apartment for many reasons, but the main one being Roger was in his apartment by himself doing FaceTime video with his girlfriend. And he was the only person. He had his little dog in the apartment.\n\nAnd so, the officer came, knocked on the door. Roger and them didn't know who it was. He never heard who it was. But Roger opened the door with his licensed, registered gun, because the Second Amendment applies to Black people, too. And he kept the gun in a down position, opened the door. The officer tells him to step back. He starts to step back, and then immediately he is executed by six shots from the sheriff's deputy, without giving any verbal command to drop the weapon, \"put your hands up,\" or anything. It's not 'til that young man is lying down, down dying, where he says, \"Drop the weapon. Drop the weapon.\" And Roger is even trying to comply after he's been shot. He says, \"I don't have it. It's over there.\"\n\nAnd then, the FaceTime video of his girlfriend is just horrible, Amy, because you hear him saying, \"I can't breathe,\" and you hear the police officer steady barking orders, talking about \"Don't move. Don't move.\" And we lose this young man, which was one of the brightest lights for his family and our community.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You know, Ben Crump, this reminds me of - and many people, of the killing of the 26-year-old accountant, Botham Jean, who was eating ice cream, I think he was watching TV, when a police officer came in, in 2018, Amber Guyger. She thought she was entering her own apartment in the apartment complex, but she was just confused and entered his apartment and killed him, because she said she thought he was an intruder in her apartment.\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : Yeah. It reminds me of Botham Jean. It reminds me of Breonna Taylor. It reminds me of Atatiana Jefferson - any number of Black people who were - young Black people who were just in their apartments minding their business when the police killed them unjustifiably.\n\nAnd this is tragic, because that video is so horrific. I mean, he doesn't give him any chance. He immediately starts to shoot and kill him. And so, this raises many issues. And the military needs to make sure his reputation is without stain, as his mother said. The first report went out, Amy, saying, well, he was killed in self-defense, there was a domestic dispute, and so forth. And there's nothing to suggest that. So, the Okaloosa Sheriff's Department needs to not try to assassinate his character, now that they have assassinated his person. And we have to honor him as a patriot and a hero and have accountability for this police officer.\n\nAnd this apartment complex, at the beginning of the video, they asked a leasing representative, \"Where's the disturbance coming from?\" She says, \"I'm not sure.\" They asked her again. She's still not sure. But then, the third time, she say, \"It's in apartment 1401,\" which is his apartment. And they go, and we see what happened. And we will not let them sweep this under the rug.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, what are the authorities saying? Can you explain why they went into his apartment?\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : Well, they're saying because they were told it was a domestic dispute. But he was the only one there, him and his dog. He was on FaceTime with his girlfriend. So, they need to go ahead and admit that it was the wrong apartment, and quit trying to justify this unjustifiable killing. I mean, it is - it's just horrible.\n\nHis funeral is going to be Friday in Atlanta, Georgia. And hopefully, by then, they won't continue to have this incorrect narrative that they went to the right apartment, because as long as they do that, that is dishonoring his legacy and his commitment to being a person who respected the rules, respected authority, did the right things, and was one of our brightest spots, a true American patriot. And he should be honored and remembered as such.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Finally, Ben Crump, the U.S. Special Operations Affairs - I mean, he was a U.S. airman - released a press release saying, \"Our focus [is] on Senior Airman Fortson's family, providing necessary resources ... We respect the legal process and the family's right to secure representation.\" Can you talk about the significance of the U.S. military acknowledging and monitoring this killing?\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : I think it's very important, as this young African American airman, who was a senior airman, he is part of the military family. And so we would expect that they will stand up and make sure he's given the same dignity and respect that you would afford a military personnel who has done everything appropriate to serve his country.\n\nThe fact that, you know, we haven't heard from the NRA - I mean, we're in Florida. Florida encourages citizens to have guns and have their right to the Second Amendment. Well, it should be foreseeable for police officers, if you're coming to somebody's house in a state like Florida, where many citizens have guns, well, how are you supposed to interact with them when they're exercising their basic constitutional rights. And that's why you have many people in our community saying, \"Hold on. Where's the NRA ?\" This is a Second Amendment issue. He was a registered gun owner. He was militarily trained. He was responsible. He respected authority. This is the type of person you would want to have own a gun. But you haven't heard anything from them. So, hopefully, the military will continue to shine the light on this, to make others stand up and decry this tragic killing of this innocent young American patriot.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And finally, Ben Crump, on a totally different issue, last Malcolm X Day, on the assassination - the anniversary of the assassination of Malcolm X, you announced the family's lawsuit. And I'm wondering if the mayor of New York City - one of the things you've requested is the release of key evidence in the assassination. Has Mayor Adams, a former police officer, responded?\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : Not in a formal manner, but we expect to have updates for you very soon.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Very good. When we come back, we are coming back here to New York, but we're going to be looking at another police killing, the police killing of a 19-year-old teenager who called 911 himself asking for help. He was in a mental health crisis. The police came and shot him dead in front of his mother and brother. Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

In 2006, Cariol Horne, who is Black, saw a white officer repeatedly punching the man in the face before putting him in a chokehold.

New York state Supreme Court Judge Dennis Ward cited Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in his ruling, writing, \"The time is always right to do right.\" Ward also wrote, \"Recent events in the national news, including the death last year in the City of Minneapolis of George Floyd, who died from unreasonable physical force being applied for over nine minutes, have sparked national outrage over the use of this practice,\" unquote. The judge continued, \"One of the issues in all of these cases is the role of other officers at the scene and particularly their complicity in failing to intervene to save the life of a person to whom such unreasonable physical force is being applied. ... To her credit, Officer Horne did not merely stand by, but instead sought to intervene, despite the penalty she ultimately paid for doing so,\" the court said.\n\nThe officer Horne intervened against, Gregory Kwiatkowski, would later be sentenced to a four-month term in a federal prison for a 2009 incident in which he assaulted four African American teenagers in handcuffs. The man Cariol Horne saved from Kwiatkowski's chokehold, Neal Mack, credits her with saving his life.\n\nMeanwhile, Cariol Horne has proposed Cariol's Law, which would make it the duty of enforcement officers to intervene in cases of brutality. It would protect officers who intervene, and punish officers who cover up abuses or falsify reports. Buffalo's City Council voted last fall to adopt the legislation, and Horne is calling on state governments and Congress to follow their lead.\n\nFor more, we go to Buffalo to speak with Cariol Horne. Also with us is Intisar Rabb, a Harvard Law School professor who's one of the three attorneys representing Horne.\n\nWe welcome you both to Democracy Now! Cariol Horne, congratulations on winning this victory in court. Take us back to 2006. Where were you when you saw this white officer attacking this handcuffed Black man?\n\nCARIOL HORNE : I went to the home of Neal Mack at 707 Walden Avenue. And when I went inside of the house, that's when Neal Mack was handcuffed and being punched in the face. So, once we got Neal Mack out of the house and went outside, that is when Gregory Kwiatkowski started choking him. And that's when I released the chokehold, and then he punched me in the face.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And what did you do?\n\nCARIOL HORNE : Well, I got ready to defend myself, but two officers came between us, and two officers pulled me back. So, then I went to the station house, reported it to the chief. And then an internal investigation started, and I became the target.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And you ultimately were fired.\n\nCARIOL HORNE : Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : How did that affect your life, Cariol Horne? And why is this vindication coming 15 years later?\n\nCARIOL HORNE : It affected my life in a lot of ways, financially, emotionally, physically. You know, I had five children - I mean, I have five children, but they were younger then. And I knew that I did the right thing, so I couldn't understand why they would not do the right thing, meaning the city police department.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, you were fired. The white cop who was assaulting this Black man wasn't fired. He, the handcuffed man, says you saved his life. And then the white cop ends up going to jail for assaulting four Black teens?\n\nCARIOL HORNE : He went to jail for exactly what I had said he did, using unnecessary, unlawful force.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to bring Intisar Rabb into the conversation. How did you get involved with this case? You weren't Cariol Horne's original lawyer.\n\nINSITAR RABB : No, I got a call in summer of this past year, in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, from Rami Nashashibi, who is the director of the Inner-City Muslim Action Network, an organization in Chicago. He's the author, as you mentioned, or the songwriter of the song for - \"Mama Please,\" for Cariol Horne. So he called, telling me about the facts of her case, that she had done the right thing, she saved a man - Neal Mack is the George Floyd who lived - but she suffered the consequences of doing something right as if she had done something wrong. She was fired. She needs vindication. And I thought, \"Absolutely, she does.\"\n\nVery soon after that, Ron Sullivan, Neil Eggleston, we all joined in, took the case immediately and thought that this has to be something where, even if the law says on paper that it's impossible, we're not going to take no for an answer, and we're going to do everything that we can to help bring her justice.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Professor Rabb, and Attorney Rabb, why did this case affect you so deeply?\n\nINSITAR RABB : This case really affected me in two ways. I think it comes - the case itself, our notice of it, and the handing down of the judgment comes in against a backdrop of a widespread epidemic of violence, police excessive use of force, that has to be curbed, I think, from all sides. The law has to be used as a tool for justice. So I think it's the backdrop of what was and the context of what is today that really demanded that we get involved in Cariol's case and ensure that her behavior is lauded and that she becomes an example for other police officers, that this courageous judge becomes an example for other courts to correct past wrongs.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And what do you think of Cariol's Law?\n\nINSITAR RABB : I think the law is one that should spread far and wide, so that it will both create a duty to intervene for police officers against fellow officers who are using excessive force unlawfully, as we see happens way too often - this week alone. And I think that one of the provisions of the law is that it creates a retroactive cause of action. So, when incidents happen - if an incident happened 20 years prior, a person like Cariol Horne, who suffered the consequences, bad consequences, of doing the right thing, can still get justice.\n\nSo, I think this is - both the law and the case can be exemplary models for other cities and states. There is a saying: \"Save a life, it's as if you've saved all of mankind.\" The law and the police officers can help be in that position of saving all mankind instead of taking life, in the way that Cariol Horne did in saving a life.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : But this case does not mean that Cariol Horne gets compensated for the emotional damage that was done to her, being stripped of her job, losing her pension. This is 15 years later. Does she get reparations for that?\n\nINSITAR RABB : We hope that she will. We took this case as a first step. The law moves slowly. But the first step toward her getting compensation or damages of that sort would be at least to clear her name, clear out the wrongful termination for her actions. And I think she may well go on to determine next steps. Right now we were focused on getting justice for Cariol Horne in this case.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, Cariol Horne, has this changed your view of police, both now this vindication and also what happened then? We have a photograph of you standing with Martin Gugino, who people might remember, the elder man, the big peace activist in Buffalo, who was pushed down by police officers. They cracked his skull.\n\nCARIOL HORNE : What's your question?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Cariol, I was just asking you: Does this change your view of the police department and of police, in general, what their role is, and what you feel should be the direction of police reform?\n\nCARIOL HORNE : No, it doesn't change my view of policing, because there's still a lot of work to be done. When you hear stories of Adam Toledo, Daunte Wright, and even Caron Nazario, this is what people have been talking about forever. There needs to be an international law. So, I mean, Cariol's Law is great that it's been passed in Buffalo. It still needs to be amended to include a national registry, because these officers who are involved in these cases should not be able to leave one department and go to another one so that they can continue to do the same thing. And then, the system - I think that, you know, what I did was right, and I think that the judge was awesome in his decision, and that that's a start. So, if you're changing the system from within, that's a start.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, Cariol Horne, I want to thank you so much for being with us, and both congratulating you on your actions and for winning this case, as the judge cited Dr. Martin Luther King. Cariol Horne, the Buffalo, New York, police officer fired for stopping a fellow cop from choking a handcuffed man during an arrest, sanctioned by the Buffalo Police Department, ultimately fired, just months before she was eligible to receive her full pension. Last week, a New York court vindicated her, making her eligible for back pay and pension benefits. And Intisar Rabb, attorney and Harvard Law professor, thanks so much.\n\nThat does it for our show.

      "text": "DC Police Officers Convicted In Black Man's Death Rehired After Trump Pardon\n\nBreaking News Reporter, HuffPost\n\nTwo Washington, D.C., officers who were convicted in the 2020 death of 20-year-old Karon Hylton-Brown have been reinstated to the city's police force after being pardoned by President Donald Trump .\n\nThe reinstatements of Metropolitan Police Officer Terence Sutton and Lt. Andrew Zabavsky were confirmed by a police spokesperson to HuffPost on Tuesday. The spokesperson declined further comment, reasoning that it's a personnel matter.\n\nBoth officers were charged with improperly chasing Hylton-Brown in a police vehicle and then conspiring to cover up their actions and the severity of his resulting, fatal injuries. They were pardoned by Trump just days after he took office in January.\n\nBoth will need to go through extensive retraining before their assignments are determined, a police source told CNN .\n\nHylton-Brown was riding a moped on a sidewalk without a helmet when he was chased by the two men. Such offenses are considered traffic infractions and are not to be pursued by police , according to the department's official policy.\n\nHylton-Brown crashed his scooter into a car while coming out of an alley ahead of the officers' vehicle on Oct. 23, 2020. He died two days later from his injuries.\n\nSutton, who was behind the wheel, was convicted of second-degree murder, conspiracy to obstruct and obstruction of justice in the crash. He was sentenced to 66 months in prison last September.\n\nZabavsky, who was supervising Sutton at the time of the crash, was convicted of conspiracy to obstruct and obstruction of justice and was also sentenced in September to 48 months in prison. Both men have been out on bail while appealing their convictions.\n\nProsecutors said the officers drove at unreasonable speeds and at one point drove in the wrong direction down a one-way street during their pursuit of Hylton-Brown, who was unarmed. After the crash, the officers turned off their body-worn cameras, allowed the driver that struck Hylton-Brown to leave the scene, and discussed how to cover up what had happened as Hylton-Brown lay dying of his injuries in the road.\n\nNeither officer notified the city's major crash unit and they submitted a false account of what happened, with Zabavsky falsely suggesting that Hylton-Brown was driving the moped while intoxicated, the Justice Department said .\n\nSutton's attorney Kellen Dwyer, in a statement praising Trump's pardon back in January, had argued that the conviction would have been reversed in the D.C. Circuit because Sutton was acting on a tip that Hylton-Brown was involved in a gang-related altercation. This detail, he said, was kept from the jury.\n\nThe D.C. Police Union, reacting to news of their pardons in January, called their convictions \"glaring miscarriages of justice.\"\n\n\"These officers - men of integrity and dedication - were targeted by corrupt prosecutors who weaponized the legal system against them,\" the union said.\n\nHylton-Brown's mother, Karen Hylton, had begged Trump in a letter not to pardon both men upon hearing of his consideration.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Officers Were Caught On Video Punching A Deaf Black Man. The Police Union Says They Were Attacked.\n\nAssociate reporter\n\nAfter widespread outrage over videos showing two police officers beating a deaf Black man, the police union responded again that the officers were defending themselves ― and claimed media coverage of the incident amounted to a \"smear campaign.\"\n\nTyron McAlpin, a 34-year-old who also has cerebral palsy, was punched and shocked with a Taser by two Phoenix Police Department officers on Aug. 19 as they tried to stop him in connection with a reported assault. But McAlpin had nothing to do with any assault, his attorney told HuffPost, adding that witnesses described the white man who accused him as behaving bizarrely. Then this week, the release of surveillance and body camera footage brought new scrutiny of the officers' actions, and the Maricopa County Attorney announced that all charges against McAlpin would be dismissed based on what the videos showed.\n\nHe had spent 24 days in jail.\n\nDespite the prosecutor's decision, the Phoenix Law Enforcement Association, the union that represents about 2,200 officers, continues to defend the actions of officers Benjamin Harris and Kyle Sue.\n\n\"It is unfortunate that a narrative was created accusing these officers of targeting Mr. McAlpin due to his race and disabilities,\" the police union said in a statement to the broadcasting group Arizona's Family . \"This is completely false and an inaccurate portrayal of what occurred in real time as the officers encountered Mr. McAlpin.\"\n\nThe beating of McAlpin comes just months after the Department of Justice found \"overwhelming statistical evidence\" that Phoenix police discriminate against Black, Hispanic and Native American people and use excessive force. In a letter, Phoenix city officials denied they need federal oversight but said they are committed to ongoing efforts to reform the police department.\n\nOn Aug. 19, McAlpin had walked to a Circle K convenience store to pick up a drink for his partner while she worked from their nearby home and looked after their infant son, McAlpin's attorney, Jesse Showalter, told HuffPost.\n\nA white man walked into the Circle K saying that he had been in a fight and demanded that employees call police, Showalter said. Multiple store employees told an investigator working for the law firm that the man in the store was \"behaving bizarrely,\" Showalter said, describing him as a \"troubled person.\"\n\nAccording to Showalter, employees said the man was aggressive toward their customers, refused to leave and at one point was lying on the floor.\n\nOfficers were then called to the store, and the man told them that he had been punched in the face after trying to stop a thief from stealing a bike, according to a police report.\n\nThe accuser was wearing a gray T-shirt and shorts covered in what appeared to be \"old dark blood stains,\" according to the report. When officers asked if he could describe the person who assaulted him, the man reportedly said he was a Black man and pointed at McAlpin.\n\nSurveillance footage taken from a nearby Dollar Tree store shows McAlpin walking on the sidewalk looking at his phone as Officer Harris quickly pulls up in front of him in a police truck, blocking his path. Harris' police lights were not on at the time. McAlpin's partner later told officers they were video-chatting and using sign language when police tried to stop McAlpin.\n\n\"Hey buddy, stop where you're at,\" Harris said while still inside the truck, seconds before coming out and grabbing McAlpin with both hands, according to body camera footage reviewed by HuffPost.\n\nShowalter said it's unclear whether anybody could have heard the officer's command from inside the police truck.\n\nIn his police report, Harris wrote that McAlpin \"took a fighting stance\" and \"engaged in active aggression by swinging punches\" at Harris' head.\n\n\"He was not simply assaulting me in order to get away, but engaging in assaults to cause me harm and injury,\" Harris wrote.\n\nShowalter told HuffPost that police tactics such as those Harris used on McAlpin during the stop only escalate the situation. He added there was no way for McAlpin to respond that wouldn't have resulted in officers claiming more force was justified, describing the situation as \"a pop quiz that nobody can pass.\"\n\n\"If your hands go up, they claim that you are entering into a fighting stance. If your hands go down, they claim you're reaching for a weapon. It's a lose-lose proposition, and the claim that Tyrone went into a fighting stance is just outrageous,\" Showalter said.\n\nThe police union did not immediately respond to HuffPost's request for comment but said in the statement to Arizona's Family that \"at no time did Mr. McAlpin convey to [the officers] that he was hearing impaired or suffered from cerebral palsy. Our officers defended themselves against the attack of Mr. McAlpin.\"\n\nThe statement added that the union was appalled by the county attorney's decision to drop the charges against McAlpin.\n\nBut what officers described as a \"fighting stance\" was actually McAlpin \"gesturing in surprise,\" Showalter said, possibly pointing to his ears to indicate to the officers that he is deaf. Showalter added that McAlpin was ducking the punches being thrown at him. A review of Harris' bodycam footage shows McAlpin ducking multiple times.\n\nOfficer Sue then arrived at the scene and helped Harris force McAlpin down to the ground, the video shows. Harris can be heard telling the deaf man multiple times to put his hands behind his back as both officers take hold of him.\n\nMcAlpin does not say a word as both officers can be seen in Harris' bodycam video hitting him multiple times, including in the back of his head, before Harris pulls out his Taser and shocks McAlpin while he's on the ground. McAlpin can be heard screaming while Sue continues to punch him and Harris delivers more shocks.\n\nMcAlpin's partner arrived at the scene about three minutes after the beating began and explained to officers that McAlpin is deaf and has cerebral palsy , according to the bodycam footage . Police did not make any mention in their report of McAlpin's disabilities.\n\n\"How is he deaf if he's been on the phone,\" Harris can be heard in the video asking McAlpin's partner. She replies that they were communicating through sign language and that she had been on the phone with him since he left Circle K. She told officers that someone was bothering McAlpin at the convenience store before he left.\n\nA black cellphone, which police claimed in their report belonged to the man who'd accused McAlpin of assault, was dropped on the ground during the beating. But, according to Showalter, the phone belonged to McAlpin, which his partner told officers at the scene, pointing to the lock screen photo of their son and showing that it was logged into McAlpin's Facebook account. Still, he was charged with theft.\n\nMcAlpin was also charged with assault with intent, two counts of aggravated assault of an officer and resisting arrest.\n\nShowalter told HuffPost that as of Thursday, McAlpin had still not gotten his phone back, even though the charges had been dismissed.\n\nMcAlpin's arrest brought national attention to the necessity of training police on how to interact with people who are deaf or hearing impaired. The police union on Thursday said in its statement that officers do receive that training.\n\n\"The Phoenix Police Department provides training on how to interact with community members, victims and suspects, who are hearing impaired and/or disabled, however, we are also trained on how to defend ourselves if faced with a violent individual intent on hurting us,\" the statement said.\n\nHowever, during a preliminary hearing earlier this week, ABC affiliate KNXV-TV in Phoenix reported that both officers testified they don't recall much training on how to handle people who have hearing impairments.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

He began riding it home after feeling scared by police activity in his neighborhood, his mother, Regina Sanders, told CBS affiliate WTSP.\n\nAn officer in a patrol vehicle leaving the scene of a different call struck the boy a at around 6:30 p.m. on Oct. 28, Sarasota Police Chief Rex Troche said in a press conference. The police department also shared the graphic body camera footage online.\n\nIn one video, the unnamed officer can be seen turning left at an intersection, passing a stop sign without appearing to make a complete stop before accelerating and hitting the child. The officer then gets out of his patrol car, and Butler can be seen lying on the ground a great distance from the vehicle.\n\n\"The cops, you just see them flying, at least hitting 60 miles, and they don't care about the stop signs, just flying through the roads,\" Sanders told WTSP. \"I was inside and I just heard something scraping and then you just see the little minibike on there.\"\n\nIn the video, the officer calls for backup and emergency medical aid as a crowd of panicked neighbors forms. Police make some attempts at CPR in the interim, but cannot find a defibrillator.\n\nThe child was taken to Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital and was treated for serious injuries, according to an earlier release by police. Sanders told WTSP earlier this week that her son had undergone two brain surgeries and a knee surgery and is scheduled for jaw surgery.\n\nIn a Wednesday update from ABC affiliate WWSB, Sanders said her son has only been able to move his legs slightly and cough since he was admitted to the hospital.\n\n\"I've never been through anything like this before,\" Sanders said.\n\nPolice told WTSP the officer involved was uninjured but is shaken by the incident.

      "text": "Grand Jury Recommends Abolishing Police Department After Indicting 5 Officers\n\nAssociate reporter\n\nAn Alabama grand jury recommended that a local police department be \"immediately abolished' after indicting a local police chief, four officers and an officer's spouse as part of a corruption investigation, Cullman County District Attorney Champ Crocker announced Wednesday.\n\nThe grand jury alleged that the \"rampant culture of corruption\" within the Hanceville Police Department meant that it \"operated as more of a criminal enterprise than a law enforcement agency department,\" Crocker read aloud from the grand jury recommendations.\n\nThe department, which stands accused of compromising evidence in numerous cases, has \"abused public trust by its failure of oversight, lack of leadership and negligent training and hiring,\" Crocker continued.\n\nThe charges against department employees were made public months after Hanceville police dispatcher Christopher Michael Willingham, 49, was found dead in his office in August last year, according to WBMA-LD . Coroners found that he had died from an accidental overdose of drugs including fentanyl, gabapentin, diazepam, amphetamine, carisoprodol and methocarbamol.\n\nNo officers were charged in direct connection to Willingham's death, but the grand jury concluded that his death was a direct result of the department's negligence, Crocker said.\n\nWillingham had access to the unsecured police evidence room on his last day at work before his death, according to Crocker.\n\nHe added, \"I'll just say nothing was secure about the evidence room, and when Mr. Willingham was discovered, there was evidence in his office.\"\n\nThe \"anything but secure\" evidence room was one of the most concerning discoveries made during the investigation, according to Crocker. The evidence room was allegedly accessed routinely by people who were not authorized to do so, with staff using a broomstick to open the door through a hole in the room's exterior wall.\n\nHanceville Police Chief Jason Shane Marlin, 51, was charged with two counts of failure to report ethics crimes and tampering with evidence, according to Crocker. Three of his officers, Cody Alan Kelso, 33, Jason Scott Wilbanks, 37, and William Andrew Shellnutt, 39, were also charged with tampering with evidence.\n\nOfficer Eric Michael Kelso, 44, and his wife, Donna Reid Kelso, 63, were also charged with four counts of unlawful distribution of a controlled substance and two counts of conspiracy to unlawfully distribute a controlled substance.\n\nCody Kelso and Wilbanks each face additional charges of computer tampering, using an office for personal gain and solicitation to commit a controlled substance crime, according to Crocker.\n\nAll charges are felonies except tampering with physical evidence and computer tampering, which are misdemeanors.\n\nJohn C. Robbins, a lawyer for Cody Kelso, told The New York Times that he had \"not seen any evidence that supports these charges.\" It was not immediately clear if the other people charged had attorneys.\n\nCrocker also read out that the grand jury recommended \"that the Hanceville Police Department be immediately abolished,\" calling it an \"ongoing threat to public safety.\" The jury recommended that another state or local law enforcement agency be tasked with protecting the people of Hanceville.\n\nIn a statement posted on the police department's social media page, Hanceville Mayor Jim Sawyer responded to the grand jury's findings in a press release, saying the department has \"fallen short in its mission to serve the people.\"\n\n\"It is unfortunate that the actions of a few have tarnished our city's good name,\" Sawyer said. \"Those entrusted with serving and protecting our community must be individuals of integrity and honor.\"\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the charged officers are still employed by the police department.\n\nSawyer noted that he had spoken with Crocker and has agreed to have the police evidence room audited by the appropriate authorities.\n\n\"While the vast majority of police officers and deputies are dedicated public servants, the misconduct of a few casts a shadow on the profession,\" said Sawyer. \"Such individuals must be held accountable without delay. We will uncover the truth, and justice will be served.\"\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Minnesota School District Bans Officer Who Reenacted George Floyd's Murder\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) - A Minnesota school district has banned a police officer from working as a substitute teacher after a series of \"racially harmful\" actions that officials say included putting a student on the ground for a reenactment of the 2020 murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis officer.\n\nThe staffing agency that placed him at Woodbury High School said Wednesday that he also no longer works for them.\n\nThe man was serving as a substitute English teacher on Monday when he told students in four separate 10th and 12th grade classes that they might want to hear about his life as a police officer, school officials said in a letter to students, families and staff.\n\nBesides the re-enactment of the actions that led to the death of George Floyd, students also complained that the substitute teacher \"repeatedly made racially harmful comments,\" \"told sexist jokes,\" \"spoke in disturbing detail about dead bodies he had seen,\" said \"cops would be the best criminals\" because \"they know how to get away with stuff,\" and \"stated that police brutality isn't real,\" the letter SAID.\n\nThe letter was signed by the principal of Woodbury High School and the superintendent and assistant superintendent of the South Washington County Schools district. It said the man is now prohibited from setting foot on district property. They also said they reported the incident to the Minnesota Department of Education, the state teacher licensing board and the Woodbury Police Department.\n\nFloyd died after a white officer pinned his neck to the pavement for 9 1/2 minutes despite the Black man's dying pleas of \"I can't breathe.\" Children were among the concerned witnesses, including a teen who captured the incident on a video widely viewed on social media. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was convicted of murder. Floyd's death touched off protests that sometimes turned violent, testing the leadership of Gov. Tim Walz at one of the state's most consequential moments, and sparking a nationwide reckoning over racial discrimination and police misconduct.\n\n\"I specifically want to acknowledge racial harm that occurred when the substitute teacher reenacted the prone restraint that resulted in the murder of George Floyd,\" Principal Sarah Sorenson-Wanger wrote.\n\n\"This reported behavior is reprehensible. I am embarrassed, and I am sorry this happened to our students. We will take as much time as students need to listen and create open space for courageous conversations that lead to healing, action and education. The reported actions are not, and will not, be tolerated at Woodbury High School or in South Washington County Schools,\" the principal wrote.\n\nThe man was not identified in the letter, but it said he is not a police officer in Minnesota. Woodbury is a suburb southeast of St. Paul, and the eastern suburbs of the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area extend into western Wisconsin.\n\nThe substitute was hired through Teachers on Call, a staffing agency that's part of the national Kelly Education employment network. The company said the man passed comprehensive background checks before he was placed.\n\n\"The actions of this individual were unacceptable, and the substitute teacher is no longer an employee of Teachers on Call,\" company spokesperson Danielle Nixon said in a statement. \"We recognize the significant public trust placed in us to ensure our substitute educators maintain a safe learning environment. We have a zero-tolerance policy for any form of violent, aggressive, or harmful behavior.\"\n\nCiting the ongoing investigation, she added that Teachers on Call is not releasing any additional information on its former employee.\n\nWoodbury Police Chief Jason Posel said in a statement Wednesday that his department is \"disturbed by the preliminary information of what occurred\" and will investigate this incident to the fullest extent, while showing compassion to the students impacted.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

(AP) - An Arkansas police officer has been fired after he was caught on video beating a handcuffed inmate in the back of his patrol car, and the police chief says he will refer the case to prosecutors.\n\nJonesboro Police Chief Rick Elliott fired Officer Joseph Harris on Friday, the day after Harris was caught on his patrol car video punching, elbowing and slamming the car door on an inmate being transferred from a local hospital back to the county jail.\n\nElliott reviewed the video after receiving a complaint from the county sheriff's office about the incident. The department also posted the video on its YouTube page and announced the officer's firing.\n\n\"I was just shocked and appalled by (Harris') actions,\" Elliott told The Associated Press on Monday. \"Based on that conduct, I'm not going to have it and I'm not going put up with it, and immediately terminated him.\"\n\nA phone number was not listed for Harris, who had worked for the department for the past five years.\n\nBilly Lee Coram, the inmate in the back of the patrol car, is wearing a hospital gown and choking himself with a seatbelt wrapped his neck as the car is moving in the roughly 12-minute video. After the car pulls over, Harris opens the door and punches and elbows Coram several times in the face as he unwinds the belt.\n\nHarris later slams the car door against Coram's head. Elliott said he didn't know what injuries Coram sustained from the beating. Coram was being held at the Craighead County jail Monday on escape charges and was wanted on warrants from out of state.\n\nCoram had been taken to the hospital after he told jail staff he had ingested fentanyl and had escaped the hospital. Harris had caught Coram and put him in his patrol car.\n\nThe jail did not return a message Monday afternoon, and no court date or attorney was listed for Coram.\n\nElliott said he will be referring the case to the local prosecutor and was putting together paperwork in the coming days to send to the prosecutor. The county prosecutor did not immediately return a call Monday.\n\nElliott also said he had contacted the FBI 's Little Rock office about the incident and will ask the state to decertify Harris as a police officer.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

He nearly had his eye dug out of its socket and was repeatedly assaulted and almost crushed to death in a doorway by supporters of Donald Trump .\n\nHodges was a stalwart defender of people inside the Capitol on Jan. 6. He has since been unequivocal in stating what happened that day, taking on critics, trolls and detractors with a resolute calm and even a sense of humor.\n\nOn Wednesday, when HuffPost asked Hodges what he made of Trump's victory and the path ahead for the nation, his answer was succinct.\n\n\"I don't get it,\" he said. \"Immigrants voted to be put in concentration camps. Women voted to be breeding stock. Men voted for cruelty, malice, to abandon allies. People voted for someone who would see them never vote again. I don't understand people. It's going to be a cold January.\"\n\nHodges has no doubt about what he saw, heard or felt on Jan. 6. He has testified before Congress and in courts at length, including in Colorado, where a group of Republican voters sought to disqualify Trump from ever holding public office again. They had sued to remove Trump from the ballot this year, pointing to his remarks at the Ellipse on Jan. 6, as well as the sea of evidence in the public record already underlining his failure to quell the mob's attack on the Capitol for three hours.\n\nThe voters said Trump violated Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which bars anyone from service in office who took an oath to uphold the Constitution and then abandoned that sacred document by aiding an insurrection or providing comfort to the nation's enemies.\n\nAs HuffPost reported in March, a court in Colorado had initially ruled against challenges to Trump's eligibility for the ballot, finding that the office of the presidency was not something Section 3 considered. On appeal, the Colorado Supreme Court revived the case, finding Section 3 did apply to the presidency and, further, that Trump had engaged in insurrection, making him ineligible for future office. The U.S. Supreme Court, however, overruled that decision - and the rest is history.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Police Officers Who Defended Capitol From Trump's Mob Blast His Mass Pardon Of Rioters\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nWASHINGTON ― Current and former police officers who defended the U.S. Capitol from President Donald Trump 's mob on Jan. 6, 2021, were outraged Monday by Trump's mass pardon of the rioters.\n\n\"Today is another dark day in American history and a continuation of the stain that January 6th left on our nation,\" former U.S. Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn said in a statement. \"I am infuriated, but not surprised in the slightest. We can't pretend to be shocked because Trump has fulfilled his longstanding promise to pardon the criminals he incited to attack me and my fellow officers.\"\n\nThe Justice Department charged more than 1,500 people with crimes for attacking the Capitol that day, including hundreds for interfering with or assaulting law enforcement. Dozens of officers suffered injuries that day; five officers died afterward, one from a stroke and four by suicide.\n\nOn Monday, in one of his first acts as president, Trump offered clemency to all involved, commuting the sentences of 14 offenders who orchestrated the storming of the Capitol and offering \"a full, complete and unconditional pardon to all other individuals convicted of offenses related to events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021,\" according to a release from the White House .\n\n\"This is a miserable miscarriage of justice and erases accountability for the criminals who have done irreparable damage to our nation,\" Former Capitol Police Sgt. Aquilino Gonell said in statement. \"The scars of January 6, 2021 are seared in my mind and body, and I will never truly recover from the events of that day.\"\n\nDunn and Gonell have been outspoken critics of Trump for inciting the riot and pledging to pardon members of the mob. Dunn left the Capitol Police for an unsuccessful bid for a U.S. House seat in Maryland; Gonell said he left due to injuries sustained on Jan. 6, including to his shoulder and foot. Both have partnered with a liberal group called Courage for America to warn against Trump's embrace of political violence.\n\nCurrent D.C. police officer Daniel Hodges offered a more understated reaction to the pardons Monday evening.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Nation's Largest Police Union Likely To Endorse Convicted Criminal Who Released Cop Killer\n\nSenior White House Correspondent, HuffPost\n\nThe nation's largest police union appears to be on the cusp of endorsing for president convicted felon Donald Trump , who released from prison a cop killer subsequently convicted of a strangulation attack on his wife, and who salutes, praises and has promised to pardon domestic terrorists convicted of assaulting police officers at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThe Fraternal Order of Police is hosting the coup-attempting former president at its board meeting Friday in North Carolina, where an endorsement appears likely. The Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris , a former prosecutor and state attorney general of California, was not invited to the gathering.\n\n\"We are eager to see President Trump again after meeting with him at Mar-A-Lago earlier this year,\" FOP President Patrick Yoes said in a recent statement.\n\nNeither Yoes nor any of the members of its executive board responded to HuffPost queries about its expected endorsement of Trump, whose lies that the 2020 election was stolen from him led to 140 police officer injuries and five officer deaths from the Capitol assault that Trump incited in a last-gasp attempt to hang on to power.\n\nIn his final days in office, Trump commuted the life sentence of drug dealer Jamie Davidson, who was convicted of murder for his involvement in the shooting death of a New York state police officer in 1990. Following his release, Davidson was arrested in Orlando, Florida, and charged with battery by strangulation and domestic violence. A jury convicted him of a lesser battery charge in July, and he is now back behind bars.\n\nAn FOP employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said he was not certain how the union came to back Trump, despite everything he has done. \"To be honest, I'm not sure. You raise an important question, but I'm not sure.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung, asked how Trump had received the FOP's endorsement despite being a convicted criminal, responded: \"Kamala sucks.\"\n\nPolice officers who defended the Capitol from Trump's mob were livid about the union's support for Trump, who in May was convicted on 34 felony counts and is facing dozens more felony charges in other cases.\n\nMichael Fanone, a former Washington, D.C., officer who suffered a heart attack after being repeatedly shocked by a Taser as he fought Trump supporters on Jan. 6, said that the Fraternal Order of Police has never been there for him and other officers who were attacked that day. \"The truth is that FOP leadership is more interested in kissing the ass of a convicted felon who incites violence against law enforcement, then hails the perpetrators as 'heroes' and 'patriots' and promises them pardons,\" he said.\n\nHarry Dunn, a former Capitol Police officer who was also there on Jan. 6, said his former colleagues are \"appalled\" that the union is even contemplating backing Trump. \"The fact that the FOP is entertaining, let alone offering, a potential endorsement is a slap in the face to men and women who bravely defended the Capitol on Jan. 6.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign on Thursday held a conference call with Dunn and two sheriffs who are backing her candidacy to denounce the likely endorsement of Trump.\n\n\"He uses cops for nothing more than a photo-op or a television prop,\" said Javier Salazar, the sheriff of Bexar County in Texas. He pointed out that with his felony conviction, Trump wouldn't even be eligible to be a police officer.\n\n\"It looks like they're endorsing a person who wouldn't qualify to be a law enforcement officer in any state of the union that I'm aware of,\" Salazar said.\n\nTrump is scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 18 in New York City, where he was convicted in May on 34 counts of falsifying business records to hide a $130,000 hush money payment to a porn actor in the days ahead of the 2016 election. He could receive as much as four years in prison.\n\nHe faces four felony counts in federal court in Washington, D.C., based on the Jan. 6 coup attempt. He could receive decades in federal prison if convicted. Trump is also under felony indictment in Georgia for his attempt to overturn his election loss there. Conviction on the most serious charges could mean decades in Georgia state prison.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nPrograms that teach young people how to interact with police are popping up around the country. But they're often exercises in victim-blaming - shifting the responsibility for avoiding lethal stops from cops to the very civilians they brutalize.\n\nChicago police officers attend a graduation and promotion ceremony at Navy Pier on November 19, 2018 in Chicago, Illinois. Scott Olson / Getty\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nViolence is inherent to policing. As critic Kristian Williams notes , \"In the field of social control, police are specialists in violence. They are armed, trained, and authorized to use force ... Violence as well as the law is what they represent.\"\n\nStill, American police are particularly violent. In 2015, an article in the Guardian stunned many with its side-by-side comparisons of police violence in America relative to other countries. Iceland had one fatal police shooting in seventy-one years; Stockton, California had three in six months. Australia had ninety-four fatal police shootings between 1992 and 2011; the US had ninety-seven in March 2015.\n\nAnd the numbers have not improved since then. When adjusted for population, American police killed over two hundred times more people than UK police did in 2018. In Germany, where police are far more violent than in the UK, police killed twenty-seven times fewer people than their American counterparts.\n\nIn this lethal landscape, a number of programs have emerged in the US to teach young people about how to live in the world police create. \"I'm hoping the law enforcement officer will walk up, see this child doing exactly what the curriculum told them to do and think, 'I can relax. This child knows exactly what he or she is supposed to be doing,'\" Virgina House Rep. Jeion Ward told reporters after sponsoring a bill to require a course on interacting with police as part of drivers education. \"And perhaps, it will not escalate.\"\n\n\"Our number one goal is to teach children what they need to know to be able to live through the police stop and make it home safely,\" said David Miller, founder of the Dare to Be King Project in Baltimore. \"There is no silver bullet,\" he added, more pessimistically. \"There is no way you'll be able to determine whether or not the police will actually harm you, but if you can be respectful and humble you stand a better chance showing the officer you're not a threat.\"\n\nFive states - Texas, North Carolina, Virginia, New Jersey, and Illinois - now mandate some form of instruction on how to interact with police, either as part of the civics curriculum or drivers education. Four states - Missouri, Rhode Island, Mississippi, and West Virginia - are currently considering similar measures. Many school districts also now use informal instructional programs organized and run by police, public defenders, church groups, the ACLU, or other community organizations.\n\nThese programs are often pitched as a stopgap - a concrete way to equip young people with life-saving tools in a country where racism is intractable and structural reforms are elusive.\n\nYet there is a deep cynicism at work when police violence is treated as a fact of contemporary life that can only be mitigated through a series of subservient rituals. In fact, rather than fostering a less violent present and future, the programs end up shifting the onus for avoiding deadly interactions from police onto the very civilians they brutalize .\n\nThe realities of modern policing are nowhere to be found in the various policing curricula used by states and localities. In an instructional video that high school students in Texas are now mandated to watch, police officers are portrayed as a strikingly diverse group of men and women - a stark contrast to the state's overwhelmingly white and male police force.\n\nAn online course that Virginia now requires all Drivers Ed students to take notes that teens might have a bad attitude \"because they think police are singling them out based on their age or other visible characteristics for unfair treatment.\" The elephant in the room, racial discrimination in traffic stops, goes unmentioned. Later, the lesson provides four strategies \"that will ensure a safe and appropriate interaction with law enforcement officers,\" including \"staying calm and being respectful.\" Again it is silent on an obvious question: \"what do I do when the police choose to attack me?\"\n\n\"What we tell teens very strongly,\" explains Lt. Charles Wilson, chairman of the National Association of Black Law Enforcement Officers, a group that runs youth-outreach programs around Providence, Rhode Island, \"is that you want to be able to go home .... If you act crazy, you don't get that chance. Let the officer give you a ticket and you can go fight it in court. That's a lot better than being carted off to jail or worse.\"\n\nBrandon Holmes, who organizes teen workshops for the NYCLU, advises , \"You should tell police that you would like to remain silent. You should not just remain silent - that can be seen as a form of aggression.\"\n\nThe constant threat of violence , though unmentioned, hangs in the air. Police are understood as forces of nature, figures whose behavior can be slightly modified at best.\n\nAmong the \"Don'ts\" listed by Strategies for Youth in their presentation \"Be SMART with Police\" are items like \"Don't keep your hands in your pocket - take them out slowly,\" \"Don't make quick movements,\" and \"Don't question or mock an officer's authority.\" If you feel you were mistreated, do not bring it up to the officer - instead, file a complaint with the department later.\n\nA presentation used in the Midwest called \"Get Home Safely: 10 Rules of Survival\" instructs, \"Avoid physical contact with the police. No sudden movements, and keep hands out of pockets.\" And \"Don't, under any circumstance, get into an argument with police.\" Do not run, even if you are afraid and do not resist, even if you are innocent. Finally, they counsel: \"Stay calm and remain in control. Watch your words, body language and emotions.\"\n\nThere's a startling transference of responsibility here from the adult who is ostensibly trained for the encounter - the police officer - to the teenager. The burden of restraint is not on the officer, the one with lethal force - that is the business of the child. It is the very definition of blaming the victim.\n\nMany of these programs imply that their raison d'etre is as much about officer safety as about the well-being of the kids receiving the lesson. Texas's recently approved curriculum guide asks, \"Why should you place your hands on the steering wheel while the officer is approaching? A: For the officer's safety; it signals that you are not armed.\" Under the \"Driver Dos\" it warns that \"certain movements, such as reaching for required documents, could be interpreted as a threat to the officer's safety.\"\n\nThis inverts the actual danger present in any encounter with police. In 2017, the last year in which we have statistics, police killed 987 people ; police deaths caused by another person stood at forty-six. Police are twenty-one times more likely to kill civilians than the other way around.\n\nCivilians like Sandra Bland . In 2015, Bland was beaten by a Texas police officer during a traffic stop and later died in police custody. What do these programs have to say about her death? While Chicago police officer Yolanda Brewer acknowledges \"the officer went up to 10,\" she tells students during her presentation for NOBLE: if Bland had \"given him her license and insurance, she might be here with us today.\"\n\nSome students know a self-serving lesson when they see one.\n\nAt a 2017 presentation for teens in Baltimore put on by the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives (NOBLE) and sponsored by the Urban League, a sixteen-year-old asked the police officer , \"Since this kind of stems from police misconduct, are police officers being told how to interact with us?\"\n\nThe officer volleyed that police are trained how to interact with the community in the police academy, adding that if students \"show respect,\" it will go \"a long way in setting the tone for how the encounter will go.\"\n\n\"But throughout the morning session,\" a reporter for the Baltimore Sun noted, \"the students sought to relate their real-life experiences and stories of Baltimore police corruption or misconduct to challenge the lessons of obedience to police being put forward.\"\n\nNOBLE runs a similar program in Chicago, where the history of police violence creates a particularly fraught environment for pro-police lecturing. Students here do not need to point to the ACLU reports documenting racism in police stops, or the fact that the vast majority of police stops in the city do not lead to arrest, or that in half the stops the ACLU reviewed police either gave an unlawful justification or no reason at all. They can simply draw on their own experience.\n\n\"We were walking and they just pulled us over,\" two thirteen-year-olds at a 2015 presentation told reporters, recounting a recent police stop. \"They asked what we were doing. They put our name in the system. I don't need to have my name in the system with jailed people .... It just wasn't fair.\"\n\nPresenters for NOBLE acknowledged that their department has \"bad apples\" and gave students the canned response for what to do when faced with an abusive police officer: \"Cooperate at the time and file a misconduct report later.\" They declined to mention that 89 percent to 96 percent of police misconduct reports in Chicago are dismissed .\n\nAt Oakland schools, where the Alameda County public defender's office puts on its own presentation instructing teens how to interact with police, attorney Brendan Woods tells students to always remember the magic words: \"I have the right to remain silent\" and \"I want a lawyer.\" His co-presenter and fellow public defender Jennie Otis warns students that oversharing with police \"can quickly and needlessly escalate a situation.\"\n\nThis is sound legal advice, but in places like Chicago - where NOBLE advises students, \"Most of the time, you should answer the questions. Because if you don't, you're making something that could have been two questions worse\" - the hard realities of American policing inevitably intrude. This, after all, is the city where police commander John Burge ran a torture program on Chicago's predominately black South Side from 1972 to 1991. His program did not simply mete out beatings, but also designed torture instruments - most notably a device that sent out electroshocks when applied to the testicles - for the police to extract (often false) confessions. In 2015, the Guardian revealed that Chicago police operated a black site where seven thousand people were \"disappeared\" for off-the-books interrogations.\n\nAnd herein lies the core problem with these classes. None of them deal with the inherent power imbalance between a teenager and an agent of the state, who holds a monopoly on legitimized violence. \"This legislation does not empower young people, especially those living in brown and black communities,\" said Zellie Imani , a teacher and activist who opposed a recently passed New Jersey law mandating a police interaction course for students. \"Instead, it empowers law enforcement by allowing them to continue to evade accountability for abuse and misconduct while forcing the burden on the public.\"\n\nSome who run these programs have a genuine desire to curb police violence. But because they assume that radical changes to policing are impossible, we are left with a series of hacks and tips that they hope might, just might, prevent the police from killing more people. Suffused with the illusion, the comfort, of \"doing something,\" they forget the fundamental problem: as a student in Chicago summed it up at a recent event: \"We don't know what a police officer is going to do. They always have the upper hand.\"\n\nBrian Platt is an aerospace machinist who lives in the Seattle area.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Unions must step up and do the same today - because racial justice movements can't win radical reforms without the institutional power of organized workers.\n\nWorkers clean graffiti off of an entrance sign to the AFL-CIO headquarters that was vandalized during overnight unrest, June 1, 2020 in Washington, DC. Drew Angerer / Getty\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nAmong the many buildings torched this past week, one stands out as an odd target: the AFL-CIO headquarters in Washington, DC. While some have speculated that protesters set the lobby ablaze Sunday night because of the labor federation's failure to pursue racial justice with sufficient gusto, the more likely explanation is that protesters saw it as just another fancy edifice.\n\nThat's a tragedy. The headquarters of the country's most important labor federation should be widely viewed as a symbol of racial and economic justice. That the union hall was of no special importance to the people rebelling is an indictment of the AFL-CIO. As the DC area local of the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) put it in a press release yesterday, \"Why did young black and brown workers, frustrated with constant injustice, not view the AFL-CIO as their natural ally with over a century of experience in the struggle for equality? Why did they not recognize that act as burning their own house?\"\n\nSome unions, including the ATU, have given a glimpse of the best of American labor - one at the forefront of fighting all forms of oppression. In Brooklyn, when the police attempted to use a city bus last week to transport arrested protesters, the bus driver stepped off and refused to drive it. His union backed him up. In Minneapolis, after a rank-and-file bus driver declined to transport police , his ATU local issued a statement affirming members' right to refuse to assist police operations. The national Transport Workers Union (TWU), which represents workers from San Francisco to New York, issued a statement saying their drivers are under no obligation to act as police chauffeurs.\n\nAll of these workers and unions took their place in the long history of anti-racist action by organized labor in the United States. While far too many perpetrated or ignored racial injustice, some unions, particularly those connected to the socialist or communist left , threw themselves into struggle in a way that provides a model for today.\n\nIn 1946, immediately after World War II, New York unionists mobilized in support of the Ferguson brothers, four black men (three of them veterans) who were reuniting after the war in Freeport, Long Island. After being refused service in a white coffee shop, the men were attacked by a police officer who shot and killed two of them (and who was immediately commended by a judge and a district attorney for doing so). Along with the local NAACP, the Communist Party (CP), and other forces, progressive labor unions played a central role in the movement for justice in Freeport. The TWU, close to the CP at the time, led the way. At one rally, a TWU leader linked the struggle against police brutality to anti-colonialist movements, shouting, \"Freeport, my TWU, the struggles in India, they are all the same fight.\"\n\nIn those same years, New York City's CP-led Teachers Union (TU) also took on the police. An earlier investigation had revealed that more than four hundred New York City police officers were members of the Christian Front, a fascist organization founded by Father Charles Coughlin . Drawing links between antisemitism and anti-black racism, the largely Jewish TU campaigned for the mayor to fire police officers tied to the organization.\n\nIn Los Angeles, the postwar years also saw unions mobilize against police violence. In 1948, an LAPD officer shot and killed seventeen-year-old Augustín Salcido while arresting him for supposedly selling stolen watches. The citywide CIO council, a leader in the fight for justice for Salcido, immediately put out a statement: \"Mexican-American members of our union in the thousands can testify to the beatings, intimidations, shake-downs, uncalled for arrests and terrorism carried on by the police in the Mexican-American community in Los Angeles.\"\n\nThe head of the United Office and Professional Workers of America addressed a letter to the mayor on behalf of his members, demanding prosecution: \"If [the police officer] is not brought to account, this latest shooting will be a clear sign of official approval for terror against minority peoples.\" When the officer was acquitted, the city CIO led a delegation to meet with the chief of police, insisting that he fire the officer.\n\nMore recent examples also show how organized labor can commit itself to the struggle against police violence. In 2014-15, a number of unions signed on to the demands of Black Lives Matter (BLM) activists. National Nurses United linked police violence to racial health disparities. In California, UAW local 2865 urged the AFL-CIO to boot police unions from its ranks. The Communication Workers of America put out a statement in support of BLM (though a hedged one that also revealed the reticence of many union leaders to confront police unions).\n\nThe participation of labor unions in anti-racist struggles isn't just an ethical imperative. It's crucial to the success of the fight against police violence and racism, for at least two reasons.\n\nFirst, police unions are a central enemy of the movement on the streets. They fight for the most reactionary legislation, mobilize to defend members guilty of the most heinous crimes , and generally flaunt their disregard for civilian governance . However, in most cities and states, police unions are treated as members in good standing of local labor councils and federations. They often work closely with other municipal unions, from firefighters to teachers, to protect labor rights and municipal budgets. Given their size and power, most other city unions are wary of alienating them.\n\nThis is an enormous political problem. If the police are to be defunded and reined in, their unions need to be split off and isolated from the rest of organized labor. If police unions are able to maintain a common front with other city unions, they will almost certainly be able to resist any meaningful efforts to restrain them.\n\nEffecting a split will require action from union members themselves. In public worker unions in particular, members will have to push their organizations to identify publicly with the struggle against police brutality. Unions will have to go beyond mere statements and devote real resources to anti-racist struggle. These kinds of actions would widen the gap between cops and other city workers, rendering police unions politically isolated and more vulnerable to progressive reforms.\n\nSecond, it's still unclear where the power to force police reform will ultimately come from. While the tremendous energy put into restraining the police over the last seventy years has often raised public awareness of racial oppression, it has been much less successful in institutionally disempowering the police. Victories have been won against individual police, but few against the system itself.\n\nSignificantly weakening the police will require a tremendous amount of social power - overcoming not just the institutional power of police unions, but the capitalist city planners that support expanded policing. To confront those interests, the movement will need to mobilize far more extensive forces than have yet entered the field. It will need to be able to exert power not merely through necessarily brief acts of disorganized disruption, but through organized, nonviolent coercion against capital and the state.\n\nBuilding an alliance between labor and anti-racist struggles won't be simple or easy. Many unions are all too happy to align with police unions, while others will pass resolutions galore without any action to accompany them. But rank-and-file union members can push these institutions forward even when their leaders would rather they remain stationary. As the fires inevitably begin to cool, and the question of where the movement goes next arises, these workers are one group that could provide an answer.\n\nPaul Heideman holds a PhD in American studies from Rutgers University-Newark.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

After months in prison, Tennenbaum spoke to Jacobin about Georgia's crackdown on civil liberties.\n\nActivists hold a rally and a march through the Weelaunee Forest on March 4, 2023, in Atlanta, Georgia. (Andrew Lichtenstein / Corbis via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nOn January 18, Georgia State Patrol troopers murdered Manuel Esteban Paez Terán, a nonbinary Afro-Venezuelan activist who went by the name \"Tortuguita.\" An independent autopsy concluded that Tortuguita had been shot more than a dozen times while they were sitting cross-legged with their hands up and their palms facing their body. Months later, the state's autopsy established the precise number of shots, fifty-seven, and confirmed another key finding from the independent autopsy: Tortuguita had not fired a gun, as officers claimed. Their death was ruled a homicide.\n\nTortuguita's killing is the most horrifying event to come out of the state's suppression of the Stop Cop City movement, which has occupied the Weelaunee Forest in southeast Atlanta since late 2021 to protest a $90 million police training facility and a new movie studio, Blackhall, the city plans to build there. The facility earned the nickname \"Cop City\" because it is set to include a mock city block, where police could hone militarized tactics to deploy against a city that activists say is already the nation's most surveilled .\n\nAs of this summer, the state has charged forty-two protesters with domestic terrorism and three Atlanta Solidarity Fund organizers with money laundering. In most cases, the evidence was comically flimsy: the protesters had mud on their clothes, apparently proof that they had vandalized construction equipment, and the solidarity fund had provided reimbursements for \"totes,\" \"forest cleanup,\" and \"yard signs,\" supposedly code for unspecified illegal items.\n\nIn April, Stop Cop City activist Charley Tennenbaum was distributing flyers in the neighborhood of Jonathan Salcedo, an officer involved in Tortuguita's murder. When police stopped Tennenbaum (who is nonbinary), they say they had no idea that they were about to be thrown in jail, interviewed by the FBI, and charged with felony intimidation of a police officer and stalking - all for putting up flyers.\n\nAfter a two-and-a-half-month incarceration that included stretches in twenty-four-hour isolation, Tennenbaum is currently out of jail and spoke to Jacobin assistant editor Tadhg Larabee about disenfranchisement in Atlanta, fighting back against the climate crisis, the free speech implications of their case, and the potential for them to serve up to twenty years in prison if convicted.\n\nWhat drew you to the Stop Cop City movement?\n\nAtlanta has been my home for the last decade. When this movement was beginning, it interested me because I saw just how many intersecting institutions and issues were coming together to create this perfect storm. You have stolen Muscogee land that was then a plantation, and that was then the Old Atlanta Prison Farm. And now they're trying to make that into Cop City and Blackhall Studios.\n\nThese two megaprojects are threatening this area of land, which was recognized through city government and the parks and recreation department as a green space that was supposed to remain dedicated as such. It's land that is immediately surrounded by a historically black, poor, and working-class neighborhood. Because this area is in unincorporated DeKalb County, it's not represented on the city council. They don't even get to have a say in this.\n\nWith climate change, the Weelaunee Forest is also essential ecological infrastructure. That area floods badly already. If the trees are removed, it will flood even more. If you look at future climate change migration models, Atlanta is one of the main places in the South where people are going to go. So what we do now really matters not just right now, but for the future of Atlanta.\n\nWhat do you think that this massive investment in policing, if completed, would mean for the residents of the surrounding area and Atlanta more broadly?\n\nThis police training facility, otherwise known as Cop City, will have a fake apartment complex, a fake grocery store, a fake convenience store, a fake gas station - replicas of the spaces where many of us live and interact with each other in the city and on the streets. And this facility is designed to meet people who are trying to exercise their right to those streets in a way that is increasingly militarized and threatening, with police brutality already on the rise.\n\nCop City is a couple miles south of a university. And it's in an extremely black lower- and middle-income area. That's who they're targeting with this immediate presence.\n\nIf you look at Atlanta more broadly, this is very connected with what's happening in Buckhead in north Atlanta, a much higher-income neighborhood. In the past, when there were people on the streets demanding change, the people of Buckhead got scared, and so they've been threatening to secede from Atlanta. Part of Atlanta mayor Andre Dickens's motivation to push for Cop City is to convince Buckhead to stay in Atlanta, because Buckhead residents are worried about crime and are incredibly important to the tax base.\n\nSo the project is not only doubling down on oppression, but also serving the interests of the higher class. At the same time, it serves private interests, as you see with the Atlanta Police Foundation, a powerful nonprofit that supports the Atlanta Police Department with donations from Delta Air Lines, Home Depot, Wells Fargo, and other large corporate sponsors. The Stop Cop City movement and the broader Defend Weelaunee Forest movement have really exposed the major forces that decide how we live together in cities - I think it's important that we continue winning, because so much is at stake in Atlanta.\n\nTalk about the specific circumstances of your arrest. What happened?\n\nOn April 28, two friends and I were on our way to go camping, and we had flyers to put in Jonathan Salcedo's neighborhood to try to raise awareness for what he did on January 18, when he was involved in killing Tortuguita.\n\nWe were avoiding confrontation. My friend was driving, I was flyering, and our other friend chose nonparticipation. It was the middle of the day, we weren't hiding, and I was doing my best to not break the law. Opening a mailbox is a felony, but putting things on the exterior of a mailbox is not illegal - so we did not open any mailboxes. We committed no acts of aggression. We had a fun time. We were just riding around, singing songs. It was a beautiful day.\n\nWhen we were leaving town, an officer recognized our van, and we were detained for about an hour. The cops were on the fence about what action they wanted to take with us; one cop was like, I can understand how it's [protected by the] First Amendment to speak about things like this, but you can't do that in a neighborhood. I think that's false - you can exercise your First Amendment rights in a neighborhood.\n\nThen, one of the police officers got off the phone and said that the FBI wanted to talk to us, so we were being arrested. It was the FBI's decision ultimately to bring us in.\n\nWe went through the intake process. We tried to settle in for what we knew was about to begin, but you can never really know. After we were held separately for a long time, I was asked to come to this other room where there was an FBI and a Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent. They did not identify themselves until I asked who they were. They wanted an interview with me.\n\nThe FBI agent tried to be intimidating, saying that I was facing serious charges. He would not explain what those charges were. And then he asked for my consent for an interview. I pointed out that I had no lawyer there, so I absolutely had zero interest in an interview. And then it was over.\n\nAt that point, it was unclear what was going to happen. We were still hopeful that it was going to be a quick turnaround.\n\nThen I was brought to an isolation room, and it was not explained why. It was around midnight at this point; we were arrested around 4:30 p.m. When I woke up the next morning, it sunk in that I was in isolation. Normal isolation is twenty-three-hour lockdown with one hour of access to a kiosk, a phone, and socialization. But for some reason I was put in double isolation, which is twenty-four-hour lockdown, with twenty-four-hour lights. At no point did I resist arrest, and I complied with the medical intake requirements. I felt very targeted. As the days went by, no one would really give me information.\n\nI was trying to file a grievance, because the Bartow County Jail's inmate handbook says that if an inmate is in an area without access to a kiosk, then the inmate can request a paper grievance form from the guard on shift. When I asked for this form, the guard said she didn't have to do that. After I went to medical, because I was having some health problems while I was in isolation, the guard took pity on me and looked it up and there was nothing entered in the system as to the reason for my being put in isolation. Isn't that funny?\n\nThat Monday was our bond hearing, and we were all denied bond very quickly. The grounds for being granted bond were not even discussed; the magistrate judge just kicked the case up to the superior court level. I got sent back to isolation, with no information about when I would be getting released from there, if at all, which was very hard.\n\nEventually, I was brought into the general population. That meant that I had access to not only my support crew on the outside, but to people on the inside and much better living conditions, which made my time there more endurable. I did end up submitting a grievance on the kiosk asking why I was put in double isolation. Here's what I was told: \"The deputies were told to keep you separate from your codefendants. We were waiting until we were told it was all clear for you and your codefendants to be populated out of administrative segregation. They were just following orders.\"\n\nAdministrative segregation is typically only for inmates who have done something violent; we could have all been put in the general population and kept separate. I will be bringing that up in my countersuit, because I think that that is cruel and unusual punishment, and there's no justification that they can provide for why that was at all necessary.\n\nThe second bond hearing at the superior court level was then held on May 17, and my two codefendants were granted bond. I was not. State prosecutor John Fowler seemed very motivated to make me into a boogeyman, talking about the \"dark web\" and how I got reimbursed for some art supplies, which they portrayed as very dangerous.\n\nIn the state of Georgia, the rules of evidence don't apply to bond hearings. So prosecutors can say things that are verifiably not true, as long as they string together a scary-sounding story. In particular, they claimed that Defend the Atlanta Forest is designated by the Department of Homeland Security as a domestic violent extremist organization. But the Department of Homeland Security has said - on paper, twice - that they've not designated it in any way.\n\nThat was the same claim cited in the warrant to raid the Atlanta Solidarity Fund, which led to three arrests, right?\n\nExactly right. This lie is still being passed around in a lot of the legal dealings that the state uses to bring politically motivated oppression down on the movement, which does not give me confidence in funding [the state's law enforcement] more. This sort of behavior is exactly why we don't want to fund Cop City.\n\nIts budget, which was originally going to be $60 million, is now apparently going to be $97 million. That could be going toward providing housing, access to food, better education, job security, and medical care. There are so many alternatives that we could be funding with that money.\n\nThe charge they eventually brought against you was \"felony intimidation of an officer of the state.\" What do you think the free speech implications are of construing flyering as felony intimidation?\n\nIt's sort of funny, because at first the charge was \"felony, statute pending.\" They wanted to get me with something, but they didn't know what. And then it was \"felony intimidation of an officer of the court.\" But Salcedo is not a court officer; he's a Georgia State Patrol trooper. They had filed under the wrong statute. So they landed on what it is now, which is \"intimidation of a police officer.\" That carries a twenty-year maximum prison sentence.\n\nTo me, this is an attempt to criminalize something that should undeniably be a right: raising awareness about things that we believe are wrong and deserve to be handled in a more public forum, so that we have a better chance of getting justice.\n\nWhen you are close to police brutality, it motivates you to fight, because you know that it could happen to anyone. And this violence is, of course, falling along classic lines of oppression. Tortuguita was Afro-Venezuelan. If an increasingly militarized police state can commit acts of brutality like they did on January 18 and it goes unchallenged, then that kind of oppression grows. This is a time, not just for Atlanta, but for anyone who stands to benefit or be harmed by these institutions, to act.\n\nThe Supreme Court case New York Times Co. v. Sullivan clearly allows for public, heated debate concerning government officials. I strongly believe that I'm entirely within my First Amendment rights to be critiquing what those state patrol troopers did. It's ironic that I am raising awareness about an injustice - murder - and yet I'm now the one facing twenty years in prison.\n\nI'd also like to talk about the domestic terrorism charges that forty-two other protesters are facing. In effect, they criminalize certain actions simply because they occurred at a protest, which seems to raise obvious free speech issues.\n\nGeorgia expanded its domestic terrorism law in 2017, after Dylann Roof murdered nine members of a black church in South Carolina. And now, what was originally designed with the outwardly facing intention of protecting marginalized people is being used to further oppress marginalized people.\n\nLook at who's facing these domestic terrorism charges: by and large, we're the kind of people who live on the margins. A lot of us are queer, a lot of us are trans, a lot of us are coming from different communities of color.\n\nWe all are aware that we live in one of the most important times in human history, and the choices that we make can change that path that we're on. Climate collapse is happening right now. Some people have succumbed to not just climate denial, but climate nihilism: the belief that we can't change anything. I don't think that's the case. Our movement is trying to build something different, and we need to be able to use our freedom of speech when we disagree with the state's actions.\n\nMy protest was perfectly legal. What I'm wondering - and what I'd like to ask Prosecutor Fowler or anyone in the FBI - is how I'm supposed to engage in my civil duty to disagree with my elected officials if exercising my legal rights is going to be treated as illegal.\n\nI have been a registered voter in Atlanta since 2014, and I think that it's in the state's interest to recognize that freedom of speech is absolutely to be protected and defended.\n\nRight now, the citizens of Atlanta are organizing a petition to put a referendum on the next election's ballot about whether Cop City should go forward. It seems like the state is trying to preemptively shut that down with a federal court filing that refers to the referendum campaign as \"invalid.\" How do you think that fits into their broader strategy of repression?\n\nThe strategy of repression is the phrase here. Whenever there's been an arrest, the only thing more absurd than it is the next thing that happens - for example, going from charges of criminal trespassing in a public park to allegations of domestic terrorism in the span of half a year. Now, forty-two people are facing domestic terrorism charges and upward of sixty or seventy are facing other charges.\n\nThe referendum campaign has been really wild. Originally, they asked for seventy thousand signatures from people who were registered as Atlanta voters during the previous election cycle. If they weren't registered but could qualify as a voter, their signatures didn't count. In addition to that, because Cop City and the Weelaunee Forest are surrounded by unincorporated DeKalb County, local residents don't get to participate in the City of Atlanta referendum. There are many layers of exclusion.\n\nThe figure of seventy thousand signatures represents 15 percent of Atlanta registered voters. When Andre Dickens was elected mayor during the 2021 election cycle, he still only got the votes of around 11 percent of Atlanta registered voters. Before our referendum can even get on the ballot, we need to get the support of more people than he did. Seeing those numbers relative to each other shows that this is an extremely absurd standard in addition to being exclusionary of DeKalb [County].\n\nFederal courts have granted us a deadline extension and ruled that DeKalb County residents should be able to collect signatures, although the city is fighting both these decisions in court. It seems like even if we hit the seventy thousand threshold, the city will try to stop the referendum from appearing on the ballot.\n\nAgain, the question is, how are we supposed to engage in protected civil dissent when this is how it is treated?\n\nWhat's next for your defense?\n\nOf course, I want the charges to be dropped. But if I am indicted and go to trial, I believe that we would win. And that would be a wild gift - an opportunity to contribute to the modern case law around exercising First Amendment rights.\n\nI enjoy witnessing the state disagreeing with itself as to how these charges are being handled - watching the DeKalb County [district attorney] drop out of their portion of the forty-two domestic terrorism charges and say that all the domestic terrorism charges should be dropped. On the same day, the head of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation stepped down. That's powerful.\n\nIt would be great if my charges were dropped, but if I go to trial, then I'll win.

But troubling incidents - including fatal shootings by police officers in the state - during her time as California's \"top cop\" suggest that wasn't always the case.\n\nWhen Kamala Harris was California's attorney general, she did not investigate the fatal shootings of two unarmed men by the same Anaheim police officer less than a year apart.

The new bill was named for George Floyd, who was killed in May 2020 by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who had previously used fatal force and had a history of misconduct complaints. Among other things, the legislation would create a grant program for state attorneys general to assist them in conducting independent investigations in police misconduct cases.\n\nIn the lead-up to the vote, Vice President Kamala Harris, who spearheaded similar legislation in the Senate with Cory Booker in June, lauded the bill on Twitter.\n\n\"The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act represents an important step towards ensuring more accountability and transparency in policing,\" she tweeted. \"I join [President Joe Biden] in encouraging Congress to pass this legislation and get it to the President's desk.\"\n\nBut Harris was not always so eager to scrutinize officers' behavior or push for attorney general reviews of police misconduct when she was California's top law enforcement official, documents reveal.\n\nThe Daily Poster has found that when Harris was California's attorney general, she did not investigate the fatal shootings of two unarmed men by the same Anaheim police officer less than a year apart, despite calls from the city's mayor and members of the public following the second. Instead, she left the task up to the Orange County District Attorney's office, which was embroiled in a misconduct scandal and notorious for letting officers off the hook.\n\nAt the time, Harris suggested her office would review the findings of the district attorney's office, but the Daily Poster found no evidence that a serious review of the DA report ever took place. The Anaheim police officer, Nick Bennallack, remained on the force for years - and went on to kill again.\n\nThe City of Anaheim has already had to spend several hundred thousand dollars in lawsuit payouts over Bennallack's conduct; a civil rights lawsuit filed late last year over his latest killing is still ongoing.\n\nHarris has enjoyed a trailblazing career in politics. In January, the Los Angeles Times even started a beat dedicated to her historic rise to the White House. The fifty-six-year-old politician of Jamaican and South Asian descent has already written herself into the history books as the first woman to serve as San Francisco district attorney, California attorney general, and now vice president of the United States. She was also the first black person to have represented California in the US Senate. Now, she is one heartbeat away from the presidency and could be a serious future presidential contender, too.\n\nBut as remarkable as Harris's career is, it has not been without controversy. During her 2020 presidential run, Harris attempted to paint herself as a progressive prosecutor, but critics pointed out that she had embraced the mantle of California's \"top cop\" and done little as DA or attorney general to challenge law enforcement power structures, instead pursuing low-level offenses like truancy and drug possession .\n\nHer reluctance to push for more police accountability appears to have extended to failing to investigate an officer with a troubling record at a time when doing so could have prevented killings down the line.\n\n\"She neglected a lot of cases in California,\" says Genevieve Huizar, the mother of Manuel Angel Diaz, one of the men subsequently killed by Bennallack. \"Why she didn't get involved in these shootings, I don't know.\"\n\nThe first unarmed man in Anaheim that Officer Bennallack killed was Filipino-American father Bernie Villegas.\n\nVillegas had been shooting a Red Ryder Daisy BB rifle in the parking lot of his West Ball Road apartment complex with a friend on January 7, 2012. He had bought the toy as a present for his fourteen-year-old son, who was inside. A neighbor had called the police, warning about a suspected drug dealer loitering with a gun. Bennallack was one of the responding officers. When they arrived, they found Villegas leaning against the gun, holding it from the barrel.\n\nThe officers ordered him to show his hands. Villegas complied but did not let go of the barrel of the BB gun. Bennallack unloaded five rounds without warning . Officers would say they thought the toy was a shotgun.\n\nSeven months later, Bennallack killed again.\n\nHe and another officer were on patrol in Anaheim near the 700 block of North Anna Drive on July 21, 2012, when they found twenty-five-year-old Manuel Diaz leaning into a car window in an alleyway. Bennallack did not recognize Diaz , court records say.\n\nThe officers ordered everyone to stop what they were doing, but Diaz fled. The officers would later say they suspected criminal activity based on his baggy clothes, location, and behavior. Bennallack gave chase briefly before drawing his service weapon and shooting Diaz twice - once in the buttock, once in the back of the head - outside a nearby apartment complex. Video shows that as the young man lay dying on the ground, Bennallack applied handcuffs rather than administer aid. Diaz later died at the hospital.\n\nThe Orange County DA noted in its report that Diaz was a \"self-admitted\" gang member with prior gun and drug convictions, and had drugs in his system at the time, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals would later decide in a lawsuit on the matter that such information had \"marginal, if any\" relevance to liability and damages in the case.\n\nThe report also noted that the incident occurred in a so-called \"Safety Zone.\" The City of Anaheim was in the controversial practice of issuing \"gang injunctions,\" designating whole blocks as quarantine zones where even mundane activities were restricted. Officers were also empowered to add names to a database of supposed gang members without oversight. Civil liberties advocates pointed out that removing names from that list was nearly impossible and that black youth, in particular, were targeted.\n\nHuizar, Diaz's mother, described the hole his death left in her family, noting it stripped her of her youngest child and only son. She cannot talk about what happened without tears nine years later.\n\n\"He's laying on the ground and they turn him over with a bullet in his head and they handcuff him,\" she says.\n\nBennallack would later claim that he saw Diaz reaching for his waistband and throwing an object nearby during the chase that he thought had been a gun. The only item found near the scene was a cell phone. The next day, another Latino man, Joel Acevedo, was fatally shot by Anaheim police. The two killings were the latest in a string of fatalities by police in Anaheim, a city probably best known as the home of Disneyland. The deaths sparked widespread protests and riots in the city, some of which were met with force by law enforcement.\n\nIn the wake of the turmoil, Bennellack earned a pejorative nickname: \" Backshot .\"\n\nIn 2011, Harris became California's attorney general. She'd run on her bonafides as San Francisco district attorney prosecuting violent crimes and crimes against children, and focused on her past as the daughter of two civil rights activists who \"spent full-time marching and shouting about this thing we call justice.\" Harris would tell reporters that the heroes for her of the civil rights era were the lawyers.\n\nHarris had a chance to seek justice the next year.\n\nThe July 2012 shootings and subsequent unrest sparked a scramble for accountability in Anaheim. While the Office of the Orange County District Attorney would investigate the incidents, as was routine for police shootings, the Anaheim city council asked the Office of the US Attorney and the FBI to conduct independent investigations into the matter and hired the Office of Independent Review (OIR), a contractor that looks into police departments, to examine its police force.\n\nAnaheim mayor Tom Tait also asked Harris's office to conduct an independent review of the most recent two shootings. At the time, Tait told the press , \"Whatever the truth is, we will own it.\" The national Latino advocacy group Presente.org echoed Tait's appeal to Harris in a petition with more than seventeen thousand digital signatures.\n\nTait and the public had valid reasons for asking Harris's office to get involved. In 2000, California became the first state to grant its attorney general the authority to intervene in law enforcement misconduct cases. Legal experts say such interventions can offer a greater level of scrutiny and objectivity than other kinds of police audits.\n\nReviews by local district attorneys are often seen as unreliable since the attorneys work closely with law enforcement in ways that could create conflicts of interest. And while the Department of Justice has authority under the 1994 crime bill to conduct reviews of potential systemic police abuses, such investigations have limitations . The agency lacks the power to subpoena internal documents from local police departments and has been hobbled by chronic underfunding.\n\nCalls mounted, therefore, for Harris to investigate. Protesters gathered outside her Sacramento office. Huizar was among them, demanding justice for her son.\n\nAt first, the efforts appeared successful. In July 2012, four days after Tait's request, the mayor told the Orange County Register that the attorney general had agreed to investigate the shootings.\n\nBy October, however, Harris's office suggested the investigation might not happen.\n\n\"We are advised that the Orange County District Attorney's office is conducting a thorough examination into all of these incidents. Once that review is completed we can best evaluate what if any involvement by this office is appropriate,\" her office's press secretary Lynda Gledhill said .\n\nSpeaking to the New York Times in August 2020, Tait recalled receiving a phone call from Harris two days after he asked her to intervene, denying his request.\n\nIn March 2013, the district attorney's office released its report on the shootings, finding Bennallack was justified in shooting Diaz.\n\nEvidently, Harris's office was satisfied with the DA's findings. A Daily Poster public records request with the California Office of the Attorney General turned up no records of any investigations or findings related to the Villegas, Diaz, or Acevedo shootings. Nor did it turn up any communications related to the shootings between the attorney general's office and the Anaheim Police Department, the local DA, or the Office of the US Attorney.\n\nAdditionally, a public records request to the Orange County DA's office yielded no records of communications between them and Harris's office.\n\nSimilarly, the FBI declined to conduct a full investigation into the shootings, telling OC Weekly that it planned on merely reviewing the DA's report. The Daily Poster 's public records request to the DA turned up no records of communications with the Office of the US Attorney over the killings.\n\nThe OIR's report , released in 2015, recommended several changes to Anaheim Police Department policy, including shortening the forty-eight-hour waiting period to interview officers after shootings and updating rules regarding police pursuits.\n\nDiaz's family, meanwhile, filed a lawsuit against the city and the police department over his shooting. After the DA's office released its report allowing Bennallack to remain on the force, the attorney representing the family, Dana Douglas, told reporters she believed the officer would likely repeat his behavior.\n\n\"Unfortunately someone like Nick Bennallack, with a nervous disposition and a quick trigger finger, can get onto the Anaheim Police Department and nothing happens, said Douglas. \"He's out there today ready to shoot a third victim.\"\n\nTwo years after the Diaz killing, Bennallack, who had been moved to the SWAT team, was involved in a third fatal police shooting. He was of five officers who shot and killed Steen Thomas Parker. Parker was white and engaged in a firefight with officers. Parker had previously been arrested for rape , according to the Orange County DA report, which cleared Bennallack and his colleagues of any wrongdoing in the shooting.\n\nIn April 2019, after Harris had moved from attorney general to US senator, Bennallack fatally shot another unarmed Latino man. Thirty-year-old father Daniel Ramirez III had been at a garage where Irvine police were attempting to serve a search warrant for theft of guitars and amplifiers from a vehicle. The situation had led Ramirez and another man to barricade themselves in an attic. That's where they were when members of the Anaheim SWAT team - including Bennallack - arrived.\n\nBody cam footage released by the Orange County DA shows that Ramirez and the other man initially refused to come down while officers fired pepper balls into the attic. The men threatened to shoot back, but soon Ramirez's colleague surrendered to police without incident.\n\nAfter a twelve-minute standoff, Ramirez relented and descended from the attic, pleading with the officers not to shoot him. While he was out of view of the officers' body cameras, according to the district attorney's later review of the incident, Ramirez then refused to surrender and instead turned to run deeper into the garage. At that point, an officer fired a nonlethal round that struck Ramirez in the right lower back. In the footage, Ramirez is heard screaming in pain. Seconds later, Bennallack is seen firing four live rounds in rapid succession. After a brief pause, he fired a fifth time.\n\nParamedics attempted to revive Ramirez, but could not save him. He was unarmed, although two loaded weapons were found elsewhere in the garage according to the Orange County DA.\n\nFor Ramirez's younger stepbrother Levi - who asked to be identified as Levi Ramirez Dixon because \"he's my step-brother but he feels like blood\" - the killing is raw and unforgivable.\n\n\"Everyone in our family is missing a part of their heart because they've lost Daniel,\" he says.\n\nDixon acknowledges that Ramirez struggled as he got older, and had done time in jail. He says he once saw Ramirez with a gun, but never thought of him as dangerous. He says Ramirez loved his daughter \"more than anything,\" and the six-year-old girl has taken the loss of her father hard.\n\nLast June, Dixon and his family marched on the Anaheim Police Department. Dixon had hoped to talk to Bennallack, but when they arrived, the building was barricaded and nobody came outside.\n\n\"It was almost like a second death,\" he says.\n\nDixon says he has lost complete faith in law enforcement and does not want to call the police for help again.\n\nOnce again, the Orange County DA's office cleared Bennallack for killing Ramirez. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who succeeded Harris and is now Biden's nominee for Health and Human Services secretary, did not appear to investigate the matter, as his office told the Daily Poster it had no records regarding any investigation.\n\nIn each of Bennallack's three killings of unarmed individuals over eight years, the local district attorney's office cleared him of all wrongdoing, and the attorney general's office never once got involved.\n\nWhen state legislation came up in 2014 that would have required the attorney general's office to conduct independent investigations into police shootings, Harris spoke out against the bill on the grounds that it took prosecutorial power away from local district attorney offices.\n\n\"I don't think it would be good public policy to take the discretion from elected district attorneys,\" she said .\n\nBut in the case of Orange County, the district attorney's office might not have deserved Harris's deference.\n\nAt the time, the office was helmed by Tony Rackauckas , who was described in 2018 by ACLU attorney Brendan Hamme as \"one of the most scandal-ridden and criticized government figures in California.\"\n\nThose scandals included a systematic jailhouse snitch scheme and the practice of routinely withholding evidence from defense attorneys.\n\nThe jailhouse-snitch revelations came to light in 2011, causing a judge to recuse the entire DA's office from the death penalty case of Scott Dekraai, the man behind Orange County's worst mass shooting - a decision Harris's office unsuccessfully appealed . As OC Weekly put it , the scandal led to at least twenty felony cases in the office being tainted by the hint of corruption. Harris's office would eventually launch a probe into the scandal in 2015. That ended four years later under Becerra without explanation .\n\nOne of the figures at the center of the affair, Dan Wagner, was the same assistant district attorney who twice helped clear Bennallack of wrongdoing, first by signing off on the Villegas shooting report , then by authoring the subsequent Diaz shooting report . In December 2019 , Wagner left the DA's office amid further scandal. Internal whistleblower complaints alleged he had engaged in covering up misconduct .\n\nThe 2019 shooting report clearing Bennallack in the death of Ramirez fell to a different assistant district attorney: Andrew Bugman. He, too, has been caught up in the controversy. Bugman defended the concealment of impeachment materials related to the jailhouse-snitch scandal by Rackauckus's successor, DA Todd Spitzer.\n\nIn 2017, a jury awarded Diaz's family $200,000 over his death, finding that Bennallack had used excessive force in the shooting. A year later, however, in a lawsuit brought by the family of the first man Bennallack killed, Bernie Villegas, a jury found in favor of the police.\n\nFederico Sayre, the attorney who represented Villegas's family in that case, told the Daily Poster that the Orange County DA's office \"always\" clears police officers in shootings and that it's very difficult to get a jury to rule in favor of victims' families.\n\nA review by the Daily Poster of 253 incident reports listed on the Orange County DA's website in which someone was either shot by police or died while in police custody between January 2010 and March 2020 found that prosecutors cleared the law enforcement personnel involved every time.\n\nBennallack is no longer employed by the City of Anaheim, according to Sgt Shane Carringer. Carringer said he could not provide other information about Bennallack, but noted the separation occurred months ago.\n\n\"I don't think it's quite been a year,\" Carringer said.\n\nMoving forward, all incidents similar to those in which Bennallack had been involved will be investigated by the state's top prosecutor. In September 2020, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill into law requiring the state attorney general to investigate all fatal police shootings of unarmed individuals.\n\nBecerra, like his predecessor Harris, opposed the idea. He called an early version of the bill \"untenable and unreasonable\" due to the monetary cost to his office.\n\nThe same month the bill was signed, Ramirez's family filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against Bennallack, the City of Anaheim, and the City of Irvine over his death. Dale Galipo, the lawyer behind the case, was the same civil rights attorney who represented Diaz's family.\n\nResponding to an inquiry whether or not he felt the state's justice system had failed Diaz and Ramirez, Galipo gave a one-word answer: \"Yes.\"\n\nHuizar, Diaz's mother, works to find strength in family and religion. But she says she will bear the pain of losing her son for the rest of her life.\n\n\"You kinda have to live life without him, but he was a really good son,\" she says, her voice breaking. \"He was just the light of our family.\"\n\nHuizar usually avoids politics and never considered Harris particularly responsible for her family's pain. But given Harris's lack of response to her son's killing when she was attorney general, the vice president's recent posturing as an advocate for police accountability strikes her as hypocritical.\n\nHarris, she says, \"should have done a better job.\"\n\nYou can subscribe to David Sirota's investigative journalism project, the Daily Poster , here .\n\nWalker Bragman is a journalist and JD whose work has been featured in Paste Magazine , the Intercept , HuffPost , the Independent , Salon , Truthout , and the Hill .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

When Nichols was taken out of his vehicle, his protest was simple. \"I didn't do anything,\" he can be heard saying in police body camera footage.\n\nLess than an hour later, Nichols was en route to the hospital, having suffered a police beating that would ultimately claim his life. In the aftermath of Nichols's death, the Memphis Police Department disbanded the Scorpion unit that was designed to target crime in the city's poorest neighborhoods.\n\nIt is also, now, considering limiting how and why police can make traffic stops - a familiar municipal response to a brutal episode of police violence in a country where, according to data from Mapping Police Violence, police have killed more than eight hundred people following traffic stops since 2017. The victims of that violence have, like the victims of all police violence in the United States, been disproportionately black. In the aftermath of particularly high-profile police killings, like that of Patrick Lyoya in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Daunte Wright in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, and Nichols in Memphis, media outlets like the New York Times and the BBC have run stories asking the same basic question: What is it about traffic stops that causes them to turn deadly?\n\nThere are several possible answers. Police officers and criminologists, for example, often blame the prevalence of violence following traffic stops on police training that frames those stops as inherently unpredictable and dangerous for officers. The notion that traffic stops are especially dangerous for officers isn't conclusively backed by data: an estimate published in the Michigan Law Review three years ago pegged the rate at which officers are assaulted during routine traffic stops at just one in every 6,959 stops, and the rate at which they're feloniously killed at just one in 6.5 million stops. But police trainings haven't adjusted.\n\nAnother view is simply that police interactions are always dangerous, particularly for people of color, whether at traffic stops or anywhere else. Traffic stops just happen to be the primary way the general public interacts with police officers. \"Traffic stops turn violent because the act of policing is rooted in force and violence,\" Woods Ervin, communications director for Critical Resistance, told Jacobin .\n\nThe police officers who beat Nichols have been charged with second-degree murder, but they're anomalies. The New York Times surveyed four hundred cases in which a police officer killed an unarmed motorist; of all those cases, only five officers were ever convicted of a crime - even though the Times found that police officers making traffic stops all too often unnecessarily escalated confrontations with motorists and then shot them in \"self-defense.\"\n\nTraffic stops have long played an outsize role in American policing. Akhi Johnson, director of the Reshaping Prosecution Initiative at Vera, told Jacobin that this is no coincidence.\n\n\"Not only are police trained that those are stressful situations, they are also trained to use them as investigative tactics to try to ferret out evidence and that traffic stops are this incredible public safety tool,\" Johnson said.\n\nJohnson, a former assistant US attorney, said that traffic stops fall into two categories: what police officers describe as \"must-stop\" situations, where a person is driving recklessly or endangering the safety of other people on the road, and \"can stop\" situations, where a person is not endangering anyone's safety but an officer decides to pull them over anyway for a reason often tenuously related or completely unrelated to public health.\n\nPretextual stops, in which officers pull over drivers for a minor traffic-related infraction in order to investigate them for an unrelated offense, fall into the latter category - and it's those stops that disproportionately impact people of color and low-income neighborhoods. A study of fourteen years of traffic stop data in North Carolina found that black drivers were 95 percent more likely than white drivers to be pulled over and 115 percent more likely than white drivers to be searched during a stop, even though searches of white drivers more often uncovered contraband.\n\n\"The real damage in that is if you're a driver, and you were speeding way over the limit and you get pulled over, you get it - you know you weren't supposed to be doing it [and] it doesn't tend to impact your perceptions of law enforcement,\" Johnson said. \"When you aren't doing anything wrong and you get pulled over time and time again, it erodes your trust in law enforcement, it erodes your trust in government, and that makes all of us less safe.\"\n\nJohnson's claim has empirical backing. A recent study conducted in Tampa found that getting stopped by police makes a person less likely to vote - a point that Ervin argues underscores how policing, like the rest of the carceral system, is used as a method of exerting social control and effectively excluding certain groups of people from the democratic process.\n\nIn few places was that clearer than in Ferguson, Missouri, in the lead-up to the killing of Michael Brown. A study conducted by the St Louis nonprofit Better Together found that court fees made up a quarter of Ferguson's budget, giving police officers an effective imperative to pull drivers over in a scheme that former St Louis alderman Antonio French described as \"taxation by citation.\" In 2013, the year before Brown was killed, 86 percent of police stops in Ferguson and 92 percent of searches were of black people.\n\nThere is an emerging consensus in major cities that these \"can stop\" traffic stops aren't doing anything to improve public safety. San Francisco is one of a number of cities that have recently moved to limit the circumstances under which officers can make pretextual stops - banning officers from making stops for low-level offenses like driving without working taillights or driving with an item hanging from a mirror. The San Francisco order also limits when officers can ask to search a person's vehicle or ask investigatory questions following a stop to when they have concrete evidence of criminal activity.\n\n\"The overall goal is to be smart about how we use the limited law enforcement resources that we have,\" Max Carter-Oberstone, vice president of the San Francisco police commission, told Jacobin . \"A huge volume of our stops are for low-level offenses that don't pose any threat to people on our roadways, and for which we are not recovering guns, drugs, or making arrests. These stops are just a horribly inefficient use of our law enforcement resources.\"\n\nPhiladelphia and Pittsburgh have also passed laws limiting the use of pretextual stops. Minneapolis two years ago began exploring the creation of an unarmed Traffic Safety division that would take traffic law enforcement away from the city's police department following public safety logic popularized during the 2020 Black Lives Matter uprising; Berkeley has attempted to institute a similar plan but has thus far been stopped by California state law.\n\nA handful of national politicians are beginning to pick up the picture as well - a bill introduced in the US House by Rep. Ritchie Torres of New York would establish a $100 million annual grant program for cities that reassign traffic law enforcement to unarmed officers or technology. The fact that police unions in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia are fighting limitations on their traffic stop powers suggests in itself that the stops serve a purpose aside from public safety.\n\nWhether or not reassigning the work of policing away from police would make a decisive long-term impact remains to be seen. But if limiting the police officers' ability to make arbitrary stops is important because it limits their ability to spin those stops into other charges and fines, it's also important because there is scant evidence that any other sort of police reform measure effectively cuts down on police violence. The officers who beat Nichols were all black. They wore body cameras. They were armed, but they didn't use their guns. None of it mattered.\n\n\"Police are trained to read the need for force in most situations,\" Ervin said. \"That is actually core to what their function is. It's the actual act of policing that leads to the violent police encounter. Yes, it's the cops, but more it's doing cop work.\"\n\nAbe Asher is a journalist whose reporting on politics, social movements, and the climate has been published in the Nation , VICE News , the Portland Mercury , and other outlets.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Many come from working-class backgrounds.\n\nYet on the beat, police come in contact with - to question, to arrest, to brutalize - the most disadvantaged. This presents a problem for radicals. If the Left stands for anything, it's worker emancipation and labor militancy. But police and others in the state's coercive apparatus, workers themselves in many respects, are the keepers of class society. Their jobs exist to maintain social control and protect the status quo.\n\nThe introduction of unions to this portion of the state raises additional concerns. Can \"coercive unions\" ever advocate for the broader working class, rather than members' narrow self-interests? Or are police unions irredeemably reactionary?\n\nIt's easy to focus on the individual over the institution. Not a few police officers are drawn to the profession out of a desire to \"serve the public.\" Many genuinely want to serve, and take great pride in their chosen occupation. Police don't have to enjoy breaking up protests; they don't have to be racists or hate homeless people. But once they decide to do their jobs, institutional exigencies overwhelm personal volition. When there's mass resistance to poverty and inequality, it's the cops who are summoned to calm the panic-stricken hearts of the elite. They bash some heads, or infiltrate and disrupt some activist groups, and all is right in the world again.\n\nSuch is the inherent defect of law-enforcement unionism: It's peopled by those with a material interest in maintaining and enlarging the state's most indefensible practices.\n\nIt's hard to imagine how it could be any different. Chicago teachers, exemplifying the kind of social-movement unionism that defends the working class broadly, organized the community before their strike by trumpeting a vision of equitable education. The Left cheered. How could anything similar be achieved by prison guards? A police strike would appear to signal an incipient authoritarianism, cops untamed by democratic dictates. How could empowering police - increasingly militarized and shot through with a culture of preening brutality - yield anything but stepped-up repression? How could the traditional socialist goal of worker self-management result in anything but a dystopia of metastasizing prisons, imperious cops, and Minuteman-esque border-patrol guards? The best we can hope for from police, it seems, is passivity.\n\nAs Kristian Williams documents in Our Enemies in Blue , professionalized policing arose in the United States amid urbanization in the 1820s and 1830s. Controlling \"dangerous\" classes (principally of the industrial working variety), more than ameliorating any pronounced spike in crime, was the reason for its formation. The institution had its roots in slave patrols, which were established to control the behavior of slaves - the \"dangerous\" classes of that day.\n\nIn the late 1800s, when more workers bandedtogether to improve their situation, elites once again blanched. Police broke up strikes, confiscated pro-labor newspapers, and arrested radicals. States like Pennsylvania set up forces to deal with labor stoppages. Free speech and free association were subordinated to private property.\n\nIn this respect, little has changed. The activist who is doing anything of value expects to be under surveillance, and is on the lookout for agents provocateurs . Where capital is concerned, cops are custodians, and the First Amendment is flotsam.\n\nOther subtler - primarily ideological - forms of policing have long existed. The police officer, border patrol guard and corrections officer only step in when abstract injunctions need to be made tangible. When all attempts to modify citizens' behavior have failed, they appear - to intercept undocumented immigrants forced from their home countries by Global North-favoring trade agreements, to watch over incarcerated drug dealers from deindustrialized wastelands. When they exercise their power, it's far from subtle; they are the state's monopoly on violence incarnate. And they have a vested interest in seeing their power increase unchecked.\n\nWhen police unions have widened their gaze beyond issues like compensation and working conditions, it's been almost exclusively to advance conservative ends. \"Police,\" as Williams puts it, \"organize as police , not workers.\"\n\nThey've bitterly opposed civilian review boards (and, if established, have sought to undermine them). They've fought the placement of names and badge numbers on officer uniforms. They've resisted rooting out police misconduct. \"The modern police union movement,\" criminologist Samuel Walker argues , \"originated largely in reaction to the civil rights movement and its criticisms of police conduct during the 1960s. . . . Any local unions originated or at least became more militant in response to specific police-community relations initiatives in the 1960s.\"\n\nAnd police unions aren't even the worst actors.\n\nIn the hovel of coercive unionism, the California prison guards union (the California Correctional Peace Officers Association) is the leader. The organization has long defined itself as separate from the mainstream labor movement. Politically, the California prison guards aren't wedded to the Democratic Party, and institutionally, they're not affiliated with either of the nation's labor federations. The association has proven its ability to parlay mass incarceration into increased political power, membership, and dues. They bankroll \"victim's rights\" groups, they fight anti-incarceration referenda, they funnel millions to Democrats and Republicans who adopt law-and-order stances.\n\nWhen tougher sentencing became the new norm several decades ago, the organization was small - membership totaled about five thousand, and their budget didn't crack a half a million dollars. They now represent more than thirty thousand correctional officers. In 2008 alone, they spent nearly $5 million to elect sympathetic candidates and, more importantly, to defeat a ballot measure seeking to reduce the prison population through treatment instead of incarceration. Other prison-guard unions have benefited from the prison boom, but none have been able to capitalize on the carceral state as well as the CCPOA. The union looks at the marginalized and sees an opportunity for enrichment.\n\nTwo of the CCPOA's ideological cousins are the National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) and the National ICE Council. Unlike the CCPOA, the two are inhabitants of the House of Labor - they're member unions of the American Federation of Government Employees, which is affiliated with the AFL-CIO. On immigration, however, they've bucked the federation's pro-reform line (a line that has already conceded far too much to the Right).\n\nAbove all, both organizations are interested in more enforcement - despite the Obama administration's deportation of undocumented immigrants at a faster rate than any previous president. The two groups' preferred term for undocumented immigrants is \"illegal aliens,\" of course. ICE Council President Chris Crane, the New York Times wrote in June, has been \"the most frequent witness on Capitol Hill during this year's immigration debate and the favorite expert of conservative critics of the Senate measure.\"\n\nOn top of trying to scuttle any path to citizenship, the border-patrol union has resisted efforts to restrict its violent mandate. \"If you don't throw rocks at Border Patrol agents,\" the NBPC's charming vice president said in November , \"you won't be shot.\"\n\nThere are counterexamples - including, ironically, among police in apartheid-era South Africa.\n\nIn the 1980s, black police officers in that country were enforcers of their own subordination. Internally, they were mired in low-level positions and lacked collective-bargaining rights; externally, they couldn't arrest whites, yet had to quell unrest that threatened to topple the racist Afrikaner government. Economically desperate and typically lured from rural areas by the promise of a paycheck, some, having coarsened once on the force, patrolled restive townships unsympathetically.\n\nRevolutionary organizations and community members urged black police to join the struggle for liberation. In September 1989, they got their aggrieved dissident - Gregory Rockman, a slim, mustachioed lieutenant in a Cape Town suburb. The thirty-year-old lambasted the riot police - \"a pack of wild dogs,\" in his estimation, that \"feasted on the people\" - and said he sought \"a whole new era of police in South Africa [and] to assure the public they are not enemies but protectors.\"\n\nThe next month, Rockman presided over the establishment of the Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union (POPCRU) - the first real trade union in South Africa, according to the sociologist Monique Marks.\n\nTheir first demonstration resulted in the arrest of Rockman and twelve others. Membership mushroomed, but so did management repression. Cops who tried to join were suspended or fired, meetings were broken up by tear gas, and members were bludgeoned with batons. With resistance came solidarity. \"The sight of policemen in uniform singing freedom songs and shouting anti-apartheid slogans touched off popular demonstrations of support,\" scholar Gavin Cawthra wrote in his 1993 book Policing in South Africa .\n\nIntimately linked to the African National Congress, conceived in the crucible of anti-apartheid struggle, the POPCRU's infancy was a study in social-movement unionism. On their website, they still trumpet their devotion to \"advancing the working-class struggle within the criminal justice system.\"\n\nBut there's cause for skepticism. Can an established amalgamation of police and prison guards really advance the working-class struggle? Collective bargaining has been won, apartheid has been vanquished. No longer is the POPCRU, in Marks' words, a \"dissident grouping.\" What, then, distinguishes this \"civil rights union\" from a standard US police union? For Marks, this seems to be the wrong comparison. Just as the POPCRU functions as a \"watchful eye\" that propels the attenuation of police authoritarianism, so too can black political associations drive reform.\n\nThe US equivalent group would be the National Black Police Association . They oppose the death penalty, support affirmative action, and condemn police brutality. They aim to \"to be the conscience of the criminal justice system, and to enhance the quality of life in the African-American community.\" But the group does not unequivocally oppose the unconscionable War on Drugs, a caging frenzy so colossal that the US now imprisons a larger percentage of its black population than South Africa during apartheid .\n\nFounded in 1972, just a year after Nixon launched the War on Drugs, the NBPA has been an anemic force for pacification. Over the same decades, the war has ravaged communities of color, the number of racial minorities and women on the beat has increased substantially, and the NBPA has been the \"conscience of the criminal justice system.\" That the increased presence of women and minorities on the force - laudable, no doubt - hasn't fundamentally lessened the country's system of social domination should sober enthusiasts of police reform.\n\nTo its credit, the AFL-CIO staked out a strong position against mass incarceration this year. In September, at the federation's quadrennial convention, federation president Richard Trumka called it \"a betrayal of the American promise.\" He said, \"the practice hurts our people and our communities, it keeps wages low, it suppresses democracy, and we can't afford to imprison so many people. Nor can our families, our communities, or our country afford the loss of productivity of these people.\" Trumka's forceful statement, and the related resolution, were notable in that the federation's largest union, AFSCME, counts prison guards among its members. No doubt mindful of this tension between social justice and narrow self-interest, the resolution chiefly indicted the private prison industry, charging \"our nation's profit-driven justice system [with] producing a level of mass incarceration that is anything but just.\"\n\nAdmirable as the resolution was, it's likely purely rhetorical, at best a suggestion that locals linked to the prison industrial complex change their tack. The AFL-CIO's organizational structure is such that the federation has about as much power to compel an obdurate affiliate to change its behavior as a parent does with a grown child. As the AFL-CIO's constitution states , member unions \"are affiliated with, but are not subordinate to, or subject to the general direction and control of, the Federation.\" The late journalist Robert Fitch believed this inscribed corruption in the very structure of organized labor. Corrupt or not, the independence of locals unquestionably constricts the federation's ability to steer coercive unionism in a more constructive direction.\n\nSocialists, recognizing the contradictions of the democratic capitalist state - by turns securer and seizer of freedom - can simultaneously love Medicare and loathe the NYPD. We recognize that, through struggle, workers have secured the occasional spot on what Marx called the executive committee of the bourgeoisie. Pro-labor liberals are in more treacherous territory. Unable to navigate the nuances and paradoxes of the public sector, their anti-austerity message is, \"Don't cut the jobs of teachers, firefighters, and police officers.\" For them, the function of all three occupations is identical: to serve the public good.\n\nPro-labor liberals see a revanchist Tea Party and cuts in food stamps, and crouch to defend a monolithic state. They see a dying labor movement in which the number of union workers in the public sector now eclipses those in the private sector, or some cops standing against GOP attacks on collective bargaining rights, and they believe the police are their natural allies.\n\nBut they overlook whose class interests are served when police are dispatched, as compared to other government workers. Teachers teach, cops serve capital. The homeless man arrested for public intoxication has been treated more punitively than the Wall Street trader whose avarice breeds homelessness. This is the system the police, prison guards, and the border patrol maintain.\n\nBecoming agents of progressive change would require that unions in these occupations negate their own power, that they work toward their own abolition. Absent this development, parochialism seems to be the only model that's realistic in the here-and-now. Bargain for decent salaries and benefits. Accept the constraints that communities and elected officials impose. Act as professional associations, constituted strictly to advance member interests rather than social change or class struggle. Meanwhile, workers and organizers under the same union umbrella - AFSCME, primarily - can place internal pressure on their coercive counterparts in the hopes of smoothing out their worst traits.\n\nBut allies? Hardly. The cop who rallies for collective bargaining today will be protecting Goldman Sachs tomorrow.\n\nShawn Gude is Jacobin 's associate editor.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

But powerful police unions have closed ranks behind the killer, in a backlash that shows French cops' refusal to accept even basic accountability.\n\nFrench riot police officers stand guard next to a burned-out trash bin during a demonstration against police in Marseille, southern France on July 1, 2023.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThis Tuesday, Nahel, a seventeen-year-old of Franco-Algerian origin, was shot and killed by a police officer during a traffic stop in the Paris suburb of Nanterre. The young man's death - and footage of the scene that looks to many like an execution - has set off a powder keg nationwide. For the last few days, major urban areas and small regional cities alike have seen a wave of protests, rioting, and looting. Many commentators are comparing the events to the 2005 uprising that followed the death of two men of color as they were chased by police north of Paris. On Thursday, thousands attended a march in Nanterre alongside Nahel's family and anti-police violence activists. As of Saturday, upward of two thousand people have been arrested, with hundreds of police officers injured in the clashes.\n\nKicked off by Nahel's killing, this has morphed into a revolt against policing and its role in the broader exclusion faced by minorities in France. It's feeding off the accumulated experience of many forms of harassment and daily violence by the police, from cheap verbal abuse (of which just about everyone I spoke to at Thursday's march seemed to have a story) to the industrialized use of minor-offense fines against working-class communities of color. France's strict laws regulating statistics make it very difficult to collect concrete information on the effects of racism. But a 2017 report from France's Rights Defender, a public watchdog, suggests that young men perceived as black or Arab are twenty times more likely to be stopped for an ID check than French people perceived as white.\n\nThese are the facts. Yet it's difficult to get past the impression that France is woefully ill-equipped for confronting the death of a young man like Nahel - or the unavoidably political meaning of the revolt that has resulted from it.\n\nQuick to condemn the actions of the officers caught on videotape in the hope of calming tensions, Emmanuel Macron and his government have just as rapidly acceded to the Right's calls for swift clampdown. Upward of forty-five thousand police officers were deployed across France on the night of June 30 to July 1, and the interior ministry is starting to deploy forces trained to engage with anti-terrorist interventions. Some of these units have been seen wielding live-action weapons like shotguns.\n\nThe government has so far resisted these calls, but Marine Le Pen is calling for a nationwide state of emergency. This would effectively ban protests and gatherings and authorize measures like curfews, stay-at-home orders, and special detentions of individuals. In certain suburbs, curfews have already been put in place, while parts of the transport network in the Paris area have been closed earlier in the evening than usual.\n\nThere's nothing surprising about intolerance for rioting, of course. But what's revealing is the speed with which a social revolt has been buried beneath the trappings and rhetoric of another right-wing civilizational battle. Macron has spoken of the nefarious effects of violent video games.\n\nThere's also a second force at play: France's powerful and restless police unions, who have turned this crisis into a test of loyalty for Macron and his government. After footage of Nahel's killing contradicted initial claims of self-defense by the officer who fired the lethal shot, police unions were up in arms over the critical statements coming from Macron and his ministers.\n\n\"Our colleague was strung up to the whipping post in order to buy peace and calm rioters who are attacking the republic,\" Davido Reverdy of the National Police Alliance union told Le Monde . He also criticized the fact that the officer was detained, and the announcement by prosecutors that he had been placed under investigation for homicide.\n\nBut this dissent radically escalated on June 30. On the eve of the fourth night of action, the National Police Alliance and the National Union of Autonomous Trade Unions (UNSA) released an inflammatory press statement threatening the \"wild hordes\" and \"pests\" taking to the streets - and an unconcealed warning to government officials.\n\n\"All means need to be deployed to restore the rule of law as quickly as possible,\" the two unions declare:\n\nNational Police Alliance and UNSA Police assume their responsibilities and want to alert the Government that once this is behind us, we will be mobilized and that without concrete measures of legal protection for the Police Officer, an appropriate penal response, and consequential resources, Police Officers will be the judge of the level of consideration that ought to be given in return.\"\n\nSome elements of this are very cryptic - others less so. \"Today, the police are engaged in combat because we are at war,\" the communiqué concludes. \"Tomorrow, we'll be in resistance and the government needs to be aware of that.\"\n\nAre the police unions demanding that the government bury any criminal charges against the officer who shot Nahel? Are they claiming the right to use forms of lethal force beyond the tear gas, rubber bullets , and other forms of officially nonlethal dissuasion usually deployed?\n\nThe two organizations have walked back on their claims, suggesting that it has been blown out of proportion, but critics on the Left have read in this bombastic message a shot at the justice system and France's elected government. But for now, Macron and Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin have sought to downplay it all, dependent as they are on these forces to get through the coming days and weeks. \"I'm not here to squabble,\" Darmanin said on TF1 in response to a question about the open letter. \"These are not my words.\"\n\nBut these are not the isolated ramblings of a fringe faction within the police ranks. Union elections held in late 2022 had the bloc formed between the National Police Alliance and UNSA Police emerging as leading representatives of a profession that boasts a massive, 90 percent unionization rate.\n\nAnd neither is it the first example of police restlessness. In May 2021, France's police unions organized a large rally in front of the National Assembly in Paris, demanding more resources for the police forces and an end to what they deemed the laxity of the justice system. \"The police's problem is with the justice system,\" said National Police Alliance secretary Fabien Vanhemelryck before the thousands of officers and supporters at the rally. During the 2022 election season, the unions were behind a push to consecrate a presumption of \"legitimate self-defense\" for officers who make use of force. When Macron deigned to speak of the problem of racism and violence in French policing in late 2020, they called for a boycott of ID checks and searches .\n\nPart of what's driving today's revolt is the outsized role that the police forces have acquired in French life. This addiction took root well before the current presidency, but Macron has come to depend on it more than perhaps any of his predecessors. And the horrifying irony now is that he's falling back on forces openly calling to warp the separation of powers and act over the heads of elected officials. All in the name of \"republican order.\"\n\nHarrison Stetler is a freelance journalist and teacher based in Paris.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

The show vividly captured the failures of American policing that would animate the George Floyd protests 20 years later.\n\nStill from The Shield . (FX)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nAmericans love cop shows. In fact, about 20 percent of all scripted network TV shows are about law enforcement. And while most of these programs follow the same tired premise of honorable characters doing their best to catch the bad guys while balancing the stressors of family life, there is one cop show that stands out from the rest.\n\nOriginally aired in 2002, FX's The Shield turned the boilerplate cop show on its head. Unlike the prestige television show The Wire, a more pensive and high-brow offering that premiered the same year on HBO, The Shield followed the format of shows like Law & Order and NCIS - except instead of unquestioningly valorizing police work, it centered on Detective Vic Mackey and his corrupt, anti-gang \"Strike Team\" as they rampaged through the streets of Los Angeles. What made The Shield different from its contemporaries was its explicit focus on the dark side of policing. Throughout the show, Mackey breaks every law on the books, including but not limited to drug dealing, torture, planting evidence, illegal searches and seizures, and murder.\n\nThough twenty years old, the Emmy-winning series shines a light on two facets of modern America that still plague the country today: our punitive and ineffective policing model, and the authoritarian hysteria of the \"war on terror.\"\n\nThe Shield was inspired by the illicit actions creator Shawn Ryan saw while shadowing the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) for his much rosier cop show, Nash Bridges. \"What I saw [during the ride-alongs] was much darker,\" Ryan told Entertainment Weekly in 2017.\n\nRyan's pilot script was based on the Rampart scandal , which the Los Angeles Times called \"the worst corruption scandal in L.A.P.D. history.\" In September of 1999, Officer Rafael Pérez was caught stealing a million dollars of cocaine from an evidence locker. He agreed to a plea deal and began to reveal widespread corruption throughout the department. When the dust settled, Pérez had fingered close to seventy police officers in crimes such as bogus arrests, false confessions, perjured testimony, the planting of evidence, and more. According to Pérez, these practices were most frequent among the city's anti-gang units, the inspiration for Mackey's Strike Team.\n\nMembers of the Strike Team torture suspects, plant evidence, deal drugs, are openly racist, have sex with suspects, and steal with absolute impunity. The Shield's title card - the theme song \"Just Another Day\" playing over an image of a fractured police badge - leaves little room for interpretation. The show's perspective is that violent and often extralegal control of Los Angeles's minority and poor neighborhoods is routine for the officers of the LAPD. The show's second episode, titled \"Our Gang,\" poses a side-by-side comparison of the funerals of a gang member and a police officer, drawing explicit parallels between the lawbreaking groups.\n\nIn addition to portraying flagrant disregard for civil liberties and procedural justice, The Shield illustrates the inherent inability of American policing to solve the problems it claims to - indeed, how the cops often make things worse. In one of the most memorable scenes of the show, the new police captain gives a speech to her officers, stating: \"We can't solve poverty, we can't solve addiction. But we can distinguish between the criminals and the citizens.\" Such words echo the viewpoint of activists critical of policing, who have long claimed that armed police are unable to solve the actual underlying problems that cause crime.\n\nNot long after this speech, The Shield shows officers seizing cars and houses from suspected (but unconvicted) criminals to fund the hiring of more cops and the purchase of military-grade weaponry for Mackey's Strike Team. When a black officer protests that taking a single mother's house will put her and her children onto the street where they are destined for a life of crime in order to survive, the captain dismisses him, saying, \"I don't care what skin color you are. But you're either blue or you're out.\"\n\nThe Shield also captures the widespread fear of the post-9/11 years, and demonstrated how it was weaponized by the state both at home and abroad. Though it is exclusively set in Los Angeles, there's no shortage of references to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In a later season, the Strike Team gains a member nicknamed \"Army,\" who teaches the others abusive tactics he learned \"going door to door in Baghdad.\"\n\nThe pilot episode shows Mackey torturing a suspect in an interrogation room under the watch of his captain. It only escalates from there, as he burns, beats, and threatens to send suspects to prisons where they will be raped and killed by other inmates. He even has a secret remote torture site where victims are suspended from chains, an image strikingly similar to those seen in the American torture camps at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay.\n\nOn this point, however, The Shield errs. The portrayal is stomach-turning, but the problem is that in the world of the show - unlike in real life, where confessions extracted under torture are often false - it actually works. Like many other American films and series of the time, it seems to suggest to America that torture, while perhaps immoral, is at least a viable method for \"getting the bad guys,\" whether they're low-level drug dealers or high-level al-Qaeda operatives.\n\nNevertheless, The Shield captures the hysteria of the war on terror period, showing how rational thinking and proportionate responses were dismissed in favor of groupthink and maximal force. In one episode, a minor gang member claims affiliation with al-Qaeda, bringing the Department of Homeland Security on to the case, demonstrating the broad reach of the post-9/11 anti-terror apparatus.\n\nAgain, however, the show reveals its limitations. In the final seasons, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) makes an appearance as the cutting-edge face of federal law enforcement, offering an alternative to the brutal tactics of the LAPD. One wonders whether the writers would have shaped that storyline the same way today, after mass protests against ICE have convinced many that it's not a necessary agency, but is instead a heavy-handed expression of American xenophobia and anti-immigrant paranoia.\n\nIt's not clear that Ryan himself really understands the implications of The Shield. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly , Ryan claimed that \"98 percent of the time Mackey is doing the right thing.\" This will come as a surprise to anyone who watches the show, as 98 percent of every episode consists of Mackey's Strike Team breaking the law. In other interviews, it seems that Ryan was setting out to dramatize the warts on an otherwise noble project to \"protect and serve.\"\n\nBut whatever its creator's own intentions, The Shield vividly captured the depravity and brokenness of American policing. In the aftermath of the George Floyd protests of 2020, it looks less like a case for tossing bad apples than a condemnation of the entire enterprise.\n\nJoe Mayall is a writer from Denver, Colorado.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIn 2020, the mass demonstrations that exploded across the country over the police murder of George Floyd spurred a nationwide reckoning on race and an outpouring of promises from politicians to enact policing reform. In the intervening years, however, little in the way of policing in the United States appears to have changed. Last year, for instance, over 1,100 people were killed by police.\n\nIn his new book, After Black Lives Matter: Policing and Anti-Capitalist Struggle , political scientist Cedric Johnson explores the origins and consequences of what he calls stress policing, or the style of law enforcement that emerged out of \"broken windows\" initiatives in the carceral expansion of the 1980s. Johnson argues that, contrary to popular conceptions, policing in the United States is not primarily an expression of antiblackness or white supremacy, but rather functions to secure the conditions for perpetual capital accumulation, in large part by managing a surplus population that is increasingly multiracial. \"Police violence,\" he writes, \"is not meted out against the black population en masse but is trained on the most dispossessed segments of the working class across metropolitan, small town and rural geographies.\"\n\nAnd while \"Black Lives Matter\" has been a powerful rallying cry in the streets, Johnson further demonstrates that the focus on racial disparities among victims of police violence tends to detract from the creation of the kind of majoritarian political coalition that will ultimately be necessary to roll back the carceral state. In an interview with Jacobin , he discusses his new book and offers a perspective on how working people - and the labor movement in particular - can collectively contest police violence.\n\nIn 2020, a lot of leftists were hopeful that the George Floyd protests would be a transformative moment for the country. Unfortunately, since then, police violence in the United States doesn't seem to have abated at all.\n\nYou've long argued that while Black Lives Matter is, in many ways, an understandable response to the phenomenon of stress policing, it's also inherited many of the limitations of postwar racial liberalism. What are some of these limitations, and how should we understand police violence today?\n\nA blind spot of Black Lives Matter and adjacent notions like the New Jim Crow is the tendency to view police violence as an exclusively black problem, and a problem that universally threatens black people.\n\nThe response I've given repeatedly is that policing is not primarily about \"controlling black bodies.\" What we are witnessing is a problem that's actually much bigger and more daunting: We have a problem of a society that's by and large abandoned welfare provision and has instead decided to address the desperately poor and the dispossessed through policing. As a society, we've come to manage surplus population through punishment rather than benevolence.\n\nI've been reflecting a lot on my own experiences and the journey of how this book came to be. I've thought about this subject matter since I was a teenager, having grown up in Louisiana amid the carceral expansion, and then protesting capital punishment as a freshman in college. As a nineteen-year-old, I was already taking younger black males to visit one of Louisiana's prisons, where we talked to wardens and inmates and former gang members.\n\nSo I've been thinking about this subject for a long time, and as I've been listening to the Black Lives Matter rhetoric and engaging with peers and participating in demonstrations, a lot of the rhetoric seemed off the mark. There's been a lot of hyperbole regarding who the main victims of police violence are; who's most affected by it. On the one hand, the Black Lives Matter rhetoric motivates people to get into the streets and has helped force the issue into public conversation. But it also distracts from the fundamental motive of policing.\n\nWhen we take a serious look at the victims of that violence - when we look closely at who they are and what their lives are like - a different set of conclusions emerges or should emerge for us.\n\nWhenever there's a violent incident involving a black civilian, on one side, you've got the Fraternal Order of Police and Blue Lives Matter types who try to demonize the victim: they pull out whatever bad things they can find about the person or bring up their criminal record and so forth. On the other side, activists try to suppress that information in order to humanize the victim, and instead talk about the great things the person did, whether he was a parent, an honor roll student, a devoted friend, and so on; details that allow us to see them as a whole person, not just a victim.\n\nAnd both sides are actually right, but for the wrong reasons. We should be able to say, \"These human beings did not deserve what happened to them; it was unjust.\" But we should also be clear that many of them were involved in survival crimes and criminalized forms of work, or maybe just lived in places where those were the dominant aspects of the economy.\n\nSo I think there's a way to avoid both the right-wing response and the liberal response. We need a genuine left analysis of society as it exists. We have to identify the common hardships that many people are facing, the circumstances that force people to engage in activities that are targeted aggressively by police and our courts system. Black Lives Matter opens the door to important public debate, but it also points us in the wrong direction.\n\nI think there are a number of leftists who would agree that policing is about controlling a surplus population, but might then say that a racial framing is still necessary for understanding the problem, because the surplus population is racialized, or is disproportionately black and brown. Is this a useful way of resolving some of the tensions between the so-called race analysis and the class analysis?\n\nGoing back again to my own experiences, when I was a teenager during the Reagan-Bush years, it was black civil rights organizations, black ministers, and black students who were some of the first people to contest the carceral expansion of the 1980s and '90s, even though we weren't calling it mass incarceration at that moment. Hip-hop artists too - think back to all the various protest anthems that came out of the '80s. This formative framing of the policing problem as one of enduring racism really shaped how we thought about the problem and has at times constrained us.\n\nI think it was Milton Friedman who once said that whenever there's a crisis, people reach for the ideas that are lying around. That was certainly true of the carceral expansion in the '80s and early '90s, and with cases like Rodney King. It looked like racism, it sounded like racism, and it acted like racism, so that's what it was. But at the same time, that interpretation emerged primarily from the urban theater and was trained on a particular set of experiences and incidents within cities.\n\nBut right now, as [the political scientist] Marie Gottschalk and others have pointed out, with the opioid crisis, we've seen that demography shift, and many popular analyses of policing and incarceration haven't really kept up with those changes. There have been reductions in the numbers of black men who have been incarcerated, and at the same time, increases in the numbers of working-class whites.\n\nThis actually contradicts a quip I hear repeated over and over, which holds that the crack-cocaine crisis was met with aggressive policing, but we've treated the opioid crisis as a public health crisis. That pop narrative is usually offered as evidence of a racial double standard, but in the process, it gets both historical crises and their pernicious effects on the working class dreadfully wrong. The numbers Gottschalk cites suggest that both periods have been defined by punishment more than state benevolence. So we're at a point now where we have to think beyond the urban theater.\n\nI get a version of this question at every talk that I give on this. Somebody always gets up at the end and says, \"I understand what you're saying about class. But what about race?\" And this is sometimes tough for people to appreciate, but the reality is that throughout American history, the vast majority of people who are poor in this country have always been white. At the height of AFDC [Aid to Families with Dependent Children] payments, the majority of recipients were white (though the popular image of the welfare recipient was a black person, thanks to Ronald Reagan and others). And even if we're talking about blacks and Latinos as a plurality of people within a surplus population, those people are still different from the rest of African Americans who have jobs, bank accounts, credit cards, mortgages, and possibly savings; people who are somewhat upwardly mobile in the economy. I think we have to ask what's to be gained by ignoring the fact of common conditions facing the most oppressed elements of the working class of all colors.\n\nIt's not only important on an intellectual level to get this story right. It's also important politically if we're trying to build a left majority. If we're concerned about inequality and the damage that capital does to society - to our lives and our neighborhoods and communities - then we should be looking at what's happening to everybody, not just the people who live in our immediate vicinity, or what correct political line might be popular at one particular moment.\n\nIn your book you also unpack the function of the police. You're clear that you view the role of the police in capitalism as defending private property and upholding the existing class structure. But at the same time, you also reject simplistic sloganeering that says that the police are only the enemies of workers. Why should we think about the police not just as a repressive apparatus, but also as a very specific type of workforce?\n\nThe ACAB slogan is great when you're at the barricades, but I don't see it as my role to just follow whatever's happening in the streets. The way I try to describe the police - and I already can hear the jeers and boos from certain corners - is as a type of alienated worker. I'm not suggesting that the police are productive workers in the traditional sense; I'm saying that they're reproductive. Their labor is necessary insofar as it secures the conditions for capital accumulation to take place.\n\nBut even that role changes in quality and form over time. During the period of industrialization, the function of the police was, on one side, to crush labor insurgencies, and then also to do things like round up drunks and allow them to dry out so they could make it to work the next morning. We live in a different \"postindustrial\" moment now, where the police are there to manage and contain the surplus population, and to shore up [conditions] for all sorts of urban real estate speculation and development, and the expansion of tourism and entertainment in cities.\n\nWe should also remember that the police are often people who are conscripted by class - that is, people who end up pursuing that particular occupation because they don't have a whole lot of other options. The same is true for people in the military. I don't mention this in the book, but in the community where I grew up in South Louisiana, it was mandatory for everyone in my high school to take the ASVAB [Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery] test - we didn't have a choice. When I tell that story to people from other parts of the country, they're like, \"What? We never had to do anything like that!\" And it's because you weren't from one of the poorest places in the entire United States!\n\nI've had classmates, friends and family members, and other people I've known throughout the years who've worked in law enforcement, and I know that their route to that occupation is often more complicated, and their occupation doesn't necessarily determine who they are, how they see the world, how they move about in the world, or even how they occupy that particular job. So I tried to offer a more nuanced interpretation of the police, while still thinking about them as fulfilling a repressive role.\n\nI was inspired by both James Baldwin and Frantz Fanon in writing that chapter. A lot of people love Baldwin, but they forget that he offered a depiction of the police in Harlem as actual human beings cast in an impossible role as managers of the black ghetto, who struggled to reconcile their prescribed task and the humanity of those blacks they confronted everyday. The same is true for Fanon: in Wretched of the Earth he opens with a chapter on emancipatory violence but concludes the book with a more nuanced treatment of the role of the colonizer and the damage that occupation does to the French soldiers and police who have to manage the colony.\n\nI think as I get older, I'm less patient with empty posturing and hand-me-down slogans that don't give us either the political vision we need or the view of social reality that we should have. If we're sincere about trying to build a left-wing opposition, I think we have to account for the fact that there have been moments within American history where some elements of the police have realized the problems in their role and have instead sided with working-class people.\n\nOn that note, you also talk about the role that organized labor can play in fighting police violence. In 2020 I saw a few calls for workers to go on strike to protest police violence and calls for parent unions to kick out police unions. But in your book, you discuss an approach from inside the labor movement that's actually very different.\n\nYou mean the discussion of [United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America president] Carl Rosen? Right. He gave a speech that I thought was great because he was, again, thinking about actually existing conditions. So, in a place like Chicago, you've got police officers who are connected to all sorts of other public employees, as spouses, as friends, as people who belong to the same neighborhoods, social networks and communities.\n\nThis is very counterintuitive in this world of callouts and cancellations, but Rosen suggested that because of those connections, there could be a way for local labor unions to push for greater police accountability by engaging directly with the police unions. He was saying, we know these people; they're part of our central labor councils, and we talk to them on a regular basis. There's a way that we can try to address these problems that involves engaging with them - not the most right-wing or fanatical Fraternal Order shills - but the rank-and-file folks who work in these departments, who are also concerned about their reputations and concerned about public perceptions of the police.\n\nI've been a part of a couple of different unions and some local labor council committees, and the work that happens in those spaces is just completely different from what happens on social media and within some sectarian subcultures. It's about building bonds of trust and working in good faith with other people, who may be very different from you. You always have to be mindful that those relationships are fragile, and remind yourself of the actual common interest that you have, and not violate those delicate and hard-fought linkages with irresponsible speech.\n\nIt's reasonable to think that the police also have an interest in changing the conditions that they work under. We know that policing is not the most dangerous occupation out there - the last time I checked, it wasn't even in the top ten - but for the police and other first responders, mental health is an occupational safety issue. There's been a quiet epidemic of police suicides and untreated mental health crises that need to be addressed. So officers themselves should be concerned about improving conditions and improving policing practices and finding a way to achieve public safety not through expanded and more militarized policing, but through economic security for the greatest number of people. I do think there's an opportunity there for us, as unionists, to insist on better policing and better practices.\n\nI want to ask you about the calls from leftists to abolish the police. I think that most people who identify as abolitionists would probably agree that this is not something that can happen tomorrow, just as we can't overturn capitalism tomorrow. But people argue that even if we can't abolish the police overnight, it should still be a long-term goal or a horizon. Is that a useful way to think about the problem of policing?\n\nThere are some great things about abolitionist arguments; I share some ground with them. I agree that we should shrink or rightsize police departments in certain places where they're too large and overblown. We should rethink the kinds of crises and problems that police regularly respond to, and whether those problems can be addressed instead by unarmed nonpolice units.\n\nI also like the redistributive arguments that have been made by defund proponents, though I think some of those proposals don't go far enough, in the sense that it shouldn't just be police budgets that we're thinking about recuperating. We should be thinking about the massive tax giveaways, land grants, and infrastructure upgrades doled out to corporations and private developers that happen in cities every day. That should also be the focus of any genuine urban left politics.\n\nBut all that said, I think it's naive at best to think that we can have a postpolice society. Especially at this moment, when there are so many mass shootings, reactionary militia, and other emergencies, just saying \"abolish the police\" is not a useful way to talk about things. It doesn't win any converts from people who either live in communities that suffer from violence, or Americans who have experienced these more sporadic incidents of mass violence.\n\nI don't think we can have the kind of complex urban society that we do without state force. I don't think we can have governance, and for that matter, social justice, without the monopoly of violence. The problem for us right now is that the police uphold a highly unjust and terrible capitalist order. But at various points in American history, we've also seen moments where some form of policing has been necessary to advance social justice, especially in regard to African Americans. I think that's something that's missing from a lot of abolitionist talk. There's no Reconstruction after the Civil War without federal occupation of the Deep South - I'm sorry, it just doesn't happen. And the very moment that federal troops are withdrawn after the election of Rutherford B. Hayes, the Reconstruction process slowly collapses.\n\nAnother example of where we've seen police playing a role in advancing social justice is the civil rights movement. We of course know that there was repressive policing at the local level - segregationist police departments who repressed nonviolent protesters - and then throughout the 1960s, ramped-up FBI surveillance and then COINTELPRO repression of black activists and organizations. But at the same time, there were also progressive state interventions such as the deployments of federal marshals and the National Guard. Force was necessary to break open the whites-only ballot box, to allow black kids to attend schools in New Orleans and other places. We should be aware of those historical instances and think about these contradictions in a way that's serious and takes historical materialism with a sense of sincerity and integrity.\n\nI want to end on a quote from your most recent Catalyst piece. You say that we're actually \"at a time when real, effective majority coalitions in local and national contexts are more possible than at any time since the Great Depression and more likely to produce genuine societal transformation.\" That line stuck out to me because it seemed very optimistic for you. Can you elaborate on why you think the conditions right now are actually pretty good, all things considered, for building this kind of coalition?\n\nYou have to celebrate good things when you can. I do think there are signs of change in the country. Having lived in Chicago for over a decade, and now spending time in Los Angeles, I've noticed a real step forward in the way that people are talking about issues like gentrification, the unhoused, unionization, and so forth. Of course, these discussions can sometimes still be vapid or superficial - for example, when gentrification is understood primarily as a cultural thing . But there's a growing awareness that society isn't working for so many people.\n\nMany people are feeling these problems - whether it's the inadequacy of the health care system, whether it's the difficulty in attaining a college education due to the exorbitant and rising costs, whether it's homelessness and a lack of affordable housing, or crime and a lack of safety in big cities. People are now talking about these things in ways that we didn't talk about them in the '90s. I think there's now a consciousness of the limitations of our society that weren't there before.\n\nAnd you can look at various social struggles - not just Black Lives Matter, but also teachers' strikes that aren't only about wages and benefits of staff and teachers, but are also broader fights over what public education should look like. When the Los Angeles Unified School District staff went on strike last month, their demands spoke to the broader cost of living in an unlivable and unaffordable city, hardships experienced throughout Los Angeles county and beyond.\n\nOr take the recent election of Brandon Johnson in Chicago, which was a reflection of growing social forces on the ground that represent a more critical view of the kind of market-centric urbanism we've been stuck with for so long. There's an understanding that the for-profit city doesn't serve us - in Chicago or anywhere else - and that we need something different, more genuinely democratic and socially just.\n\nIt seems to me that we're at a moment that has some real possibilities. I'm a true Generation X-er, but these recent developments make a lot of the cynicism that I grew up with untenable. I think there are reasons to be optimistic.\n\nCedric Johnson is a professor of African-American studies and political science at the University of Illinois at Chicago and author of The Panthers Can't Save Us Now (Verso, 2022).\n\nJ.

Rather than treating the incident as an opportunity for introspection, French police have rebelled against all attempts to be held accountable.\n\nFrench police officers stand at the entrance of a courtroom in Aix-en-Provence on August 3, 2023, during an appeal on the pretrial detention lodged by a police officer suspected of having beaten up a twenty-two-year-old man on the night of July 1 to 2 in Marseille.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nWhat if the state of the French police is but a reflection of the profound malaise engulfing the rule of law in the country as a whole? Just over a month after the death of Nahel Merzouk, a seventeen-year-old boy shot down by the police, France now confronts seditious inclinations within its law enforcement ranks.\n\nThe increasing prevalence of protests across France in recent years has emboldened the country's police. This is because their ability to ensure law and order is the basis on which parties from the center and Right have sought to legitimize themselves to the conservative sections of the electorate. French police have thus felt able to assert themselves, rebel, and seek to operate outside the boundaries of the law.\n\nOn July 24, the director-general of the National Police (DGPN) stated publicly that he opposed the idea of placing a police officer in pretrial detention - a stance endorsed by the prefect of police in Paris and validated by the Ministry of the Interior itself, which found no fault in the DGPN's remarks. Within the French political landscape, the right wing rejoices at the country's drift toward authoritarianism: Senator Valérie Boyer of Les Républicains believes that prisons should be reserved for those who pose a threat to society, thus concluding that the guardians of law cannot, by definition, be arrested for misconduct. Meanwhile, some officers resort to sick leave as a form of protest and have even organized demonstrations outside the home of a judge who ordered pretrial detention for one of their colleagues. How did it come to this?\n\nThree years ago, through the \"global security\" law, French police gained the right to carry their firearms off duty, even in public spaces. The decision indicated the political establishment's complete and unflinching loyalty to the police force, solidified by the series of terrorist attacks that have struck France in the last decade - Charlie Hebdo, the Paris and Nice attacks, among others.\n\nAlthough the center and Right have embraced the institution of the police, the Left has been less willing to do so. The Left condemns police killings and racism and calls for profound reform, while the Right denies police violence and insists that since the police are \"republican,\" accusations of racism are baseless (the invocation of republicanism is a common tactic with which French chauvinists dismiss their country's racism).\n\nThe controversial Article 24 - struck down by the Constitutional Council - sought to prohibit the filming of police officers, a right long established by American jurisprudence, which views it as integral to the very core of the First Amendment: a right deemed essential both for holding government officials accountable and for safeguarding against abuses of power.\n\nFiercely defended by the current administration, the police know that they can push the limits and assert their will through force. The government, facing growing moments of public distrust (the Yellow Vest movement , pension reform protests , suburban riots ), cannot afford to be without them. However, when trust is so strong that even the fundamental principles of the rule of law can be questioned without any reaction from the executive, does it not provide evidence that the French republic is tilting toward an increasingly authoritarian regime, showing less and less regard for fundamental liberties?\n\nIn May, the Hérault prefecture took down a banner adorned with the acronym ACAB, All Cops Are Bastards, boasting a \"zero tolerance\" policy for \"hate speech\" directed at law enforcement. The interpretation of ACAB as hate speech rather than a critique of the police as an institution raises questions, especially in a country that embraces \"liberty\" in its motto. In 2020, the police union Alliance demonstrated its profound respect for freedom of expression when it filed a complaint against singer Camélia Jordana. The reason for the legal action was that Jordana had the audacity to say publicly what many thought privately, that \"thousands of people do not feel safe in the presence of a cop, and I am one of them.\"\n\nThe ban on criticizing the police is causing ripples even in the realm of freedom of association: since the enactment of the \"act reinforcing the principles of the republic,\" associations seeking public subsidies must now sign a binding \"contract\" committing them to uphold the \"values of the republic.\" The determination of what constitutes these \"republican values\" appears to rest entirely within the executive's discretion: recently, Minister of the Interior Gérald Darmanin asserted that the Human Rights League, a century-old association, wrongly labeled France as a \"police state.\" Consequently, its public subsidies could now be subject to reconsideration. The precedent this sets, according to which public funding is reserved for associations that refrain from criticizing the government, is deeply worrying.\n\nThis unprecedented succession of events has raised concerns among numerous international organizations: last month, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights urged France to address \"deep issues of racism and discrimination in law enforcement.\" Amnesty International, on its part, highlighted numerous instances of racial and religious discrimination and the excessive use of force by the police. These concerns were swiftly dismissed by France, which deemed all such accusations as \" groundless .\" For the \"Land of Enlightenment,\" there can be no systemic racism within its police forces, regardless of the fact that these forces overwhelmingly vote for the far right .\n\nAmid the aftermath of the tragic death of Nahel Merzouk, French president Emmanuel Macron is now contemplating an extraordinary measure - \" shutting down \" social media during riots - in response to violent unrest. This move, if implemented, would place France alongside undemocratic nations like China, Russia, and Belarus, prompting apprehensions about the state of democracy in the country. The president had pledged to \"appease\" the nation within a one-hundred-day timeframe following massive demonstrations against pension reform. However, instead of fostering a climate of peace, each passing day appears to be eroding the very foundations of democracy and republicanism.\n\nThe words of US Supreme Court justice William Brennan in the 1987 case of City of Houston v. Hill resonate powerfully in this context: \"The freedom of individuals verbally to oppose or challenge police action without thereby risking arrest is one of the principal characteristics by which we distinguish a free nation from a police state.\" France should give serious consideration to the potential implications of its illiberal drift. Preserving the rights of citizens to voice their dissent without undue repression is essential to upholding the values of a truly democratic society.\n\nSébastien Natroll is a freelance journalist based in Paris.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

      "text": "DOJ finds Phoenix Police Department discriminates against minorities and uses excessive force\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nThe Phoenix Police Department uses excessive force, violates constitutional rights, particularly those of homeless people, and discriminates against Black, Hispanic and Native American people, according to the results of an investigation by the Justice Department released Thursday.\n\nThe Justice Department found a \"pattern or practice\" of violations, saying Phoenix police frequently stop, detain and arrest homeless people without reasonable suspicion that they've committed any crime. The city and its police department also seize and destroy the property of homeless people without providing adequate notice or fair opportunity to collect their belongings, the Justice Department said.\n\nThe findings were announced by Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, who oversees the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division.\n\n\"This finding is historic,\" Clarke said. \"This marks the first time that the Justice Department has found violations of the civil and constitutional rights of people who are homeless.\"\n\nThe findings are detailed in a 126-page report issued Thursday.\n\nThe police department referred requests for comment about the findings to the city.\n\nMayor Kate Gallego said the city had received the report at the same time as the public.\n\n\"The City Council will meet this month - in Executive Session on June 25 - to receive legal advice, better understand the report, and discuss next steps,\" Gallego said in a statement. \"I will carefully and thoroughly review the findings before making further comment.\"\n\nClarke acknowledged that homelessness is a challenge in Phoenix, as it is in many cities across the country, saying the city's homeless population had nearly tripled in the last decade.\n\n\"Overpolicing of the homeless has become a central pillar of the police department's enforcement strategy,\" she said. \"In fact, 37% of all of the department's misdemeanor arrests and citations were of homeless people.\"\n\nShe added: \"This behavior is not only unlawful, but it conveys a lack of respect for the humanity and dignity of some of the most vulnerable members of our society.\"\n\nClarke said that the police department also discriminates against Black, Hispanic and Native American people when enforcing the law, and that officers are disproportionately targeting communities of color. As evidence, she said, Black drivers in Phoenix are 144 times more likely than white drivers to be arrested or cited for low-level moving violations, while Hispanic drivers are 40% more likely to be arrested or cited for the same thing.\n\n\"Phoenix police also enforce drug and alcohol offenses more severely against Black, Hispanic and Native American people than against white people,\" she said.\n\nData shows that Phoenix cites and arrests Black people for marijuana possession at nearly seven times the rate of white people and Hispanic people more than three times the rate. And Black, Hispanic and Native American people are disproportionately charged with pedestrian traffic violations and loitering, the Justice Department found.\n\nClarke said the police department makes no concession for the particular vulnerabilities of children, and treats them just the same as adults.\n\n\"Not only does such conduct harm children but it can contribute to fear and distrust of law enforcement by the next generation of Phoenix residents,\" she said.\n\nPolice are also accused of violating the rights of people engaged in protected speech, including through retaliatory policing. After a protest at which officers unloaded canisters of tear gas at peaceful protesters, Clarke said, Phoenix police officers circulated a challenge coin normally used to commemorate moments of valor and pride during service. The coin was reported about by KNXV-TV of Pheonix.\n\n\"This challenge coin instead depicted a protester whom an officer shot in the groin with a 40 millimeter impact round,\" Clarke said.\n\nThe coin, which was shown during her news conference held over Zoom, had a star over the image of the man's groin with the words: \"Good night, left nut.\"\n\n\"When police officers abused their power to silence people asserting their constitutional right to free speech and assembly, it erodes the community's trust in law enforcement,\" Clarke said.\n\nThe city and the police department also discriminate against people with behavioral health disabilities when they dispatch calls for assistance and respond to people in crisis, the Justice Department said. Clarke cited the city's own experts, who she said estimated that each month, 10% of dispatch calls for service relate to behavioral health. The Justice Department found through its analysis that officers spend \"significant patrol time\" responding to such calls, \"even though resources are available for an alternative response,\" and that, in some instances, police escalate encounters by using force or making arrests when they were on the scene specifically to take people to behavioral health treatment.\n\n\"The police department claims it was unaware of these significant racial disparities but long standing and frequently voiced community concerns about discriminatory policing, as well as overt displays of bias within the police force should have spurred the department to analyze its own data,\" Clarke said. \"Instead, the police department turned a blind eye to the data, ignored these unmistakable warnings and failed to uncover your own discriminatory policing.\"\n\nDuring the course of the Justice Department's investigation, Clarke said, the city and its police department took steps to institute reform. For example, Michael Sullivan, the interim police chief, revised the department's use of force policy and introduced new training on de-escalation tactics and an officer's duty to intervene. And the city has invested in additional shelters and resources for it homeless population, she said. The city also recently issued a reform report that lays out what it has done and plans to do to achieve constitutional policing, Clarke said.\n\n\"However, today, many reforms have not yet been implemented,\" she said, while others \"exist on paper but not in practice.\"\n\n\"In total, these efforts are simply not enough to address the full scope of our findings today,\" Clarke aid.\n\nClarke said career attorneys in the Civil Rights Division conducted hours of interviews, participated in police ride-alongs, reviewed thousands of documents and watched hundreds of hours of body-worn camera video.\n\n\"The findings that we have issued are severe,\" Clarke said, adding, \"This is one instance where we can't count on the police to police themselves.\"\n\nThe Justice Department opened a civil rights investigation into the Phoenix Police Department in 2021, after officers were involved in a series of shootings and were the subject of complaints of abuse. Unlike in other cities, the investigation was not prompted by a single incident.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said at the time that such investigations are aimed at increasing public trust and public safety by identifying systemic issues.\n\nClarke said the Justice Department will work with the city to find solutions. She stopped short of saying the department would be put under a consent decree, which typically is used to create and enforce changes within a local or state governmental agency when evidence of misconduct is found.\n\nPhoenix officials have openly opposed to the prospect. Clarke pointed to cities with consent decrees, including Baltimore, Seattle and Albuquerque, New Mexico, as places \"where reform and progress is underway.\"\n\nI am a national reporter for NBC News Digital.\n\nMichael Kosnar is a Justice Department producer for the NBC News Washington Bureau.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Here's what we know about her first murder trial.\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nBoston Police Officer John O'Keefe was found unresponsive in the front yard of another officer's suburban home on a snowy morning two years ago. He was pronounced dead shortly after, and his girlfriend, Karen Read, was charged in his murder .\n\nRead, 44, claimed innocence and alleged a far-reaching conspiracy among law enforcement officers to frame her in the killing.\n\nAfter a nine-week trial and five days of deliberations in a Norfolk County courthouse, just outside Boston, jurors remained deadlocked. A judge declared a mistrial on July 1 .\n\nAfter prosecutors vowed to retry Read, a judge scheduled a new trial for April 1, when jury selection is set to get underway .\n\nRead was charged with  second-degree murder, motor vehicle manslaughter while driving under the influence and leaving the scene of a collision causing death.\n\nHer lawyers have asked the judge to dismiss those charges , saying in court filings that jurors unanimously agreed to acquit Read on two of the charges, including murder.\n\nProsecutors have opposed the defense's request , describing it as \"legally inappropriate\" and premised on conjecture and hearsay.\n\nOn Aug. 23, the judge overseeing the case denied the defense's request , saying the jurors never said they'd reached a verdict in open court.\n\nHere's how the trial played out.\n\nO'Keefe, 46, had been an officer with the Boston Police Department for 16 years when he died Jan. 29, 2022. He'd been with Read - an equity analyst at Fidelity Investments - for two years.\n\nAccording to Norfolk County Assistant District Attorney Adam Lally, troubles in the couple's relationship appeared to intensify in the months before O'Keefe's death, including during a New Year's trip to Aruba.\n\nIn court, one of Read's lawyers acknowledged that the couple had occasional disagreements, but said they were making long-term plans. On the night of Jan. 28, 2022, Read's defense lawyer David Yannetti said, the couple seemed fine while out at a bar in a Boston suburb with other current and former law enforcement officers.\n\nAfter leaving the bar, Read later told first responders, she argued with O'Keefe before dropping him off at an afterparty at the home of Brian Albert, a now-retired Boston sergeant who'd also been at the bar, Lally said.\n\nRead's lawyers have said that she went out looking for her boyfriend when she realized he had never come home from the party. Read , who had sought help from two other women in her search, spotted his body outside Albert's house on the morning of Jan. 29, Lally said. One of the women then dialed 911.\n\nO'Keefe was pronounced dead at 7:50 a.m. at a hospital, the prosecutor said. The medical examiner attributed his cause of death to blunt force trauma to the head and hypothermia.\n\nLally cited the couple's troubled relationship and alleged that Read backed her Lexus SUV into O'Keefe outside Albert's home, causing a skull fracture and brain bleed.\n\nRead left him there to die, the prosecutor said.\n\nEven though Read said she'd dropped O'Keefe off at Albert's home, the assistant DA said that no one at the afterparty recalled seeing O'Keefe inside. They saw the SUV pull up to the house, the prosecutor said, then leave, and they assumed no one from the vehicle was joining them.\n\nBut vehicle data from Read's SUV showed that at 12:45 a.m., while outside Albert's home, the Lexus traveled backward for 60 feet at 24 mph, Lally said. The SUV's tail light was broken, Lally said, and pieces of the light were later found outside Albert's home.\n\nForensic testing showed that O'Keefe's hair was found on the vehicle's bumper and his DNA was found on the taillight, Lally said. Investigators also found the remnants of a cocktail that appears to have been spilled on the bumper, the prosecutor said. O'Keefe was captured on video leaving the bar with a cocktail in his hand, and bits of what the prosecutor described as a drinking glass were found in the SUV's bumper.\n\nRead was charged with second-degree murder, vehicular manslaughter and other crimes.\n\nRead's lawyers have challenged some of the prosecution's evidence and said that she was framed for a murder she didn't commit. During the afterparty, the defense team alleged, O'Keefe appeared to have been ambushed, beaten, bitten by a dog - the Alberts had a German shepherd - and left outside.\n\n\"He was supposedly sprawled on that lawn, just feet from where these people were walking when they left the residence,\" defense lawyer David Yannetti said in his opening statement. \"Not one of these people saw John O'Keefe.\"\n\nThe defense blamed authorities for failing to carry out a \"real\" investigation because of close connections to Albert and his family - his brother is also a police officer - and instead focusing on Read, whom Yannetti described as a \"convenient outsider.\" (Albert testified that O'Keefe never came to his house but he would have been \"welcomed with open arms\" if he had.)\n\nThe defense lawyers have alleged that the lead investigator in the case, Massachusetts State Police Trooper Michael Proctor, was one of the chief reasons the investigation was biased.\n\nIn testimony Monday, Proctor acknowledged referring to Read using derogatory language in text messages with other troopers. In one instance, Proctor described Read using an offensive term for developmentally disabled people and told other troopers in a text thread - including two supervisors - that he hadn't found any nude photos of Read while searching her cell phone.\n\nProctor described the comments as \"regrettable\" and \"unprofessional jokes\" that did not obscure his ability to carry out a impartial investigation.\n\nProctor was suspended without pay seven days after the judge declared a mistrial.\n\nThe defense also pointed to what Yannetti described as two \"curious\" phone calls between Albert and Brian Higgins, a friend and agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives who had been at the bar and afterparty. The calls were made at 2:22 a.m. Jan. 29 after the party at Albert's house, Yannetti said.\n\nUnder questioning from the defense, Albert testified that his initial phone call to Higgins - which lasted one second - was accidental. He said he did not respond to a returned call that lasted 22 seconds. Higgins testified that he had no recollection of answering the phone or calling anyone back.\n\nHiggins testified that he and Read had become attracted to each other in the months before O'Keefe's death and had exchanged flirtatious texts. When another defense lawyer, Alan Jackson, asked Higgins if he'd become frustrated when Read \"ghosted\" him in the days before the party and paid no attention to him at the bar, Higgins responded: \"No, not at all.\"\n\nAccording to defense attorney Yannetti, Read's broken taillight didn't come from backing into O'Keefe, but from leaving her home in a panic after discovering in the pre-dawn hours of Jan. 29 that her boyfriend had never come home.\n\nShe backed into O'Keefe's car, Yannetti said, in an event that was captured on security camera. He added that authorities did not find the broken pieces of taillight during an initial search of Albert's yard. They only began finding them later in the day, after Read's car had been seized, Yannetti said.\n\nMcCabe, Albert's sister-in-law, had also been at the bar and afterparty, and she was one of two women who'd gone looking for O'Keefe with Read.\n\nUnder cross-examination, defense attorney Jackson asked McCabe why she appeared to have shifted her account of Read's reaction to finding O'Keefe's body.\n\nMcCabe initially told a grand jury that she heard Read wonder if she could have hit her boyfriend - \"Did I hit him?\" - Jackson said, citing her testimony. But at trial, McCabe described Read's reaction as a statement - \"I hit him\" - that she said Read declared three times to a paramedic who'd asked what happened to O'Keefe.\n\n\"You've manufactured this story for this jury because you think it helps you out?\" Jackson asked.\n\n\"Absolutely not,\" she responded.\n\nJackson also questioned McCabe about what he said a forensic extraction of her cellphone showed. At 2:27 a.m. on Jan. 29, several hours before O'Keefe's body was found, he said she asked Google how long it takes for someone to die of hypothermia.\n\nAfterward, Jackson said, McCabe deleted the search.\n\nMcCabe denied searching for the phrase at that time. Around 2 a.m., she testified, she'd been searching for a basketball team her daughter had been invited to join. She said she didn't ask Google about hypothermia until several hours later, after she and Read had discovered O'Keefe's body and she said Read asked her to find the answer to that question.\n\n\"I never would have left John O'Keefe out in the cold to die because he was my friend that I loved,\" she said, according to T he Associated Press .\n\nI cover crime and criminal justice and frequently collaborate with \"Dateline.\" I've reported on unsolved homicides and wrongful convictions, police misconduct and the rise of artificial intelligence in law enforcement.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

He also said smaller departments, which account for 80% of agencies nationwide, were underrepresented in the responses PERF received.\n\nMany larger departments have increased officer pay or started offering incentives such as signing bonuses for experienced officers who are willing to transfer, something smaller departments can't really compete with. At least a dozen smaller departments have disbanded , leaving the municipalities they once served to rely on state or county help for policing.\n\nBut even some of the highest-paying large departments are still struggling to get new hires in the door.\n\n\"I don't think it's all about money. I think it's about the way people perceive their job and feel they are going to be supported,\" Wexler said. \"You have West Coast departments that are paying six figures, but still seeing major challenges in hiring.\"\n\nIn addition to pay and bonuses, many agencies are reexamining their application requirements and hiring processes.\n\nWexler believes some of those changes make sense, including allowing visible tattoos, reweighing the importance of past financial issues and processing applicants' background checks faster. But he cautioned that PERF does not support lowering standards for training or for applicants.\n\nMaria \"Maki\" Haberfeld, chair of the Department of Law, Police Science and Criminal Justice Administration at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, says departments have been too focused on officer numbers. She worries some are lowering education requirements and other standards to bolster numbers instead of trying to find the best people to police their communities.\n\n\"Policing is a real profession that requires more skills and more education than people can understand,\" she said. \"It's not about tattoos or running a mile in 15 minutes. It's really more about emotional intelligence, maturity and making those split-second decisions that don't use deadly force.\"\n\nHaberfeld also cautioned that any staffing gains made through incentives could easily be erased, especially as officers, including some in riot gear, have been seen breaking up protests against the Israel-Hamas war at universities across the country.\n\n\"In policing, it takes decades to move forward and a split second for the public attitude to deteriorate,\" she said.\n\nPERF's survey showed a more than a 20% drop in resignations overall, from a high of almost 6,500 in 2022 to fewer than 5,100 in 2023. They are still up over early pandemic levels in 2020, however, when a few more than 4,000 officers resigned across all responding departments.\n\nAs with the hiring increases, the rate of decrease in retirements tended to depend on the size of the departments. There were fewer retirements in 2023 than in 2019 at large departments, slightly more retirements at medium departments and elevated retirements at small departments. The survey found a steep drop in resignations at large agencies with 250 or more officers and medium-size agencies with between 50 and 249 officers.\n\nIn addition to pay and benefit increases, the improved retention can be partly attributed to a shift in how some public officials view their public safety departments, Wexler says.\n\n\"We went from having public discourse about defunding the police just a few years ago to public officials waking up to the fact their workforce is leaving,\" he said. \"I don't think there's any question that there has been a sea change among political leaders.\"\n\nI cover early morning U.S. breaking news, everything from severe weather to crime.

White Sulpher Springs is about 370 miles from Cleveland and has a population of roughly 2,220.\n\n\"As of July 1, 2024, Timothy Loehmann has resigned his position and is no longer an employee\" with the city, she said, adding that, because it was a personnel matter, she would have no further comment.\n\nGlover did not immediately return a request for comment about when Loehmann was hired and whether she had signed off on it. Her statement said Loehmann had been hired at the request and recommendation of the chief of police.\n\nThis is the second time Loehmann has resigned from a police department since he left Cleveland.\n\nEarlier Monday, before the mayor's announcement, White Sulphur Springs City Council member Thomas Taylor confirmed Loehmann's hiring to NBC News. It was first reported by The Real WV , a nonprofit multimedia organization. Taylor said in an interview that only the police chief and the mayor had the power to hire Loehmann and that the city council had no authority over personnel issues and was not involved in his hiring.\n\n\"From what I understand, the chief of police hired him,\" Taylor said.\n\nHe said the decision had spurred backlash on social media and he anticipated the matter would be raised at the next city council meeting, which is scheduled to take place next Monday.\n\nReached by phone Monday morning, Chief D.S. Teubert said he was not at liberty to speak about Loehmann but said he may be at a later time. He did not return requests for comment after Loehmann's resignation was announced.\n\nTeubert confirmed to Cleveland.com that he hired Loehmann. He said that he spent a year or so looking into Loehmann's background - which included watching videos and reading about Tamir's killing.\n\n\"Just as a person, I looked at the whole situation,\" Teubert told the outlet. \"I did a background check. I researched everything. It's just a sad situation. Does any police officer in the world stand a chance when they're involved in a shooting? Do they deserve to never work again as a police officer, or is it just this shooting?\"\n\nTamir, who was Black, was playing with a pellet gun outside a recreation center in Cleveland on Nov. 22, 2014, when he was shot and killed by Loehmann seconds after Loehmann and his then-partner, a veteran training officer, arrived.\n\nLoehmann and his then-partner, Frank Garmback, had been responding to a call of someone pointing a gun at people. The caller told a 911 dispatcher that it was probably a juvenile and that the gun looked fake but that was never relayed to Loehmann and Garmback. Both men said in statements after the shooting that Loehmann had given Tamir multiple commands to show his hands before he shot him.\n\nThe shooting sparked months of protests over police treatment of Black people. A state grand jury decided not to indict Loehmann or Garmback. In May 2017, about three years after he killed Tamir, Loehmann was fired by the Cleveland Police Department, which said his 2013 application contained inaccuracies. In December 2020, the Justice Department announced that it would not bring federal criminal charges against Loehmann and Garmback, saying quality of the video of the shooting was too poor for prosecutors to conclusively establish what happened.\n\nA message left at a number publicly listed for Loehmann was not immediately returned. He has twice before left jobs at small police departments. In 2022, he resigned from a position with the police department in Tioga, Pennsylvania, after his hiring drew backlash , his attorney Henry Hilow said at the time. And in 2018, he withdrew his application to become a part-time police officer in Bellaire, Ohio, the department's police chief said then following protests from Tamir's mother and others .\n\nTeubert told Cleveland.com that he met Loehmann through friends in the military, and that he did not believe Loehmann had done anything wrong.\n\n\"What crime was he convicted of?\" Teubert said. \"I just want everyone to be fair about this whole thing. If I thought he had done something illegal or wrong in any way I wouldn't have hired him.\"\n\nTeubert also expressed surprise that the hiring had drawn attention.\n\n\"I know there are two sides to every story, but people just aren't looking at what happened,\" Teubert said. \"It's a sad, sad thing that that young man lost his life. I take nothing away from that.\"\n\nCleveland settled a lawsuit with Tamir's family for $6 million. There was no admission of wrongdoing in the settlement.\n\nSubodh Chandra, an attorney who represented the estate of Tamir Rice and his family, said Loehmann should never again be entrusted with a badge and gun and questioned why he insists on working as a police officer.\n\n\"Timothy Loehmann should be radioactive to any sensible member of law enforcement or any community,\" Chandra said.\n\nI am a national reporter for NBC News Digital.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Dunn plans to endorse candidates up and down the ballot through the group, using his personal story and his fundraising prowess to help in targeted races.\n\n\"The first thing I had to decide when you want to run for office is your why: Why are you doing this, why are you running?\" Dunn told NBC News in an interview Tuesday, before he announced his plans Wednesday morning on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\"\n\n\"My why is to do everything I can to protect the institution of Congress, to fight back against Donald Trump, to defend our Constitution, our democracy,\" Dunn continued. \"Even though I came up short in the election, there definitely is room for me to continue to fight.\"\n\nThe group will inherit the money left over from Dunn's campaign - though it won't be clear how much until post-primary fundraising reports are due this summer.\n\nDunn, a 15-year veteran of the Capitol Police, says that the mob on Jan. 6 shouted racial slurs at him and attacked him, and he testified about his experience before the House committee investigating the attack and at the seditious conspiracy trial of members of the far-right Oath Keepers.\n\nIt's against that backdrop that Dunn decided to run for Congress in Maryland this year. Despite his national recognition, endorsements from prominent members of Congress and significant fundraising, the political newcomer fell short to Democratic state Sen. Sarah Elfreth . Elfreth highlighted her legislative record and got a boost from an outside group affiliated with the pro-Israel American Israel Public Affairs Committee.\n\nIn his first run for political office, Dunn raised more than $4.5 million in less than six months, making him one of the best 30 House candidate fundraisers this election cycle to date - including incumbents who have been fundraising for their re-elections since January 2023. That gives Dunn a strong financial platform for his new group.\n\nDunn said he didn't have a financial goal in mind and that the group's plans will depend on what his endorsed candidates need from him. But after his primary, he said he wants to boost Democrats who agree that corporate money doesn't belong in politics.\n\n\"There was no secret I was a very strong fundraiser - all that came from was my story and my message and my desire to, one, stop MAGA Republicans, and two, to get dark money and MAGA money, these corporate PACs out of free and fair elections. That's a simple story and it resonates with a lot of people,\" he said.\n\nDunn is also taking on a more visible role in supporting President Joe Biden's re-election - joining former fellow police officers who also defended the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, on the trail with the Biden campaign .\n\nAsked whether the group could endorse moderate Republicans to oppose Trump-supporting Republicans, Dunn said that he wouldn't take the concept off the table - but that he doesn't \"see any Republicans on the other side aisle that are standing up to Donald Trump, it's like they don't exist anymore.\"\n\n\"Donald Trump has surrogates, people in the Republican Party that want to do nothing except downplay, whitewash, diminish, flat out lie about what happened that day,\" Dunn said of the Jan. 6 attack.\n\n\"It's not just regular everyday American citizens. These are elected officials that are whitewashing and saying these things. That's why it's so important that we never stop telling our story,\" Dunn said.\n\nAnd he added that while he has no specific office in mind for a potential future bid, he wouldn't rule out another run.\n\nI am a national political reporter at NBC News covering presidential and down-ballot elections, as well as campaign finance and other election data.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

      "text": "Karen Read murder trial: Messy investigation exposes problems with police work that public rarely sees, experts say\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nJurors weighing the murder case against Karen Read, the Massachusetts woman accused of running down and killing her police officer boyfriend in 2022 , ended the week without a verdict Friday, their fourth day of deliberations after a trial that included dozens of witnesses and allegations of botched detective work.\n\nRead's defense lawyers argued that the investigation was flawed, with undisclosed conflicts of interest, offensive text messages and a failure to consider alternative suspects. They've alleged a conspiracy among law enforcement officers to cover up the death of Boston police officer John O'Keefe at the hands of one of their own and frame Read in his killing.\n\nRegardless of the trial's outcome, legal experts said, the proceedings exposed an often-hidden side of law enforcement that can be rife with problems.\n\n\"One of the legacies of the Karen Read murder prosecution is that it puts a spotlight on some of the flaws and missteps in the police investigation,\" said Daniel Medwed, a professor of law and criminal justice at Northeastern University and an expert on wrongful convictions.\n\n\"If there are missteps and sloppiness in a murder investigation involving the death of a police officer, what does that suggest about the process in a more run-of-the-mill case with a civilian victim?\" he said.\n\n\"This should be cause for concern and some evaluation,\" he added.\n\nStara Roemer, a former Dallas County prosecutor turned criminal defense lawyer in Texas, said the actions of the lead investigator in the case, Massachusetts State Trooper Michael Proctor, reflect a problem with some police officers who show little respect for the subjects of an investigation.\n\nAt trial, Proctor acknowledged making derogatory comments about Read and sharing details about the investigation with friends and family. He testified that the comments were unprofessional but did not compromise the investigation.\n\n\"I have never seen this kind of an appearance of impropriety,\" Roemer said. \"I am sure that this happens every day. The difference between this case and other cases is that, generally, the detectives going home and talking to whoever about a case - they're not talking about it with people who know the people that are involved in the case and are potential suspects.\"\n\n\"If I were a police officer and I saw this, it's like, how are you expected to go out and do your job?\" she added. \"How do you trust the police?\"\n\nThe Massachusetts State Police did not respond to a request for comment. A message left on a number listed for Proctor was not returned.\n\nRead and O'Keefe, 46, who had been a Boston police officer for 16 years, had been at a bar with other current and former law enforcement officers the night before he was found dead. O'Keefe had planned on going to an after-party at the home of a now-retired Boston police sergeant, prosecutors have said, but never made it inside.\n\nO'Keefe was discovered in the front yard of Brian Albert's home around 6 a.m. on Jan. 29, 2022.\n\nHe was later pronounced dead at a local hospital. The medical examiner attributed his cause of death to blunt force trauma to the head and hypothermia, and Read was later charged with second-degree murder, vehicular manslaughter and other crimes. She pleaded not guilty.\n\nProsecutors have alleged that Read - drunk and angry over her troubled relationship with O'Keefe - backed her SUV into her boyfriend while dropping him off at the after-party.\n\nAt trial, Norfolk County Assistant District Attorney Adam Lally said vehicle data from Read's Lexus showed her SUV traveled backward for 60 feet at 24 mph outside Albert's home. The SUV's taillight was broken, Lally has said, and pieces of it were later found outside Albert's home.\n\nForensic testing showed that O'Keefe's hair was on the vehicle's bumper and his DNA was on the taillight, Lally said.\n\nLally also pointed to Read's own comments - \"I hit him\" - that emergency personnel recalled her saying on the morning of Jan. 29.\n\nRead has denied striking O'Keefe, and her lawyers have said she dropped him off and he went inside Albert's home.\n\nRead later realized that her boyfriend never came home, her defense team has said. Hours after Read said she dropped him off, she went to look for him with two other women and found him in Albert's front yard.\n\nRead's defense lawyers have challenged key pieces of the prosecution's physical evidence, including the broken taillight. Citing home security video that showed Read backing into O'Keefe's car as she left to search for him on the morning of Jan. 29 and discrepancies in Proctor's police reports, they suggested the pieces of taillight found outside Albert's home could have been planted. (Proctor testified that the discrepancy was a typo.)\n\nAnd the defense team has said that Read's comments from the morning of Jan. 29 were twisted from a panicked question - \"Could I have hit him?\" - into a statement.\n\nMedwed, the Northeastern professor, said that how those comments were used may show confirmation bias among authorities.\n\n\"She's upset, she's speculating,\" he said. \"She can't remember what happened because she was so inebriated and maybe she's thinking she hit him.\"\n\n\"If you think Karen Read is guilty, then all of these factoids would support that theory,\" he added.\n\nRead's lawyers, who were permitted to present an alternative theory of O'Keefe's killing at trial, argued that O'Keefe may have gotten into a fatal scuffle at the party with another law enforcement officer - an agent with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives whom Read had traded flirtatious texts with, then \"ghosted.\"\n\nThe lawyers have alleged that those who attended the party then dumped O'Keefe's body outside and framed Read to cover it up. She was \"a convenient outsider\" in law enforcement officials' attempt to protect one of their own, her lawyers said.\n\nLally has dismissed that claim as \"rampant speculation.\"\n\nProctor admitted during trial that he used slurs and offensive language to describe Read in text messages to family, friends and supervisors. During testimony, Proctor also acknowledged having undisclosed personal and professional ties to Albert, the former Boston sergeant who owned the home where O'Keefe was found.\n\nHe testified that his comments and relationships did not compromise the investigation.\n\nProctor testified that he had worked a cold case investigation with Albert's brother, an officer with the Canton Police Department, and had gone out drinking with him. And Proctor's sister was close friends with Albert's sister-in-law. The investigator testified that he'd previously asked the sister-in-law to babysit his children.\n\nDuring the investigation, Proctor testified, he interviewed the sister-in-law - who had been out drinking with O'Keefe and Read before the party - and admitted discussing that conversation with his sister. The sister-in-law later offered Proctor a thank-you gift via his sister \"when this is all over,\" according to text messages between the siblings that were presented as evidence in court.\n\nIn testimony, Proctor said he never asked for a gift or received one. He denied sharing progress of the homicide investigation with his sister and added that he'd only made her aware of \"newsworthy stuff.\"\n\nProctor shared details of the investigation with several high school friends. In a group chat on the night of Jan. 29, hours after O'Keefe was found dead, one of the friends wrote that the person who owned the house where O'Keefe's body was discovered \"will receive some s---.\"\n\n\"Nope,\" Proctor responded, referring to Albert. \"Homeowner is a Boston cop, too.\"\n\nProctor presents a serious problem for the state's case, said Roemer, the former prosecutor turned defense attorney in Dallas.\n\n\"Everything about Trooper Proctor was a problem,\" she said. \"He shouldn't have been involved in this case. He should have taken himself out because he knew people that were witnesses in this case.\"\n\nTo avoid a potential conflict of interest, state police led the investigation into O'Keefe's death. But Proctor damaged that effort by sharing details about the case with others, Roemer said.\n\n\"When you have somebody like Trooper Proctor going around telling everybody in town intimate details of the investigation, you're compromising it,\" Roemer said. \"Even if there's not a conspiracy, you're compromising it. He does not know who these people are talking to. But what he does know is that the people that he's talking to know the people that live inside of the house where this happened.\"\n\nAt trial, Proctor said he wasn't aware of two phone calls between Albert and the ATF agent, Brian Higgins, that the defense described as \"curious\" and potentially significant. The calls were made at 2:22 a.m. on Jan. 29, roughly four hours before O'Keefe was found dead.\n\nHiggins said he had no recollection of the calls. Albert said a one-second call from his phone to Higgins was accidental. He said he didn't answer a return call moments later that lasted 22 seconds. Proctor said he wasn't aware of the calls because investigators don't typically seize witnesses' phones.\n\nIn the chat with his friends, Proctor said that Read, whom he called a \"whack job\" and identified using a slur, had \"waffled\" O'Keefe, or hit him with her SUV. He added that there would be \"serious charges\" brought against her.\n\nAsked at trial if he'd wrapped up the case before fully investigating it, Proctor responded that in those early hours he'd already developed compelling evidence showing Read had struck O'Keefe with her vehicle.\n\nMedwed said the revelations about Proctor's investigation showed what he's often seen in wrongful convictions - a tendency among investigators to develop \"tunnel vision,\" or a resistance to pursuing possible evidence or information that doesn't fit their theory of what happened.\n\n\"The way that we see the evidence is tinged by our expectations and our theory of the case,\" he said. \"It seems as if the police did develop a theory pretty early that Karen Read committed the crime. As the case evolved, there might have been other avenues of investigation that they didn't pursue.\"\n\nI cover crime and criminal justice and frequently collaborate with \"Dateline.\" I've reported on unsolved homicides and wrongful convictions, police misconduct and the rise of artificial intelligence in law enforcement.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Mr. Nelson was found guilty of murder and assault last June.\n\nBy Sara Ruberg\n\nA police officer in Washington State was sentenced Thursday to more than 16 years in prison for killing a man during an attempted arrest in 2019, cementing the first conviction under a state law that made it easier to prosecute police officers for using deadly force.\n\nThe officer, Jeffrey Nelson, was found guilty of second-degree murder and first-degree assault in June for shooting and killing Jesse Sarey, 26, while attempting to arrest him for disorderly conduct in May 2019 outside Sunshine Grocery in Auburn. Officer Nelson was charged with murder and assault in August 2020, more than a year after the killing, according to the news release from the King County Prosecuting Attorney's Office.\n\nThis is the first sentencing under a legal reform, Initiative 940, which was overwhelmingly approved by Washington voters in 2018. The initiative loosened the standards that needed to be met to criminally prosecute police officers for using deadly force.\n\nBefore the legal change, prosecutors had to prove that officers acted with malice. Under the reform, a jury must decide if the officer's action was reasonable. Officer Nelson was the first police officer to be charged by King County prosecutors under the law in August 2020.\n\n\"A King County jury found that Officer Nelson's actions were not above the law,\" Leesa Manion, the King County prosecuting attorney, said in a statement on Thursday. \"We have always known how impactful this case is to the individuals involved and to the community as a whole.\"\n\nBefore the guilty verdict was delivered in June, Mr. Sarey's mother and brother also died. Elaine Simons, who was a foster mother to the brothers, told The New York Times in June that the conviction \"sets a precedent that officers are not above the law.\"\n\nEmma Scanlan, a lawyer on Officer Nelson's defense team, said in an email to The Times on Thursday that the officer and his defense team \"regret the loss of Jesse Sarey's life.\" However, she said, the trial \"was marred by unprecedented and significant legal errors that deprived Officer Nelson of his constitutional rights,\" and his legal team would be appealing.\n\nThe Auburn Police Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday.\n\nOfficer Nelson has been on unpaid administrative leave since his conviction in June. He has been under a formal review process, which was paused during the hearings but has since resumed, according to a spokesman with the city of Auburn.\n\nHis case was the second to go to trial under the new law. Three Tacoma police officers were acquitted last year in the death of Manuel Ellis, a Black man who died in police custody. The officers received $500,000 to resign from the Tacoma Police Department.\n\nAlexandra E.

Shane Lamond guilty of lying to investigators and undermining police work by sharing tips with Enrique Tarrio, the group's leader.\n\nBy Zach Montague\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nA federal judge on Monday found a former intelligence officer in the Washington police department guilty of obstruction of justice and lying to investigators, ruling that he had improperly concealed details about his relationship with Enrique Tarrio, the former leader of the far-right group the Proud Boys.\n\nThe former officer, Lt. Shane Lamond, had drawn attention from the Justice Department for cultivating an unusually close connection with Mr. Tarrio in the months leading up to the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. That relationship, prosecutors said, crossed into inappropriate conduct after Mr. Lamond leaked details about an investigation into Mr. Tarrio over his setting fire to a Black Lives Matter banner during a protest in Washington after the 2020 election.\n\nIn her ruling, Judge Amy Berman Jackson of Federal District Court in Washington said that the hundreds of messages she reviewed between Mr. Lamond and Mr. Tarrio illustrated that Mr. Lamond had been undermining his colleagues with \"entirely unauthorized\" back channeling with Mr. Tarrio, conduct that she viewed as \"entirely contradictory\" to the police department's interests.\n\nDuring his two-week trial, Mr. Lamond's lawyers had argued that he had reached out to Mr. Tarrio as part of his duties as an intelligence officer, and that Mr. Lamond shared periodic updates about the status of police and F.B.I. investigations into the Proud Boys' activities as part of building a relationship.\n\nThey said that Mr. Lamond's methods, which included tipping off Mr. Tarrio that a warrant for his arrest had been processed and that the police had not been able to obtain video of him burning the banner in December 2020, did not amount to sharing sensitive information, and were part of building a rapport with a source. When he was later interviewed about the interactions by federal agents, Mr. Lamond acknowledged that the two men had been in touch, but suggested he was doing so to help build a case against Mr. Tarrio.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

The shooting drew the attention of the N.A.A.C.P., which said it had pushed investigators to bring charges.\n\nJose Coronado, Officer Lunsford's lawyer, said he had argued during an eight-day jury trial that the shooting was justified because Mr. Eze was holding the Taser about 12 inches from the other officer's face and had his finger on the trigger.\n\nExperts hired by the defense concluded that, under those circumstances, Officer Lunsford's \"use of force was necessary to stop the threat,\" Mr. Coronado said in an interview on Thursday, adding: \"You can't react.

The Met says Irikefe was arrested by German police on April 17, the day Arsenal played Bayern in the Champions League quarter-finals, for wearing a balaclava and sunglasses inside the Allianz Arena. He received a €100 (£83; $105) fine for the \"masking\" offence.\n\n\"The hearing found he had breached the standards of professional behaviour for discreditable conduct at the level of gross misconduct,\" a Met statement read.\n\nIrikefe had already resigned on February 12 but the Met stated that \"his notice period meant he was still a serving officer when his misconduct hearing was held, therefore he was dismissed without notice\".\n\nHis banning order applies to all regulated football matches in the UK for three years, and he must also surrender his passport when asked in relation to matches played abroad. Irikefe is also prohibited from going within two miles of a stadium England are playing at four hours before and after the fixture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDetective Superintendent Emma Bond, in charge of policing for the Central South area, said: \"DC Irikefe has shown an unacceptable pattern of behaviour at football matches, for anyone, let alone a police officer who should uphold the highest of standards whether on or off duty.\"\n\n(Alex Pantling/Getty Images)\n\nAli Rampling is a News Editor at The Athletic.

A prosecutor said the driver, from Texas, had accelerated in the officer's direction and nearly hit him.\n\nBy Annie Correal\n\nReporting from Mexico City\n\nAn American man was killed when a Mexican police officer opened fire on the car he was driving in Ciudad Juárez, across the border from El Paso, Texas, the Mexican authorities said on Monday.\n\nA regional prosecutor in the state of Chihuahua, Carlos Manuel Salas, said the shooting occurred on Sunday as the officer was accompanying a staff member from the prosecutor's office, who was serving a warrant. The two were on foot when a Mustang with New Mexico license plates suddenly accelerated in their direction, according to Mr. Salas. He said the officer opened fire as the driver tried to flee.\n\nMr. Salas said the officer was in custody and that the shooting, which was captured on video by a passenger in the car, would be investigated by the internal affairs division of the state prosecutor's office. At a news conference, Mr. Salas described the incident as \"regrettable\" and urged the public to refrain from drawing conclusions until the investigation was complete.\n\nBut he appeared to offer a defense of the officer, whose name was not released. According to Mr. Salas, the vehicle was traveling at high speed and skidded as it approached the officer, almost hitting him. The driver was wearing a hood, he said.\n\n\"Why would you accelerate?\" he asked. \"Why would you drive at that speed?\"\n\nMr. Salas argued that if something similar happened in another country, including the United States, the police would also likely respond with force.\n\nThe authorities did not identify the man who was killed, describing him only as a nursing assistant from El Paso. But Mexican news outlets reported that his name was Julián Alfredo Rodríguez Medina. News reports said the man and at least one of the two passengers in the car had family members who lived nearby.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

No longer. A steep drop in the number of people wanting to become police officers since the start of the pandemic and the unrest of 2020 have given extraordinary leverage to job seekers, forcing departments to market themselves in new ways.\n\n\"The game has clearly changed,\" said Marcus Jones, the police chief in Montgomery County, Md., who said he discovered that another department was using location-based digital advertising to target the area around his police stations with job postings.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Body-worn camera footage released by Miami-Dade police showed Hill being forced out of his vehicle and onto the ground by officers.\n\nIn the video, police approached Hill's car, and he rolled his window up after a brief interaction. The police told Hill to keep his window down. When he did not fully roll it down, one of the four officers opened the car door and pulled Hill from the vehicle by the back of his neck. One officer put Hill face-down on the street to handcuff him.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nDolphins say police conduct with Hill 'overly aggressive and violent'\n\nHill was cited for careless driving and failure to wear a seatbelt, the AP reported.\n\nIn their statement, Hill and Collins noted that the officer \"placed his hands on or around\" Hill's neck at least twice and said the officer did not listen to Hill when he told police he recently had knee surgery.\n\n\"The officer ignored his statement and continued his escalation in his use of force,\" they said in the statement.\n\n\"The events that occurred on Sunday, September 8, 2024, are just a reminder of the realities of the many injustices that people of Black and minority communities face at the hands of law enforcement,\" they said. \"While we are in no way accusing the officer of being racist, we are accusing the customs and practices of law enforcement from a historical standpoint of being discriminatory and oppressive to black and minority communities. We cannot ignore this fact and remain silent on the issue just because it's a tough conversation.\"\n\nThey conclude the statement by saying Hill \" is committed to furthering the conversation and being active in promoting change in community and police relations.\" It echoes a post the wide receiver shared to X on Monday in which he wrote, \"Let's make a change.\"\n\nLet's make a change\n\n- Ty Hill (@cheetah) September 10, 2024\n\nAttorneys Ignacio Alvarez and Israel Reyes, who are representing Torres, the officer placed on administrative duties, said they believed the decision to place him on leave was \"premature\" but support Miami-Dade Police Department director Stephanie Daniels' call for a thorough review of the incident.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We call for our client's immediate reinstatement, and a complete, thorough, and objective investigation, as Director Daniels has also advocated,\" they said.\n\nOn Monday, the South Florida Police Benevolent Association, a union for police officers, said it \"(stands) with the actions of our officers\" involved in the incident.\n\n\"We have worked hard across all communities to bridge the gap between what people believe law enforcement should and can do,\" the association said in a statement. \"While we wait for the investigation to run its course, based on what we know, we stand with the actions of our officers but look forward to further open communication moving forward.\"\n\nHill's coaches and teammates have spoken in support of him since the detainment. Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel said Monday that it has \"been hard for me not to find myself more upset the more I think about it.\"\n\n\"I think that it's supremely important to wait for information to be gathered before any rush to judgment,\" he said. \"Regardless, I know the feelings expressed to me are ... unsettling. Two things did come from the adversity. I'm super proud of teammates being teammates and super proud of our guys understanding the civic responsibility of a platform and intending to do right by it.\"\n\n(Photo: Rich Storry / Getty Images)\n\nTess DeMeyer is a Staff Editor for The Athletic working on the live/breaking news team.

      "text": "My 5-Year-Old Is Way Too Obsessed With Police Officers\n\nCare and Feeding is Slate's parenting advice column. Have a question for Care and Feeding? Submit it here or post it in the Slate Parenting Facebook group .\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nMy lovely, outgoing son is 5 years old. For the past year or so, he has been absolutely obsessed with police officers. He loves their uniforms, cars, and dogs. He tells everyone he wants to be a policeman when he grows up, and whenever he sees a police officer, he runs up to them and says hi. In our overwhelmingly white suburb, this is always well received; cops are usually idle and don't mind letting him touch their cars or look at their outfits.\n\nI'm a little conflicted about this obsession, for obvious reasons. I know my son views police officers as friendly heroes because we are white and well-off-and he loves Paw Patrol- and I'm struggling to decide how to expose him to the reality that for many people, they are anything but heroes. I have been neutral toward his obsession so far: When he says he wants to be a police officer, I try to bring up other jobs where you can help people (like an ambulance driver!), and rather than let him dress up as a policeman for Halloween last year, I made an alternate suggestion and he went with it. Nevertheless, I'm wondering whether it's time to have a serious conversation with him about the role of the police and, if so, if you have any advice about doing that.\n\n-Sound the Alarm\n\nDear StA,\n\nIf you have not started talking to your child about social inequities, specifically those related to race, class, and gender, now is the time to begin that dialogue. For him to understand what's wrong with policing, he has to know why they function as they do in the first place.\n\nOnce you've explained the ways that racism, classism, and sexism define the world we live in, you can tell your son how police function to uphold those inequities. Instead of saying that police are not viewed as heroes by all, explain that it is actually quite rare that police are heroic. The harassment, abuse of power, and violence are essentially written into the laws that they are sworn to uphold; for police, bad behavior is not a bug but a feature. Study after study has shown that police are woefully ineffective when it comes to preventing and solving crime, and we do a disservice to our children by pretending that it's the \"bad cops\" alone who are the problem.\n\nAsk your little one what it is about police that he admires so much; he's likely to mention some virtues that theoretically should define an institution that is designed to protect communities. Continue to nudge him toward people and groups who actually represent those values, such as firefighters, nurses, and teachers, while also explaining that there are bad actors in those roles as well but the difference between a \"bad\" firefighter and a \"bad\" cop is that the job of being a firefighter was not created in order to do harm to vulnerable people.\n\nThis may sound like a lot for a 5-year-old, but I assure you that he can handle it. Remember: Black children, poor children, and many others don't have the privilege of learning these lessons later in life in the service of protecting their innocence, or because it's so hard to talk about in what feels like age-appropriate terms. I'm heartened by the fact that you're even contemplating this conversation. Please keep going!\n\nHelp us keep giving the advice you crave every week. Sign up for Slate Plus now .\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nI have a 6-year-old first grader doing all-online remote learning. It's been two weeks, and she is having a really hard time with it. One day she was getting frustrated and started crying; she got up because she was upset, and the teacher promptly called her out by name to sit back down, which made her cry harder. I actually went on camera to tell the teacher that she was crying and needed a break. But on top of this, I'm getting burned out by this new normal.\n\nWe have numerous daily assignments that I find difficult to do during the workday. A few of us parents have asked the teacher if it's possible to release the assignments early, but she said that wasn't possible. So in between doing my own work and trying to keep my kid from having a meltdown, I'm also trying to do math homework and scavenger hunts. To complicate matters, I also have an 8-month-old I'm pretty much ignoring except when he's hungry or needs a diaper change. (Because I'm a terrible parent, I've been letting him have obscene amounts of screen time, so he's usually keeping himself entertained.)\n\nDo you have any advice? Or just words of comfort that I'm not a screw-up? My kid hates school, my team is getting annoyed with me, my baby's rotting his brain on crappy YouTube videos, and I'm pretty sure I'm already that annoying parent who's grating on the teacher. Help!\n\n-Losing It\n\nDear LI,\n\nYou are me, and we are you-all of us, every parent, everywhere. Remote school sucks. Working from home while being expected not merely to keep our children distracted so they don't bother us but to actively engage in their \"learning\" process sucks. Everything sucks right now, and that's not your fault.\n\nYou've got two very young children and a job, all needing your attention at once. It sounds to me like you're doing the absolute best you can, and you should give yourself some grace.\n\nYou can and should be empathetic to the challenges that your child's teacher is faced with as she tries to teach a group of ostensibly wiggly and weary 6-year-olds, but not to the detriment of your child. While none of us want to be \"that annoying parent,\" there are times when we can and must speak to our children's teachers on their behalf. If multiple parents are having a problem keeping up with the pacing of this particular classroom, then it very well may be the case that the teacher needs to make some adjustments in order to allow families to effectively participate. Request a meeting and speak to her at length about your concerns. Encourage other parents to do the same. If you find she is unwilling to work with you all to make things work, you may need to have a conversation with the principal.\n\nAs far as your infant goes, make sure you're choosing educational videos that both delight him and help to sharpen his little brain. Schedule short periods, five minutes or so, throughout the day when you're pausing to give him some cuddles and affection-and don't forget to make time to lavish your 6-year-old with a little extra TLC as well. (Hopefully she's getting periodic breaks from class; consider aligning your downtime with her schedule if you can.)\n\nNone of this is your fault; we are all floundering right about now. Just do your best to keep your babies upbeat-even if that means explaining for the first time that teachers are not always right-and grounded by the fact that they have a parent who loves them and is doing what they can.\n\n• If you missed Tuesday's Care and Feeding column, read it here .\n\n• Discuss this column in the Slate Parenting Facebook group !\n\nDear Care and Feeding\n\nThis year has created a lot of divides, and my family is no exception. I come from a mixed political family (Dad's a Republican, and Mom's a Democrat). While they don't agree, they are logical moderates and have had a happy 40 years of marriage. I was taught that politics was not an appropriate topic at family gatherings since my aunts are extremists and childhood rivals, and their fights never end well. (Example: A brick was once thrown through a window after Thanksgiving dinner.)\n\nI am married to an amazing man who shares my political views, but his family is the polar opposite. Before we met, he was estranged from them for years due to their extremist views. However, he is very passive-aggressive about it; he makes fun of them with friends but never confronts them. We have a 4-year-old daughter. I have kept the peace with my in-laws for the sake of family and my daughter having a relationship with her grandparents, but last Christmas, my husband's extended family thought it would be funny to teach my daughter the phrase \"Make America Great Again\" and have her say it at the dinner table! I was shocked; I have made my views clear and cannot get over them trying to bring my little one into this since she is the only reason we tolerate their politics. (In reality, it is their white supremacy that I abhor.)\n\nThe coronavirus created a great excuse for space, but now my in-laws are looking for \"granddaughter time,\" and I just can't seem to get past this. I have endured insults regarding my own political views and tried to keep my husband from his passive-aggressive retaliation, but I really don't want to make an effort anymore. My daughter has a great relationship with my parents, and my husband adores my dad (another sticking point with his father). Can I cut off contact with this side of the family, or do I have to stick it out for my daughter to have a relationship with her grandparents?\n\n-Is Family More Important?\n\nDear IFMI,\n\nI'm speaking from my heart, and I hope you can receive this.\n\nYou aren't the first, or the last, Democrat who has pondered whether to cut themselves off from such loathsome relatives. Alas, far too many white Americans have chosen their relationship with their loved ones over doing the right thing, and that is one of the reasons we are in this predicament: living under a bigoted, misogynist president who grossly mishandled a pandemic to the point of hosting what may be categorized as a superspreader event, a man who has encouraged white supremacist organizations and counts known white supremacists among his most trusted advisers.\n\nThese in-laws do not just stand diametrically opposed to what you believe in-they have made a spectacle of exposing your child to their nonsense. What value do they offer to your daughter? Family is so often associated with legacy and love; however, they are not the only sources of those things. Your daughter can understand who she is and where she comes from without having to be exposed to white nationalists who very well may plant seeds in her mind that may be difficult to destroy. She has your non-MAGA relatives to dote on her. Friends and community members can stand in the gap for the cousins and aunts or Pop Pop whom she may \"miss out\" on knowing if you and your man do the right thing and cut these losers off for good.\n\nTalk to your husband and let him know you'd prefer to have little to no contact with these people, and that goes for your child as well. Fuck your in-laws. They did this to themselves. Perhaps if there were more social consequences for bigotry, it wouldn't be so popular. Good luck, and I hope you do the right thing for you and your little girl.\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nI've been struggling with depression and anxiety for about a year now, and the pandemic has made it worse. I won't go into detail, but it's pretty bad. I don't have any friends at my high school (my best friends moved away, then there are the COVID protocols, and my dislike of direct eye contact, my introverted nature, and my poor conversation skills have made it very, very difficult to make new friends) so school is no longer enjoyable. Home isn't much better. If I try talking to my parents about depression or anxiety, I get responses like \"just be less sad/nervous,\" or \"pray more\" (I've tried, with mixed results), or \"focus on your interests.\" (When I try to talk about my interests I get shut down with comments like \"Why would you waste that brilliant mind of yours learning about that?\") If I tell them I'd like to see a mental health professional or a therapist or something, they'll say that they will call the doctor, but then nothing happens.\n\nI don't know what to do. We've incurred some unexpected expenses recently, so I'm afraid of being a financial burden on my family, but I cannot keep living like this. I want to feel supported by my parents, not shut down. Do you have any advice?\n\n-I Know They Love Me, But ...\n\nDear IKTLMB,\n\nFirst, let me say that I am so, so proud of you for recognizing you need some support that you aren't receiving and for taking steps to try to figure out what to do to change that. I hope you can be proud of yourself for that as well.\n\nThere are a number of free and low-cost therapy apps and sites that will allow you to speak to a professional from the safety of your home. (I found a great list with some options here .) Pick out one or two that seem like a good fit for you and present the idea to your parents. Hopefully they will recognize that you have taken this step because this is a serious matter to you, and hopefully they will be supportive; perhaps knowing that therapy does not have to be a major expense will help them get past their hesitation to get you into some sort of treatment.\n\nI would also recommend speaking to your teacher or another trusted adult who may be able to speak to your parents on your behalf. It is very important that they come to understand you are fighting a difficult battle, and you deserve their support.\n\nPop culture often depicts teenagers as being sullen, dramatic, and moody for a punchline, or as if misery is merely a component of that time in one's life that cannot be avoided. But while the discomfort of shifting hormones and social complications are practically a given for kids your age, the level of unhappiness you are experiencing right now is not the toll you pay for being a high school student. Furthermore, many families lack experience when it comes to dealing with matters of mental health; unfortunately, that leads some adults to disregard their children's feelings, or suggest that prayer and good intentions alone can \"fix\" things.\n\nI'm not making excuses for your parents, nor am I suggesting that they are simply unable to do better than they have. Rather, I just want you to understand that it isn't a failure to articulate your needs, or a lack of urgency behind them, that has led your parents to disregard your feelings. The world does not encourage adults to listen to children for understanding, and that is a serious problem. I hope you know that you are both heard and understood in this moment, and that I am rooting for you. Do not give up on yourself, and do not give up on feeling better-you can, and you will! Please keep us posted.\n\n-Jamilah\n\nMy kid is 15 months old and has discovered he can make himself vomit by sticking his finger down his throat. He only does this when he is in a high chair or car seat. If I try to stop him from doing it, he enjoys the attention and will escalate the behavior, so I'm thinking I need to let it happen, but it's pretty hard to be chill when your kid is covered in vomit.

      "text": "What Are Police Thinking?\n\nListen to What Next:\n\nLike a lot of people, Michael Sierra-Arévalo doesn't watch those police videos anymore. You know the ones: the bodycam footage and the cellphone videos. Last week, there was one showing a police officer killing 13-year-old Adam Toledo in Chicago, even though he had his hands up. And then there was one showing a cop in Minneapolis confusing her gun for her Taser, before shooting 20-year-old Daunte Wright during a traffic stop. \"I spent a lot of time watching videos like that throughout most of my time in graduate school,\" Sierra-Arévalo said. \"And the more videos I watched, the clearer and clearer it became to me that the empirical observable reality of the video was actually not that important for what was happening in the world outside.\"\n\nMichael Sierra-Arévalo, who teaches at the University of Texas in Austin, studies policing and has spent hundreds of hours observing the cops in three different big city departments across the country. In his research, he's anonymized the departments: The city he calls \"Elmont\" is on the East Coast; \"West River\" is out West; and the town he named \"Sunshine\" is in the Southwest. He's thought a lot about the way police think about their jobs and how they speak to one another about the work they do. And when he sees these videos come across his news feeds, he know the police and the public will have a very different reaction to the footage.\n\nYou can't understand the violence in these videos without understanding the people perpetuating the violence. On Monday's episode of What Next , I spoke with Sierra-Arévalo to try to understand that perspective. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nMary Harris: You say that those three police departments that you studied all shared a culture-a culture of fear.\n\nMichael Sierra-Arévalo: For any of the officers listening, I know that they would never say they're afraid. They would say that they are vigilant. They would say that they are prepared. And that's the language that they use. In fact, they'll even openly push back: \"We're not scared. We're not training cops to be scared.\" Even though I think it's very easy to see how that is actually the case in many regards. What I talk about in my writing is that the academy in some ways just confirms the most fantastical parts of policing.\n\nHow?\n\nIf you were to ask the average American what they think it means to be a police officer, they'd likely point to a movie or a TV show. They'd point to Cops or Live PD or Training Day or End of Watch or one of these films.\n\nChasing people.\n\nChasing people, kicking in doors, getting in gunfights, making arrests. That is a very romantic version of what policing is.\n\nHow's that different from what they actually do?\n\nWell, it's crushingly boring is the first thing. It's a lot of driving in circles. And when you're not driving in circles, you're going to calls that have little or nothing to do with violence. If it is violence, more commonly, it's things like a fight between roommates. It's domestic abuse. Not that that's not important, but it's not a quadruple shooting or a double homicide or a gang war or what you see in TV and movies. And in some ways, the people that align with that view of what policing is, they're not exactly disabused of it when they go into the academy. From the first day in the academy, you are taught that officer safety is your No. 1 concern.\n\nOfficer safety not public safety?\n\nIt's never stated that police life is more important than public life, but in practice what officers learn is that I actually can't keep anybody safe if I'm dead. Ergo, keeping myself alive is the most important thing that I can do in order for me to do my job.\n\nSo you're taught to be vigilant about your own safety first for these sort of reasons of protecting the people around you.\n\nThat's the way that it gets framed. The idea is that the public is the sheep, and there are the wolves that would do them harm. And we as police officers must learn to use violence in a way that defends the defenseless. And in order for us to be able to do that, we have to make sure that we are safe. To be clear, there is a lot of discussion of sacrifice. There is a lot of discussion of bravery and laying down one's life. But again, in practice, we're not talking about an active shooter every day or every week or every month. It's about these low-level interactions that still demand constant vigilance and a willingness to engage in violence to stay safe at all costs.\n\nYou told this story about how in all of the places you visited, you noticed the officers had this habit when they were doing a traffic stop of touching the trunk of the person that they'd pulled over. And you started asking them why. And it was revelatory to you. Could you explain?\n\nI first saw it in Elmont, and I didn't really think anything of it. I just remembered it. And so I go to my next city, West River, and I see it happened really early on when I began riding along. And so I asked the officer-and he was a young officer, Mexican American guy, military veteran who had just joined the force-and he said, \"You're trained to do that because we want to make sure the trunk of the car is closed, because we want to make sure that if there's a gunman hiding in that trunk, that they can't jump out and ambush us.\" I was surprised.\n\nWas there any reason to believe that there was a gunman in the trunk when you were on a traffic stop with him?\n\nI would answer your question with what they might ask, which is: How do you know there isn't one? And that's the kind of logic that underlies this behavior. There always could be. And technically speaking, in a mathematical sense, they're not wrong that there could be. It's Schrödinger's gunman in the trunk. And they behave as such. They do these things on the grounds that it could be the thing that potentially saved their lives. But I even asked him, \"OK, have you ever heard of that actually happening?\" He said, \"No.\" I said, \"Well, seeing as how you can't think of a time that's ever happened, could you at least admit that the probability of that happening is very, very low?\" And his response is, \"Yeah, it's low, but that's how we're trained. We don't train to stop granny. We train for the worst-case scenario. We train for someone to try and hurt us, to have a gun.\" The gist was that the potential cost is just too high to not do this. And I think that logic, that way of understanding why police do what they do, allows police to defend almost anything that they do. Every stop, every interaction can be defended in that way.\n\nWhen I looked at your research, I noticed that you were looking at this idea of the \"danger imperative,\" which drives cops and how they behave and influences officer safety. But you talk about how that danger imperative is putting police themselves in harm's way. You talk about stuff like how making cops scared that something could go wrong leads them to do things like drive at high speeds without seat belts, which puts them at risk. And I thought that was a really interesting choice because it seemed to me like you were trying to talk to cops and get them to focus on the ways their behavior might hurt themselves-be a little selfish-before they thought about how those choices could hurt people in the Black and brown community. Was that an intentional decision on your part?\n\nFor me, it was more an emergent conclusion. When I was in the field, I began to understand that it was officer safety-it was this core oriented principle of their day-to-day life on the street-that I began to see that it was all connected. And one of the things that was mundane until I realized that was the seat belt. It was this unquestioned behavior that was supposed to keep them safe, that was supposed to allow them to exit the vehicle quickly and was supposed to allow them to reach their pistol unencumbered. But I could see that behavior, as the ride along with their seat belt on when we're doing 85 on a one-way street in the middle of the night... That's when I was white-knuckling it. Not when we were contacting somebody who was shoplifting. That's not when I was scared. I was scared when we were doing the driving stuff, and that's when I looked at the statistics and I began to try to understand how this becomes baked into your daily practices in a way that because you can't see it as anything but helping you is getting everybody hurt. You're plowing into churches. You're plowing into light poles, and it's costing the department money, and it's just all bad and it's all revolving around the same cultural value, the danger imperative. \"I need to stay safe no matter what, even if it gets me killed.\"\n\nI think you've made this really good case that officer safety is in some ways a hurdle for police forces to get over in terms of understanding how they behave toward the public. But one thing I keep thinking about is the fact that the United States has more police shootings than other places, but it also just has more guns. Did you think about that, too?\n\nIt's not possible to understand the manifestations of policing as we know it today in the U.S. without considering that there are more guns than there are people in this country. Guns are talked about ad nauseum in the academy. You cover things like edged weapons and blunt instruments and just people without weapons, but the No. 1 threat is always going to be a gun. And to your point, the police in the U.S. do get victimized with firearms more than officers in, say, Germany or Wales. It's naïve to think that that's not a possibility here. I think that what my work tries to point to is that there are costs to this kind of behavior. Some of those behaviors are things like the seat belts and the speeding that gets cops killed. That's part of it. But it's actually about understanding that if you treat even the most mundane interaction as one that might escalate into violence at any moment, how you police is going to be different. That interaction is going to be imbued with different kinds of emotions. There's going to be a different kind of interaction with that citizen.\n\nI think a lot about what cops need guns for. You mentioned how when you were on your ride alongs, so much of what the police officers did was mundane. When you think about a solution here, when you think about some way to move through this moment, do you think about parceling out what the police do into different jobs that are done by different kinds of people who may or may not have firearms?\n\nYeah, it's very much at the center of this current discussion around defunding and abolition. Do we continue to have this outsized reliance on police to solve our problems? Police do a shocking amount of things that they're actually very poorly equipped to do. They deal with mental illness, they deal with homelessness, they deal with substance abuse, they deal with runaways. They deal with these petty disputes over fence lines. There's no reasonable reason for them to do all of these things, unless you operate in an environment where you can with a straight face, say, \"Well, we need to have armed agents go do this because at any one of these interactions, there could be guns.\" And that's this really awful equilibrium that we're stuck in. There's no way for us to address the fact at present about there being so many guns. And so we continue to send police to more and more and more and more things because there are still more and more and more and more guns.\n\nAnd so when the police say sometimes flippantly, like, \"Oh, yeah, you're going to have a social worker do that?,\" I take their point, which is that eventually if we begin sending social workers unarmed into situations, one of them is going to get hurt. It's going to happen. It will happen. Is that a reason to not do it? I think that's a different conversation. I think that we have to think about what the costs are and who bears that cost. Currently, the way we set up policing, the cost is borne by officers who may get shot and then by citizens who have become prey of police violence. That's who currently bears cost. And I think we're coming to a place where we don't think that it needs to be that way. We don't want it to be that way, but we have to address firearms. I don't think there's any way that you actually get to a healthy equilibrium without addressing how many deadly weapons are floating around and how easy they are to get hold of.\n\nYou did this research where you spent all this time with officers, did you ever think about going back to those departments and telling them what you found? Were they even interested in hearing that?\n\nI have shared it with some officers. And I actually had an officer from West River who read a paper that I published on commemoration-on how the commemoration of police death underlies and animates this culture around death and avoiding it at all costs and the danger of the work-and she wrote back 11 single-spaced pages after she read it.\n\nWhoa. What'd she say?\n\nShe, on the one hand, says things like, Yeah, I tried to avoid the officers that seemed really obsessed with this version of culture that I write about this or that view the public as enemies. But then she came back to these instances where her life was under threat. She talked about one instance in which she got into a wrestling match with a suspect in a parking lot alone in the rain. She was attacked and was beaten in the head with an object a couple of years before she retired. She has confronted danger. She has confronted violence. And in some ways, once you do that, from an officer's perspective, it's difficult to not see the world as if it could careen into catastrophe at any moment. All of my statistics, all of my writing, is all moot when you've seen the worst of humanity for decades. She's seen awful things, and she feels misunderstood. And I think a lot of officers feel that way.\n\nIt's hard to listen to that story or listen to you talk about your research at all and avoid the fact that it seems like if we're going to make policing safer, it requires turning the entire culture of policing inside out, which is hard when you have a disaggregated system the way our police structure is right now. I understand why you sound tired.\n\nI'm resigned to this not being something that's going to get solved today or tomorrow. Some people thought that Michael Brown was going to be the catalyst and that was going to change everything. I was one of those people. I was someone that felt something in the air. I was young. I was, like, 24 years old. I didn't remember the '90s of Rodney King. And I certainly don't remember the civil rights era those decades before me. But something felt different with Michael Brown.\n\nThe past week has not been a great week, but then I'm encouraged when I hear a new generation of kids that I don't have to convince them that policing has problems. I hear from new officers that they understand that there are problems. There are chiefs that are changing their tune. There's a growing recognition that unions are a problem, that our laws and our policies are set up in a way that this is going to continue to happen. So the recognition of that is encouraging. But I'm under no illusions. This is not going to get solved with one bill. This is not going to get solved with one new training. This is our heritage. This is what America has always been. And it will continue to be unless we choose to make changes.\n\nGet more news from Mary Harris every weekday.\n\nSlate is the place that gave me the freedom to create What Next alongside a small team of dedicated producers.

      "text": "I Learned to Think Like a \"Warrior Cop\"\n\nPop quiz! What is the third thing-besides weapons and skills-that you need to survive armed combat? Is it:\n\nA. Ammunition? B. Body armor? C. Tactical advantage? D. The will to kill?\n\nThe answer is D, obviously-or at least it would be obvious if you knew that the question is part of an online course, called \" On Combat ,\" that is steeped in a pseudo-academic field called \"killology,\" and that the instructor and creator, Dave Grossman , is the foremost killologist on the planet. When I decided recently to learn how to be a warrior cop, Grossman's course is where I turned.\n\nI am not a cop and will almost certainly never become one. But earlier this year, I became very interested in understanding how police officers think-how the mindsets they nurture might be related to outcomes such as the killings of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky, and George Floyd in Minneapolis, and the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The nationwide protest movement that erupted in May has called attention to the problem of overaggressive and racist policing in America, raising some very specific questions about police training and threat-assessment methods, situational escalation, and police tolerance of community dissent. In the background of all of this is the ongoing militarization of the American police department. Many cops these days are functionally indistinguishable from soldiers-in terms of the gear they use, the image they project, and the mindset that they embody.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons for this evolution. As Radley Balko writes in his 2013 Rise of the Warrior Cop , much of it has to do with federal incentives for police departments to pursue this country's endless war on drugs. But another answer is that there is a cottage industry of trainers and consultants who encourage police to see their beats as a battlefield.\n\nA retired Army lieutenant colonel with a master's of education in counseling psychology , Dave Grossman is one of America's best-known independent police trainers-and one of the foremost exponents of the \"warrior cop\" mindset. Under the aegis of his Killology Research Group -he defines killology as \"the scholarly study of the destructive act, just as sexology is the scholarly study of the procreative act\"-Grossman travels the country offering continuing-education seminars to cops and cop-adjacents. He musters scientific research, anecdotal evidence, and a boatload of presuppositions in order to prepare his students for the realities of combat, while valorizing the notion that the thin blue line is humanity's last bulwark against total societal collapse.\n\nMany have argued that \"warrior cop\"-style training seminars teach law enforcement officers to start from a place of fear, which can lead them to quickly turn peaceful situations violent. The officer who shot and killed Philando Castile during a 2016 traffic stop in Falcon Heights, Minnesota, had attended a \"Bulletproof Warrior\" course co-taught by Grossman and a colleague, Jim Glennon, two years earlier. Over his career, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune , that officer had clocked more than 100 hours of trainings on topics such as firearms usage, street survival, and the use of force-but had only attended two hours of deescalation training.\n\nA lot of cops want to hear from Grossman-and so did I. Though I couldn't take one of his in-person courses- Grossman's touring calendar , normally packed with engagements, has been empty since the pandemic began-I decided to spend $79 to take the online version of \"On Combat\" that can be found on his Grossman Academy website (the other courses are \"On Killing\" and \"The Bulletproof Mind\"). The class is divided into eight hourlong units. Each is effectively an enhanced PowerPoint presentation, with Grossman narrating the slides that appear on screen. Occasionally, as a treat, Grossman himself will pop up on screen to tell a story or underscore a point. Each unit ends with a five-question multiple-choice quiz, but the quizzes are not particularly challenging, and students can take them over and over again until they get a passing grade.\n\nI came away with a certificate of completion from Grossman Academy (the o in \"Grossman\" is a rifle sight), an abiding dislike for the term sheepdog , and a much better sense of how and why so many American police officers seem to believe that the streets of America are effectively a war zone-and why the average American police department seems so resistant to reform.\n\nYou can define a police officer's job in a lot of ways: to solve crimes, to maintain order, to help people in need. In the first unit of \"On Combat,\" Grossman characterizes cops as basically like the Avengers, but with more body armor and less public accountability. \"Think about it,\" Grossman says, \"if we went but a single generation without men and women who are willing to go out every day and confront evil, then within the span of that generation we should surely be both damned and doomed.\"\n\nGrossman's America is a terrifying place where police are both the primary targets of and defenders against superpredation. \"Increasingly the police must face organized opponents armed with assault rifles and bombs,\" Grossman says at the outset of the class, citing an \"explosion in violent crime\" and an \"extraordinary rise in violence\" in the streets of America . (The online course bears a copyright date of 2014; many of the incidents that Grossman cites throughout the course happened in the 1990s.) Though many independent sources show that the violent crime rate in America has steadily declined since the early 1990s, Grossman maintains that America is now scarier than ever-and that cops may well be the ones with the most to fear. \"We know that if it were not for all the body armor, bulletproof vests worn by officers, law enforcement fatalities in the United States would easily be double or even triple what they are today,\" Grossman asserts. \"If this is not war, then you tell me what is.\"\n\nWell, war is war: combat waged between states, or states and state-adjacent groups, or states and organized insurrections that hope to topple the state. What Grossman is describing is violent crime, the penalties for which are prescribed by civilian codes of law. But Grossman, who spent decades in the U.S. Army, doesn't just blur the line between soldiers and police officers: He completely erases it.\n\nWhen people talk about military-style policing, they are often referring to the militarized gear and weaponry that many police departments prefer these days: the body armor, the semi-automatic rifles, the armored SWAT Humvees equipped to recapture Fallujah. But the gear is just a symptom of these departments' gradual adoption of the premise that the world is now a theater of war and that battles are most easily won through the liberal use of shock and awe. \"You've probably heard of the Big Bang Theory,\" Grossman says in Unit 2. \"I call this the Bigger Bang Theory, which states that, all other things being equal, in combat, whoever makes the bigger bang wins.\" Combat has clear military connotations, and Grossman's frequent use of the term undergirds the course's martial framing.\n\nGrossman wants cops to develop \"autopilot responses\" so that they will not be caught flat-footed when confronted by an armed suspect. \"Is it possible to see a gun pointed at you, draw your own weapon, and shoot without conscious thought?\" Grossman asks. \"Not only is it possible, in this case it is highly desirable. Of course, his training must be state-of-the-art, so that he knows instantly that the threat is indeed a gun, and not a wallet or a cellphone.\" In practice, many cops have had trouble clearing this threat-assessment barrier.  (\"You shot four bullets into him, sir. He was just getting his license and registration, sir,\" Castile's girlfriend told the cop who shot and killed him.)\n\nGrossman makes sure to clarify that deadly force should be used \"only under the rules of engagement,\" and very few people would disagree with that caveat. But rules of engagement is also a military term, and its usage is just another willful conflation of policing and war. Grossman invokes terrorist attacks, school shootings, and a \"large-scale epidemic of preteen and teenage mass murderers\" who have been trained to kill on \"murder simulator\" video games-he spends a lot of time on this last point, and it is fairly exhausting-in order to argue that your local Officer Friendly should prepare himself to go ahead and unleash his inner G.I. Joe.\n\n\"As a cop, or a peacekeeper, your job is not to kill. It is to serve and protect. To do that, you may have to kill,\" he says in Unit 4. \"The most effective way to stop someone is to fire a bullet into his central nervous system. It is up to God and the paramedics as to whether the man dies. Your job is to stop the deadly threat, and the most effective way to do that is to make the threat die.\" Throughout \"On Combat,\" Grossman is very, very clear that police officers must be ready to manifest the will to kill-and to deal with the aftermath of having done so.\n\n\"On Combat\" borrows from Grossman's book of the same name, which he co-wrote with Loren W. Christensen. In it, Grossman draws on his academic background to break down the neurological, physiological, and emotional responses that participants can expect to experience before, during, and after combat situations. It's true that cops who are better able to control and understand their bodies and emotions while on duty are probably less likely to act recklessly. But Grossman's goal isn't to stop cops from killing; it's to train them to do so more efficiently. To this end, he wants his students to understand how their minds and bodies work so that they can suppress any intrinsic resistance when it's time to pull the trigger.\n\n\"Any natural or learned resistance to killing, any sense of the sanctity of human life, any human emotions, any remorse or compassion at the moment of truth can all be overcome and overwhelmed with training,\" Grossman says in Unit 2. What's more, he says, even a post-traumatic stress reaction can be averted with training. He acknowledges that killing in the line of duty can be very unsettling. He presents a lot of material on how a cop might expect to feel after having done so, and how their colleagues and family can help them process and cope with the experience. Grossman does not deny the reality of PTSD. But he also argues that cops who kill need not be scarred for life by their actions. \"If you do the rationalization and acceptance ahead of time, if you prepare yourself and immerse yourself in the lore and spirit of mature warriors, past and present, then the lawful, legitimate use of deadly force does not have to be a self-destructive or traumatic event,\" Grossman says.\n\nGrossman wants his students to become \"mature warriors\" who can sleep at night untroubled by the bodies they've left in their wake. Though Grossman recently told the Spokane, Washington, Spokesman-Review that the warrior model is not central to his training methods, it was certainly a large part of the course I took, which anyone can take right now. \"We are warriors,\" he says in Unit 1, and the theme recurs throughout the course. Unit 4 literally features a slide of a uniformed cop standing next to a medieval suit of armor, as if to underscore the ostensible link between the paladins of yore and the SWAT teams of today.\n\nGrossman refers to his students as \"sheepdogs,\" battle-ready protectors who are innately responsible for-and tacitly superior to-their noncombatant charges. \"We know that the sheep live in denial; that is what makes them sheep. They do not want to believe that there is evil in the world,\" says Grossman. \"They can accept the fact that fires can happen, which is why they want fire extinguishers, fire sprinklers, fire alarms, and fire exits throughout their kids' schools. But many of them are outraged at the idea of putting an armed police officer in their kids' school.\" (\"On Combat\" doesn't consider whether putting armed cops in schools may well be a solution in search of a problem. There is plenty of evidence to suggest that the presence of armed officers does not serve to deter school shooters or reliably stop shootings in progress.)\n\nBut what recourse do the sheep have when the sheepdog becomes the wolf? The course spends no time acknowledging any of the ways in which cops may abuse their power, and it certainly does not acknowledge the long history of ongoing mistrust between many communities and their police departments. Though I did not expect him to-the name of the course is \"On Combat,\" after all, not \"A People's History of Police Work\"-Grossman does not address the social construction of crime and criminality, or the historically racist coding of \"tough on crime\" policies and rhetoric, or the political origins of this country's endless drug war, or any other factors that might complicate his Manichean thesis. He sees no oppression in the sight of warrior cops forever riding roughshod through \"bad\" neighborhoods like members of an occupying army. He does not stop to consider that treating the \"war on crime\" like an actual war tacitly encourages cops to take less care with the lives of their \"enemies\"-nor does he acknowledge that those disposable lives are all too often Black ones.\n\nWhile Grossman does spend part of Unit 3 discussing the phenomenon of civilians filming on-duty cops, he does so in the course of disparaging the tapers' motives and advancing his \"cops are under siege\" motif: \"Sometimes these videographers do creative editing to make the police look bad and then take the doctored videotape to the media.\" Grossman has little use for the media. \"Do the media people know that they are hurting people? Of course. They even admit it. Do they care? Apparently not,\" Grossman says in Unit 6. \"We are dealing with an industry functioning at the moral level of drug dealers; in fact, one of their objectives is to convince us to legalize drugs.\" He also blames violent video games and entertainment products as prime factors in America's alleged decline and fall-an argument you hear often from gun proponents looking for an alternative explanation for shootings. \"Violent video games are murder simulators,\" he says, \"except when police officers and soldiers use them for training, in which case they are combat simulators.\"\n\nTo Grossman, who makes much of school shootings as the proving grounds for game-addled, kill-crazed teens, the difference is clear. To others, the difference between \"murder\" and \"combat\" might not be so obvious. In 2019, according to Education Week , eight people in America were killed in a school shooting; 35 people were killed that way in 2018. But 999 people in America were shot and killed by the police in 2019, according to the Washington Post , and in 2018, 990 people were killed that way. Even if 95 percent of these deadly police shootings were unquestionably justifiable, the body count of the remaining 5 percent would still be higher than the body count from the school shootings that Grossman repeatedly cites as proof that it's war out there.\n\nBut the streets of America are not a war zone. Police work is not combat. Cops are not soldiers. Property damage is not a capital offense, Black men and women are not targets for shooting practice, and Americans demanding police reform are not tantamount to some fifth column of saboteurs. In the wake of the Floyd case and other incidents, communities across America are asking their police departments to reconsider their roles and responsibilities, to pursue demilitarization, and to learn to deescalate the dangerous situations that they too often create.\n\nGrossman has not, as far as I can tell, gone on record with his thoughts about this summer's police reform movement. But in recent years, his style of trainings has seen a backlash from municipalities that now find them troubling, as well as a counterbacklash from police officials who seemingly can't get enough of the \"will to kill.\" When Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey banned warrior cop-style courses in 2019, the local police union offered to pay for any cop who wanted to take one. When a woman in Spokane, Washington, launched a petition earlier this year to urge the county sheriff's office to cancel an upcoming \"mindset bootcamp\" seminar from Grossman, the sheriff vowed that the course would go on as planned. \"I am tired of being bullied by political rights and left,\" the sheriff told the Spokesman-Review ; earlier this month, he told a local television station that the opposition was spearheaded by \"a group of progressive socialist[s]\" who are \"actually promoting a lie about the training.\"\n\nYou want to know the truth about the training? Take it from me, a proud holder of a certificate of completion from Grossman Academy: \"On Combat\" teaches its students to fear and resent the people they serve, to willfully mistake this contempt for bravery, and to believe that heroism is conferred by the barrel of a smoking gun. This philosophy, as manifested by the countless police officers and officials who subscribe to it, is and will continue to be one of the foremost impediments to meaningful efforts at police reform in towns across America. \"If we do not keep the warrior in the mix, we become glorified social workers with guns,\" Grossman says very early in \"On Combat\"-and even if that's what the communities whose taxes pay their salaries want from their police officers, Grossman implies that it is those officers' patriotic duty to resist.\n\n\"In this dark hour, our mission is to rise up and nurture the next generation of warriors,\" Grossman says at the very end of the course, his words illustrated by a photograph of a cop standing in the middle of a city street. The cop's arms are crossed. He wears mirrored sunglasses, a baseball cap that says \"POLICE,\" and a resolute half-smirk on his face, as if daring the sheep and wolves alike to try to move him off his spot.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Playing Good Cop\n\nIn early April in Baltimore, a woman filmed a police officer walking toward her. \"Hey, Officer Friendly with the cherry cheeks!\" she shouts, taunting the unmasked policeman. He pushes past and coughs right in her face. (The sergeant was later reassigned .) In June, Baltimore rapper Kaflow Kaboom released a song sampling the video, called \"Officer Friendly,\" which slams the officer's actions and other miscarriages of the criminal justice system: \"So fuck you to Officer Friendly/ And by the way, fuck you to Zimmerman.\"\n\nThis was a particularly bitter pandemic-themed update, but Officer Friendly-the elementary school educational program, most popular from the 1970s through the 1990s, that positioned the police officer as kindly community protector-has been fodder for civilian satire for years. You can buy a poster, originally printed in 1991 ( now reprinted for the benefit of the Bail Project and the Black Visions Collective), featuring the words \"Officer Friendly?\" in blazing white against a blue background, over a threatening figure in a gas mask brandishing a huge weapon. Sir Mix-a-Lot's 1992 single \"One Time's Got No Case,\" about being profiled, stopped, and questioned by racist police officers, tossed in the reference : \"The cops throw me out in the street/ They found my gun like thieves/ Officer Friendly has got a new beat.\" A grunge band from Rochester used the name for a couple years in the mid-1990s; more recently, on the zombie-apocalypse show The Walking Dead , characters call Rick Grimes-small-town sheriff turned violent survivalist-\"Officer Friendly,\" coating the words with sarcasm.\n\nFor those who've been subjected to police brutality or have good reason to be suspicious of authority figures, the very idea of \"Officer Friendly\" is absurd. But for another kind of person (white, comfortable, middle-class), the name triggers thoughts of a lost utopia of public service and well-executed community policing. Remember when police would help us find our lost dogs, pat us on the head, and send us home with a tinfoil badge? In our moment of reassessing the role of law enforcement in society, this sort of \"good cop\" nostalgia gets used to neutralize any critical sentiment; you can find it everywhere, from children's entertainment like Paw Patrol and Lego to adult debates over \"bad apples,\" defunding, and abolition. But a look at the origins and intentions of Officer Friendly reveals the purposeful construction of that nostalgia-and suggests one reason why \"copaganda\" exerts such a powerful influence on the American imagination.\n\nThe Chicago Police Department launched the first official Officer Friendly program in 1966, and soon afterward, the Sears-Roebuck Foundation came on board to sponsor it. By 1979, according to the Department of Education, the Officer Friendly program was in 233 communities , serving mostly classrooms of kindergarteners through second graders, kids age 5-8. At the height of his influence in the late '80s, Friendly's beat was quite large indeed: In an interview with the Chicago Tribune , a program director at the Sears-Roebuck Foundation reported that the program was in 350 communities, reaching 1.5 million students, at a cost of $400,000 to the foundation.\n\nI got a set of early Officer Friendly materials from a secondhand seller on Amazon: one children's workbook and one \"Teachers' Resource Unit,\" both sponsored by the Board of Education and Police Department of Kansas City, Missouri, and copyrighted in 1968 by the Sears-Roebuck Foundation. The workbook is full of blocky line drawings of square-jawed policemen-half of the officers pictured are white, half are Black, all are men-helping small children reunite with parents, waving from patrol cars, and answering 911 calls from worried kids. (The teachers' book recommends making students wait until after the curriculum has concluded to do the coloring, because they'll pay more attention that way.)\n\nThis, of course, was socialization-making children into the kinds of young adults who respected police. Tamara Gene Myers, a historian at the University of British Columbia, wrote a book about what she calls the \"youth turn\" in policing. \"In the 19 th century, the neighborhood cop wouldn't have necessarily involved children in his work,\" she said in an interview, but police at the end of the 19 th century came to believe that children could be \"saved\" from becoming criminals-in other words, preemptively rehabilitated. This shift in thinking led to a spate of programs that were intended to proactively control juvenile delinquency, by taking what officials would call \"pre-delinquents\" and convincing them not to lead a \"life of crime.\" Scattered districts experimented with putting police liaison officers in schools as early as 1939. Other examples of the kinds of programs police departments started were Police Athletic Leagues, Police Explorers, and the \"school\" or \"safety patrol\"-a classic activity of the postwar era, where kids dressed up in uniforms and policed other kids, like \"junior traffic cops.\"\n\nTraffic and traffic safety were always integral to Officer Friendly. For children in third grade, the teacher's handbook proposed, a discussion about travel could offer a chance to talk about police officers' jobs in directing traffic. \"Decide who must take the most responsibility for their safety (the pupils themselves),\" the book suggested, \"and then think about the responsibility they assume when traveling to the store, school, or around the community.\" The teachers' handbook also recommends reading Policeman Small , by Lois Lenski, with the children-an adorable board book from 1962 that is about a traffic cop .\n\nCars became a much bigger part of American city life right around the time cops became a much bigger part of American childhood. The need to teach kids to \"look both ways\" or wait for the light to cross, Myers writes, created a natural opportunity for police officers to become \"educators.\" If this sounds like a conspiracy theory, that's not quite it-it's more that the increasing danger of the streets, especially for the impulsive and exuberant early-elementary-age kids right in the Officer Friendly target demographic, gave police who wanted a PR boost for other reasons a convenient opening. \"They weren't fabricating the problem,\" Myers said in our interview, \"but it was also this way that they were sort insinuating themselves in childhood.\" Who, after all, could object to safety education?\n\nLeveraging their avuncular image with little kids, police also hoped to gain public relations points in the community at large. There's an outline of the way the program worked in Norfolk, Virginia, public schools in the 1970s in the FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin . Police officers developed lesson plans and activity books, with assistance from the schools; the Sears-Roebuck Foundation paid for teachers to make the activity books and print them. In 1976-77, officers visited the kindergarten through second grade classrooms three times. In the first visit, the Officer Friendly would show and tell their police equipment, and present slides that showed him doing normal, everyday things: watching TV with his family, feeding a baby, mowing a lawn.\n\nThose \"humanizing\" slides were key to the Officer Friendly project. In a 1986 interview with the New York Times, Sears-Roebuck Foundation representative Mary Strahlendorf recalled the program's genesis: \"In the 1960s, it was a very turbulent time. Police were called names and we felt there was a need for the children to see police officers as human beings.\" The police officer interviewed for the story, Felicia Perry, said that the Officers Friendly on her force were trying to counter what the kids saw on TV. \"They have one of two extreme attitudes about police officers,\" Perry said. \"They either think we're a superhero or we're totally stupid.\"\n\nThe television may have played a role, but the bigger problem, as Officer Friendly proponents saw it, were the kids' families. \"Remember that at the turn of the 20 th century, the police's object was to protect property,\" Myers said in our interview. \"So even if children in the 20 th century didn't have a direct experience of the police, what their parents or grandparents would have remembered, especially working-class people, they would remember the police being used as strikebreakers, against them. Not protecting them, or their children.\"\n\nThis was another problem that midcentury programs like Officer Friendly were meant to correct. A technical assistance bulletin published by the Department of Education in 1979 for schools interested in implementing the program made it explicit: \"The public image of law enforcement officers-especially as perceived by children-suffers from negative attitudes expressed by parents, siblings, and friends as well as the influence of television police shows.\"\n\nThe 1968 teacher's handbook instructs teachers to allow students to take their own workbooks home to \"share with family and friends, in order to better acquaint the child's community with the positive efforts and contributions afforded the child as part of his classroom experiences.\" Those working on the Officer Friendly program hoped that the kids would defend police officers to the older, more experienced people in their households, operating-all unawares-as junior agents for the public affairs project of Officer Friendly.\n\nBut did the program work? Did it achieve its stated goal of making children more comfortable with police? The answer seems to have been \"Yes\"-at least in the short term. A team of psychologists from Old Dominion University, led by Valerian J. Derlega, studied the Officer Friendly program in Norfolk, Virginia, in the mid-1970s. The psychologists evaluated second graders who had, and hadn't, experienced the program in their classrooms. Before and after the program, the children drew a picture of a police officer and answered simple questions: \"A police officer is nice. Yes or no?\" Those whose classes had used the workbook were more likely to draw pictures of police helping victims: \"A patrolman helping a child whose bicycle had been stolen,\" \"a patrolman interviewing a person whose apartment had been burglarized.\"\n\nThen, the researchers tested whether those who had a real-life Officer Friendly come into the classroom would be more comfortable near a random uniformed police officer. They brought children into a hallway and told them that an unknown police officer standing some distance away wanted to talk with them. Those who had experienced the program were more willing to stand closer to the officer than those who had not. White and Black children \"improved\" equally in their positive attitudes toward police, but Black children had less favorable attitudes before and after the program. As far as I can see, the researchers didn't do a longitudinal study, asking third grade or fifth grade or seventh grade kids who had Officers Friendly in their kindergarten classrooms about their feelings toward police and comparing those kids with others who hadn't gone through the program. But other work done around the same time found that young children's positive affect toward policemen predictably drained away as they aged, with Black children expressing negative feelings toward police at a younger age than white kids.\n\nSome adults remembering Officer Friendly recall the visits of those officers with affection, pointing to them as a way policing \"used to be.\" In the wake of the death of Laquan McDonald in Chicago in 2014, columnist Monica Holland recalled her own Officer Friendly with a kind of pointed nostalgia: \"He is in heaven now, but I remember years ago when Officer Friendly came to our school. Police Officer James McDaniel was a tall handsome man who always smiled at us kids and knew us each by name ... \" Holland believed that, in her school, the program worked to acclimate children to the presence of police-exactly what it was supposed to do: \"As we grew into teens and young adults, seeing a police officer walking the beat or seeing a blue flashing light in our rearview mirror did not strike fear in our hearts. That is, unless we were playing hooky or driving alone with a learner's permit. But that is not the case today.\"\n\nBut adults' memories aren't always sunny, and some remember Officer Friendly with a vague sense of unease. Scott Reeder, writing in 2019, remembered \"Officer Friendly,\" \"in his pressed blue uniform,\" telling a group of second graders about a kid he arrested for stealing a Hershey bar, who couldn't find a job as an adult because he had a \"permanent record.\" As a commenter on a Facebook group post reminiscing about the Officer Friendly program in D.C. noted, \"I remember Officer Friendly used to come from 1 st to 4 th grade, teaching us that the police were our friends. ... Then, in 5 th grade, it went from 'I am your friend' to 'I am not to be trifled with.' That is a very jarring experience.\" Reflecting on all of the examples of 20 th century police youth work she's studied, Tamara Gene Myers underscored that disconnect: \"There's this feeling of protection and benevolence, until . 'I'll protect you, as long as you're on the right side.' \"\n\nThat students' workbook from 1968 ends with the \"Officer Friendly Rules\"-10 of them, starting with \"Play in your yard\" and \"Play on the playground,\" and ending with \"Be a friendly helper in school\" and (ominously) \"Be my friend, always.\" The teacher's handbook suggests the teacher ask children to state a single concept about Officer Friendly while taking attendance. One of the possible concepts they could have learned in the course of the classes: \"All police officers are friendly, if we are friendly.\"\n\nOfficer Friendly, as a program, isn't completely gone, but it's got nowhere near the coverage it had in the 1970s and 1980s. The Sears-Roebuck Foundation announced in February 1990 that it would no longer be funding the national Officer Friendly program; a representative told the Deseret News that \"it's hard to justify continuing to give it the same support when the community and government sector could and should support the program.\" The foundation handed the copyright, logo, and trademark to the Utah Council for Crime Prevention, which had run the program in Utah schools for 12 years. Other localities would need to pay for the program's implementation.\n\nToday, Hampton, Virginia, still has the program, along with Jacksonville, Florida, and Green Bay, Wisconsin, according to reporting by Eric Easter of Urban News Service. In 2018, coverage of the retirement of a police officer in Vernon, Connecticut, Michelle Landry, who had been an Officer Friendly far later than most-between 2014-18-noted that she \"revamped\" the program, bringing in elements of the D.A.R.E. anti-drug curriculum and mixing them with \"topics like bullying, 'drama' between peers, and dealing with strangers.\" And a present-day Houston police officer working in the department's Office of Public Affairs-Community Outreach Unit, Jeremy Lahar, self-publishes a book series using the character name; one of the books in the series addresses children's fear of police. But since the Columbine shootings in 1999, police presence in schools has increasingly come in the form of the school resource officer-a contested figure, who, like the Officers Friendly of years past, is supposed to make kids feel \"safe\" but whose presence in a school often leads to increased student arrests, suspensions, and expulsions.\n\nDespite his semiretirement from schoolhouses, Officer Friendly continues to patrol our collective memory. Criminology scholar Delores D. Jones-Brown invokes Norman Rockwell's 1958 painting for the Saturday Evening Post The Runaway as \"the quintessential image of officer friendly .\" This illustration features a white boy on a stool at a diner, bindle at the base of his stool, shoulder to shoulder with a police officer, who's clearly gently persuading him to go home and make amends with his family. \"The author has often wondered how the scene might be different if the youthful perpetrator were Black,\" Jones-Brown wrote.\n\nYou don't have to look far to find contemporaneous images to situate alongside The Runaway to make this point. In 1965, Anthony Quin was 5, right in the Officer Friendly target demographic. He and his mother, Aylene Quin, of McComb, Mississippi, were on the steps of the state Capitol after seeking an audience with the state's governor to protest violations of voting rights. (They were turned away.) Matt Herron, a photographer who was in attendance, saw a highway patrolman , Hughie Kohler, approach Anthony. Herron wrote that he heard Anthony's mother say, \"Anthony, don't let that man take your flag.\" Herron's photograph is of an officer in uniform wresting away the symbol of promised freedom away from a child who holds onto it fiercely-a child so small, the elastic waistband of his pants will break your heart.\n\nThis image, as much as any cop-car show and tell, represents the historical truth of children's encounters with police in this country. It is not a truth that fits well into the mythos of Officer Friendly and its story of a lost past of protected childhoods, when kids were kept safe by police instead of being handcuffed, roughed up, and suspended from school. But it's the truth nonetheless. The program sold a fictional story of community authority, a utopian dream of good policing-in theory, perhaps an ideal to pursue, in practice, copaganda for the youngest among us.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "No One Becomes a Cop Because It's Safe\n\nScout Schultz.\n\nRemembering Scout Schultz/Facebook\n\nA student at Georgia Tech was shot dead by a police officer Saturday night after refusing to comply with orders. 21-year-old Scout Schultz, who identified as gender nonbinary and used they/them pronouns, was in the midst of what their family's lawyer says was a mental health crisis. A video of Schultz's final moments, filmed from a window shortly before midnight, shows police officers pointing their weapons and shouting \"drop the knife!\" and \"do not move!\" Scout Schultz responds, \"Kill me.\"\n\nWhile the shooting is still being examined by state investigators, it's not too early to make an informed prediction about how the Georgia Tech police will attempt to justify Schultz's death. They will almost certainly argue that this was a clear-cut case of police officers facing a potentially lethal threat and making the reasonable decision to protect themselves from lethal risk.\n\nSome version of this argument has been used to defend countless police officers in the wake of shootings that have struck many Americans as avoidable. Timothy Loehmann said he was scared for his life when he shot Tamir Rice in Cleveland; he thought Rice, who was holding a toy gun, was brandishing a real weapon. Randall Kerrick said he was scared, too, when he shot Jonathan Ferrell outside Charlotte, North Carolina ; he thought Ferrell was lunging toward him with an object in his hand. Dante Servin was also scared when he shot Rekia Boyd in Chicago; he thought one of her friends had pulled out a weapon.\n\nIn each of those cases, a prosecutor , jurors , or a judge accepted the premise that an on-duty shooting can be justified as long as the officer in question had a reasonable (if objectively unwarranted) fear of losing his life if he didn't apply lethal force. There's a certain pragmatism embedded in this logic. Police officers need to make instantaneous high-pressure decisions. If we insist on punishing them for sometimes making the wrong call, we'll hinder their ability to do their jobs. The logical conclusion of this line of argument, then, is that we have to tolerate a few bad, even fatal, decisions in order to make it possible for police to make good ones.\n\nThat's the theory. The facts on the ground are that, according to the Washington Post , 963 people -including 44 who had toy weapons, 48 who were unarmed, and 241 who were known to suffer from mental illness-were shot and killed by police in the United States last year. It may be true that some of those shootings happened because well-intentioned, well-trained officers were forced into impossible situations. It's also true that a lot of those shootings might have been avoided if American police officers weren't trained to be so afraid of the citizens they're supposed to be protecting.\n\nIn May 2015, I wrote about the \" grim canon of videos \" shown to police officers during training. These videos, many of which are shot with dashboard cameras, show a succession of officers being murdered because they waited too long to use deadly force. As I wrote at the time, the videos are meant to serve as \"a chilling reminder to never lose sight of the unpredictability [officers] face on the street-and to resist any political pressure they might feel to forget their training in the face of danger.\"\n\nOne particularly famous video in law enforcement circles shows the 1998 murder of Deputy Kyle Dinkheller of Georgia's Laurens County Sheriff's Office. The three-and-a-half minute \"Dinkheller tape\" shows the deputy pulling over a car on the side of a highway and getting a rifle pulled on him. After ordering the man to put the gun down five times, Dinkheller gets shot, and the man runs back into his truck and drives off.\n\n\"There were multiple times when he would have been justified in using deadly force against that individual with the rifle, and he either hesitated or chose not to do it,\" said Dave Grossi when I interviewed him in 2015. Grossi, a former police lieutenant in upstate New York who spent 12 years as a private law enforcement trainer, told me videos like the Dinkheller tape teach recruits to avoid making tactical mistakes.\n\nThe most striking conversation I had about these videos was with Emanuel Kapelsohn, who sits on the board of directors of the International Association of Law Enforcement Firearms Instructors. \"One of the biggest problems we have in police training today,\" Kapelsohn told me, \"is getting officers to understand when they need to use force and getting them to be willing to use it.\"\n\nHe pointed to a news story about an officer who declined to fire his gun at a suspect who was running toward him while holding his hand in his pocket. Although the officer was feted in the press for his restraint after successfully making the arrest, Kapelsohn sharply criticized his approach after watching body-cam footage of the incident. \"From a professional point of view, the officer made an extremely poor tactical decision and needs to be retrained, not commended,\" he said. \"Whether Ferguson was going through his head, I don't know. Whether Staten Island was going through his head, I don't know. But an officer has to be prepared and trained and capable of shooting someone even though he doesn't want to. This was someone who needed to be shot, should have been shot.\"\n\nThat's the mindset of a person whose job it is to train police officers on how to use their guns. As I wish I'd emphasized when I originally wrote my 2015 story, it's a mindset that is undermined by the relative infrequency with which police officers are killed in the line of duty. According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund , firearms-related officer fatalities peaked in 1973, when 156 officers were shot and killed, then dropped to an average of 87 per year in the 1980s, 68 per year in the 1990s, and 57 per year in the 2000s. In 2016, 64 officers were fatally shot, five of them during the sniper attack in Dallas that July and three more 10 days later during a Missouri man's rampage in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\n\nNo doubt one of the reasons these numbers are not higher is that police officers are trained to fear for their lives. It's thanks in part to the Dinkheller tape and others like it that officers who think they might be in fatal danger tend to act quickly to neutralize the threat. But it is impossible to draw this connection, or to say that police training keeps officers safe, without considering the trade-offs involved, and what those trade-offs mean for civilians-particularly black people and the mentally ill, both groups that are shot by police at a disproportionate rate.\n\nI'm reminded of a December 2015 piece written by my colleague Jamelle Bouie after prosecutors announced that the officers responsible for killing Tamir Rice wouldn't be charged. He wrote:\n\nPart of policing is risk. Not just the inevitable risk of the unknown, but voluntary risk. We ask police to \"serve and protect\" the broad public, which-at times-means accepting risk when necessary to defuse dangerous situations and protect lives, innocent or otherwise. It's why we give them weapons and the authority to use them; why we compensate them with decent salaries and generous pensions; why we hold them in high esteem and why we give them wide berth in procedure and practice.\n\nAlong these same lines, Dallas Morning News columnist Steve Blow wrote a piece in March 2015 interrogating an oft-repeated mantra that has been called \" the first rule of law enforcement \": that the \"No. 1 duty of a police officer is to go home to his or her family at the end of the shift.\"\n\nBlow wrote:\n\n[It] sounds so obvious at first that of course we nod along.\n\nBut wait. Really? Is that the No. 1 duty of a police officer?\n\nIf so, then an officer is always right to shoot in any dangerous encounter. Or potentially dangerous. Or conceivably dangerous. Or most any time.\n\nIf self-preservation is the first and foremost priority of a police officer, then you get what we have seen in recent months and years-a series of unsettling police shootings.\n\nAfter acknowledging that he lacks the courage to do what police officers do, Blow continued:\n\nI so appreciate their willingness to assume the risks of the job.\n\nBut there's the crux of the matter. They have willingly taken a job that involves personal risk. It also requires split-second decision making that must go beyond simple self-preservation.\n\nIf going home safely becomes the overriding priority, that can become another way of saying, \"Shoot first and ask questions later.\"\n\nHow much risk is it fair to ask a police officer to take? Speaking as someone who has never patrolled a dark alley, answered a 911 call, or raced to the scene of a shooting spree, my first inclination is to say, \"I don't know and it's not for me to judge.\"\n\nMy second inclination, though, is to say that it's a police officer's job to take risks the rest of us are unable or unwilling to take. That is why the vast majority of police officers, the ones who perform their duties admirably and selflessly, deserve our respect and admiration. The reason we revere cops isn't their dedication to protecting their own lives. It's their dedication to protecting ours.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Blurred Blue Line\n\nPhoto illustation by Slate . Images by Romaniaboy/Thinkstock, moodboard/Thinkstock, and Jupiterimages/Thinkstock.\n\nThe debate over law enforcement that's been raging in America for the past two years has naturally focused on the decisions police officers make when they're working-not what they do after they punch out for the day. But a new paper by law professor Seth Stoughton, posted online this week in draft form , makes the argument that we've been ignoring an important aspect of policing-namely, the massive amount of moonlighting that cops do for private companies when they're off duty.\n\nFor Stoughton, who teaches at the University of South Carolina School of Law, this is a consequential oversight-particularly because, as he learned when he was a police officer in Tallahassee, Florida, and did moonlighting work for nightclubs and other private entities, officers who take these kinds of gigs typically wear their official police uniforms, further blurring the public's understanding of whether they are on duty or off and whether that matters.\n\nStoughton sent survey questions to about 400 police agencies at the state, county, and city levels, asking them about their policies regarding off-duty work and the amount of time their officers spend doing it. Stoughton got answers from 162 of the agencies, which in total employ about a fifth of the nation's police officers.\n\nI talked with Stoughton about why it's so troubling to think of police officers selling their law enforcement authority to private companies, how prevalent the practice is, and how off-duty opportunities affect the salaries that police departments pay their cops. The conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nBefore I read your paper, I had no idea that police officers were allowed to do off-duty work for private employers while wearing their uniforms and carrying their service weapons. And I had no idea that, as you report in the paper, some agencies require officers to wear their uniforms while working off-duty for private employers.\n\nWhere do you live?\n\nNew York.\n\nOh, yeah-New York does it.\n\nIt just strikes me as crazy, though I'm not sure I can totally explain why. You've thought about this for longer, so maybe you can tell me: What is it that feels intuitively wrong about this?\n\nI've gotten this reaction a lot while talking to people about this phenomenon. I think people react negatively because we think of policing as a public good. It's counterintuitive and incongruous to think of a public police officer who is being paid by, and working on behalf of, a private employer. It's just not what they do, right? Fundamentally it doesn't line up with our intuitive conception of what policing is.\n\nI knew officers sometimes took off-duty gigs, working as bouncers or security guards. But the idea that they'd be in uniform is shocking to me. Does that mean that off-duty officers doing freelance work are allowed to do all the same stuff they can do when they're on duty, like arrest people and search them and use force on them?\n\nYeah, absolutely. In fact, part of the reason why private employers hire them is that they're perceived as more official than private security guards. The police officer who's working off-duty for a private employer represents the state. They're in uniform, they have a badge, they have a gun belt. They may have a marked police vehicle with them. So in a very real sense they represent the arm of the state.\n\nIt seems unfair that someone can just rent out that kind of authority. Like, could a bunch of wealthy people who live in a neighborhood pool their money and hire a cop to patrol their streets? It seems like police resources shouldn't be allocated based on who can afford to pay for them.\n\nRight. Well, that's exactly what happens. In fact, one of the stories I open the article with is about an officer who was paid by a security company that had been hired by a neighborhood. Policing is typically thought of as inherently redistributive. The neighborhoods that pay for most of the policing in a given city are not the neighborhoods that are on the receiving end of most police services. The higher-income neighborhoods that have a higher tax bracket pay more, but most of the policing happens in the lower-income neighborhoods. So when you have private businesses, neighborhoods, even potentially private individuals hiring police, it cuts against that general approach of police as a public good that serves all of the citizenry without regard for anyone's ability to pay.\n\nWhat kind of work are most of these officers doing when they're hired by private companies?\n\nMy survey wasn't that specific, but my sense is most of it is security work. Some of that might be bouncing at a nightclub, but some of it might just be standing by at a party. If there's a large public event, they might have an officer just standing by in case there are any problems. And that happens not just at nightclubs and parties, it happens at pharmacies, grocery stores, department stores, big box stores, at strip malls. That's generally the emphasis-security.\n\nThere's also something called a \"courtesy officer,\" which is a police officer who lives at an apartment complex or condo building and provides some security or law enforcement services in exchange for reduced rent. This might include responding to noise complaints in the apartment complex. It might require the officer to park their police car in a visible spot near the front of the complex, just to provide that sense of police presence. It might require them to take reports of crimes that occur in the apartment complex when they're available to do so, so instead of sending an on-duty officer to deal with a noise complaint or a vehicle burglary report, the off-duty courtesy officer is called and sent instead. It also provides the apartment complex management and other residents with a police contact, so instead of calling the police department to complain about a noise problem, residents might be given the courtesy officer's phone number and encouraged to call him or her instead.\n\nThis is in exchange for reduced rent? I'm imagining my landlord giving a police officer moving into my building a discount in exchange for parking his cruiser out front like a scarecrow.\n\nI originally had a part of this paper that tracked the history of what I call the blurred blue line -the difficulty of distinguishing private and public policing. If we go all the way back to the original modern police force in the 1830s and '40s, officers commonly got paid through private sources for doing their public work. One scholar, a historian, published a paper about English police services in the 1830s, and it described the officer's salary as a \"retaining fee.\" It wasn't really where the officers made their money-where they made their money was someone would call in a burglary and say, \"my stuff has been stolen\" and the officer would say, \"well, how much are you offering to recover it?\" And then the officer would collect that reward. That's totally foreign to our modern conception of policing. But in some ways, it's the same idea of officers trading on their public authority. Because, again, it's not just their skills they're being hired for. It's not because they're better trained and better equipped than someone else. A private employer hires an off-duty officer because of their public authority, not just because of their personal characteristics or their qualifications.\n\nYou did some of this work when you were a police officer in Tallahassee. What were your reasons for doing it?\n\nI did it because it was a good way to make extra pocket money. I think that's why most officers do it.\n\nHow lucrative is it? How much were you making when you were doing it?\n\nIt can be extremely lucrative. There are some stories cited in my paper of officers working in New Orleans and making six figures just on their private off-duty employment-more than doubling their public salary. When I left the police department, I was making right around $45,000 a year. Breaking that down by hours, my public salary was just under $22 an hour, plus benefits and all that other stuff. When I did work for a private employer I don't think I ever made less than $30 an hour. And sometimes I could get paid much more than that. There was a particularly large event every year in Tallahassee, [ Florida A&M U niversity]'s homecoming. Lots of people, something like 60 or 80,000 people come into Tallahassee for that, and officers' days off all get canceled and you work a lot of overtime for the city. And then after your overtime for the city, if you have a gig like I did, you'd go to the nightclub afterwards. So you'd get released from your public job and you would go to your private job. And I think on FAMU homecoming I was making 75 or 95 dollars an hour.\n\nIs it common for an officer's off-duty income to be a significant chunk of what he or she is bringing home?\n\nYes, it absolutely can be.\n\nIn most places, are police officers taking this work to line their pockets, or are there places where the public pay is so low that this is really the only way to earn a decent living?\n\nBoth. Officers are absolutely using off-duty employment to make extra money, but it's also true that officers are, in many places, pathetically underpaid. Police at some agencies, particularly smaller, rural departments, might start their careers with a salary of $30,000 or less; officers in agencies like that might turn to off-duty work as a necessary way to pay the bills.\n\nThere's some tension here and some unanswered questions. It may be the case that [the allure of] off-duty employment attracts higher-quality officers than the police could otherwise hire. But it could also be the case that off-duty employment decreases officer wages because the agency doesn't need to pay officers as much to attract the level of applicants it wants.\n\nIs it your sense that most people who are doing this kind of work on the side are doing it at the expense of sleeping or their weekends? Where do they find the time to have a whole separate income stream?\n\nIt runs the gamut. There are officers who work a day shift and get off at, say, 5 p.m., then they go home for a little while and then go work five or six hours at their off-duty jobs in the evenings. For me, I would get off work at 2 o'clock in the morning on Friday or Saturday nights and then I'd go work for two hours at the nightclub as it was closing down.\n\nAnd how common is this? Can you tell from your research how widespread the practice is?\n\nSo I want to reinforce the caveat that this wasn't a rigorously representative sample. I think it's a good sample-the agencies that responded employ just under 20 percent of the entire state and local police force in the country-but I don't want to extrapolate from it too much. The sense that I get from the research is that it's pretty common. Most departments allow off-duty employment. The statistics from the agencies that responded to this survey suggest that around 80 percent of agencies allow officers to work in uniform while off-duty for private employers. That's consistent with the numbers we have from earlier research, which is very limited-there was research in the mid-'80s where one criminologist and a group of academics who were studying the private security industry tried to identify the extent of off-duty employment. And they found roughly the same 80 percent number.\n\nSo that's agencies that allow it. Do you have a sense of what percentage of officers actually do it, and how much time they're spending on it relative to their normal jobs?\n\nThe short answer is no. We don't have good local or national data on how many officers are engaged in off-duty employment or how many hours they're working. What I can give you is the data from my survey. And one of the takeaways from this paper is how few agencies actually track the number of officers who work for private employers and the number of hours that officers spend working for private employers. Of all the agencies that responded-I had 162 agencies respond to the survey-130 of them allow off-duty employment. And 62 of those, almost 50 percent, do not track the number of officers who do it. Two-thirds-87 of the 130 agencies that permit off-duty employment-don't track the number of hours that officers work for private employers.\n\nSo while the information that I have is a good start toward understanding how big this phenomenon might be, the takeaway is we actually don't know.\n\nFrom your paper it also sounds like there aren't rules or even conventions for who is held responsible when an off-duty police officer working a private gig does something to get sued.\n\nThere's a tremendous amount of variation and very little consistency here. Some states put the liability for an off-duty officer's actions squarely on the private employer. Other states tend to suggest the opposite approach-they say the private employer is not liable. As a matter of policy some departments have private employers sign indemnity agreements with the agency before the officer is allowed to work with them. So even though the employment contract is only between the private employer and the officer, in order to approve the off-duty employment, the agency wants to be indemnified so if the officer does get sued, the private employer will pick up the tab.\n\nLiability is a huge issue. And the key question is whether you conceive of the off-duty officer as being a police officer who works for a public agency or whether you conceive of them as working for the private company. Most plaintiffs are probably going to sue both, because there can be ambiguity. For example, if a private employer has a dress code that has racial implications-like, no gold chains, no hats turned backwards, no baggy shorts, no basketball jerseys. These dress codes exist at nightclubs and other places in this country. Can the nightclub have the officer enforce those dress codes? And what happens when the officer does enforce those dress codes and gets sued for discrimination? How much of that is on the officer, how much of that is on the city or the county that employs the officer, and how much of that is on the private employer?\n\nWoof. That introduces a whole other issue, doesn't it? If these guys are working for a private employer, and they're being paid to enforce the private employer's rules by using their authority as law enforcement agents, aren't they kind of turning those rules into ... pseudo-laws?\n\nYeah. Not to get too theoretical, but if you believe that \"law\" is what happens on the ground, then yes-the private employer's rules become de facto law.\n\nThat seems bad.\n\nI tend to agree. This piece did not identify and did not try to identify best practices. I think that, and developing more information about how agencies are handling off duty employment, is the next step.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Do Police Officers Struggle With Becoming Bitter Toward the Public?\n\nPhoto by Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images\n\nThis question originally appeared on Quora , the knowledge-sharing network where compelling questions are answered by people with unique insights. You can follow Quora on Twitter , Facebook , and Google Plus .\n\nAnswer by Tim Dees , retired cop and criminal justice professor, Reno Police Department:\n\nYes. This is particularly a problem when the officer is dealing with a group who he perceives is always making work for him.\n\nThe city where I worked was a tourist destination with lots of money and liquor in the mix. It drew a disproportionate share of people who are now called \"homeless\" (we usually referred to them as \"vagrants\" or \"drunks\") who would panhandle, buy, or otherwise acquire alcohol, and get drunk in parks and other public places. They had very low standards of hygiene, occasionally fought (not very effectively) with officers, and committed many petty offenses that took a great deal of time and resources to deal with.\n\nIt was very easy to depersonalize these people and essentially forget they were human. When I worked there, management didn't make much of an effort to discourage this. The only time anyone would get into trouble over a drunk was when something truly over-the-top happened. For example, a two-officer team working the drunk wagon were loading up the drunks and then racing out of town 20 or 30 miles to the boonies, then dumping them at the side of the freeway. They got fired, but several attempts at trying them were all frustrated by witnesses who were either too drunk to testify or who just couldn't be found when they were needed.\n\nThat same agency now has a homeless outreach program that is the model for other agencies in the U.S. and elsewhere. The sort of behavior that was common in my day is not tolerated now.\n\nI think this is a low-intensity version of the dynamic that takes place with combat troops in war time, especially if the enemy is a different race or ethnicity than the troops. In past wars, enemies of the U.S. have been referred to as all kinds of slurs. It's a lot easier to dehumanize someone if he or she doesn't look or act like you do. Depersonalizing the opposition makes it easier to kill them without as much emotional baggage. You're not shooting a person; you're shooting a [insert ethnic slander here].\n\nThe problem can be further aggravated until the adversary becomes anyone who isn't a cop. There is an old tongue-in-cheek summary of the stages of a police officer's career:\n\nStage one: People are all the same. There are good people and bad people, and my job is to keep the bad people from hurting the good people. Stage two: There are two kinds of people: cops, and everybody else. I trust only the cops. Stage three: A lot of the cops are assholes. The only one I can trust is my partner. Stage four: I'm not so sure about my partner.\n\nThe organizational culture of the law enforcement agency largely dictates how pervasive this sort of attitude is allowed to be. It's not tolerated in some outfits, and it's status quo in others.\n\nDo police officers ever struggle with becoming bitter towards members of the public? originally appeared on Quora .

      "text": "\"In One Day, We Became the Worst Things in the Country\"\n\nThis country is changing its mind about the police. Over the past few years, Americans have watched countless videos of police brutality against Black people. They've witnessed, or participated in, the formation of a massive social movement dedicated to the preservation and celebration of Black lives. And their perception of police forces has shifted: A Monmouth University survey conducted at the end of May found, for the first time in polling history, that a majority (57 percent) of Americans and a plurality (49 percent) of white people think police officers \"faced with a difficult or dangerous situation\" are \"more likely to use excessive force if the culprit is black.\" That's an increase of 24 points among all Americans and 23 points among white people since Monmouth's 2014 poll in the wake of NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo's killing of Eric Garner.\n\nPolice officers have been watching those cameraphone videos too. They've witnessed, or participated in, the formation of a movement for \"blue lives\" in response to the movement affirming Black ones. More recently, they've been confronting Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin's killing of George Floyd, the widespread protests against racism and police brutality, and the calls to defund or abolish police that have entered mainstream policy discourse as never before.\n\nYou'd be hard-pressed to find a cop who thinks his job ought to be bound for obsolescence. But law enforcement officials are processing this moment in American history in a wide variety of ways. Some officers are beating protesters and journalists in the streets. Some are beseeching their colleagues to listen to what the demonstrators have to say. Some are defending their profession on social media to strangers who reject the idea of a \"good cop.\" Some are considering a career change. Some police officers are drawing on their experiences as Black Americans to explain the protesters' grievances to their co-workers. Many remain convinced that, in most cases that aren't as cut-and-dry as Floyd's killing, civilians who end up injured or killed by police could have avoided their fate if they'd simply followed officers' orders.\n\nOver the past two weeks, I spoke to seven current and former cops about the protests and the future of policing. (They by no means constitute a representative cross-section of U.S. police officers; compared with the national police demographic breakdown, those who eventually agreed to speak with me were disproportionately people of color, women, and/or LGBTQ.) All strongly denounced Chauvin's actions but disagreed on almost everything else: whether jurisdictions should divert funding from police departments toward other public services, whether law enforcement systems are peppered with a few bad apples or besieged by wholesale rot, whether claims of racism in police forces are substantiated or overblown. What follows are excerpts from our conversations, lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nI haven't heard anyone in my department defend the killing of George Floyd. That's how extreme the situation was with Floyd, between the fact that it was all recorded, to the total lack of humanity of the officers involved, to the eight to nine minutes of watching someone die, where you really can't say anything in defense. And traditionally, as cops, we are defensive. But in this situation, everyone's like, \"Yeah, that was jacked up for sure.\"\n\nThe protests have made us as law enforcement very uncomfortable-but it's a necessary uncomfortable. My view on the protests is: We've seen the masses come out and say what they want done. And if it were a small group of people, you could kind of cast it off as \"oh, this is just one fringe group.\" But when you have police agreeing with it, and you have millions of people in the streets saying it needs to be changed, it's kind of like, yeah, maybe we need to look in the mirror and change it.\n\nI have been offended by calls for the abolishment of police. I don't want that message to dilute the real message of defunding police departments, because defunding police departments makes sense. In most jurisdictions, public safety expenses exceed other expenditures by a large margin. Those funds should be allocated to improve education and social services, and to assist the mentally ill and homeless populations. And the whole bad apple-versus-good apple argument is just tired to me. It deflects from the real systemic problems that exist. Without widespread changes, the apples don't matter.\n\nMy wife and I have conversations every day about the protests. I'm white, and she is Black. We agree with their messaging and calls for dramatic reform. We do, however, disagree on one front: property damage. From my wife's point of view, she has seen peaceful protests many times before in this country, and sometimes they bring about incremental change. But in this instance, she believes more dramatic changes are needed, so more intense protests are needed. My view is that property damage will give opponents of police reform a crutch to fall onto. It will taint the overall message in the eyes of our leaders.\n\nI've seen a lot of pendulum swings. Departments will go through phases where officers are on board with reform, but then if some officers get hurt, you might see officers saying, \"Hey, we need to get things back to the way they used to be.\" We go through times when police enforcement is proactive, then it becomes reactive. We become experts in deescalation, then we have an incident and we refocus on harsh enforcement of laws. It changes for each department depending on how morale is in the community and what's viewed as acceptable.\n\nWhen I first started out in law enforcement, in Florida, that police department and academy were very paramilitary. You're really conditioned for that warrior type of mindset . You get trained from a SWAT perspective; it's totally different from patrol or community-oriented policing. In a class like that, we're doing physical training, defensive tactics every day. They were emphasizing takedown maneuvers, how to use force. The training emphasizes having a plan and being firm in what you do, which is necessary. But you gotta know when to switch those hats. Because if you're trained to be paranoid and always have a plan to kill somebody. ... There's a saying in police departments, \"I'd rather be tried by 12 than carried by six.\" That is a common phrase thrown around: \"Hey, I'd rather be in court charged with manslaughter than be killed in the line of duty.\" We all want to go home at the end of the day, but if you're teaching people that mindset, it is devaluing the person on the other end.\n\nIn my department in Florida, it was mostly white police officers, and we were policing this very low-income African American neighborhood. You could see these officers that were not really from that sort of background- there would be communication issues. When you have that soldier mindset, you're basically giving orders. There's really no time for open dialogue to take place. It's kind of, \"I'm telling you to do this. Do it.\" That kind of rubbed off on me early in my career. It really opened my eyes.\n\nI've seen officers be abusive and escalate situations. One particular incident, an officer kicked a teenager in the teeth. He ended up getting terminated. One of my first nights out, with my training officer, we were patrolling one of the rougher neighborhoods in the city. We saw two black men with a pit bull walking on the wrong side of the street. In Florida, there's a law that if you're a pedestrian, you have to be walking opposite the flow of vehicle traffic. My training officer jumps out the car, so I jump out the car. The tone he used to simply confront them was-it shook me. We were stopping them for a pedestrian violation, but it almost seemed like we were at a robbery in progress.\n\nI got so discouraged by what I was seeing and doing and not really liking the type of person I was becoming that I left policing entirely for a couple of years and managed retail for a while. It wasn't until I met my wife and had a daughter and a stepdaughter when I felt I wanted to do something greater. I wanted to help make things better by getting back into policing.\n\nNow, I'm about to get my master's degree in criminal justice. In my classes, we've had to do deep dives on the Ferguson Police Department and CompStat up in New York and see how different methods of policing have certain repercussions, and why sticking to old methods is not going to work going forward. Look at Ferguson: The demographics of the police department were significantly different than the community it was policing. I'm trying to get into more supervision, to try to fix things going forward.\n\nThe past few weeks have been really difficult for me, because I see both sides of it. I see that police officers are good people. Me personally, I haven't seen any bad police officers-but I'm not saying there aren't any in our department. But I also know what it's like to be Black and for someone to call the police on you for no reason.\n\nWhen I was growing up in Oklahoma, it happened a couple of times. We'd take a shortcut to my mom's house, or we'd be outside playing basketball, and somebody would call the police on us. The police would show up, and we would have no idea what was going on because we were just being kids. They just told us that somebody called because they thought we were up to no good.\n\nWhy did I want to be a police officer? The simple answer is I thought there should be more Black police officers. Where I lived in Oklahoma, I don't know if there were more than five [Black officers] in the department, in a city of close to 100,000 people. I would hear people talk about their interactions with the police, and I felt like the department really didn't represent the population.\n\nWe've talked about [Floyd's killing] quite a bit. Everybody agrees that it was the wrong way to hold him down. Everybody knows that would be a policy violation here. Our supervisors brought it up, and our interim chief brought it up. He usually doesn't comment on things that happen outside the city. But he agrees it was bad, it shouldn't have happened, and George Floyd should be alive. I do think Chauvin should be charged with murder, and everyone I've talked to agrees.\n\nMy department is mostly white, but there are maybe six Black officers and a couple of Latinos. I do feel like some officers don't understand why people are so angry right now. A lot of the police officers take an us-versus-them stance rather than good-versus-bad or right-versus-wrong, just because it's a tightknit job where everybody becomes like family. They're more apt to defend a police officer even when, to me, it's clear police are in the wrong. But I think it's more of an issue of a few bad apples. I don't think the system of policing needs to change, just that officers need to hold people accountable when they see something like this.\n\nSome of my co-workers have been coming to me and seeing how I'm doing with everything. I explain to them different things in my life, like how the police would get called on us for playing basketball in the street. None of them have had that happen to them before. They don't know what it's like to be Black. But a co-worker having that type of experience might open their eyes a little bit.\n\nI didn't know how the department would react to me agreeing with the protests, and I didn't know how my family would react with me being a police officer. I've had family members who have had bad experiences with police. But I've talked to my family, and they're still happy with me being a police officer. And that has helped the most, that my family's OK with it. They know that I'm a good police officer; they know that I'm a good person. They know that if anything like what Chauvin did is happening around me, then I'll step in and make sure it doesn't get to the point where somebody dies.\n\nI've not talked to a single officer who supported what happened in Minneapolis, yet every one of us is being painted with that broad brush. Everyone's screaming about racism and racial inequality-but is that not what everybody is doing to law enforcement? With racism, people get in power and use that power against another ethnicity. Now, [activists] have a voice because of what happened to Floyd, but they're using that power against another group. That group happens to be law enforcement. Within law enforcement, you're starting to hear about, \"Why are we being demonized and considered the bad guy?\" COVID hit the U.S. and police were heroes. Then in one day, we became the worst things in the country. And what did we do? It's what one person did. Every profession has its bad apples. Teachers have gotten arrested for having sex with kids, but are people saying \"get rid of teachers\"?\n\nI taught a class on procedural justice for recruits and officers with a whole section on the African American history with police. I'm 100 percent understanding of it. I can have some empathy for that plight. What I don't have empathy for is a failure of the movement to denounce ... the riots, the property destruction. Is that what the movement wants to be known for?\n\nThese days, society is asking police to do more things that they're not equipped to do. Forty thousand people in the United States commit suicide every year, and what are we doing about it? The answer is, equip a cop to deescalate somebody who's ready to jump off a bridge? The cops have now become kind of a catchall for everything. Can every cop deescalate a mental health patient? No, even if they get training.\n\nIn my career, have I done some things that maybe I wasn't so proud of? I can't lie to you. But I also have to tell you there are people out there who have no problem trying to kill me. And how do I discern the difference? It's all about the person's behavior. A lot of people want to make cops out to be racist. But when they get in those tense situations, cops are reacting to behavior. There have been some people who have come out and said, \"Hey, if you just follow the directions of a cop, you should be OK.\" That's not a bad piece of advice.\n\n[George Floyd's killing] is more of a clear case versus past examples where officers are struggling with somebody. It wasn't a highly emotionally charged event. Chauvin was clearly calm, and it's not like he was wrestling with the guy at that particular moment.\n\nI agree that Black people might be perceived as more aggressive for doing the same thing as a white person. The research shows even African American police officers see African American men as more aggressive. Where does implicit bias come from? Stereotypes, interactions. I'd advocate for this: Every cop who works in what they call a \"fast district\" or a \"minority district,\" they should be periodically rotated out to another neighborhood with a similar racial makeup but economically different, with less crime, so they can get some positive imagery of a particular minority group to help replace what they've seen. Because how do you counteract implicit bias? You replace the stereotype you have about a particular group of people with positive ones. But if you have an officer who sits in a high-violence neighborhood and the people who live there all happen to be African American or Latino, what's naturally gonna happen? What's his thinking gonna be?\n\nSome of my friends have lost friends over this issue. It's getting to that point. I've had to have lengthy discussions with my college-age daughter. She was asked to go protest by her friends. Her comment, and I gotta give her 100 percent props, was, \"I'm against racial injustice and the things that have happened, but why do we have to protest against cops?\" If I didn't believe in good changes coming out of this, I'd probably be a very depressed person.\n\nMe and my co-workers, we're all on the same page about George Floyd. What bothers us the most is that the three sat there and didn't do anything to stop Chauvin. So a lot of the cops were disgusted, and mad because that makes us all look bad. It makes it so people don't trust the police. I can't say I necessarily blame them.\n\nBeing a cop right now-it's not good. When I try to defend cops on Twitter, where I like to talk to people about queer TV shows, no one responds. All them are saying, \"Fuck the police, defund the police.\" And I'm like: \"Hey, I'm here, I'm queer, too, and I'm a cop. And I'm saying, some of the stuff those cops are doing, it's not OK. It's not all of us.\"\n\nIn real life, the \"fuck the police\" stuff gets to you. It's really entertaining when people say that and then five minutes later they ask for help. I've seen that a few times. They'll be like \"Fuck the police!\" and within the next day I'll get a call. I'll be like, oh, fuck me, right? We're not appreciated until we're needed.\n\nI understand Black lives matter. Everyone agrees with that. That's not an issue for me, and it shouldn't be an issue for anybody else. But when you commit arson and start stealing stuff that doesn't belong to you, that's when it becomes a problem. We understand it's not all of you, but you wanna sit there-I'm sure you've seen memes that people have sent around about 1,000 good cops, but if you have 10 bad cops, you have 1,100 bad cops because we're not holding one another accountable. The same could be flipped, with 1,000 protesters and 10 agitators.\n\nSome of the stuff I've seen cops do at these protests is unnecessary. Like, I understand this lady is sitting in front of you and you need her to move. You don't have to kick her in the face, though. When it comes to enacting reforms [about the use of force by police], most of them have exceptions. So, for example, most departments already restrict shooting at moving vehicles. But if you are trying to run me over with a car, which could kill me, I'm authorized to use deadly force to protect myself or the life of another. In Virginia, we can use deadly force if we have reason to believe the person fleeing has just committed a felony and poses an imminent threat to us or another person. And if I'm authorized to use deadly force, which means it's a life-or-death situation where I'm in fear for my life or the life of another, I can and will do whatever I have to do to stop that threat. That means I can shoot, stab, beat, strangle, choke-nothing is off limits at that point.\n\nMy last 17 years, I've seen a big change from when I first started in the attitudes and the culture of policing. It's been good and bad. Now we're definitely under the microscope more than we used to be. I wish police departments were a little more transparent in the sense of how we police our own. There's always this theory that police take care of themselves and things get swept under the rug. In my years in this field, I've seen a lot of officers be terminated, a lot of officers be suspended for different violations and breaking the code of ethics. And I think if the public would see that, and we would be more vocal about that, that would kind of help show our community, \"Look, we don't tolerate this.\"\n\nWhen we see [police officers beating people] on the news, we sit there and just chat in the office like, \"Man, really, again? What were you thinking?\" When we hear about these cops who are slamming people on the ground who are handcuffed and their faces bounce off the concrete-I would vouch for all the guys in my office, none of us would treat somebody like that.\n\nAs far as hearing the Black Lives Matter movement, I do hear them. Where I separate myself is when I start hearing the anti-cop rhetoric, defunding the police. A movement that chants, \"We want dead cops now,\" or \"The best cops are dead cops,\" I can't get behind. [Ed. note: When asked where he heard chants like this, Martinez pointed to a 2015 video of Minnesota protesters chanting, \"Pigs in a blanket, fry ' em like bacon.\"] And that's not being a cop-that's just being a human.\n\nI grew up in an impoverished neighborhood. My dad was an immigrant. There were six of us living in that home with one bathroom. I'm where I'm at because of hard work. And then I'm now told, \"You won't understand because you're not Black.\" But I'm being told this by Black friends who grew up in wealthy neighborhoods, friends who grew up with parents being very successful. We can go back and look at 100 years ago, and yes, if I was living in that time frame, I would be right there marching. But I've seen a Black president.\n\nI've been struggling. Friends whom I know, whom I've grown up with, say I'm a racist because of the person I voted for, although I don't agree with everything Trump says. I've had to pray. I've had to seek guidance from my pastor. After 17 years, I'm on the verge of just saying \"I'm done\" and turning it in. I never thought I would-I thought I'd be a 30-year cop. But I'm looking for other career choices. I've been very vocal with my kids: I don't want them in this field. I want them to be something else. Because it's only gonna get worse. They're voting to [disband] the Minneapolis Police Department . I don't want my boys to do this.\n\nI've noticed a lot of my former colleagues with D.C.'s police department outright condemning Chauvin's actions, which isn't something that I had seen in the past, to be honest. Usually there's a little hesitation about \"Let's wait and see where the investigation goes.\" But when it came to seeing that video, I knew, and my former colleagues knew, that what they were seeing was enough to condemn him morally and obviously that criminal charges would be forthcoming. That vocalness among police officers is something I haven't witnessed in the past that I find to be really encouraging.\n\nWhen I was a cop, we'd have conversations about these shootings, focused on understanding the circumstances around them and what went wrong. There was some room for disagreement about whether an officer handled it in the correct way. Tamir Rice's killing is a good example of that. There was a tactical mistake, and that was driving that car right up next to a person whom you didn't know anything about. Why would you do that and basically plop your partner out right in front without any cover? In front of a person who allegedly has a weapon? It's not smart police work. But there was another layer to that conversation that some of the Black officers brought up, which is: Would there have been the benefit of the doubt given to Rice if he were a white boy as opposed to a young Black boy?\n\nSome violence stems from the fact that there's a lack of manpower in a police department. If you don't have enough people working your shift, these 911 calls don't stop. They just keep building up. If you're working an evening or weekend shift, you're working those eight or 10 hours straight, responding from one call to the next call. There's a sort of keep-it-moving mentality. I think that bumps up against a lot of the tactics advocates are calling for, such as deescalation. Deescalation takes time. That means you need to slow it down. When you get to a scene and someone's upset, instead of having to worry about the three or four calls pending after the one you just responded to, you need to be able to stay and have the space and lack of pressure to say, \"I'm gonna take my time and talk to this person and really figure out what the problem is.\" A department that's adequately staffed can afford to have a softer approach to these issues. So in order for calls for defunding police or reducing police budgets to be in the best interest of communities, I think those calls need to be accompanied by a radical rethinking of what we're asking police to do.\n\nI think the cops policing the protests are beat down, for sure. A lot of them haven't had days off for a really long time since the protests began. So I think there's a sense of exhaustion. But I think a lot of social movements in history would prove that these kinds of protests are necessary to change America's relationship to policing.\n\nI also think there are a number of issues where the old-school police officers are not seeing eye to eye with the rookies and the younger generation. When I was a cop, I had a friend who was new on the police force. He responded to a call, and somebody came up to him and pushed a finger into his chest, as a way to disrespect him. And my friend's response was not to do anything. And the next day in roll call, which is where everyone gets dogged out for anything that happened the night before, somebody stood up and said something along the lines of, \"Yeah, you're a police officer, I get it. But you're a man first, and you don't let another man touch you like that.\" That was a total generational divide. Like, there's something about this man's work that's caught up in his gender identity. It represents a rather inflexible form of policing, I guess, to put it nicely.\n\nWhen you walk into a roll call room, it's all arranged according to seniority. So all the younger officers have to sit at the front, and the people who've been on for two decades, they get to kind of do what they want in the back. They're smoking and joking, and the people up front are diligently taking notes in their uniform. Their shoes are still shined and everything. A lot of the older officers were working when crack hit D.C. really hard. They always bring up the tagline of D.C. having been the \"murder capital.\" Like, if they're training somebody, they'll say, \"All right, you need to listen to me because I worked here when D.C. was the murder capital of the United States.\" There's a sense of pride associated with that. And a sense that some of the rest of us might be used to a safer way of life, to being pampered or babied.\n\nWith my family members, I think there was this idea that you need to \"back the blue,\" especially when I was actually on the police force . They want to support me, so they naturally think this is the side that I'm on, so this is whom you root for. I've worked hard with my friends and family to show them that this isn't as binary an issue as that. I've been having conversations with family members about the protests, and especially about the nonpeaceful protesters. I can talk candidly about why that's not something that upsets me terribly. It's unfortunate, but also in the grand scheme of things it's understandable-and effective, to be honest. I think my family can more readily hear that message from me, since I used to be a cop.\n\nThe bigger picture to me is the thoughtfulness this is really spurring among police departments and officers, because the situation unfolded as it did and there was space to ask why this happened to George Floyd, to ask why Chauvin felt he could treat this man this way, that undoubtedly keeps pointing back to racism. Police officers often do make split-second decisions, where if there's any bit of implicit bias, it's going to come out. There's a difference between having implicit bias training and a police officer looking inside themselves and seeing that there's a part of them that's racist too, regardless of the training they have or how they think of themselves. That seems to be a more abstract but even more important transformation that I think is happening, I hope is happening.\n\nI'm more optimistic about the future of this country than I have been in the past 31⁄2 years . Because up until this point, there was so much apathy, so much frog-boiling going on. It was one outrage after another, people getting tired and numb to it. But [George Floyd's killing] shocked the conscience so much that it woke people out of that torpor.\n\nI'm a liberal, transgender police officer. You aren't going to find many of us. We know that public safety in general tends to attract people with more conservative ideologies. And part of being a conservative is you're not so comfortable with change and new things. So if you're taught police are always right, then all of a sudden when I say, \"You know, I don't really think we should be shooting Black kids in the back as they're running away from us,\" all of a sudden, it becomes a threat. It becomes, \"Wait a second, are you really one of us?\" It doesn't mean that officers feel like \"Yeah, we should be able to shoot Black kids in the back and get away with it,\" but it's more like \"Yeah, that was bad, but look at all these contributing factors.\"\n\nI once got into an argument with an officer over nasal Narcan. He was a \"let these scumbags die\" kind of person. But part of the training [for Narcan, an emergency treatment for opioid overdose] is: We humanize people. One of the speakers in the training was a mother with three kids, and two of them had died from opioid overdoses. The third one was constantly also having problems overdosing. She pleaded with officers: \"Please, this is my last baby. Don't let my baby die.\" And that was what changed that officer's opinion. He came up to me later and said: \"I was wrong. That really hit home. I'm a parent. I can't imagine losing my child.\"\n\nI think the protests could have a similar effect. But it's a bit of a razor and people can fall on one side of it or the other. Because if you look at some of the crap that went on in Minneapolis and St. Paul-police are using force to punish protestors. I think that right now, they have a siege mentality, and they are just hunkered down and angry and scared and they're lashing out.\n\nWe also have to look at police culture, because that wall of silence gets us into an incredible amount of trouble. It allows us to justify behavior that we wouldn't permit for anybody else. Those officers in Buffalo [ who assaulted 75-year-old activist Martin Gugino ]-when another officer tried to intervene and was pulled back, what message does that send? That message says, \"We live, they die.\" How do you say that you're the good guy and yet you cheer on somebody who committed an unnecessary act of violence that resulted in a serious physical injury? That's a police culture problem. The organizational structures of police agencies are very narrow pyramids. You can train out of a police culture problem, but it comes from the top.\n\n*A pseudonym\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Hiring Practice That Could Dramatically Improve Policing\n\n\"We're not the ones out there shooting,\" says Janeé Harteau, former chief of police of the Minneapolis Police Department. \"This is really about gender at its very core.\"\n\nA growing number of police reform advocates say the way to fix the policing problem in America might be to hire more female police officers. In fact, they say gender parity was a key item missing from the conversation when, in the wake of a series of high-profile police shootings of Black Americans in 2020, a federal police reform bill made its way this year to the halls of Congress. That bill tanked in September.\n\nDespite decent female representation on popular policing dramas, the nation's 18,000 police departments are not teeming with women. In fact, only 12 percent of the nation's police officers are women, and that number has remained unchanged for more than 25 years. Yet decades of research has proved what anecdotal evidence has demonstrated for half a century, that compared with their male colleagues, female police officers use less excessive force, are named in fewer complaints and lawsuits, are perceived by communities as more honest and compassionate, see better outcomes for crime victims (especially in sexual assault and domestic violence cases), and make fewer discretionary arrests, especially of Black and Latino people. And, most important, when female officers do stop or arrest people, they are more likely than their male peers to actually find guns or drugs.\n\nA daily email update of the stories you need to read right now.\n\n\"If we could have put a strategy out there in the last 50 years that could have guaranteed outcomes like these, every agency would have implemented it. But it's not a specific strategy, it's just about changing who you recruit,\" says Maureen McGough, co-founder of the 30x30 Initiative , which launched earlier this year and seeks to increase female police recruit classes, nationally, to 30 percent by 2030. Thirty percent is the target number because representative bureaucracy theory says that a marginalized group can effect cultural change once it has reached a critical mass of about 30 percent.\n\nAdvocates say increasing the number of female police officers cannot be dismissed as simply a women's rights issue. \"This is about improving public safety outcomes for communities,\" McGough says. While millions of dollars have been spent to reduce violence by police officers, including body cameras and training programs, not much has changed, she adds. Reports show that the number of people killed by police still hovers around 1,000 a year.\n\nTwo new studies released this year have reinforced earlier findings about women in policing from the '90s and the early aughts. Despite studies showing that women have better outcomes, the overall pool of policing research is thin. Researchers say the dearth can be attributed to a lack of transparency by police departments over the last several decades.\n\nA study of traffic stops by the Charlotte (North Carolina) Police Department and the Florida Highway Patrol published in May found that female officers minimize negative interactions while having just as many, if not more, effective outcomes. The authors of the study write that while female officers are less likely to search drivers, they \"are more likely to find contraband and they confiscate the same net amount of contraband as male officers. These results indicate that female officers are able to minimize the number of negative interactions with citizens without losses in effectiveness.\"\n\nThe same holds true for use of force. A study of the Chicago Police Department -which in 1970 was 99 percent male, and is now 22 percent female-found that there is a direct correlation between greater diversity and less excessive force used. The authors of the study, published in February, write, \"Within each racial and ethnic group, female officers use significantly less force than male counterparts.\"\n\nThe improved outcomes are mostly a matter of perspective, says Harteau, who resigned from the Minneapolis Police Department in 2017 after two well-publicized shootings of unarmed individuals by male police officers. \"Women receive the same training, they're in the same police academies, yet they're not using force,\" she said. Female officers are \"not part of this culture which is this 'us versus them' attitude.\"\n\nThis difference has profound consequences. Earlier studies concluded that \"the average male officer is over eight and a half times more likely than his female counterpart to have an allegation of excessive force sustained against him,\" and that \"female officers are less personally challenged by defiant suspects and feel less need to deal with defiance with immediate force or confrontational language.\"\n\nDuring her three decades as a police officer, Harteau says she saw these differences play out time and again. Male officers respond to what they perceive as their loss of control with a \"panic reaction ... grabbing people and pulling them out of cars.\" But often it's not defiance, she says. In the commotion of a police incident, individuals may not always understand what an officer is telling them to do. Harteau has channeled these insights into the creation of the Vitals app , a technology that helps people with invisible conditions, such as PTSD, autism, and dementia, communicate with first responders.\n\nWomen are more inclined to see policing as a \"public service,\" says Kathy Spillar, executive director of the Feminist Majority, a nonprofit working to advance nonviolence and women's equality. \"They see problems in their communities that they think they can help, while men say policing is about using force to gain compliance with the law.\" A 2017 study supports these anecdotes, suggesting that \"helping people\" is the key reason female officers got into policing. The study also found that female police officers felt \"they offered special skills that would provide solutions to the police legitimacy crisis ... to prove to citizens that police officers are good men and women.\"\n\nWith more female police officers, \"the brand of policing would change,\" says Sheryl Victorian, chief of police in Waco, Texas. More women on patrol will help police to be \" 'peace' officer[s] as opposed to just relying on a guardian or warrior mentality,\" adds Victorian, who holds a Ph.D. in administration of justice and has been a police officer for 28 years.\n\nThe vast majority of police across the country aren't trained for the service aspects of their job. Most police recruits spend about 60 hours on how to shoot a gun and only eight hours on how to de-escalate situations. Yet the majority of interactions police have do not start off as violent. A new study published in July analyzed why people call 911. According to the researchers who studied 4.3 million calls across nine agencies, mental health incidents made up 1.3 percent of the calls, while the largest percentage of calls, at nearly 17 percent, were traffic-related. Roughly 16 percent of the 911 calls were for \"disorder,\" and almost 13 percent were about suspicious activities. Calls for violent incidents specifically were much lower, around 6 percent.\n\nThe training mismatch means the police operate more like a paramilitary group that is trained to use violence against people in the community. Yet 80 percent of what police officers do is social work, says Spillar, who serves on the Los Angeles County Women and Girls Advisory Commission to assess police hiring and training policies. But 88 percent of police officers are men, while 83 percent of social workers are women . Therefore, changing the way police departments think about their job could help change their recruitment strategy, bringing more women into the force\n\nBut that's not an easy proposition. There are 18,000 police agencies across the country. Each has the freedom to interpret the role and function of the police differently. And no single agency exists to provide oversight and regulation of police departments. So there is no uniformity in training and no requirement to reshape the curricula to better address the fact that the vast majority of police work is more akin to social work.\n\nAdvocates say that to better equip officers for the job, police departments need to get rid of old hiring practices that focus on physical prowess and physical use of force when recruiting police officers. The emphasis needs to be on critical thinking skills and communication. Women on the force have a leg up here too. The researchers who studied the Florida Highway Patrol and Charlotte Police Department noted a difference in education levels of male and female officers. Women are more likely to come in with a bachelor's degree or to have some sort of college education. Men are more likely to come in from the military. Studies on education have, in turn, shown that education is correlated to higher levels of social capital and social empathy.\n\nThe 30x30 Initiative, co-founded by former Newark Police Chief Ivonne Roman , is trying to address the training disconnect. Through the initiative, Roman has already recruited more than 100 police departments, including the NYPD, Miami Police Department, Philadelphia Police Department, and Seattle Police Department, since launching in March. The goal is to build a network of departments with shared values so the best practices can be easily replicated across departments. Despite initial success, the group admits the process could take years.\n\nPart of the problem is entrenched police culture. Police unions have routinely blocked reforms that would make it easier to discipline or fire officers accused of corruption or misconduct. Whistleblower officers are routinely pushed out of the force. Departments respond to criticisms or calls to reduce their funding with work slowdowns. \"In this type of culture, many 'good' cops fear the repercussions of reporting misconduct is greater than the repulsion of the misconduct itself,\" Roman says.\n\nThe culture of policing is keeping women out too. Pew research shows that female officers perceive the culture in most police departments supports masculine values, which negatively affects women's experience in policing and makes them reluctant to stay in policing or even go into the field in the first place. Moreover, the few female police officers already in the ranks rarely rise into leadership positions as a result. Roughly 9 percent of first-line supervisors are women, and 3 percent of chiefs or executives were women, according to Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics .\n\nHiring more female officers may also improve the frayed relationships between the police and the communities they serve. Communities respond positively to the idea of more female police officers, says Kelsey Shoub, lead author of the traffic stop study in Florida and North Carolina. Her research shows that residents have a more favorable impression of their local police departments, especially with respect to accountability, when they believe the department has a great number of female police officers.\n\nAdditionally, while there is no current research on female police officers and implicit bias, a study from the '70s suggests that \"male officers were more likely than females to be aggressive because of some quality in the citizen, such as race or socioeconomic class.\"\n\nJust adding women won't \"fix\" the police, Shoub says. Still, \"doing so may decrease the rate of negative outcomes and interactions.\" Early research on women in policing shows that female police officers have a \"calming effect\" on male partners, which, in turn, results in fewer civilian deaths at the hands of the police.\n\n\"I would say the worst-case scenario for increasing gender diversity on the forces is that nothing changes,\" says Shoub. \"Best-case scenario is that we get police forces with attributes that the public is actually asking for, which is that more like suburban-style policing, which is more hands-off or community-oriented, rather than aggressive and in your face.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "'Height of hypocrisy': Backlash erupts over Trump's vow to protect police\n\n\"We're going to make it less dangerous,\" Trump said of policing.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said in his speech to a joint session of Congress that he'll work to protect and support police. But his words set off a backlash that included a Democratic lawmaker accusing him of the \"height of hypocrisy\" and a former Capitol Police officer noting that Trump pardoned 1,500 people who attacked him and his colleagues during the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nHarry Dunn, a former Capitol Police Officer who risked his life to defend the Capitol Building as Trump's supporters rioted in 2021, slammed Trump in a series of posts on the social media site Bluesky as the president was addressing Congress Tuesday night.\n\n\"Trump threatens public safety,\" Dunn said in one post.\n\nIn an expletive-laced post, the 41-year-old Dunn, wrote in all capital letters, \"YOU PARDONED OUR ATTACKERS.\"\n\nDuring his speech Tuesday night, Trump did not mention the insurrection, of which, according to the House Jan. 6 committee's final report, he allegedly engaged in a criminally \"multi-part conspiracy\" to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 presidential election and failed to act to stop his supporters from attacking the Capitol.\n\nIn his address, the president spoke about getting police officers nationwide \"the support, protection and respect they so dearly deserve.\"\n\n\"They have to get it. They have such a hard, dangerous job,\" Trump said. \"But we're going to make it less dangerous. The problem is the bad guys don't respect the law, but they're starting to respect it, and they soon will respect it.\"\n\nIn the first two months of 2025, at least 58 police officers have been shot in the line of duty, including eight who were killed, according to a report released on March 3 by the National Fraternal Order of Police. The report showed that the number of police shootings is down 11% from this time in 2024.\n\nAmong the officers killed this year are Virginia Beach Police Officers Cameron Girvin, 25, and Christopher Reese, 30, who authorities said were shot at point-blank range on Feb. 25 as they were already lying on the ground wounded and defenseless following a traffic stop. The suspected killer, who police said died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, was identified as 42-year-old John McCoy III, a convicted felon.\n\nTrump said that one of the first steps he has taken since returning to the White House is signing an executive order requiring a mandatory death penalty for anyone convicted of murdering a police officer.\n\n\"And tonight, I'm asking Congress to pass that policy into permanent law,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump cited the March 25, 2024, fatal shooting of New York Police Officer Jonathan Diller, who was gunned down while conducting a traffic stop in Queens -- becoming the first NYPD officer killed in the line of duty in two years. The suspect, who was shot and wounded by Diller's partner, was identified as 34-year-old Guy Rivera.\n\nRivera, who has pleaded not guilty to a murder charge, was previously arrested 21 times, according to police records. Also arrested in the fatal shooting, was 41-year-old Lindy Jones, who was in the car with Rivera at the time of the shooting. Jones pleaded not guilty to a charge of being a criminal possession of a weapon and possession of a defaced firearm. Jones had 14 prior arrests including attempted murder and robbery, and was out on bail in connection to a separate crime at the time of the shooting, police records indicate.\n\n\"We're going to get these cold-blooded killers and repeat offenders off our streets. And we're going to do it fast. Gotta stop it,\" said Trump, who attended Diller's wake.\n\nTrump called on Congress to pass a new crime bill aimed at \"getting tougher on repeat offenders while enhancing protections for America's police officers so they can do their jobs without fear of their lives being totally destroyed.\"\n\nFollowing Trump's speech, Rep. Sylvia Garcia, D-Texas, posted a statement on social media accusing Trump of \"the height of hypocrisy.\"\n\n\"Trump talks a big game about standing with ... the blue, yet on the first day of his administration he pardoned hundreds of cop-beaters who tried to steal an election on January 6, 2021,\" Garcia wrote.\n\nRep. Judy Chu, D-California, who walked out of Trump's speech with other Democrats, also took to social media, posting , \"Trump insults the American people by saying, 'let's bring back law and order.' Among his first acts as president? Pardoning 1500 violent felons involved in the January 6 attacks on our U.S. Capitol and democracy.\"\n\nRep. Lois Frankel, D-Fla., cited the hundreds of FBI agents and Department of Justice employees who have lost their jobs in the Trump administration's sweeping reduction in the federal workforce being overseen by billionaire Elon Musk and the new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\n\"Purging hundreds of FBI and DOJ agents who investigated the Jan 6 insurrection -- career law enforcement officers, not political appointees -- does not make us safer, more secure, or prosperous,\" Frankel wrote on social media .\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

I feel really more embarrassed by all the attention,\" said Brosonski. \"I would've gone in no matter what for anyone, whether I was working or not working.

He was later taken to a local hospital by first responders, where he received treatment for hypothermia. WABC reported the boy returned to school the following day.\n\nABC News reached out to the police department but has not received further comment.\n\n\"The West Long Branch Police Department is deeply grateful for Officer Brosonski's swift and heroic actions, as well as for the community members who quickly alerted authorities,\" the police department said in their Facebook post. \"Chief Botti would also like to recognize the West Long Branch Emergency Medical Services and the West Long Branch Fire Department for their response.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

So, in my mind, that was one of the first indicators, 'hey, maybe this is not just a normal protest.'\"\n\nPingeon recalls his team being outnumbered and says he was punched in the face by rioters who had descended on the Capitol that day to protest the certification of the 2020 presidential election results, fueled by false claims about election fraud spread by Former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"I was knocked on my back,\" Pingeon said. \"My helmet came down and felt like someone was on top of me and I couldn't see anything. And I remember just thinking, I have to protect my gun, because they stole my baton.\"\n\nPingeon wasn't injured as severely as other officers, but he has invisible scars that may never fully heal.\n\nHe returned to work shortly after the riot and served in the Capitol Police for another nine more months as the memory of Jan. 6 became politicized. He has since left law enforcement.\n\n\"Right after Jan. 6, it seemed like everybody was on the same page,\" Pingeon said. \"This is not OK. Then very quickly the narrative shifted. And that was really difficult to see.\"\n\nApproximately 140 Capitol Police officers were injured by rioters, making it one of the most violent days for law enforcement in recent U.S. history.\n\nFour officers who responded to the Capitol attack have since died by suicide.\n\nCapitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick died after suffering multiple strokes hours after he was pepper sprayed by rioters. The Washington DC medical examiner ruled he died of natural causes, but said his experience on Jan. 6 played a role in his condition.\n\nDespite the deaths and injuries to officers, a months-long investigation by ABC News found conservative figures, including Trump, have begun to downplay the violence on Jan. 6, painting that day as a largely peaceful protest and recasting imprisoned rioters as \"hostages.\"\n\nDerrick Evans, a former West Virginia House of Delegates and congressional candidate who served three months in federal prison for charges related to Jan. 6, repeated many of those false claims in an interview with ABC News.\n\n\"Do I think that anyone should be fighting police officers? No, I do not,\" Evans said. \"I think it's wrong to do that. The police officers are the ones that really started the whole violence over there.\"\n\nWinston Pingeon reacted strongly.\n\n\"That's not true,\" he said when ABC News played video of Evans' comments for the former Capitol Police officer. \"We were there protecting. We were there to hold a line. We're not pushing back unless we're pushed on first. So its completely ridiculous.\"\n\nMultiple accused rioters from Jan. 6 have claimed they were incited to violence by police, but none have been successful in court.\n\nEvans was convicted of trespassing at the Capitol and attempting to obstruct the certification of the 2020 election, a charge the Supreme Court has recently found was applied in an overly broad manner to Jan. 6 criminal cases.\n\n\"I don't even think [Jan. 6] is really worth remembering. It's been blown out of proportion by the media,\" he said.\n\nMeantime, the former president and his allies have made rewriting the history of Jan. 6 a centerpiece of his campaign, often saying a large number of capitol rioters deserve to be pardoned.\n\n\"If they're innocent, I would pardon them,\" Trump told ABC's Rachel Scott during a panel at the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) Convention.\n\nA pardon is exactly what Capitol rioter Rachel Powell told ABC News she's waiting for behind bars.\n\n\"If Trump gets that, he's promising that he will pardon us, if he gets in and they don't steal the next election,\" Powell said.\n\nPowell called ABC News from federal prison, where she is currently serving a more than four-year sentence for her actions on Jan. 6.\n\nSeveral of Powell's fellow Jan. 6 inmates feel the same, she told ABC News. Powell sent ABC News a photo, taken inside of her correctional facility, showing her and three other Jan. 6 inmates smiling, with the words \"Trump 2024\" written in marker on top.\n\n\"I would want to know why they did what they did, and I'd be curious to know if they have remorse today. I think that's what I would want to know,\" Pingeon said. \"Because loyalty to one man, to alter your life negatively, to go to prison for years. I mean, I would ask them: Was it worth it?\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "This is one of America's hottest jobs right now\n\nMarkets\n\nHot Stocks\n\nFear & Greed Index\n\nLatest Market News\n\nHot Stocks\n\nFollow:\n\nAmericans may be finding it a little tougher to land a job these days, but not so much in one field in which salaries are climbing fast and employers are offering robust perks.\n\nOnce a source of US economic resilience, the nation's job market is now weaker than it has been in recent years, and it's still unclear if it will soften further. In July, the labor market had the fewest available jobs since January 2021 , according to government figures released Wednesday. Job growth has also slowed over the past several months, with employers adding fewer jobs than expected in August after logging a tepid 89,000 job gain in July, the Labor Department said Friday in a separate report.\n\nBut a few industries are defying the slowdown. The health care industry is still the leading job creator , though law enforcement is also seeing some momentum. Police departments and sheriff's offices across are clamoring for new recruits after grappling with a sharp drop in applicants and a wave of retirements after George Floyd's murder in 2020 caused many to be wary of working for a police force, recruiters told CNN.\n\nUS job openings have fallen substantially across the board since they reached a record high in March 2022 - down about 37% through July. But in state and local government, excluding education, openings have declined by just 7.6% during the same period, government data show. A sizable chunk of those openings are in law enforcement.\n\nThe average salary of a police officer climbed more than 37% in the first eight months of this year compared to the same time last year, according to ZipRecruiter data provided to CNN. That's a recent sign of strong demand for police officers, because from 2022 to 2023 the average salary for policing jobs rose by roughly 8%.\n\n\"Police departments are trying hard to make the role more attractive after suffering a recruitment and retention crisis,\" said ZipRecruiter Chief Economist Julia Pollak. She added that there's also been a huge spike in job postings on ZipRecruiter listing \"law enforcement\" as a desired skill.\n\nWhile a police officer may be a steady job, it's important to note that it usually requires a months-long training process (typically paid), as well as an extensive background check.\n\nThe police department in the Phoenix suburb of Mesa dealt with the same hiring challenges in 2020 as other departments across the country. But it turned that situation around by increasing pay and making the application process much smoother, Mesa Police assistant chief Ed Wessing told CNN.\n\nThe Mesa Police Department also advertises another enticing incentive: After working as a municipal employee for 20 years, the city provides workers medical insurance benefits for life. That perk was discontinued in 2009 when Mesa was forced to make some budget cuts but it was brought it back in 2023 \"to recruit and retain talented employees who want to build a career in the public sector,\" the city said in a release .\n\n\"When our recruiters are talking with prospective applicants, that's one of the things that we highlight right away,\" Wessing said. \"That's really drawn a lot more people back into looking at Mesa versus going to the departments at neighboring Gilbert, Scottsdale, Chandler, Tempe and Phoenix. That's been a huge benefit that the city did, which has helped us in our recruiting efforts.\"\n\nHe added that whenever the broader economy hits a rough patch, \"folks start to look to government positions that offer job security, like a police officer.\"\n\nThe pipeline of going from the military to a police force has become more common.\n\nData provided to CNN from Hire Heroes USA, a nonprofit job placement agency for veterans and their spouses, show that jobs in \"safety, security and law enforcement\" have been one of the top categories for clients in recent years. Johnathan Severs, director of client programs at the firm, said \"from the ground level, there's absolutely been an increase\" in hiring for law enforcement roles among clients this year.\n\nAnd there's another sign of strong demand: sign-on bonuses.\n\nAfter serving 25 years in the US Army as a petroleum supply specialist, Ramonedward Bayer, 44, of Colorado Springs, Colorado, decided this was the year he would retire. That meant hitting job search market by writing up a resume and attending job fairs, only Bayer wasn't exactly sure what kind of job he wanted. He said a Seattle Police Department recruiter had piqued his interest. Bayer started the police officer application process with some reservations but eventually became convinced he was doing the right thing.\n\n\"I wasn't even interested in the police. It wasn't really on my radar,\" Bayer said. \"I'm a person of Filipino background, and I remembered when I went to a Filipino community event, I saw how the officers were interacting with the people within the community, and how the community wanted them there. It just really motivated me to to continue with the process and finish it.\"\n\nBayer said he was offered a $7,500 sign-on bonus and financial assistance to relocate to Seattle.\n\nPollak of ZipRecruiter said workers don't usually pivot to law enforcement from a completely unrelated career. But that could change if the job market keeps sliding.\n\n\"We're creatures of habit, so we tend to stay put and not push ourselves out of our comfort zones, unless we have to. And with hiring slowing in so many industries right now, that is prompting people to explore other kinds of opportunities, opportunities that provide paid training,\" she said.\n\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

      "text": "Miami-Dade police officer placed on administrative duty after Dolphins star Tyreek Hill detained before game\n\nFollow:\n\nThe Miami-Dade Police Department placed an officer on administrative leave Sunday after Miami Dolphins star Tyreek Hill was detained prior to the start of the season-opening game.\n\nOn Sunday morning, just hours before kickoff, Hill was detained for a short time by police after a traffic incident, the team said on social media. Hill's agent said the wide receiver was ticketed for a moving violation and it's not clear why the situation escalated.\n\nMiami-Dade Police Department (MDPD) Director Stephanie V. Daniels said Sunday an investigation has begun into the incident and one of the officers involved is being placed on administrative duties. A second Dolphins player said he was also handcuffed when trying to discuss the situation with officers at the scene.\n\n\"Following the incident involving Tyreek Hill, I have initiated an Internal Affairs investigation to ensure a thorough review of the matter. One of the officers involved in the incident has been placed on administrative duties while the investigation is conducted,\" Daniels said in a statement . \"I'm committed to transparency and accountability to the community with any situation involving my officers.\"\n\nHill won't soon forget the start of the 2024-25 season. After being detained, his day ended with a comeback win against the Jacksonville Jaguars that featured a \"handcuffs\" celebration after scoring a key touchdown.\n\nThe \"Cheetah\" said after the game he was still confused by his pregame encounter with police.\n\n\"I wasn't disrespectful because my mom didn't raise me that way, didn't cuss, didn't do none of that. Like I said, I'm still trying to figure it out,\" Hill said at his postgame press conference.\n\nShowcasing his trademark speed, Hill found the end zone in the third quarter against the Jaguars, connecting with quarterback Tua Tagovailoa for an 80-yard score. After scoring, Hill celebrated by putting his arms behind his back with his wrists together - perhaps an allusion to being in handcuffs earlier in the day.\n\nIn the end, the Dolphins overcame a 14-0 deficit to win the game 20-17 on a 52-yard field goal from Jason Sanders as time expired. Hill finished the game with seven catches for 130 yards and a touchdown.\n\nIt's still unclear exactly what led to Hill being detained by police. The team said on social media before the game he was pulled over by police for a traffic incident.\n\n\"This morning, WR Tyreek Hill was pulled over for a traffic incident about one block from the stadium and briefly detained by police,\" the Dolphins X account said .\n\n\"He has since been released. Several teammates saw the incident and stopped to offer support. Tyreek and all other players involved have safely arrived to the stadium and will be available for today's game.\"\n\nReported video of the incident appeared to show a handcuffed Hill being picked up off the road by police.\n\nHill's agent, Drew Rosenhaus, told CNN in a statement Sunday night his legal team will \"pursue this matter\" and \"consider legal action.\"\n\n\"What happened today to Tyreek at the stadium is completely unacceptable,\" Rosenhaus said. \"Tyreek did not deserve to be treated that way by the police involved.\"\n\nRosenhaus said the altercation left Hill rattled.\n\n\"The most important thing is that Tyreek is OK physically. Mentally, he was very distraught about what happened,\" Rosenhaus told ESPN. \"Tyreek has told me over and over he's a big supporter of police. He was telling the police there, 'I want to be a police officer in the future.' But this is crazy, I've never seen anything like this.\"\n\nCNN has reached out to Rosenhaus for more information.\n\nSpeaking after the game, Dolphins defensive tackle Calais Campbell said he was also put in handcuffs by police when he attempted to intercede and \"deescalate\" the situation.\n\n\"They put handcuffs on me too, and I was like 'What's going on?' I didn't understand what the issue was,\" Campbell told NFL Network. \"For him to put handcuffs on me, I felt some type of way.\n\n\"But that just goes to show how our resilience though. We didn't let that stop us. We just got back in line, got focused again, and went out there and played a good football game. But that definitely was an interesting way to start a ballgame.\"\n\nMDPD confirmed to CNN on Monday that Campbell was present and had been \"temporarily detained but released moments later without any further incident.\"\n\nHill said he was moved by the show of support from his teammates.\n\n\"That should tell you everything you need to know,\" Hill said after the game. \"I'm just glad that my teammates were there to support me in that situation because I felt alone. And when they showed up, it made me realized that we got a f-king good team this year. For them to put their life on the line.\"\n\nWhen contacted by CNN, MDPD declined to provide more information on the incident, citing an active internal investigation.\n\nIn a statement, Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava praised the \"immediate steps\" taken by the MDPD in the aftermath of the incident.\n\n\"In recent years our nation has confronted important conversations on the use of force, and the internal review process will answer questions about why the troubling actions shown in public video footage were taken by the officer,\" Levine Cava said on Instagram .\n\n\"We will continue to keep our community informed about this process and findings will be made available - critical to maintaining the public trust that MDPD has earned with our community. I look forward to learning more from the internal review process and to updating the public as the review concludes.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN's Homero De La Fuente contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Lawyer should be sanctioned for blowing police officer's cover, city demands\n\nEditor's Note: Since this story was first published, US District Judge Dolly Gee denied the motion for sanctions on October 2. She concluded the interrogation video was never designated as confidential and wrote in part: \"Steering's behavior was not in bad faith, or tantamount to bad faith, in abuse of the judicial process, or a reckless multiplication of the proceedings.\"\n\nThe length and bushiness of a police officer's beard has become a key issue in a legal fight in California.\n\nThe city of Fontana is calling for attorney Jerry Steering to be held in contempt months after Steering publicized a nearly $900,000 settlement. The city says he violated a protective order by releasing confidential images of officers received during the lawsuit, which accused detectives of browbeating a murder confession out of an innocent man during 17 hours of interrogation . The city maintains its officers did not break any laws.\n\nVarious media outlets in the US and Europe ran the story after it broke in the San Bernardino Sun at the end of May, many using video and still photos from the interrogation of Tom Perez by Dets. David Janusz and Kyle Guthrie. At least one also used a photo of Janusz in his police uniform, and one of Guthrie taken from a deposition in the case.\n\nBut when CNN spoke exclusively to Perez for an in-depth feature and sought comment from Fontana officials, the city accused Steering of blowing a covert officer's cover and releasing materials in contravention of a court's protective order, designed to not \"jeopardize the Fontana Police Department's operations and safety.\"\n\nThe city, through its attorney Shel Harrell, called for Steering to face sanctions and be found in contempt of court, saying his alleged release of Guthrie's image hurt the officer's \"promising career\" as supervisor of undercover operations.\n\n\"FPD has now been forced to abruptly pull its key undercover officer from the field in an effort to protect him from the underworld elements he had successfully infiltrated,\" the motion said.\n\n\"(D)ue to the danger of assassination following his exposure, Sgt. Guthrie's utility as a field undercover officer has been destroyed. Sgt. Guthrie has been quickly removed from his undercover assignments and his valuable undercover operations have consequently imploded. The people of Fontana community will assuredly suffer as a result,\" it continued.\n\nGuthrie was not named as a defendant in the civil suit in which Perez accused the police of false imprisonment and due process violations, among other offenses, though he was a chief interrogator of Perez.\n\nSteering countered that Guthrie's appearance was no secret. The city itself had publicized Guthrie's face, with photos of him receiving an employee of the year award. The award was for his work in 2019, and the photo dates from a February 2020 ceremony during a city council meeting.\n\n\"(W)hen in 2020 Officer Kyle Guthrie received the Award for the Fontana Police Department Officer of the Year for 2019, he already sported that long beard,\" Steering wrote in his response to the action against him.\n\nHe called Guthrie \"the most vicious interrogator\" of Perez.\n\nThe city replied in a September 13 filing: \"But the image of Sgt. Guthrie which Steering released to the media is more current and bears his actual likeness during FPD's 2024 undercover work.\"\n\n\"Guthrie's photo from 2020 depicts a heavier man with completely different facial hair than is depicted in Steering's media release Guthrie photo,\" the city wrote.\n\nIn both images, Guthrie has a shaved head.\n\nIn 2020, his beard is arguably thicker and shorter than it appears in the February 14, 2023, deposition. By 2023, the sideburns are gone, and Guthrie's cheeks are clean-shaven down to his jawbone. A streak of gray down from the chin is more prominent in the ruddy-colored beard as seen in the later images.\n\nSteering joked in the deposition that he sported a beard to distract people from looking at the top of his head, to which Guthrie replied: \"Same.\"\n\nWhen asked if the beard was part of his job, Guthrie replied: \"I work in an undercover assignment. So, I'm not a uniform personnel. So, I can choose to grow my hair out, a beard - obviously you can tell I don't have much hair to grow out. So, this is the only thing I got.\"\n\nThe city complains that the deposition shows Guthrie's \"current undercover likeness.\" And in a supporting document supplied to the court, FPD Capt. Brian Binks said images from the deposition \"captured Sgt. Guthrie while he was dressed in his undercover attire.\"\n\nBut the video shows Guthrie wearing a shirt with the logo of the Inland Valley Special Weapons Team - a regional SWAT outfit.\n\nUndercover police officers typically never wear anything that could link them to law enforcement, even when not conducting operations.\n\n\"Mr. Steering elected to publicize Guthrie's current likeness and implode his in-the-field undercover career,\" the city wrote.\n\nThe still image from the deposition was not covered by the court's protective order, but the city argues it should not have been released.\n\n\"(I)t would be difficult to conceive of more 'reckless' conduct than Mr. Steering's decision to destroy valuable FPD undercover operations and valuable undercover careers by broadcasting FPD officer images to the City's criminal underworld,\" it wrote.\n\nYet - just four hours after the deposition concluded on February 14, 2023 - Guthrie, with his prominent beard, was thanked and named publicly along with his team as the police department's employees of the year. He had changed into a suit and tie for the ceremony at a public city council meeting that was broadcast, and a report was later published in the Fontana Herald News . The video from the city council showing Guthrie and his colleagues is still online.\n\n\"On behalf of our great citizens, we want to just thank you for all your hard work,\" said Fontana Mayor Acquanetta Warren. \"I tell you, I love watching the TV and seeing Fontana's on the job again, so thank you so much.\"\n\nIn the meeting, Fontana Police Capt. Jim Burton praised Guthrie and his colleagues in the city's \"Rapid Response Team\" for their work tackling illegal firearms and drugs and other emerging crime trends.\n\nHe said the team had seized 127,000 fentanyl pills and 25 illegal firearms in just the first six weeks of 2023.\n\nBut this is the kind of activity the city now says has been imperiled.\n\nThe city argues separately that the court's protective order did cover a lengthy interrogation video during which police berate Perez, use his dog and his friend to pressure him and ultimately watch while he breaks down.\n\nSteering said he reviewed legal files and did not believe the video was sealed when he provided it to the local reporter who broke the story and \"a few other media sources.\"\n\nThe lawyers have put forward clashing evidence about whether the video was covered by the order.\n\nBut Steering was not accused of contempt until CNN began reporting its story, after the other media reports had been published.\n\nThe city wrote: \"Mr. Steering has now escalated matters by providing Fontana's officer videos to CNN, which publicly aired them on September 5, 2024 - over the Fontana Defendants' vigorous objections. Thus, the distribution of Fontana's protected video now involves many millions of new viewers, some of which could doubtlessly include criminal elements that wish Fontana's law enforcement officer's (sic) harm.\"\n\nCNN has not reported on how it obtained the materials used in its story.\n\nA court hearing on the motion against Steering has been requested for September 27.\n\nThe city of Fontana has asked for Steering's cut of the $898,000 settlement to be returned and to be compensated for at least $26,885 of legal fees spent investigating his conduct.\n\nFontana also argued all the materials it views as confidential that were included in CNN's story should be considered by the court as part of the contempt motion and criticized CNN for the publication.\n\nCNN reached out to Steering and Harrell, the attorney who represents the city of Fontana and its employee Guthrie, for comment on this story. They have not given responses.\n\nThe Fontana Police Department didn't answer any of CNN's questions before or after the story ran.\n\n\"I don't recall receiving your emails,\" Chief Michael Dorsey said when we approached him as he was walking back to the police department after a city council meeting earlier this month.\n\nHe then did not respond to questions about how Perez was treated, the actions of his officers, how they took a dog into the interrogation room, and whether he stood by the officers..\n\nFontana PD does allow and even apparently encourage its uniformed officers to appear on TV. Guthrie himself briefly appears in uniform and is named in an episode of \"COPS\" in 2018, before the Perez interrogation. The department earlier this year joined the \"On Patrol: Live\" show that airs live footage of police officers as they respond to situations.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

      "text": "Charges dropped against deaf man after bodycam video shows Phoenix police punching and tasing him on the ground\n\nFollow:\n\nAll charges were dropped against a Black man after bodycam footage released earlier this week shows two Phoenix police officers shouting orders at him as he's lying face-down on the ground - with one officer repeatedly punching him and another officer tasing him.\n\nTyron McAlpin, 34, is deaf and no longer accused of an alleged crime that prompted officers to physically confront him in a parking lot the morning of August 19. The Maricopa County Attorney's Office decided to drop an initial charge of theft against him, the office told CNN Tuesday.\n\nBut until Thursday evening, McAlpin faced two counts of aggravated assault and one count of resisting arrest after Phoenix police said he took a \"fighting stance\" when first approached by an officer. The local police union said the officers came \"under immediate attack\" - a notion disputed by others who watched the footage.\n\nMaricopa County Attorney Rachel Mitchell said she reviewed the case against McAlpin and \"convened a large gathering of senior attorneys and members of the community\" to get their opinions, and decided to drop \"all remaining charges,\" according to a statement from her office Thursday.\n\n\"On behalf of Tyron and his family, we are overjoyed,\" McAlpin's attorney Jesse Showalter told CNN by phone. \"Rachel Mitchell has done the right and just thing after an independent review. These were unjust charges brought against Tyron and we are deeply saddened that the City of Phoenix and its officers allowed the case to progress as far as it did.\"\n\n\"This case highlights continuing issues with the city of Phoenix, Phoenix police and its police culture. We look forward to obtaining accountability and justice from the City of Phoenix,\" he continued. CNN has reached out to a city spokesperson and the Phoenix Police Department for comment.\n\nPolice were trying to question McAlpin after a man said he was punched by someone who tried to steal his bike, according to an incident report. The man directed police to McAlpin, and officers followed him to a nearby parking lot.\n\nAs McAlpin walks across the parking lot, one officer calls out to the deaf man from his police car, the bodycam footage shows.\n\n\"Hey buddy, stop where you're at,\" the officer says. \"Have a seat.\"\n\nThe officer then gets out of his car, and within seconds, a scuffle ensues.\n\n\"His hands raised to deliver targeted punches at my face/head, and multiple swings with closed fists at my head,\" the first officer who confronted McAlpin wrote in an incident report.\n\nSurveillance footage from a nearby business shows the police car driving up to McAlpin. Within seconds, an officer gets out of the car and lunges toward McAlpin.\n\nBody camera footage shows the officer was the first to outstretch his arms toward McAlpin while McAlpin's arms remained by his side.\n\nAlmost instantly, McAlpin raises his arms up. Less than a second after that, both the officer and McAlpin are tangled in a brawl.\n\nA second officer comes to help pin McAlpin on the ground, face-down. But McAlpin's right hand is still in front of his body.\n\n\"Put your hands behind your back!\" the first officer shouts to the deaf man. \"Hand behind your back, now!\"\n\nWhen McAlpin doesn't comply and lifts his head slightly, the other officer punches his head down.\n\nOne officer tases McAlpin several times before he is handcuffed and taken away. At one point, the officers describe their injuries from the confrontation:\n\n\"I think I broke my hand,\" the first officer says. \"Did he bite you?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" the second officer replied.\n\nShortly afterward, a woman arrives at the scene identifying herself as McAlpin's wife, the bodycam footage shows.\n\n\"That's my husband. He was on the phone with me,\" said the woman, later identified in a police incident report as Jessica Ulaszek.\n\n\"Well, he's under arrest for assault on a police officer,\" an officer tells her. \"He assaulted somebody at the Circle K. If you can wait over there, I'll tell you right about it, in a little bit.\"\n\nUlaszek tells officers her husband is disabled, and the two were communicating on the phone via sign language.\n\n\"He's deaf and he's got cerebral palsy. And I've been on the phone with him since Circle K,\" Ulaszek said.\n\n\"I've been on the phone with him the whole time. He didn't assault nobody.\"\n\nThe body camera footage shows fire department medics responding and assessing McAlpin while he lay on the ground. The police incident report indicated he was taken by ambulance to a hospital \"for precautionary measures.\"\n\nThe two officers have not been placed on administrative leave pending an internal investigation and are actively working, the Phoenix Police Department told CNN Tuesday.\n\n\"This incident is the subject of an ongoing internal investigation and was assigned to the Professional Standards Bureau on August 30, 2024,\" Phoenix Police said in a statement.\n\nIt took less than two seconds for the first officer to get out of his police pickup truck and put his hands on McAlpin. The officer later acknowledged he had already decided to detain McAlpin before getting out of his truck.\n\nAfter the officer drove toward McAlpin in the parking lot, gave a \"loud verbal order\" and used the truck to block McAlpin's path, he wrote in an incident report. \"Tyron changed direction 90 degrees with a quick step,\" the officer said.\n\n\"Having reason to contact Tyron as a suspect of an assault I decided to detain him,\" the officer's report states. \"I quickly exited my vehicle to take hold of Tyron's left arm, and he immediately engaged in active aggression by swinging punches at my head, beginning with his left arm.\"\n\nBut surveillance video shows McAlpin was looking down at his phone while walking across the parking lot.

      "text": "What it's like to be a black police officer, navigating two turbulent worlds\n\nSacramento Police Chief Daniel Hahn knows he plays a key role in changing the culture of policing and how communities perceive officers. It's a tough position to be in for a Black man in 2021.\n\nHe's endured being called an \"Uncle Tom\" and \"a sellout.\"\n\nIn 2017, Hahn became the first African American police chief in the Sacramento Police Department. While he understands the frustrations of the Black community, the name-calling is hard to hear.\n\n\"I think that's probably the hardest thing to have your own community, something that you've been part of since the day you were born...\" have this perception, Hahn said.\n\nBut Black police officers also get called names by others. Hahn recalls how during protests, \"young White kids\" walked up to them and called them a \"race traitor.\"\n\nAs the shootings of Black people continue to rock cities across America, debates about reform and what it means to defund the police continue. And Black officers are finding themselves navigating two worlds that are often at odds, and sometimes even at war, with each other: The black and the blue.\n\nWith police training programs under scrutiny after Derek Chauvin's murder conviction, the Sacramento police department is using several high-profile police killings of Black Americans as it trains the next generation of officers to better anticipate and respond to high-risk encounters.\n\nUnder Hahn's leadership, the department's training techniques have been largely shaped by the police killing of Stephon Clark, a 22-year-old Black man, in the city in 2018. And graphic videos of recent fatal police shootings, including 16-year-old Ma'Khia Bryant in Columbus, Ohio, and 20-year-old Daunte Wright in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, are serving as teachable moments in the agency's hands-on training.\n\nDe Lacy Davis remembers the moment vividly.\n\nThe New Jersey officer and a fellow officer were patrolling the streets of East Orange when a Black woman and her daughter accidentally stepped in front of their police cruiser.\n\nThe other officer, who was White, rolled down his window.\n\n\" What the hell are you doing, you effin' ns? \" Davis recalled him saying, while censoring out the racial slur.\n\nDavis, who is Black, is now retired from the force. But that moment 30-something years ago was just one of the many times he realized how some of his White colleagues viewed his community.\n\n\"The 'few bad apples' theory is a theory that I think is postulated by my colleagues and politicians to minimize the impact of this racism that is baked into the culture of policing,\" Davis said.\n\nThe chasm between cops and communities of color has always been deep - and it's getting deeper.\n\nBlack men are 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police than white men, according to one recent study. Black women are about 1.4 times more likely to be killed by police than White women.\n\nAnd yet, just 27% of white officers think the deaths of African-Americans in police encounters are a sign of a broader problem, according to a Pew survey. ( 57% of black officers think they are.)\n\nPolice brutality against Blacks, Davis says, hasn't become the culture of policing;  it has always been the culture of policing. Now, it's just getting filmed more.\n\nHe acknowledges that not all cops are bad. But, he says, put two bad apples in a bag of good ones, when you \"check on them next week, you'll see that you got worms through all the apples.\"\n\nIt is this world that Black officers have to tread - a delicate balance of reconciling allegiance and identity.\n\nRetired LAPD Sergeant Cheryl Dorsey knows this all too well.\n\nShe was working as a patrol officer during the 1992 Los Angeles riots , which started after four white officers were acquitted in the beating of a black man named Rodney King.\n\nAs a cop during those protests, Dorsey was called plenty of names. But she didn't take it personally because \"they don't know Cheryl. They just know the uniform,\" she said.\n\n\"I've never been torn. I'm able to be a black woman and a police officer and do my job professionally as I was trained, rely on my training and tactics so that I'm not aggressive when it's unnecessary,\" says Dorsey, who wrote an autobiography titled \"Black and Blue, The Creation of a Social Advocate.\"\n\nDavis knows this too.\n\nHe's been called a \"pig\" among other names at protests, but he had to understand that \"it's not you personally they're attacking. They're attacking the symbol that you represent.\"\n\nIn the 1990s, Dorsey sat in court, testifying against a suspected criminal. But this suspect wasn't a civilian. Dorsey was testifying against one of her own brothers in blue.\n\nA white officer was accused of shooting and killing a black tow truck driver who failed to stop at his command.\n\nDorsey says she knew the risks of speaking out against another officer. Just like in the military, the camaraderie and kinship between officers is strong.\n\nBut one way to mend this rupture between cops and minorities is to stand up to abuse, Dorsey says.\n\nRelated article A Florida police officer pushed a kneeling protester to the ground. Then his black colleague stepped in\n\n\"You have to make a decision about who you want to be when you're out there in that uniform as a black police officer,\" she says. \"And I was clear of who I was from day one.\"\n\nAnother way is to change perception by changing the reality. If people in the community see the police as the enemy, it's on the police to show them otherwise, Davis says.\n\nHe started with himself by forming Black Cops Against Police Brutality in 1991. By being on both sides, he was able to stand as an advocate for police reform while proving to his black community that he was one of them.\n\nIn 1995, Davis was invited to Paterson, New Jersey, after a 16-year-old black teen died at the hands of a police officer. The city was on edge.\n\n\"I promised them that when I came amongst them, I would come unarmed. There were times when it was extremely tense in the streets and they were threatening to kill a black cop. Yet I volunteered to be there, to stand with them,\" Davis says.\n\n\"When you take your oath to protect and serve the people, those are the risks that you take.\"\n\nThis is not to say things aren't changing. Sergeant Rashun Drayton and Captain Sonia Pruitt are proof.\n\nDrayton was the Santa Barbara Police Department's only black officer when he started his career over 20 years ago. Now, he says, his department has employees of multiple races.\n\nPruitt, who is also chairwoman of the National Black Police Association , was the first black woman to be named captain of the Montgomery County Police Department in Maryland.\n\nStill, police forces are by and large whiter than the communities they serve.\n\n\"When you see a police force of 90% white and they're patrolling a neighborhood that's a 100% black and they don't really know the people in the neighborhood, I don't know how that can be effective,\" Drayton says.\n\nHe says his department tries to regularly meet with community groups to talk about their experiences and how the police can better serve them.\n\nDiversifying a police force and building trust with the community can take years. What needs to happen now is to standardize police policy across the nation, they say.\n\n\"There needs to be a completely consistent use-of-force policy across this country so that there can be no question about whether an officer used excessive force,\" Pruitt says.\n\n\"There should also be a national database to track officers who have accused of misconduct... so they would not be allowed to be hired anywhere else in the country.\"\n\nDavis became a police officer to finance his music career as a percussionist.\n\nDorsey became a police officer because she was a single mother who needed a \"good paying job with great benefits.\"\n\nPruitt became a  police officer because she wanted \"freedom away from a desk.\"\n\nDrayton didn't even want to join the force, but was recruited at the nightclub where he was working.\n\nBut when they did, their duty went beyond the police motto of 'to protect and serve.' They had to push for change from within.\n\nBecause, they say, when you're black, the color of your skin carries a responsibility that goes beyond the color of your uniform.\n\nCNN's Emma Tucker, Ryan Young and Julia Jones contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Why it's rare for police officers to be convicted of murder\n\nAs a Minnesota jury found former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin guilty of murder and manslaughter charges, law enforcement experts note how rare it is that police officers involved in high-profile, and sometimes deadly, on-duty incidents ever face criminal charges or are convicted.\n\nExperts point to several factors, which include laws that protect an officer's right to use force, advantages from powerful police unions, prosecutors who may face a conflict of interest, and even jury pools that tend to side with police.\n\n\"It's rare because the juries are very reluctant to second guess and judge the actions of on-duty police officers in violent street encounters,\" said Philip Matthew Stinson, a criminal justice professor at Bowling Green State University who spearheads a group that tracks data on police crimes.\n\nStinson, who collects and tracks data from news reports and court records across the country with his team at the Henry A. Wallace Police Crime Database, started tracking in 2005. In that time, the team's data has revealed that at least 140 law enforcement officers have been arrested on murder or manslaughter charges related to on-duty shootings in the US.\n\nRelated article Derek Chauvin found guilty of all three charges for killing George Floyd\n\nFrom that pool, about a third were convicted on any charges. Seven officers - just 5% - have been convicted of murder during that same time frame, according to their research. Because the researchers' data is based on cases that are reported in the media, it may not be comprehensive or representative, but it captures a snapshot that suggests how rare charges for these offenses may be.\n\nThe current standard for police use of force is the 1989 US Supreme Court decision that says force must be \"objectively reasonable,\" and reasons that officers are \"often forced to make split-second judgments - in circumstances that are tense, uncertain and rapidly evolving - about the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation.\"\n\nThe standard, which is under the federal constitution, influenced some state legislatures to interpret their constitutions similarly, and many individual police agencies have incorporated that federal standard into their own policies and training, according to Brandon Garrett, professor of law at Duke University School of Law and faculty director of the school's Wilson Center for Science and Justice.\n\nRelated article Controversial Police Encounters Fast Facts\n\n\"These cases are never in nice, neat packages. The facts are always bad for both sides,\" Stinson says about most cases involving police officers. \"There are facts here that favor the defense, and there are facts here that favor the prosecution. Neither of them has a case that's in an absolute certainty to the extent you could have something like that in a jury trial.\"\n\nThere is no reliable data set that tracks on-duty shootings dating back to 2005. But according to The Washington Post's police shootings database , on-duty police officers have shot and killed more than 5,000 people since 2015. Data on the number of incidents in which police officers use deadly force is also lacking.\n\nPolice officers who stand trial for murder or manslaughter have a unique set of advantages that make a criminal conviction less likely, according to Garrett.\n\n\"In this country, many uses of force are not crimes, criminal charges are rare, and we've seen grand juries decline to indict in high-profile cases,\" said Garrett. \"Unlike the vast bulk of criminal cases that result in convictions through guilty pleas, many police officers do not plead guilty and they are successful in trial.\"\n\nIn the past few weeks, there have been several high-profile instances of police killings that exemplify how police use of deadly force is \"far more common than it should be in this country,\" Garrett said.\n\nIn recent weeks, body-worn camera footage showed then-police officer Kim Potter fatally shoot 20-year-old Daunte Wright during a routine traffic stop in a Minneapolis suburb last week and separately, a Chicago police officer making a split-second decision to fire a single shot that killed 13-year-old Adam Toledo in late March and video from last May of Chauvin kneeling on George Floyd's neck was aired again and again.\n\nRelated article The mother of a Black man shot by police in 2009 sees her own family's tragedy in the death of Daunte Wright\n\nFormer Brooklyn Center, Minnesota police chief Tim Gannon said Potter, who was charged with second-degree manslaughter in Wright's death, mistook her gun for her Taser. In Chicago, Toledo was shot after he was seen holding what police said was a handgun at the end of a foot chase down a dark alley. The boy is seen raising his hands at the same time the officer fires his weapon, according to police body camera footage.\n\nIn many states, attorneys for police officers argue that their use of force and conduct was justified under \"split-second circumstances,\" which refers to rapidly evolving police encounters, according to Garrett.\n\nPolice defendants often turn down plea offers knowing that their defense will likely succeed at trial. Officers often secure defense attorneys just hours after the incident occurs and they have high-quality union representation from the onset to advise on their strategy, experts say.\n\n\"The quality of the lawyering is very different from regular criminal cases,\" Garrett added. \"For the typical criminal defendant, it's incredibly risky to go to trial.\"\n\nIn 2018, prosecutors charged East Pittsburgh police officer Michael Rosfeld with criminal homicide in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Antwon Rose II . Rosfeld, who is White, was found not guilty on all charges the following year. Rose, an unarmed Black teenager, was shot in the back while running away during a traffic stop.\n\nPatrick Thomassey, the defense attorney for Rosfeld, told CNN this week that juries in criminal trials involving police are often torn because they know officers are authorized by law to use deadly force when they are confronted with it.\n\nRelated article Killings by police, like the Breonna Taylor case, rarely end in trials or convictions\n\n\"People on the outside don't understand what the law is. There are training and use of force statutes determining when police can use deadly force,\" Thomassey said. \"You have to look at whether he had a right to use it at the time he used it.\"\n\nAnd it is more than not understanding the scope of the law. Police defendants also benefit from juror sympathy due to the public perception that their job is inherently dangerous, which can broaden their range of self-defense arguments.\n\n\"Officers know that they have legal defenses that wouldn't otherwise be available because they have a professional role in which they are authorized to use force that no one else is,\" Garrett said. \"That makes for a very different case.\"\n\nOn the same day that the jury cleared Rosfeld of all charges, seven bullets were fired into Thomassey's law office in Monroeville, Pittsburgh, he said.\n\n\"There's always so much emotion involved in these cases,\" Thomassey said. \"That's the hard part from a defense posture and a prosecution posture. You just hope that the people listen to the law, set aside whatever emotions are involved, follow the law, and render the proper decision.\"\n\nChauvin's actions spurred law enforcement officials to violate the so-called \"blue wall of silence\" with no one's testimony shining a bigger spotlight than that of the Minneapolis police chief, saying that the former officer violated department policy and the use of force was unjustified.\n\nThe near-unprecedented departure from the unwritten code shows both how some police officials condemn Chauvin's actions and how unique the trial has become.\n\nChief Medaria Arradondo testified that Chauvin should have stopped kneeling on George Floyd's neck when he stopped resisting and became nonresponsive, saying Chauvin was wrong to \"apply that level of force to a person proned out, handcuffed behind their back.\"\n\nIn past cases, the \"blue wall of silence\" provides cover around an officer accused of using deadly force, inhibiting cops from speaking out against others in their police department, according to Garrett.\n\n\"Hopefully that will set a precedent that agencies will not stand by the worst conduct of their officers,\" he said. \"If jurors aren't sure what police officers are or are not supposed to do, they may see the police front is reflecting that the person's conduct must have been appropriate police behavior.\"\n\nRelated article The charges against Derek Chauvin in the death of George Floyd, explained\n\nGarrett said there are hundreds of instances where police use deadly force each year but despite the fatality, very few of those incidents result in an officer facing criminal charges.\n\nIn the aftermath of Chauvin's guilty verdict, Garrett believes there will continue to be a \"rethinking\" of how and when officers should be held civilly and criminally liable when they cause a death. The problem is that there is very little data available on deadly force used by police.\n\nIn police brutality cases, the question is whether the officer accused of misconduct acted \"reasonably\" and their behavior was necessary under the circumstances - but how \"reasonable\" is defined remains largely elusive.\n\n\"There are so few cases that tell us what reasonable is, and that's why a conviction in the Derek Chauvin trial would set a standard for reasonable that we didn't have before,\" said Gloria Browne-Marshall, professor of constitutional law at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and civil rights attorney.\n\nThe Chauvin trial is a rare example of \"zealous prosecution\" in hundreds of years where prosecutors have failed to prosecute White people for crimes against Black people, Browne-Marshall said.\n\nDespite viral images of police using what some argue to be excessive force, most are deemed reasonable by prosecutors and grand juries, whether because the officer's actions found to be justified or there is not enough evidence to file criminal charges.\n\nSam Aguiar, one of the attorneys representing the family of Breonna Taylor, said he's all too familiar with the sting a family feels when police aren't charged, and prosecutors could have done more.\n\nRelated article Minnesota's Twin Cities are once again the national flashpoint over race and policing\n\nTaylor was a 26-year-old emergency medical technician when she was shot and killed by Louisville police officers in her apartment during an early-morning raid in March 2020. A grand jury indicted only one of the officers on three counts of wanton endangerment, as prosecutors said he blindly fired 10 shots into the home. That officer pleaded not guilty.\n\nAguiar said the difference between his case and the Chauvin trial is that Minnesota state prosecutors aren't being asked to go after police officers they work with every day.\n\n\"These prosecutors use a cost-benefit analysis and it's: do we go after a police officer for what is criminal conduct and really diligently pursue the case and get a conviction and take the risk of losing the support of our key witnesses on hundreds of other cases, or do we basically sack the case,\" Aguiar said. \"When you bring in an independent body to come in and basically put all the resources into holding the officer accountable, that you're actually going to get a situation where a trial is put together that really does present all the evidence objectively.\"\n\nAnd not to be understated, police departments around the country spoke out against Chauvin's actions, with no bigger example of that than Arradondo, taking the stand against Chauvin, one of his former officers. It's something, Aguiar says, he hopes to see in other cases moving forward.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

She also detailed being sprayed in the eyes and teargassed.\n\n\"I can just remember my breath catching in my throat because what I saw was just a war scene. It was something like I had seen out of the movies,\" said Edwards, who the House select committee investigating the US Capitol attack said was the first law enforcement officer injured by the rioters.\n\n\"I couldn't believe my eyes: There were officers on the ground. They were bleeding. They were throwing up. I saw friends with blood all over their faces. I was slipping in people's blood. I was catching people as they fell. It was carnage. It was chaos. I can't even describe what I saw. Never in my wildest dreams did I think that as a police officer, as a law enforcement officer, I would find myself in the middle of a battle,\" she recalled.\n\nRelated article Takeaways from the prime-time January 6 committee hearing\n\nEdwards told the committee there were \"hours of hand-to-hand combat\" and that there were \"hours of dealing with things that were way beyond what any law enforcement officer has ever trained for.\"\n\nShe described taking pride in her job to \"protect America's symbol of democracy\" - and the vicious public scrutiny she had endured after she suffered a traumatic brain injury during the attack.\n\n\"I was called a lot of things on January 6, 2021, and the days thereafter,\" she said \"I was called Nancy Pelosi's dog, called incompetent, called a hero and a villain. I was called a traitor to my country, my home and my Constitution. In actuality, I was none of those things.\"\n\n\"I was an American standing face-to-face with other Americans asking myself how many time  - many, many times - how we had gotten here. I had been called names before, but never had my patriotism or duty been called into question,\" she added.\n\nReferring to herself as \"the proud granddaughter\" of a Marine veteran who had fought in the Korean War, Edwards said: \"I am a proud American, and I will gladly sacrifice everything to make sure that the America my grandfather defended is here for many years to come.\"\n\nRelated article January 6 Vice Chair Cheney said Trump had a 'seven-part plan' to overturn the election.

      "text": "Here's what we know about Kim Potter, the officer who fatally shot Daunte Wright\n\nThe trial of Kim Potter ended December 23 after a jury found the former suburban Minneapolis police officer guilty of two counts of manslaughter for the killing of Daunte Wright during a traffic stop in April.\n\nPotter, who is White, fatally shot the 20-year-old Black man in Brooklyn Center after police pulled Wright over for an expired tag and a hanging air freshener. During the stop, officers learned he had an outstanding warrant and attempted to arrest him.\n\nRelated article Kim Potter found guilty in Daunte Wright shooting\n\nIn the 90-second body camera video of the shooting - shared by the town's police chief less than 24 hours after the shooting - Potter can be heard yelling \"Taser\" repeatedly before she shoots Wright. After firing her handgun, she yells, \"Holy sh*t! I just shot him!\"\n\nPotter was convicted of first- and second-degree manslaughter and is scheduled to be sentenced February 18, 2022.\n\nThe maximum penalty for first-degree manslaughter predicated on reckless use/handling of a firearm is 15 years in prison and/or a $30,000 fine. However, since Potter has no criminal history, Minnesota sentencing guidelines recommend a sentence roughly between 6 and 8 1/2 years in prison.\n\nHere is what we know about Potter:\n\nPotter, 49, was with the Brooklyn Center Police Department for 26 years, according to the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. She joined the department in 1995, according to the Star Tribune newspaper in Minneapolis.\n\nShe served as the police union's president in 2019, had been on the department's negotiation team and worked as a field training officer, the Tribune reported.\n\nPotter resigned from the department two days after the shooting.\n\nThe veteran officer testified for hours at the trial and broke down in tears several times as she described the \"chaotic\" moments that led up to the shooting. She said she was \"very distraught\" and sorry for what happened.\n\nIn her testimony, Potter said before Wright's killing she had never deployed her Taser or fired a handgun while on duty, and she had never had a complaint against her.\n\nFormer Police Chief Tim Gannon, who also submitted his resignation after the shooting, said at the time the portion of the released body-worn camera footage led him to believe the shooting was accidental and that Potter's actions before the shooting were consistent with the department's training on Tasers.\n\nGannon said, \"the officer had the intention to deploy their Taser, but instead shot Mr. Wright with a single bullet.\" The fatal shooting appeared to be \"an accidental discharge,\" he said.\n\nRelated article 90 seconds of video will be key in trial of Kimberly Potter, the officer who killed Daunte Wright\n\nThe Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension examined Potter's duty belt and found her handgun was holstered on the right side of her belt, while the Taser was on the left side, according to a news release from Washington County Attorney Pete Orput's office.\n\nCiting a criminal complaint, the news release said the Taser is yellow with a black grip and is set in a straight-draw position, \"meaning Potter would have to use her left hand to pull the Taser out of its holster.\"\n\nSean Hendrickson, who teaches the use of force in Washington, told CNN the only way he could wrap his head around Potter confusing a Taser for a gun is if she underwent \"cognitive overload.\" He defined this overload as the brain going into fight or flight mode and driving the behavior of an individual.\n\nHendrickson said the situation with Potter and Wright, from the single video released, didn't seem like it was \"unfolding at a rate that would equate to cognitive overload like that.\"\n\nEarl Gray, a St. Paul-based attorney, represented Potter.\n\nRelated article Brooklyn Center City Council approves sweeping police reforms in the wake of Daunte Wright's death\n\nGray is also the attorney for Thomas Lane , one of the four officers charged in George Floyd's death. He was also a defense attorney for Jeronimo Yanez , the former St. Anthony, Minnesota, police officer who was found not guilty of second-degree manslaughter for the fatal shooting of Philando Castile.\n\nPotter was also represented by Paul Engh.\n\nMistaking a handgun for a Taser is rare and was central to the manslaughter charges against Potter. During the trial, defense attorneys argued Potter's actions did not rise to the level of a crime, while the prosecution argued her fatal error was due to recklessness and negligence.\n\nCNN's Ashley Killough and Brad Parks contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

He also said smaller departments, which account for 80% of agencies nationwide, were underrepresented in the responses PERF received.\n\nMany larger departments have increased officer pay or started offering incentives such as signing bonuses for experienced officers who are willing to transfer, something smaller departments can't really compete with. At least a dozen smaller departments have disbanded , leaving the municipalities they once served to rely on state or county help for policing.\n\nBut even some of the highest-paying large departments are still struggling to get new hires in the door.\n\n\"I don't think it's all about money. I think it's about the way people perceive their job and feel they are going to be supported,\" Wexler said. \"You have West Coast departments that are paying six figures, but still seeing major challenges in hiring.\"\n\nIn addition to pay and bonuses, many agencies are reexamining their application requirements and hiring processes.\n\nWexler believes some of those changes make sense, including allowing visible tattoos, reweighing the importance of past financial issues and processing applicants' background checks faster. But he cautioned that PERF does not support lowering standards for training or for applicants.\n\nMaria \"Maki\" Haberfeld, chair of the Department of Law, Police Science and Criminal Justice Administration at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, says departments have been too focused on officer numbers. She worries some are lowering education requirements and other standards to bolster numbers instead of trying to find the best people to police their communities.\n\n\"Policing is a real profession that requires more skills and more education than people can understand,\" she said. \"It's not about tattoos or running a mile in 15 minutes. It's really more about emotional intelligence, maturity and making those split-second decisions that don't use deadly force.\"\n\nHaberfeld also cautioned that any staffing gains made through incentives could easily be erased, especially as officers, including some in riot gear, have been seen breaking up protests against the Israel-Hamas war at universities across the country.\n\n\"In policing, it takes decades to move forward and a split second for the public attitude to deteriorate,\" she said.\n\nPERF's survey showed a more than a 20% drop in resignations overall, from a high of almost 6,500 in 2022 to fewer than 5,100 in 2023. They are still up over early pandemic levels in 2020, however, when a few more than 4,000 officers resigned across all responding departments.\n\nAs with the hiring increases, the rate of decrease in retirements tended to depend on the size of the departments. There were fewer retirements in 2023 than in 2019 at large departments, slightly more retirements at medium departments and elevated retirements at small departments. The survey found a steep drop in resignations at large agencies with 250 or more officers and medium-size agencies with between 50 and 249 officers.\n\nIn addition to pay and benefit increases, the improved retention can be partly attributed to a shift in how some public officials view their public safety departments, Wexler says.\n\n\"We went from having public discourse about defunding the police just a few years ago to public officials waking up to the fact their workforce is leaving,\" he said. \"I don't think there's any question that there has been a sea change among political leaders.\"\n\nPatrick Smith is a London-based editor and reporter for NBC News Digital.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

So did his few remaining officers, leading the Minnesota town of 1,300 residents to shutter its police force in late August.\n\nAmerica is in the midst of a police officer shortage that many in law enforcement blame on the twofold morale hit of 2020 - the coronavirus pandemic and criticism of police that boiled over with the murder of George Floyd by a police officer. From Minnesota to Maine, Ohio to Texas, small towns unable to fill jobs are eliminating their police departments and turning over police work to their county sheriff , a neighboring town or state police.\n\nThe trend isn't altogether new.\n\nAt least 521 U.S. towns and cities with populations of 1,000 to 200,000 disbanded policing between 1972 and 2017, according to a peer-reviewed 2022 paper by Rice University Professor of Economics Richard T. Boylan.\n\nIn the past two years, at least 12 small towns have dissolved their departments.\n\nGoodhue County is now under contract for law enforcement duties in the town of Goodhue, even as Sheriff Marty Kelly tries to fill four vacancies in his own department. He said he has around 10 applicants for those jobs. By comparison, one open position in 2019 drew 35 applicants, he said.\n\nKelly knows that to get to full staffing, he'll have to hire new deputies away from other towns or counties - creating vacancies in other places that will struggle to fill them.\n\n\"It's scary,\" Kelly said. \"We are robbing Peter to pay Paul. And we're not alone.\"\n\nAt the heart of the problem is the exodus from law enforcement. Officer resignations were up 47% last year compared to 2019 - the year before the pandemic and Floyd's killing - and retirements are up 19%. That's all according to a survey of nearly 200 police agencies by the Police Executive Research Forum, a Washington, DC.-based think tank. Though the survey represents only agencies affiliated with PERF, a fraction of the more than 18,000 law enforcement agencies nationwide and is not representative of all departments, it's one of the few efforts to examine police hiring and retention and compare it with the time before Floyd's killing.\n\nCompounding the exodus of veteran officers, young people are increasingly unwilling to go through the months of training necessary to become a police officer, said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum.\n\n\"Fewer people are applying to be police officers, and more officers are retiring or resigning at a tremendous rate,\" Wexler said. \"There's a shortage of police officers across the country.\"\n\nAgencies of all sizes are struggling to fill open positions. But the problem is especially dire in smaller communities that can't match the pay and incentives offered by bigger places.\n\nAnother Minnesota town, Morris , dissolved its police department last year after continued departures of officers. The town of 5,100 residents was down to two officers at the time. In Maine, the town of Limestone disbanded its police department in March. Neighboring Van Buren did the same two years earlier.\n\nGenerally, crime rates were unchanged in towns that dropped their departments, the Rice University study found. Leaders of several towns said they've been happy with the change.\n\nTown leaders in Washburn, Illinois, dissolved their department in 2021 and let the county take over law enforcement duties for its 1,100 residents.\n\n\"You really can't tell much of any difference,\" Mayor Steve Forney said. \"The sheriff's department is very responsive. I like it. I was always one who was very hesitant to go this direction, but I feel it's working for us.\"\n\nLott, Texas, a town of about 700 residents, disbanded its department last year. Mayor Sue Tacker said the town was going broke and couldn't afford to pay two officers and two other employees.\n\nWith county deputies now patrolling Lott, the crime rate remains low and response times have been good, Tacker said. She believes residents are OK with the change.\n\n\"I haven't had any griping or fussing,\" Tacker said.\n\nGoodhue occupies about one square mile of land 65 miles (105 kilometers) south of Minneapolis. It's made up of tidy homes with a few small businesses - a bakery, a florist, a café, a supermarket, a taxidermist - most of them in brick storefronts in the small downtown area.\n\nThe town struggled for years to recruit and retain officers. The City Council had boosted pay by 5% earlier this year and gave Smith a $13,000 raise.\n\nIt wasn't enough. Smith told the City Council at a meeting on July 26 that it was virtually impossible to attract applicants for a job starting at $22 an hour . That's about $10 per hour less than Goodhue County deputies earn.\n\n\"There's zero incentive to come out here to a small town,\" Smith said at the meeting.\n\nTwo weeks later, Smith gave notice of his resignation. Within days, the remaining full-time officer and five part-time employees also called it quits. The town agreed to pay the county about $44,000 for law enforcement services through the end of this year. Goodhue leaders will decide later whether to extend the contract through 2024.\n\nGoodhue resident Ron Goebel, a retired accountant, said he believes the sheriff's department will do a good job, and he expects townspeople to help out, too.\n\n\"People can kind of watch out for each other a little bit,\" Goebel said, noting that he himself watches for strange vehicles in his neighborhood. \"We pretty much know our neighbors.\"\n\nGoebel fears the loss of the police department is another challenge for Goodhue and towns like it across the nation.\n\n\"As you lose your schools, you lose your businesses and you lose your police force, how much longer can the town actually be viable as a town?\" Goebel asked.\n\nThe Associated Press\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Dunn plans to endorse candidates up and down the ballot through the group, using his personal story and his fundraising prowess to help in targeted races.\n\n\"The first thing I had to decide when you want to run for office is your why: Why are you doing this, why are you running?\" Dunn told NBC News in an interview Tuesday, before he announced his plans Wednesday morning on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\"\n\n\"My why is to do everything I can to protect the institution of Congress, to fight back against Donald Trump, to defend our Constitution, our democracy,\" Dunn continued. \"Even though I came up short in the election, there definitely is room for me to continue to fight.\"\n\nThe group will inherit the money left over from Dunn's campaign - though it won't be clear how much until post-primary fundraising reports are due this summer.\n\nDunn, a 15-year veteran of the Capitol Police, says that the mob on Jan. 6 shouted racial slurs at him and attacked him, and he testified about his experience before the House committee investigating the attack and at the seditious conspiracy trial of members of the far-right Oath Keepers.\n\nIt's against that backdrop that Dunn decided to run for Congress in Maryland this year. Despite his national recognition, endorsements from prominent members of Congress and significant fundraising, the political newcomer fell short to Democratic state Sen. Sarah Elfreth . Elfreth highlighted her legislative record and got a boost from an outside group affiliated with the pro-Israel American Israel Public Affairs Committee.\n\nIn his first run for political office, Dunn raised more than $4.5 million in less than six months, making him one of the best 30 House candidate fundraisers this election cycle to date - including incumbents who have been fundraising for their re-elections since January 2023. That gives Dunn a strong financial platform for his new group.\n\nDunn said he didn't have a financial goal in mind and that the group's plans will depend on what his endorsed candidates need from him. But after his primary, he said he wants to boost Democrats who agree that corporate money doesn't belong in politics.\n\n\"There was no secret I was a very strong fundraiser - all that came from was my story and my message and my desire to, one, stop MAGA Republicans, and two, to get dark money and MAGA money, these corporate PACs out of free and fair elections. That's a simple story and it resonates with a lot of people,\" he said.\n\nDunn is also taking on a more visible role in supporting President Joe Biden's re-election - joining former fellow police officers who also defended the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, on the trail with the Biden campaign .\n\nAsked whether the group could endorse moderate Republicans to oppose Trump-supporting Republicans, Dunn said that he wouldn't take the concept off the table - but that he doesn't \"see any Republicans on the other side aisle that are standing up to Donald Trump, it's like they don't exist anymore.\"\n\n\"Donald Trump has surrogates, people in the Republican Party that want to do nothing except downplay, whitewash, diminish, flat out lie about what happened that day,\" Dunn said of the Jan. 6 attack.\n\n\"It's not just regular everyday American citizens. These are elected officials that are whitewashing and saying these things. That's why it's so important that we never stop telling our story,\" Dunn said.\n\nAnd he added that while he has no specific office in mind for a potential future bid, he wouldn't rule out another run.\n\nBen Kamisar is a national political reporter for NBC News\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

His trial began in late 2017, lasting six weeks before he was acquitted of a second-degree murder charge. He was temporarily rehired by Mesa police last August as part of the settlement that allowed him to file for accidental disability retirement benefits.\n\nThe settlement also says Mesa will set aside up to $3 million for Brailsford to defend himself and pay lawsuit settlements related to the case, and that the city will give potential employers a \"neutral reference\" for him. He is ineligible to be hired again by Mesa.\n\nIn a statement provided by city spokesman Steven Wright, Brailsford initially requested an appeal of his firing the day after it was announced, but that process was put on hold until his criminal case was resolved.\n\n\"During the time that Mr. Brailsford was making his application for medical retirement, he was not paid and was not assigned any police officer duties. The one-year time frame to apply for an accidental disability pension began for Mr. Brailsford once the trial concluded,\" the statement said.\n\nSince there was no resolution to Brailsford appealing his firing, Piccarreta added, he was \"never really terminated\" and his acquittal at trial showed there \"was never a factual termination because the shooting was justified.\"\n\nAt the heart of the prosecution's case was shaky bodycam video showing the moment police opened fire.\n\nShaver, 26, a pest-control worker, was in Mesa on business when he showed acquaintances in his hotel room an air rifle used to exterminate birds. At one point, officials said, he waved the air rifle outside of his fifth-floor window - prompting a witness to notify the hotel front desk, which led to police being called. Police said he had been drinking at the time.\n\nWhen officers got there, they ordered Shaver out of his room and to lie face-down in a hallway and refrain from making sudden movements - or risk being shot.\n\n\"Please do not shoot me,\" Shaver begged before he was ordered to crawl toward officers. As he inched forward, he reached toward the waistband of his shorts.\n\nThat action led Brailsford to fire his rifle, he said, because he believed Shaver was grabbing for a handgun.\n\nWhile no gun was found on Shaver's body, two pellet rifles related to his pest-control job were discovered in his room.\n\nThe detective investigating the shooting agreed Shaver's movement was similar to reaching for a pistol, but also said it looked as though Shaver was pulling up his loose-fitting basketball shorts that had fallen down as he was ordered to crawl.\n\nThe investigator noted he did not see anything that would have prevented officers from simply handcuffing Shaver as he was on the floor.\n\nThe shooting has led Shaver's family to file a $75 million wrongful-death lawsuit in federal court and the Department of Justice last year to begin investigating what happened, according to KPNX. An attorney for the family did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the latest developments in the case.\n\nA spokesman for the state's Public Safety Personnel Retirement System, which reviews whether pension applications are processed correctly and that decisions made by local boards follow guidelines, said that \"there is nothing for our agency to review\" as long as state law is followed.\n\nEugene O'Donnell, a former police officer and professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, said the city of Mesa, in deciding to temporarily rehire Brailsford so he could apply for a pension, is in a difficult position because of public perception that the Shaver case was a \"bad shooting.\"\n\n\"With all deals, the good, the bad and the ugly is buried in the deal,\" O'Donnell said. \"For Mesa, they probably just want to move on from this issue because it's really turned people against police, who see it as a justifiable shooting.\"\n\n\"The police have been tarnished by the events and they're facing a lack of enthusiasm,\" he added, \"which is a crucial ingredient for doing their job.\"\n\nErik Ortiz is a senior reporter for NBC News Digital focusing on racial injustice and social inequality.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Read it now .\n\nFormer Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn announced Friday that heâs running for Congress, in a bid to work as a lawmaker in the same building he defended during the Jan. 6, 2021 riot.\n\nDunn, 40, has become a prominent voice in speaking out about what officers faced that day. He joins a crowded Democratic primary field looking to replace longtime Maryland Rep. John Sarbanes, who is not running for reelection this November.\n\nDunn enters the race with a high profile in Washington as one of the first officers to speak to the press after the Jan. 6 attack. He told The New York Times that he did so to counter criticism of the Capitol Police officers that spread following the riot, and to document how âbravelyâ they fought. âTheyâre heroes,â he said. He also spoke about the racist slurs that rioters hurled at him on Jan. 6, and testified before the House committee investigating the attack.\n\nâI never thought Iâd run for office, but then January 6 happened,â Dunn told Semafor. âSince then, Iâve been on a mission for justice, to preserve our democracy, and to stand our ground against the extremists trying to tear our country apart.â\n\nDunn wrote a memoir last year focused on his search for âaccountability and good troubleâ after the attack. Getting widespread accountability for Jan. 6 has been a dominant theme for Dunn; he has criticized â Donald Trump and his acolytes â for downplaying the events of that day, and said itâs not enough to only punish the people who physically attacked the Capitol. âThe American people deserve to know who played any role in planning or financing the events that led to the attack,â he wrote in The Washington Post, and âwho failed to take timely action to warn of and prepare for the impending violence.â\n\nDunnâs race comes the same year as the U.S. presidential election, in which the events of Jan. 6 are likely to be a major theme. In a speech Friday, President Joe Biden is set to use the anniversary of the riot to cast his reelection bid as central to the ongoing fight for democracy. His campaign also has a new ad featuring footage from Jan. 6. Trump, meanwhile, has increasingly embraced Jan. 6 and its participants since leaving office, calling it a âbeautiful dayâ and saying he will pardon âmanyâ of the rioters.\n\nâ Kadia Goba contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives."

      "text": "Whatâs worrying the worldâs top cop?\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nThe U.S. and its NATO allies have shipped over $40 billion in arms to Ukraine since Russiaâs full-scale invasion last year. Interpol Secretary General Jurgen Stock is preparing for the risk that these weapons will eventually seep into Europe and conflict zones as far afield as Africa and Latin America.\n\nIn an interview with Semafor, Stock said Europeâs recent history shows that weapons deployed in local conflicts, such as the Balkan Wars of the 1990s, inevitably make their way to other battlefields, through either legitimate trade or criminal networks, once the guns go silent.\n\nâYou donât need to be skilled with a lot of foresight capabilities, because that is what we have seen in other theaters around the world,â Stock said.\n\nI sat down with Stock to find out what was driving the work of, essentially, the worldâs top cop. A German police officer and academic, Stock has led Interpol since 2014, and is especially concerned about the growing power of transnational criminal syndicates, such as the Sinaloa Cartel in Mexico and Italyâs âNdrangheta , to challenge the power of national states, not just in Latin America and Africa, but also Europe. (Last year, Belgium arrested four gang members for attempting to kidnap the countryâs Justice Minister .) Stock is pressing for a greater collaboration among Interpolâs 195 members to combat this threat.\n\nCountering the global flow of narcotics, including fentanyl, is also at the top of Interpolâs mandate, said Stock. He explained how Interpolâs headquarters in Lyon, France has quietly provided the U.S. and China a venue to cooperate on the issue, even as their respective governments have sparred over it. âThese people are sitting together, and itâs a platform for dialogue and we are talking with each other,â he said.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nJay Solomon : What concerns you and Interpol the most right now globally?\n\nJurgen Stock : Cybercrime, organized crime groups getting stronger and stronger despite all the efforts and all the great success stories we have had, or international law enforcement has had. Most of these criminal gangs â whether they call them gangs, cartels, transnational organized crime groups â are getting stronger and stronger.\n\nJay Solomon : Whatâs making them stronger?\n\nJurgen Stock : Thereâs a bunch of reasons. But letâs say they are quite flexible, in terms of the crime areas in which they invest. We have seen that [when] we were organizing operations targeting drugs, and we identified on that occasion thousands of firearms. We are organizing operations targeting firearms particularly on that occasion, [and] we seize tons of drugs, different drugs. So, you see how flexible they are.\n\nJay Solomon : What threats do these criminal syndicates pose to nation states?\n\nJurgen Stock : Corruption plays a huge role. We see that criminal gangs are investing millions and millions to corrupt officers. This is increasingly undermining the rule of law all across the world, not only destabilizing, letâs say, so-called fragile states that are having certain problems, social problems, economic problems and so on. But even undermining the rule of law and stability in the developed world.\n\nYouâll see more and more violence on the streets. Belgium is an example, the Netherlands is an example, Sweden is an example. Where at the end of such a drug distribution chain, the supply chain, there are fights between groups â Is it my turf? Is it your turf? And more violence on the street intimidating governments. We have seen that in Belgium, where they attempted to kidnap the Minister of Justice. So more open violence against state officials.\n\nJay Solomon: How do strained relations between the U.S. and China impact the fight against the fentanyl trade?\n\nJurgen Stock: Interpol is providing a platform again where even if itâs politically difficult, we can at least have a conversation on the Interpol level. We have an enterprise Executive Committee in my Supervisory Body: We have the U.S. represented and we have China represented. So, these people are sitting together, and itâs a platform for dialogue and we are talking with each other. Again, Iâm not saying that all the time it leads to immediate, tangible results. But very often, it helps at least a little bit. And itâs better than, letâs say, radio silence.\n\nJay Solomon: Youâve been raising since last summer your concerns about weapons in Ukraine flooding into Africa and Europe. Can you say more?\n\nJurgen Stock : You donât need to be skilled with a lot of foresight capabilities, because that is what we have seen in other theaters around the world. That is still a big concern. And, again, Interpol is providing an opportunity [to stop this]. We have a database where these weapons can be tracked, traced. And we strongly encourage our member countries to use that database to help tracking and tracing these weapons.\n\nJay Solomon : How successful are policing agencies in seizing illicit money?\n\nJurgen Stock : How successful are we as a global law enforcement community? The experts are saying, optimistically, 2% to 3% of all the criminal assets. Even that would be more than disappointing. And some experts are saying youâre getting less than 1%, perhaps realistically.\n\nJay Solomon : How often are criminal syndicates using crypto?\n\nJurgen Stock : More and more definitely. I donât have any figures and numbers now, but we see that itâs increasingly being used. I mean, sometimes whenever the central platform is breaking down, there might be a certain reluctance or reorientation, but of course they are using it. They have been using it maybe faster than police could develop its tools at least in law enforcement.\n\nJay Solomon : Do digital assets provide an opportunity for law enforcement?\n\nJurgen Stock: Itâs a double-edged sword. Right? So in the one hand, of course, you provide criminals opportunities to hide their illegal activities, particularly if they are fast, faster than law enforcement. We also have opportunities to track and trace and investigate if we have the necessary tools. If we have the legal framework.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Keith Ellison got justice for George Floyd. Hereâs what he learned along the way.\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nâItâs hard to convict the police,â Minnesota Attorney Gen. Keith EllisonÂ said Â in 2020. Heâd just taken over the investigation into the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, not long after arsonists had just burned down the cityâs third police precinct. Ellisonâs team won the case, and his new book, âBreak the Wheel,â recounts how they did it, as well as how he won a tight re-election campaign amid the backlash to 2020âs police reforms. This is an edited transcript of his conversation with Americana.\n\nAmericana: You get into your re-election last year in the book, and write that âI simply could not allow the lesson to be that prosecuting a cop is political suicide.â What would have happened, had you lost?\n\nKeith Ellison: I was worried that we would be further away from the basic idea of equal protection, the idea that nobody is above the law, nobodyâs beneath the law. Keith Ellison could go and do other things. Iâve never fully identified with the elective office that I happen to be holding at the time. But I felt a tremendous urgency to pull it out in that election, because if I lost, it would scare anybody away from doing what I believe is their duty as a prosecutor.\n\nThat would have been a horrible outcome. So I knocked every door I could. Can you prosecute a police officer and still win your job back as a prosecutor? The answer is yes, but you might have to work your ass off.\n\nAmericana: You write about thinking through the risks when you learned that Gov. Walz was going to give you the case. âWouldnât I be deciding based on how the outcome affects me personally? Isnât that wrong?â\n\nKeith Ellison: My mom was on my mind that day. Do you remember when that horrible tragic incident happened at the Pulse nightclub in Florida? And then John Lewis and some other members of Congress went down to the House floor and did a good old-fashioned sit in?\n\nAmericana: I do.\n\nKeith Ellison: So, I happened to be in my office talking to some constituents at the time. My secretary walks into the room, and she hands me a card with a note on it, which says: âYour mom said get to the House floor.â My mother had called my office. She saw that there was a sit-down on the House floor, and she expected her son to be at the party.\n\nThatâs the kind of woman that she was. She was a justice person. She would have been absolutely appalled by what happened to George Floyd. And she would have wanted me to do what was right.\n\nAmericana: You write this about the prosecutionâs strategy: âWe werenât putting policing on trial. As much as some protesters would have enjoyed that, it probably would have led to an acquittal.â What do you mean?\n\nKeith Ellison: Iâm aware of the larger historical political ramifications of chronic excessive force. Itâs historic and nationwide. Iâve been working on it for a long time. But it wasnât going to achieve the main goal here. And I think it would be slightly unfair, given the fact that I know so many cops who really do care about the safety of their neighbors, and signed up to protect that safety.\n\nIf this experience taught me anything, it is that we donât have to have fundamentally flawed policing in America. We have it, because we will not maintain accountability. We have it because we wonât fire people or discipline them when they violate rules. But Iâm convinced that the institution remains important and is honorable, and that we donât have to live this way.\n\nWe need to acknowledge that we do need armed agents of the state to deal with certain kinds of crime, violent crime. But we donât need armed agents of the state to handle every kind of crime. For example, maybe you can just send out some sort of counterfeit investigator to go deal with the George Floyd matter.\n\nAmericana: The response to that, especially from Republicans, is usually mockery. Oh, you want to send a social worker to a crime scene?\n\nKeith Ellison: This is all stuff Republicans hate because they believe in punishment, for others, not themselves. If youâre a low-income, poor person, they think the way to get you to do something is to inflict maximum pain on you. If youâre talking about themselves, they want the Donald Trump treatment, nothing bad. Nothing bad you do, you ever have to answer for.\n\nAmericana: You got re-elected, but you endorsed the Â Â measure to replace Â Â the Minneapolis police department, and that failed. Whatâs actually improved since 2020?\n\nKeith Ellison: That became one of my comebacks in the debates. âOh, Ellison supported this proposal to get rid of the police department and have a department of public safety.â I said: Well, youâre right. I did. I did support that amendment. But guess what, after it went down, the wiser people took over and we now have a department of public safety, and you have one person who can coordinate all these agencies. Weâre actually interested in saving lives, and youâre interested in trying to win an election through fear.\n\nWe overhauled the police officer standards and training system. The city of Minneapolis has banned no-knock warrants. St. Paul hasnât done a no-knock warrant since 2016. And we have police leadership that, in my opinion, really gets it.\n\nAmericana: You said earlier that we do need âarmed agents of the stateâ to deal with some crimes. Whatâs your response to abolitionists, who believe that policingâs inherently racist, and you make communities safe by funding them?\n\nKeith Ellison: So long as human beings are as they are, there will be rapes, there will be robberies, there will be domestic violence, there will be drive-by shootings. Even if you got rid of any kind of economic and social injustice, explain to me, why did Bernie Madoff rip off a bunch of people? I mean, people do evil things to each other who donât have to. Theyâre not from poor families. Theyâre not racial minorities. And they do bad shit.\n\nYou might not need to bust into Bernie Madoffâs house with guns pointed at his head. But to the degree that human beings hurt each other, you need somebody whoâs going to stop it, and hold them accountable after they do it. Thatâs why I could never get my brain around abolition. When you talk to the abolitionists, theyâll say that theyâre really talking about how a high percentage of the crime that we see is socially caused. Okay. That doesnât mean we get rid of the police. That means we may not need as many as we have now. And thatâs an empirical question.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

Read it now .\n\nHaiti gang leader Jimmy âBarbecueâ ChÃ©rizier has warned of a âcivil war that will lead to a genocideâ if Prime Minister Ariel Henry does not step down, amid a wave of gang violence that has plunged the country into crisis.\n\nThe de facto prime minister is facing increasing pressure to expedite a transitional government after an explosion of violence that has displaced more than 15,000 in recent weeks.\n\nViolence flared when Henry left the country for Kenya to finalize a deal for a United Nations-backed police force to help combat the gangs. Gunmen stormed prisons, releasing 4,700 inmates, laid siege to key areas of the capital, Port-au-Prince, and shot at airplanes, leading international carriers to halt their flights.\n\nChÃ©rizier, a former elite police officer and one of Haitiâs most powerful gang leaders, has said his group is seeking to capture the police chief and government ministers , the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe United States on Wednesday urged Henry to âexpediteâ the violence-ravaged nationâs transition to a new governing structure and hold âfree and fairâ elections â but stopped short of calling for his resignation.\n\nThe 74-year-old former neurosurgeon has been the acting prime minister since the assassination of President Jovenel MÃ¶ise in 2021. Henry backtracked on a promise to step down in February, instead saying he would hold general elections in 2025 after stabilizing Haitiâs security situation.\n\nâThe situation is on the verge of a real collapse of any and every institution that remains in the country,â one Haiti scholar told NPR, after gangs formed an alliance to overthrow the government. More than 80% of the capital is currently controlled by gangs, according to the United Nations. Haiti is not unfamiliar with coups; throughout its recent history , gangs and armed groups have repeatedly played the role of political opposition.\n\nChÃ©rizierâs unification of a criminal federation of gangs known as The G9 Families and Allies has also been aided by high-caliber weapons smuggled in from the United States . âPresent-day gangs enjoy a much higher degree of military capacity than those a decade ago,â a report from the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime stated.\n\nWhile most people in the capital Port-au-Prince loathe the armed gangs that control the city, others support them âeven if they are terrified that they themselves or their families could be collateral damageâ because they âfeel the gangs are the only group capable of forcing Henry out,â an ABC News correspondent wrote. More than half of the former French colonyâs citizens live below the poverty line and have been buffeted by ongoing political instability and a series of natural disasters in recent years, including the devastating 2010 earthquake. âThe confluence of these forces has transformed what was once the wealthiest colony in the Americas into the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere,â the Council on Foreign Relations said.\n\nPart of the growing discontent in Haiti is that Henry has been solely focused on finding a military solution to gang violence, Monique Clesca, a Haitian activist, told NPR. Ordering a state of emergency at the beginning of his government would have allowed police to rein in the gangs, and plan for elections at the same time, she said. Instead, Henry requested troops from the United Nations â then crossed his arms ,â she said. Meanwhile, an agreement with Kenya to deploy a U.N.-backed multinational police force has been met with judicial hurdles and been slow to implement.\n\nSign up for Semafor flagship\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives."

      "text": "Phoenix police Officer Zane Coolidge dies from injuries after shooting\n\nPhoenix police Officer Zane Coolidge died Friday following injuries sustained in a shooting during the pursuit of a burglary suspect on Tuesday evening.\n\nDespite a courageous three-day fight for his life, Coolidge passed away surrounded by his family, Phoenix police interim Chief Michael Sullivan said.\n\n\"The injuries he sustained after the cowardly acts of another were just too much for him to overcome. Officer Coolidge's legacy will forever be a part of this Department,\" Sullivan wrote Friday afternoon in a news release.\n\nSullivan requested privacy for Coolidge's family, acknowledging the depth of their unimaginable grief.\n\n\"We will do everything we can to help them through their darkest hours, and we pledge that they will always be a part of the Phoenix Police Family,\" wrote Sullivan.\n\nSullivan described Coolidge not only as a dedicated member of the Phoenix Police Department but also as a husband, father, son, brother, and friend. Sullivan highlighted the deep value and dedication Coolidge brought to his role.\n\nCoolidge served as a five-year veteran of the Phoenix Police Department, assigned to the Mountain View Precinct.\n\nA police procession for Coolidge departed from Banner University at about 7:25 p.m. Friday, accompanied by dozens of police vehicles.\n\nOfficers were stationed at nearly every intersection along the route from the hospital to the Maricopa County Medical Examiner's Office at Washington Street and Eighth Avenue.\n\nA police helicopter hovered overhead as the procession reached the Medical Examiner's Office by 7:40 p.m., while a massive American flag waved from a fire ladder above Eighth Avenue.\n\nDozens of uniformed officers, along with K-9 units, gathered to salute and pay their respects as the procession passed by.\n\nAnthony Dewitt, 22, of Phoenix, stood at the corner of Eighth Avenue and Washington Street, holding a thin blue line flag in a show of support.\n\n\"This is a loss to the entire community and every citizen these officers protect,\" Dewitt said. \"I have a lot of family and friends who are in law enforcement.\"\n\nDewitt said he spent three and a half years as a high school cadet with the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, where he developed a deep appreciation for law enforcement.\n\n\"I think it's really important to be out here to support our officers,\" Dewitt said.\n\nWhen Dewitt heard the news of Coolidge's passing, he knew he wanted to be out on the street to show his support for Coolidge and the police.\n\n\"I pulled my flag down off the wall and put it on a flag pole and came out to support however I can,\" Dewitt said. \"It's not much, but it shows the community supports our police. I think in our society we have a lot of demonization of our law enforcement officers, and this is one of the effects of this.\"\n\nAbout 8:30 p.m., shortly after the procession, Barbra Heller stood outside the main gate of the Phoenix Police Department's Mountain View Precinct in north Phoenix, where Coolidge had been assigned, holding three handmade signs expressing her support for law enforcement.\n\n\"I've always felt the need to make sure when they're pulling out (of the Mountain View Precinct) that if it is their final hour, this is the last sign they see,\" Heller said as she pointed to her sign that read \"You are my heroes.\"\n\nHeller said Phoenix police stopped to let her know the procession was happening while she was outside the precinct.\n\n\"They stopped and just gave me a big hug,\" Heller said, stopping to give a thumbs-up to every employee entering or leaving the precinct. Some officers stopped to briefly thank Heller for what she was doing.\n\nHeller said she regularly worries about officers' safety and always reminds them to stay alert by telling them to keep their \"head on a swivel\" whenever she sees them at a stoplight.\n\nPhoenix Mayor Kate Gallego shared her condolences for the officer's family shortly after his death was announced.\n\n\"I am devastated by the tragic loss of Officer Zane Coolidge, who lost his life while keeping the rest of us safe from harm. I know that our entire community is mourning this loss, and on behalf of the City, I extend my deepest condolences to Officer Coolidge's family and friends, and his brothers and sisters in the Phoenix Police Department. We will forever honor and remember his bravery and selfless service to our community,\" wrote Gallego.\n\n\"Our police officers are the best of us. They put themselves in harm's way every day to protect us, and this loss is a stark reminder that serving in uniform comes with immense risk - and sometimes, the ultimate sacrifice. We are actively working to ensure justice is served and will continue to support our first responders and law enforcement who uphold the law,\" Gallego added.\n\nOfficer Matthew Haney was protected from serious injury by his ballistic vest. Haney, who has been with the department for two years and works in the same squad and precinct as Coolidge, was released from the hospital Wednesday and is recovering at home with his family, who have requested privacy.\n\nSaul Bal , 41, was arrested on suspicion of shooting the officers. The officers had been responding to reports of a car break-in in the area of 16th and Brill streets about 6:30 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nAccording to police, the officers were informed that Bal was the suspect attempting the break-in. When they approached him, Bal fled the scene.\n\nThe officers reported that Bal fired at Haney and Coolidge, injuring both, and they returned fire, as detailed in the police statement.\n\nBal initially escaped but was apprehended after a search lasting over three hours, which led to the closure of several city blocks, police stops and searches of vehicles in the area.\n\nBal was charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and prohibited possession of a weapon. He was being held on a $2 million cash-only bond.\n\nThe Republic's Kerria Weaver contributed to this article."

Multiple gunshots were fired and both officers were struck, the Gila River Police Department wrote in a Facebook post.\n\nBoth officers were taken to the hospital. Briese died from his injuries, while the other officer, who has not been identified, was in serious but stable condition, according to police.\n\nFour other people were struck by gunfire. The woman who died was identified as 23-year-old Alicen Apkaw, Stephen Roe Lewis, governor of the Gila River Indian Community, said. He did not provide details about her time of death. The three others who were shot were being treated at area hospitals.\n\nTwo suspects were taken into custody Sunday by the FBI's Phoenix Field Office and the Gila River Police Department. Officials identified them as a man and a teen boy but did not release their names. They said both individuals were receiving medical care for the injuries they received from the shooting.\n\n\"I know I speak for our entire Community when I say that we grieve for our fallen and injured police officers and every Community member touched by such tragic violence,\" Lewis said. \"Nothing cuts deeper than a life cut short. We will pray for our officers and their families, and for every Community member, every loved one, and every family impacted by what happened this morning.\"\n\nHere's what to know about the incident.\n\nBriese was the son of former Yellowstone County Sheriff's Officer David Briese, who also died in the line of duty .\n\nDavid Briese was killed in November 2006 in an automobile accident on Interstate 90 in Billings, Montana, while responding to a backup call for an officer who was dealing with a combative impaired driver, according to the Sheriff's Office.\n\nThe Yellowstone County Sheriff's Office released a statement regarding Joshua Briese's death:\n\n\"YCSO is heart broken and in disbelief upon receiving word this morning of the Line of Duty Death of Gila River Arizona Police Officer Josh Briese, Joshie as many of us called him,\" the statement said. \"All we can say is God Speed and rest easy. Knowing Dave & Josh are together again, both left this world serving their community and doing what they loved. RIP.\"\n\nMaricopa County Attorney Rachel Mitchell also released a statement: \"The fact that Joshua's father, David, also gave his life in the line of duty adds to the incalculable debt we owe to their family. I continue to pray for the recovery of the other injured officer.\"\n\nLuisa Gomez, a member of the Gila River Tribe, woke to sirens related to the shooting only blocks away from her home. Gomez said the civilians who were hurt and killed in the shooting were related to her and that it occurred at a teenager's birthday party.\n\n\"It's not that dangerous here ...\" Gomez said. \"Usually, it's very nice and quiet.\"\n\nRoberto Jackson, the communications director for Gila River Indian Community, declined to release further details on Saturday afternoon, including where the shooting occurred.\n\nAuthorities, however, closed both lanes of Moffett Road south of State Route 87 on Saturday. There was a heavy police presence nearby, including a mobile command center. About six law enforcement vehicles were seen near the closure as FBI investigators processed the scene at a residence about half a mile south of Moffett Road and SR 87.\n\nOn Saturday evening, Lewis called a special meeting with the Gila River Indian Community Council. Leaders approved a moratorium on all dances, effective immediately, according to documents posted to the community's Facebook page.\n\nAnyone hosting or attending a dance in the community could face arrest on disorderly misconduct and trespassing charges, according to the documents. Anyone hosting a dance is subject to losing their homesite and anyone playing music at a dance faces a $1,000 fine and risks their instruments being confiscated."

So I wanted to create a space, a campaign and initiative for women,\" said Kanavel.\n\nWhen Kanavel became Miss Arizona USA this year, she saw the opportunity for a bigger platform for her longstanding message of inspiration and self-empowerment.\n\n\"When I'm a police officer, I'm serving the community, I'm out helping others when they need us the most. But in my other job as Miss Arizona USA, even though I'm wearing a different uniform, I'm doing the same thing. I'm serving the community and I'm making a difference,\" said Kanavel.\n\nThe support of her fellow officers and city employees has been critical in her journey, even if the beauty pageant world may be a foreign concept for many.\n\nKanavel said that in accordance to Miss USA rules, this will be her last competition whether she wins the title or not, as she intends to hang up her heels and focus on mentoring young women entering the pageant world.\n\nIf Kanavel won Miss USA, she said it would be a win not only for her but for all women attempting to redefine societal norms.\n\nHowever, she said she was grateful just for the opportunity to fulfill those dreams that are so important to her morals.\n\n\"I'm just grateful for my specific journey, for the specific amount of time to get to this point for all of the individuals and the organizations and communities that helped get me here, it's not a one-woman show even though I'm the one who's walking the stage,\" she said.\n\nKanavel will participate in the national Miss USA Pageant on Friday, Sept. 29, at 5 p.m., Arizona time, which will be aired live on local channel CW6.\n\nYou can vote for Miss Arizona USA until Sept. 29 at 9 p.m. as part of the Miss USA people's choice for $2 per vote"

After a struggle Martin drove away with an officer in the back seat. The trapped officer shot screamed for Martin to let him out of the car before shooting him multiple times. Martin crashed the car into a house and was declared dead on the scene.\n\nMartin's mother, Terra Martin, said in a news conference earlier this year that she wanted the officers involved in the shooting to be charged with murder.\n\n\"I don't eat, I don't sleep and justice needs to be served,\" she said.\n\nUSA TODAY was reaching out to her attorney Friday for comment on the development.\n\nIn the weeks following the death of Martin, body camera footage of the shooting was released to the public.\n\nOfficers with the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C., responded to a report of a suspicious vehicle and found Martin asleep in the driver's seat of a car police said was reported stolen earlier that month. The engine was running and the ignition was damaged, police said.\n\nAdditional Metro officers and two Park Police officers arrived to help detain Martin, the department said. The group can be heard discussing how to remove Martin from the car in body camera footage.\n\nThe officers surround the car on both sides, enter the vehicle and attempt to restrain Martin, the footage shows. One officer falls to the ground on the driver's side as Martin drives away with a Park Police officer still in the back seat.\n\n\"Stop man, just let me out. Let me go!\" the officer yells while Martin keeps driving. \"Stop. Stop or I'll shoot!\"\n\nOne second later, the officer shoots Martin in the back multiple times and the car veers off of the road and into a nearby home. The same officer gets out of the car and does CPR on Martin but to no avail as he is then pronounced dead on the scene.\n\n\"After a careful, thorough, and independent review of the evidence, federal prosecutors have found insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the United State Park Police Officer is criminally liable for Mr. Martin's death,\" the U.S. Attorney's Office said in a statement. \"The U.S. Attorney's Office remains committed to investigating allegations of excessive force by law enforcement officers and will continue to devote the resources necessary to ensure that all allegations of serious civil rights violations are investigated fully and completely.\"\n\nMartin's family was outraged after watching the footage of the shooting, with his mother saying: \"He murdered my baby,\" family attorney Jade Mathis said in April.\n\nShe said the medical examiner told her that Martin, a father to a 7-month-old son, had been shot six times.\n\nUSA TODAY was reaching out to the U.S. Park Police for further comment.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office called the footage of the shooting \"extremely upsetting\" at the time.\n\nFernando Cervantes Jr. is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

Will that shock Arizona awake?\n\nEvery major crisis has a moment that jerks people awake, that knocks them from their slumber and forces them to focus.\n\nWe may have had such a moment with fentanyl in Arizona.\n\nA Mesa police officer overdosed on the drug in his patrol car and was found unconscious with his engine running and doors locked.\n\nThe car was in the middle of the street. Rescuers had to bust a window to save his life.\n\nIt was a story like this that grabbed a nation's attention in 2017.\n\nIn her groundbreaking report on the opioid crisis, The New Yorker's Margaret Talbot went to ground zero - rural West Virginia - to comprehend it.\n\nIn the first words of her highly touted essay \" The Addicts Next Door ,\" she described a Little League softball game that ended when a couple watching the game fell unconscious, suffering simultaneous drug overdoses.\n\nParamedics rushed to save the man and woman as the children they brought with them grew hysterical, screaming, \"Wake up! Wake up!\"\n\nWhat Talbot had described was a society ripping at the seams with all the telltale signs of despair and decline.\n\n\"At this stage of the American opioid epidemic, many addicts are collapsing in public - in gas stations, in restaurant bathrooms, in the aisles of big-box stores,\" she explained.\n\nThat was seven years ago.\n\nSince then, the opioid crisis has provoked enormous public scrutiny - congressional hearings and legal proceedings. Government regulators and prosecutors have cracked down on Big Pharma and the doctors who overwrote prescriptions.\n\nBut the crisis isn't over. And it's roaring in Arizona.\n\nSince 1999, more than a million Americans have died from overdose deaths , according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nWhat was a prescription opioid crisis in 2017 is now a \"synthetic\" opioid crisis dominated by the deadly street drug fentanyl.\n\nToday nearly 88% of opioid-involved overdose deaths are caused by synthetic opioids, the CDC reports.\n\n\"It is the deadliest drug threat our country has ever faced,\" DEA Administrator Anne Milgram told a U.S. Senate hearing in February.\n\nWest Virginia continues to lead the nation in overdose mortality, with 91 deaths per 100,000 population, according to CDC rankings. (Arizona is 17 th with 39 deaths per 100,000.)\n\nBut Arizona has become its own kind of ground zero given its proximity to Mexico, where most U.S. fentanyl is cooked.\n\nBoth News Nation and Fox News report that Arizona is the hub of fentanyl smuggling in the United States, with more than 51% of the drug passing through our state.\n\nWith numbers like that, it is no surprise that Arizona would see absurd examples of social breakdown that shook West Virginia and the nation.\n\nOn Friday we learned a bystander found Mesa Police Officer Christopher Jenkins unconscious in his patrol car and apparently suffering a seizure.\n\nJenkins' car was in the middle of the street, as reported by The Arizona Republic's Ellie Willard. His doors were locked and his foot was on the brake with the engine idling.\n\nJenkins' fellow officers arrived and had to bust through the window to get to him. They administered CPR and Narcan, an opioid overdose antidote, until they were finally able to bring him back to consciousness, Willard reported.\n\nAt first, Mesa Police feared Jenkins had been exposed to fentanyl confiscated in a bust that same day. Jenkins had placed some of the fentanyl from the arrest into evidence but still had powdered fentanyl in the passenger compartment in his car, Willard reported.\n\nEventually, hospital tests revealed Jenkins had not only fentanyl, but cocaine and marijuana in his system. Soon he was under investigation.\n\nAll of this happened in May.\n\nNot long after, Jenkins was charged with two felonies and two misdemeanors and made his first court appearance.\n\nMesa P.D. reassigned him on May 25, and he formally resigned from the police force on June 1.\n\n\"Officer Jenkins' actions are shocking and in direct conflict with the morals, ethics and integrity expected from members of the Mesa Police Department,\" wrote Mesa Police Cmdr. Anthony Abalos.\n\nJenkins is a symbol of an opioid epidemic that is threatening the lives of thousands in this state and killing nearly five Arizonans every day, according to data from the Arizona Department of Health Services.\n\nAlready this year, some 850 Arizonans have lost their lives to opioid addiction, DHS reports.\n\nNew Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes has made fentanyl a priority.\n\n\"We need to throw everything we can at this crisis - new technology at the border, enhanced and strengthened partnerships, and access to more funding,\" she said. \"I stand ready to work with anyone committed to solving this.\"\n\nIn July, U.S. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema held a tele-town hall with 5,000 people, in which she discussed the fentanyl epidemic and explained two bipartisan bills she has introduced to try to stop the flow of fentanyl into Arizona.\n\nOver the past two decades calamities have come and gone. The Great Recession is in our past. COVID-19 is a shadow. But the opioid crisis grinds on.\n\nNow an epidemic largely centered on fentanyl, it is \"the deadliest threat facing our country today,\" added DEA's Milgram.\n\nAnd even police officers can't escape its snare.\n\nPhil Boas is an editorial columnist.

Shields, a father who had served as a Hinds County deputy for less than a year, was fatally shot a day earlier while responding to a domestic violence call .\n\nIn southern Pennsylvania, officer Andrew Duarte, 30 , was killed in a mass shooting at a hospital Saturday , officials said. The gunman held a hospital worker hostage and shot multiple people, including a doctor, a nurse and a custodian. The shooter was killed in a gunfight with police, which left Duarte with fatal injuries and injured two other officers.\n\nIn Virginia Beach, Cameron Girvin, 25, and Christopher Reese, 30, were fatally shot during a traffic stop Friday night. Police say the gunman - who was later found dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound - opened fire during a struggle. Girvin, who was expecting a child this summer, and Reese, who had worked at the department for three years, were remembered for their generosity and public service.\n\nEach of these incidents underscore the daily threats faced by law enforcement and comes after a particularly deadly year for officers.\n\nThe number of U.S. law enforcement professionals who died in the line of duty last year increased 25% from 118 in 2023 to 147 in 2024, according to preliminary data from the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund .\n\nThe leading cause of the deaths was gunfire, responsible for 54 of the fatalities. Forty-six deaths involved vehicles, including 29 fatal traffic crashes, the nonprofit said. The FBI has also tracked an uptick in the number of law enforcement professionals killed in the line of duty.\n\nThe memorial fund vets each death and adds the names of the fallen officers to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington. D.C. CEO Bill Alexander, who is in constant contact with police agencies across the country, said multiple deadly shootings in such short succession is \"concerning.\"\n\n\"Every single one of these deaths is incredibly worrisome for leaders of law enforcement agencies, and the men and women out there doing the job,\" he said. Alexander noted that on any given year, hundreds of law enforcement personnel are shot but manage to survive. \"This is very hard and oftentimes very dangerous work.\"\n\nOn Sunday night in Hinds County, which encompasses part of Jackson, Mississippi, deputies responded to a domestic disturbance call. When Shields arrived at the scene, the suspect, 42-year-old Eric Brown, shot him, officials said. Brown is suspected of shooting his wife and another women, who were reported to be in stable condition.\n\nShields has been remembered as a kind, hard-working deputy in the days since his death. Shields had been employed with the Hinds County Sheriff's Office for approximately nine months. Before that, he worked with the Jackson Police Department .\n\nHe left behind a behind a wife and 12-year-old daughter.\n\nHinds County Sheriff Tyree Jones wrote on social media of the difficulty of informing Shields' family of his death. He said the two men had both responded to an incident involving a capsized boat hours before the fatal shooting.\n\n\"Deputy Shields died a hero. He died while responding to a call for service to assist someone in need. He fulfilled his assignment and his God-given mission on earth,\" Jones said. \"Pray for his family, his friends, the many lives he touched, and the men and women of the HCSO as we all prepare for a final salute. There's absolutely no way I could ever imagine or prepare to tell a family their deputy will not be coming home from their tour of duty. However, tragically, I found myself in that situation late this evening.\"\n\nJackson Police Chief Joseph Wade, called Shields \"a good man, a good person and a good police officer.\"\n\n\"My prayers, thoughts and condolences go out to his family, because I know they're hurting this morning. You had a person that was simply doing their job, and they lost their life,\" Wade said during a news conference this week.\n\nOn Saturday morning, authorities say Diogenes Archangel-Ortiz walked into UPMC Memorial Hospital in York, a city about 25 miles southeast of the Pennsylvania capital, Harrisburg, and took the staff of the ICU hostage, firing several shots and binding the hands of a nurse with zip ties.\n\nHe shot a doctor, a nurse and a custodian, said York County District Attorney Tim Barker. Archangel-Ortiz and police responding to the scene then exchanged fire. Archangel-Ortiz and Duarte were killed in the gunfight and two other officers were injured.\n\nDuarte had worked for the West York Borough Police Department since June 2022 and was a former patrol officer with the Denver Police Department, where he served for five years. He earned commendations for academic achievement when he completed drug recognition expert training, according to the Denver Police Department.\n\nDuarte received a bachelor's degree in criminal justice and political science from Pennsylvania Western University.\n\nOutside of work, he enjoyed \"photography, playing his guitar, hiking, traveling and most importantly spending time with his family,\" according to his obituary . Residents placed flowers and lit candles at the department's administrative offices before gathering for a vigil to remember Duarte. A public service will be held Friday to honor his service before a planned private burial.\n\n\"Officer Duarte was one of the best of us,\" Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro at a news conference. \"He is to be commended for a life of service, albeit one cut too short.\"\n\nOn Friday night, Girvin and Reese attempted to pull over the driver of a Hyundai Sonata with expired plates. The driver ignored them until he came to a dead end, according to officials.\n\nVirginia Beach Police Chief Paul Neudigate said the driver got out of the car and tussled with the two officers. During the struggle, the driver pulled out a pistol and shot both officers. \"He shot them a second\" time while the officers were defenseless on the ground, Neudigate said.\n\nHe \"executed our officers,\" Neudigate said.\n\nThe driver, identified as 42-year-old John McCoy III, was later found dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound at a Virginia Beach apartment complex.\n\nSurrounded by family and friends at two nearby hospitals, the officers were pronounced dead early Saturday morning.\n\n\"I'm gonna be quite honest, we're all hurting,\" Neudigate said. \"We've got an officer that is 25 years old, another one that is 30, with such a future ahead of them, senselessly taken.\"\n\nGirvin had served as a Virginia Beach police officer since 2020, the department said. \"Within that time frame, he touched the lives of so many. His smile was infectious and he brightened every room he was in,\" read a GoFundMe set up to assist his family.\n\nHe was married to his high school sweetheart, Jessica, and the couple was expecting a daughter - to be named Paisley - due this summer, according to the fundraiser.\n\nReese joined the Virginia Beach Police Department in 2022 after serving with the Virginia Beach Sheriff's Office. In 2017, he graduated with a businesses degree from Virginia Wesleyan University in Virginia Beach.\n\nLaw enforcement was a family occupation. His father, George Reese IV, served in the Camden City police department, according to a Facebook post from Gloucester Township's police department.\n\n\"Chris was also a loyal friend and devoted husband,\" read an online fundraiser for his family. \"Chris unfortunately lost his life in a senseless tragedy.\"\n\nContributing: John Bacon, Natalie Neysa Alund and Jeanine Stantucci, USA TODAY; Pam Dankins, Mississippi Clarion Ledger; Jim Walsh, Cherry Hill Courier-Post; Victoria E.

      "text": "Did prosecutors withhold evidence in case of ex-Columbus police officer convicted of murder?\n\nThis story has been updated to add clarifying information.\n\nAttorneys for a former Columbus police officer convicted of murder have asked a Franklin County Common Pleas judge to allow them to look at emails sent between prosecutors to determine if those prosecutors withheld information about an expert witness who didn't testify at trial.\n\nFormer officer Adam Coy's defense made arguments Monday morning before Judge Stephen McIntosh that emails and other communications between prosecutors in Coy's case are not protected by attorney-client privilege.\n\nCoy was convicted in November of murder, felonious assault and reckless homicide in the Dec. 22, 2020, shooting death of 47-year-old Andre Hill , an unarmed Black man. The attorneys said in a motion filed after Coy's conviction that prosecutors didn't disclose its contact with a use-of-force expert who would have determined the shooting was justified given the circumstances.\n\nMcIntosh said he would issue a written ruling on the defense request at a later time.\n\nThe content of those emails, and other evidence that will be heard at a hearing in April, could result in Coy getting a new trial.\n\nCoy is the first law enforcement officer in Franklin County to be convicted in a shooting that occurred while the officer was on duty. He has been held in the Franklin County jail since his conviction but has not yet been sentenced. The only sentence Coy can receive under Ohio law is life in prison without the possibility of parole for 15 years.\n\nFollowing the jury's verdict, however, Coy's defense attorneys, Mark Collins and Kaitlyn Stephens, filed court documents accusing the prosecutors of failing to disclose evidence . Coy's attorneys said former Deputy Chief Counsel Anthony Pierson had consulted with a use-of-force expert who had said Coy's shooting of Hill was justified under the circumstances. Pierson decided against using the expert but did not tell the defense team he had spoken with the expert, defense attorneys say.\n\nPierson, who left the Franklin County Prosecutor's office in December , denied any wrongdoing in a response.\n\nOn Monday, McIntosh heard arguments about whether subpoenas for records filed by Coy's attorneys should be allowed. Prosecutors have argued the records, which relate to communications between Pierson, other prosecutors and the expert, Jamie Borden, are work products and barred by attorney-client privilege and should not be given to Coy's attorneys.\n\nCollins and Stephens have argued that had they known about the expert, they would have called him as a defense witness to challenge the prosecution's case.\n\nThe shooting occurred shortly before 2 a.m. on Dec. 22, 2020. Coy had responded to Oberlin Drive, on the city's Northwest Side, after a neighbor called the Columbus police nonemergency line to report a silver SUV that had been running on and off for about three hours.\n\nWhen Coy arrived, he spoke to the driver of the SUV, who is now known to be Hill. Testimony from Coy's trial showed Hill had shown Coy a cellphone and told Coy he was waiting on someone. Coy testified he saw Hill walk up to the door of a home that neighbored the one he was parked in front of and knock on the door with no response from anyone inside.\n\nHill, according to Coy's testimony, then walked back to the SUV, rummaged around inside and then walked back to knock on the front door again. As in the first instance, there was no response from anyone inside the home or changes, like lights turning on.\n\nAnother Columbus officer arrived on the scene and Coy testified he told her the situation seemed off, at which point they began walking up the driveway toward the home, which had an open garage door. Trial evidence, including Coy's body camera video, showed Hill had gone inside the open garage, which had no lights on, and Coy gave verbal commands for Hill to come outside and show himself.\n\nHill began to walk out of the garage with a lit cellphone in his left hand. Coy yelled, \"Gun, gun, he has a gun,\" before drawing his firearm and shooting Hill four times. Coy testified he saw silver metal in Hill's right hand, which was later determined to be Hill's key ring and not a weapon.\n\nbbruner@gannett.com"

      "text": "Montini: Hero Phoenix police officer protected me and died for us all\n\nPhoenix Police Officer Leonard Kolodziej would have died for me , if that had been asked of him.\n\nInstead, he died for someone else.\n\nFor us all.\n\nIt began when my boss at The Arizona Republic contacted the police. An anonymous caller who'd been trolling me for weeks left a message on my voicemail saying: \"Hey, Montini, you should tell your little girl not to leave her purple and green bicycle in your front yard ... someone might steal it.\"\n\nIt happens, although most of the creeps who leave messages or send emails or write letters aren't so persistent. In one of the man's messages he described the car I drove. In another he said I should consider altering my route home so I would be less easy to follow.\n\nThis was in 1991.\n\nAfter he described my daughter's bicycle the authorities were called.\n\nThe police decided to increase patrols through my neighborhood.\n\nI had to tell my neighbors why they might notice slow-moving police cruisers passing by several times a day. The reactions varied. It was a little scary to some. A little creepy for others. It was also, for some, a little cool, a little exciting, as if there is an element of danger to a job in which much of one's time is spent sitting in an office, typing.\n\nI let them believe it. I let myself believe it - a little.\n\nDuring one of the patrols through my neighborhood the officer passing by my family's house noticed something unusual.\n\nIt might have been the way our car was parked in the driveway. Was the trunk open? What about the door to the house? Was it ajar? Something seemed off.\n\nFrom inside the house my wife, Anne, noticed the patrol car slow down then stop in front of our driveway.\n\nHad the officer seen something?\n\nWas there a problem?\n\nJust as the officer was about to get out of the vehicle Anne came out of the house.\n\nThey startled one another.\n\n\"Everything OK out there?\" he asked.\n\n\"I think so,\" she said. \"Is everything OK in there?\"\n\nThey laughed.\n\nThe officer made sure everything actually was OK then continued on his way.\n\nOver the next days and weeks the crank caller lost interest in me and the police went about more important business.\n\nSome months later, I was in the newsroom of The Republic when reports came in of a shooting with fatalities in Phoenix.\n\nThere had been gunfire coming from a house south of 20th Street and Camelback. The shooter turned out to be a mentally disturbed, distraught man named Barry Kaiser.\n\nOfficer Kolodziej (pronounced ko-lodge-ee) was dispatched to check things out. He didn't hesitate.\n\nKolodziej was a 19-year veteran of the force, within a year of retirement. He was 43 years old and the married father of three children. Most mornings he visited his ailing father, who'd suffered a stroke, to give him a shave and make sure he was OK.\n\nKolodziej had no idea what awaited him at the scene, only that there were reports of gunfire and he would check it out. As he was getting out of his vehicle Kaiser opened fire, striking the officer three times.\n\nKolodziej managed to turn on his lights and siren, warning other officers, and hit the emergency button in his vehicle, sending an \"officer down\" signal.\n\nHe would not survive .\n\nI drove to the shooting scene and stood with onlookers behind crime-scene tape, watching a police helicopter dip and rise above the house where the shooter was barricaded. In addition to Kolodziej, Kaiser shot and killed a passing bicyclist and wounded six others. Then he took his own life.\n\nA week or so later, more than 800 people showed up at Kolodziej's funeral. Officer Russ Eeiker said, \"We must remember, each of us are better persons because Leonard touched our lives.\"\n\nKolodziej's photograph had been all over the newspapers and on TV. My wife recognized him as the officer who'd stopped at our house months earlier, thinking there might be trouble.\n\nThere was no trouble that day.\n\nBut Kolodziej continued to answer those calls, as his brothers and sisters on the police force do each day, until he pulled up to that house on 20th Street.\n\nSept. 4 is the 26th anniversary of Kolodziej's last call.\n\nAt the end of his memorial service in 1991 I stood on the sidewalk outside St. Thomas the Apostle Catholic Church and watched the long, slow funeral procession of motorcycles and cars and cars and cars and cars.\n\nIf I ever believed - even a little - that there was an element of danger to a job in which the majority of one's time is spent sitting in an office, typing, it ended that day.\n\nMORE FROM MONTINI:\n\nPhoenix council protesters were loud, obnoxious - and good citizens\n\nWill Trump hold dreamers hostage to get his border wall?\n\nSorry, but masks are for cowards - not protesters"

Please check back regularly for updates.\n\nThe service for Andrew Duarte has ended.\n\nThe hearse and other vehicles left the church shortly before 3 p.m.\n\nDuarte will be laid to rest at Susquehanna Memorial Gardens.\n\nWest York Police Chief Matthew Millsaps said Officer Andrew Duarte made the department proud every shift.\n\nHe detailed the final moments for the young officer. Duarte was the second or third officer to arrive at the hospital for the active shooter. Law enforcement assembled and was informed that it was a hostage situation, and they were making a plan for a rescue.\n\n\"A threat emerged with a hostage in one hand and a firearm in another,\" he said. \"An engagement ensued.\"\n\n\"War is a game of angles, inches and seconds,\" Millsaps said. \"The hostage was rescued; the threat was eliminated; but sometimes those inches don't play out in our favor.\"\n\nDuarte was shot and he knew it, Millsaps said. He made it to cover but saw another officer was in a compromised position.\n\n\"Andrew's last physical act on the face of this earth was to run back towards the threat area and help drag the downed officer to safety while holding his hand,\" he said. \"When they made it to cover, Andrew collapsed and died.\"\n\nHe ran toward danger and was part of a team that save the life of a hostage and others, the chief said.\n\n\"As he was dying, he held the hand of a brother officer, who he had helped drag to cover,\" he said. \"He put the mission first and he gave a damn.\"\n\nThe York County Commissioners issued a proclamation today to honor the fallen officer for his heroic action that saved lives, according to a news release.\n\nThe proclamation states in part:\n\n\"West York Borough and the entire York County community join together to mourn the tragic loss of our hero, Patrolman Andrew W. Duarte, and we extend our deepest condolences to his family, friends, and fellow officers. Now, therefore, we the commissioners of York County, Pennsylvania, honor the memory of Patrolman Andrew W.Duarte and express our profound gratitude for his service and sacrifice.\n\n\"May his legacy of honor, integrity and selfless service in the name of justice and peace serveas a reminder to our community of the highest ideals and the strength of character exemplifiedby those who serve in law enforcement and public safety.\"\n\nAt the memorial service, the commissioners presented Duarte's family with an American flag that was flown at half-staff at the York County Administrative Center in the officer's honor, the release states.\n\nIn addition to law enforcement, many elected officials attended Duarte's funeral service on Friday.\n\nIn addition to Gov. Josh Shapiro, here is a list of who attended:\n\nLt. Alan Ma of the Denver Police Department spoke about Duarte's work, especially in enforcement of driving under the influence. He also recalled how they spent time together during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"It is very difficult, profoundly difficult for all of us because we're witnessing our little brother depart for the heaven's gate,\" he said.\n\nLt. Dennis Eade of the Ocean City, Md. Police Department, said his agency is the first step for many law enforcement officers. Duarte worked a seasonal job there.\n\nEade said they follow the officers as they advance in their careers wherever they go. When an officer dies, they have lost a family member.\n\nHe thanked Duarte's family for sharing him with the department even for a brief time.\n\n\"God speed Andrew,\" he said.\n\nGov. Josh Shapiro spoke about how Duarte was a good man and police officer.\n\nWhen a gunman entered the UPMC Memorial Hospital took ICU staff hostage, Duarte bravely answered the call and ran toward danger to protect others.\n\nThe governor said the public owes a debt of gratitude to law enforcement who put their lives on the line. \"... to Drew, we owe you a debt that we can never repay,\" he said.\n\nOfficer Duarte's impact will be long lasting.\n\n\"Officer Duarte was the very best of us, and we salute him,\" he said.\n\nAlex Brady, Officer Andrew Duarte's cousin, spoke first to honor his life. He shared about their childhood adventures.\n\nHis selflessness impacted everyone he knew, Brady said.\n\n\"In the end, Andrew's legacy is one of love, sacrifice and unyielding commitment to others,\" he said.\n\nBrady asked the mourners to carry on Duarte's legacy, which is unwavering dedication, boundless curiousity and his committment to service.\n\nA memorial service for West York Police Officer Andrew Duarte has begun at Living Word Community Church in York Township.\n\nHis fellow officers saluted his flag-draped casket.\n\nAndrew Duarte's parents, Nancy Duarte Matarese and Gary Duarte, are sitting up front.\n\nThe Rev.

Two of the officers were also required to complete additional de-escalation training, police said in a March 25 news release.\n\nThe attack on McAlpin drew public outcry and criticism from local leaders after footage of the encounter was released. Sullivan said the department took those concerns seriously and the suspensions reflected its commitment to \"accountability and maintaining public trust.\"\n\n\"At the same time, we stand by the men and women of this department who are placed in difficult situations every day,\" he said. \"We will continue to support our officers with training and guidance to ensure they can perform their duties safely and effectively. Our goal is to learn from this and move forward together as a stronger department and community.\"\n\nPolice declined to name the officers who were suspended, saying the information would be available once an administrative investigation was complete. In October, police said officers Benjamin Harris and Kyle Sue were placed on administrative leave while the department investigated their involvement in McAlpin's arrest. A federal lawsuit filed by lawyers for McAlpin in March also accused officer Jorge Acosta of wrongdoing.\n\nOn Aug. 19, 2024, officers Harris and Sue responded to a trespassing call at a Circle K near Indian School Road and 12th Street. The white man they were asked to remove from the store told them he was attacked and directed them to McAlpin, who was across the street.\n\nAccording to police body camera footage, Harris told McAlpin to stop. Within seconds, Harris grabbed McAlpin and the two struggled. Harris used a stun gun on him four times, then both officers collectively punched McAlpin over a dozen times, according to video recordings.\n\nAfter the beating, Acosta tried justifying the officers' actions by falsely saying in a report that the white man told police McAlpin had assaulted him and stolen his phone, according to the federal lawsuit.\n\nThe encounter left McAlpin jailed for three weeks. He faced aggravated assault and resisting arrest charges that Maricopa County Attorney Rachel Mitchell eventually dropped .\n\nThe attack on McAlpin occurred two months after the U.S. Department of Justice released a report concluding that the Phoenix Police Department had widespread problems, including routinely using excessive force .\n\nSullivan was tapped to lead Phoenix police on an interim basis in September 2022 and is a finalist to be the department's chief. Phoenix police union members have said in recent surveys they were overwhelmingly opposed to Sullivan staying on as the police chief because he was leading the department in the wrong direction and wasn't supportive in trying times.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Arizona Republic: Phoenix officers get 3-day suspensions over arrest of Tyron McAlpin"

Officer Adkins immediately began CPR while he instructed the woman's husband how to open the AED. Officer Adkins placed the AED pads on the patient and a \"shock\" was delivered. Officer Adkins then continued CPR as instructed by the AED until another shock was delivered. Personnel from the Mount Vernon Fire Department and Posey County EMS arrived and took over patient care and continued life-saving measures.\n\nNew vehicle delivered to Posey County schools SRO\n\nOfficers say if not for Officer Adkins' quick and effective response, the patient may not have survived given the condition she was in upon Officer Adkins' arrival. Chief Rutledge has received calls from other first responders commending Officer Adkins for his actions on that evening and expressing how critical his early arrival and AED deployment was for the patient.\n\nA spokesperson said, \"We would like to extend our appreciation to the Posey County Health Department. At the beginning of March, they graciously purchased new AED pads for all MVPD officers to replace pads that were expiring. This allowed MVPD officers to continue carrying AEDs in their patrol vehicles. We are grateful for their continued partnership!\"\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

(WFRV) - The Neenah Police Department announced in a release that one of their officers has been terminated from the force after he was charged with two counts of child pornography possession.\n\nAccording to the release, Officer Owen Halls had been employed by the department since March 25, 2024. On Monday, Neenah Police Chief Aaron L. Olson was alerted to an Internet Crimes Against Children tip with the suspect identified as Neenah Police Officer Owen Halls.\n\n'Stole from every taxpayer in the country': Wisconsin man ordered to pay $2.2 million in restitution to Medicaid/Medicare, 21 months in prison\n\nThe Kaukauna Police Department met with Chief Olson regarding the report, and evidence was handed off, with plans to detain Halls on Wednesday. Multiple search warrants were executed by the Kaukauna Police Department, leading to the following charge:\n\nPossession of child pornography (2 counts)\n\nThe Kaukauna Police Department later confirmed the tip was linked to an address in their jurisdiction, and their investigation led to multiple search warrants and subpoenas that determined Owen Halls was a suspect.\n\n\"Mr. Halls' alleged conduct has disgraced our department, our citizens and law enforcement as a whole,\" Chief Olson said in a release. \"He has been terminated from our department.\"\n\nHalls graduated from the law enforcement academy at Fox Valley Technical College on August 2, 2024, and started field training soon after.\n\nRegarding probation, Chief Olson added the following details in a follow-up to the original release:\n\n\"Many agencies have a one year probation period. Our probation period doesn't end until one year after they complete field training, so he would have been on probation until November 26, 2025.\"\n\nNeenah Police Chief Aaron L. Olson\n\nFormer Green Bay Packer charged for dog fighting in \"largest seizure of dogs from one person\"\n\nThe release added that they are following a procedure to decertify him as a Wisconsin Law Enforcement Officer. Chief Olson added the following statement:\n\n\"As your police chief, I am sorry. We conduct very thorough backgrounds, but somehow, Mr. Halls was able to deceive all of us. I understand this will and should cause concern. In my seven years as your police chief, nothing has disappointed me more than the reported actions of this former officer.\"\n\nNeenah Police Chief Aaron L. Olson\n\nNo additional details are available at this time. The investigation is ongoing.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

Her body-worn camera was not recording during the shooting because she was off duty. She appealed the conviction but lost her appeal two years ago. She became eligible for parole on Sept. 29 of this year.\n\nThe civil lawsuit against her accuses the former police officer of using excessive force in Jean's death.\n\nAttorneys for the Jean family, which includes civil rights attorney Ben Crump, released the following statement after the verdict:\n\n\"This verdict stands as a powerful testament to Botham's life and the profound injustice of his death. On September 6, 2018, Botham was doing nothing more than sitting in his own home, eating ice cream, when Amber Guyger -- an off-duty officer -- wrongly entered his apartment and fatally shot him. This case laid bare critical issues of racial bias and police accountability that cannot be ignored. Today's verdict sends a clear message that law enforcement officers who commit crimes cannot be insulated from the consequences of their actions.\"\n\nAttorneys for the Jean family say they most likely will not ever see any of the $98.6 million verdict and they insist they wanted to make sure that Guyger could never profit financially from having killed Botham Jean. They said they are exploring legal options to hold the city accountable and urging people in Dallas to demand change and more from city leaders.\n\nGuyger chose not to attend the trial in Dallas.\n\nRebecca Yarros on her rise to fame, \"Fourth Wing\" success and her new book\n\nPaul Simon's inside look at the Stanford Initiative to Cure Hearing Loss\n\nAmerican Airlines' new system cracks down on passengers trying to board plane early"

He had telegraphed his intent to issue Jan. 6 pardons, but the immediate and near-total reprieve - just 14 defendants had serious sentences commuted rather than pardoned - surprised many Americans.\n\nIn the wake of President Trump's pardons for the Jan. 6 rioters, police question the long-term effect on police and public safety.\n\n\"Many officers are disappointed,'' says Mr. Palmer, executive director of the Wisconsin Professional Police Association.\n\nThe National Association of Police Organizations - of which the WPPA is a member - firmly opposed the pardons Tuesday. Likewise, the Fraternal Order of Police and the International Association of Chiefs of Police jointly voiced concerns that when those who commit crimes - particularly violent acts that target police - don't face consequences, \"it sends a dangerous message that could embolden others.\"\n\nThe unions also criticized former President Joe Biden, who, before leaving office this month, commuted the sentence of someone convicted of killing law enforcement officers. However, their joint statement followed President Trump's Inauguration Day action.\n\nGiven this pushback, President Trump's pardons, particularly for those convicted of attacking police, could be a political miscalculation.\n\nFor many Americans - most of whom oppose pardons for Jan. 6 rioters - it corrodes the notion that violence against officers is an attack on America's tradition of, and appreciation for, law and order.\n\n\"When police officers are killed or injured, it's almost comparable to a political assassination,\" says Michael Scott, a former Madison, Wisconsin, police officer and now a criminologist at Arizona State University in Tempe. \"There's a risk that some people will interpret this action as the president saying, 'You are soldiers in our revolution.'\"\n\nMany who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 were acting based on President Trump's false claims of winning the 2020 election and were aiming to prevent the certification of Mr. Biden's victory that was scheduled to occur that day.\n\nThe concerns about President Trump's pardons aren't merely about abstract principles. People who attacked officers physically on Jan. 6, and against whom officers testified in court, are being freed. Those individuals have heard President Trump call them \"patriots\" and \"political prisoners.\"\n\nEnrique Tarrio, the former Proud Boys leader convicted of seditious conspiracy for his role in organizing the Capitol riot, has called for retribution against those who investigated and prosecuted the Jan. 6 defendants.\n\n\"The people who did this, they need to feel the heat,\" Mr. Tarrio said on a podcast after his release this week. \"We need to find and put them behind bars for what they did.\"\n\nAt least one former D.C. law enforcement officer has said he sought a protective order this week, unsuccessfully, against those who assaulted him on Jan. 6.\n\nMany beat cops have enjoyed Mr. Trump's pro-police banter over the past decade, especially after controversial incidents including the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer prompted protests demanding police reform across the nation. Police unions' early endorsement of Mr. Trump likely played a part in his 2016 victory.\n\nBut the unions' pushback this week against the president's new pardons is no surprise, experts say.\n\n\"If their support is truly rooted in [the belief] that Trump is committed to a more aggressive understanding of the criminal justice system, well, this isn't that,\" says Benjamin Levin, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis School of Law.\n\nThe pardons for those who attacked the U.S. Capitol included those who didn't commit violence as well as those who carried firearms, Tasers, and knives into the melee, according to the U.S. attorney's office.\n\nJuries also convicted some on charges of seditious conspiracy, which refers to activities that undermine a state without directly attacking it.\n\nMr. Trump defended the pardons to reporters this week at the White House.\n\n\"They've served years in jail,\" Mr. Trump said, according to press accounts. \"They should not have served,\" he said, adding, \"We pardoned people that were treated unbelievably poorly.\"\n\nPeople convicted of hurting or killing police officers routinely face the toughest of sentences compared with other crime convictions.\n\nIn opposing the Jan. 6 punishments, Trump supporters often suggest that there was a failure to hold social justice rioters on the political left to account. But during the 2020 protests, some of which were accompanied by rioting, police arrested at least 11,000 people , according to a tally by BuzzFeed.\n\nMr. Trump also defended his move by citing Mr. Biden's slew of pardons, including those for House Jan. 6 committee members and his own relatives.\n\nEven as the avalanche of presidential pardons may set a worrisome precedent, Professor Levin says there is also room for meaningful reforms in the U.S. criminal justice system - including raising awareness among reform skeptics about how abstract notions of crime and punishment play out in the real world.\n\n\"Part of what makes the reaction to Jan. 6 interesting is the degree to which Trump and his supporters are more willing to look at the context of punishment,\" he says.\n\nAt the same time, one of the Jan. 6 defendants has objected to Mr. Trump's action. Pamela Hemphill rejected her presidential pardon, telling her local newspaper, the Idaho Statesman, that accepting the pardon \" would be an insult to the Capitol Police officers, to the rule of law, to our nation.''\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nHer sense of affront was mirrored in the reaction from police unions this week.\n\n\"There is a genuine and very deep-seated concern in American law enforcement that much of what they have sworn allegiance to, for a long time, is in jeopardy,\" says Professor Scott, who also served as chief of police in Lauderhill, Florida. \"Police ... give meaning to the Constitution. That [meaning] is essentially being renegotiated. That's profound stuff.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

He is the first of the five officers charged to admit guilt. Prosecutors recommended a 15-year sentence.\n\nLoading...\n\nNov. 03, 2023, 10:06 a.m. ET | Memphis, Tenn.\n\nA former Memphis police officer pleaded guilty Nov. 2 in the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols in exchange for prosecutors recommending a 15-year sentence, becoming the first of five officers charged in the case to admit guilt.\n\nDesmond Mills Jr. entered his plea during a hearing at the Memphis federal courthouse as part of a larger agreement under which he will also plead guilty to related charges in state court. It wasn't immediately clear if any of the other officers would follow suit. Attorneys for three of the officers declined to comment and William Massey, the lawyer for Emmitt Martin, said in a text message that they \"will stay the course\" with the former officer's criminal defense.\n\nMr. Mills pleaded guilty to federal charges of excessive force and obstruction of justice and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. The final sentencing decision rests with the judge. Mr. Mills remains free on bail ahead of his May 22 sentencing hearing.\n\nMr. Nichols' mother, RowVaughn Wells, shook as she described hearing how five large men beat her skinny son.\n\n\"This one today was very difficult for me because this was really the first time I actually heard somebody tell and say what they actually did to my son,\" she told reporters outside the courthouse. \"So, this was very difficult. But I'm hoping that Mr. Mills, it was his conscience that allowed him to make this plea agreement, and not because of his lawyers telling him it was the right thing to do.\"\n\nCaught on police video, the beating of Mr. Nichols in January was one in a string of violent encounters between police and Black people that sparked protests and renewed debate about police brutality and the need for police reform in the United States. The five former officers who were charged also are Black.\n\nMr. Mills and four other former Memphis Police Department officers were charged in federal court with using excessive force, failing to intervene, deliberate indifference, and conspiring to lie, as well as obstruction of justice after they were caught on camera punching, kicking, and beating Mr. Nichols on Jan. 7. He died three days later.\n\nThe five - Mr. Mills, Mr. Martin, Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, and Justin Smith - pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder and other charges in state court. Mr. Mills is the first to agree to plead guilty.\n\nMr. Nichols' mother and her husband said the possibility of 15 years in prison is \"a start.\" Mr. Nichols' stepfather, Rodney Wells, noted that Mr. Mills has a family, with three children 6 years old and younger.\n\n\"Fifteen years is a long time with no parole,\" Mr. Wells said at the news conference. \"That's going to affect his family, that's going to affect him.\"\n\nBlake Ballin, Mr. Mills' defense attorney, told reporters that Mr. Mills \"understands he did something wrong and he's taking responsibility for it.\" Mr. Ballin added that there's \"overwhelming evidence of the guilt of people involved here,\" and if authorities need Mr. Mills to testify at a possible trial, he will.\n\nShelby County District Attorney Steve Mulroy said Mr. Mills' cooperation \"probably would incentivize\" the other officers to consider plea deals too. Mr. Mills will also cooperate in the U.S. Department of Justice's investigation into the Memphis Police Department, which Mr. Mulroy said should lead to systemic reform.\n\nMr. Mulroy said the defendants hold \"different levels of responsibility\" in Mr. Nichols' death and that Mr. Mills \"is not the worst of the five\" officers charged.\n\nBen Crump, the attorney for Mr. Nichols' family, said Mr. Mills' decision continues the \"sea change\" witnessed after George Floyd's death, when the Minneapolis police chief testified during former Officer Derek Chauvin's murder trial that he had violated departmental policy, values, and principles.\n\n\"The precedent that's being set now - police officers tell the truth, even if that means piercing the blue veil,\" Mr. Crump told reporters.\n\nThe plea agreement sets out Mr. Mills' role in the fatal beating, detailing how he pepper-sprayed Mr. Nichols three times before pulling out a baton and yelling, \"I'm about to baton the [expletive] out of you.\" He repeatedly struck Mr. Nichols, who was on the ground and surrounded by officers, never giving him an opportunity to comply with the command, \"give us your hands!\"\n\nAfter the beating, Mr. Mills and the other officers failed to tell the responding medics that they had beaten Mr. Nichols, instead saying he was on drugs. Meanwhile, among themselves they discussed \"taking turns hitting Nichols, hitting Nichols with straight haymakers, and everybody rocking Nichols. During these conversations, the officers discussed hitting Nichols to make him fall and observed that when Nichols did not fall from these blows, they believed they were 'about to kill' him,\" according to the plea agreement.\n\nMr. Martin used hand signals to indicate to Mr. Mills that his body camera was still recording. Mr. Mills removed the camera and placed it on the back of a patrol car.\n\nMr. Mills told supervisors at the scene that he knew Mr. Nichols was in bad shape and he \"expressed concerns about Nichols' survival,\" according to the agreement. When the five officers spoke later, they discussed what the body camera recording might show and conspired to mislead investigators. That included agreeing not to report that Mr. Martin had repeatedly struck Mr. Nichols in the head.\n\nAfter Mr. Nichols' death, all five officers were fired from the department and the crime-suppression team they were part of was disbanded. The four remaining officers have a May 6 trial date in federal court. A trial has not yet been set in state court.\n\nThe officers said they pulled Mr. Nichols over because he was driving recklessly, but Police Chief Cerelyn \"CJ\" Davis said no evidence was found to support that allegation. Mr. Nichols ran from officers, who tried to restrain him. He pleaded for his mother as he was pummeled just steps from his home.\n\nAn autopsy report showed Mr. Nichols died from blows to the head, and that the manner of death was homicide. The report described brain injuries, cuts, and bruises to the head and other parts of the body.\n\nThis story was reported by The Associated Press.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

But it was the first time I refused the invitation to pull over. It was one of those split-second decisions that people like me have to make whenever we engage with law enforcement officers. My encounter, thankfully, didn't reach the fatal threshold of a Darrius Stewart , Philando Castile , or Marcellis Stinnette . But people like me live with a constant fear that the potential is there.\n\nOnce I left the scene of the incident, I could have just paid the $164 fine or taken the four-hour, $49 traffic safety class and been done with it. But for reasons I still don't fully understand, those options left me feeling violated. And even though I had no expectation that something good would come of entering the halls of justice - in fact, there would be added court costs to pay if I lost the case - I felt better just thinking about having my say.\n\nThe morning of my court appearance, I realized that going to court would be a scary and intimidating experience, so I needed to write down what had been rolling around in my head or I'd stumble over my words. After the police officer, who was white, gave his version of the incident, here's what I had to say:\n\nCommentator Maisie Sparks proves that when fighting for your rights reveals something in common with your \"enemy,\" the outcome can be a win for both sides - and for society.\n\nGood afternoon, Your Honor.\n\nI was not following too closely. I don't know why I or anyone else would follow a state police officer too closely. And, more significant, I don't think following too closely is the reason I got a ticket.\n\nOn that evening, I was in the right lane; the police officer was in front of me at what was a safe distance. We were not even going the speed limit. I would be getting off the interstate soon, and I didn't want to speed up and pass the officer or miss my exit. The officer moved to the left lane, then beside me for a little longer than seemed normal, and then behind me, ... following me at the same distance I had been following him. I thought nothing of it until he turned his lights on. And this is when things got interesting.\n\nI didn't know why the officer turned his lights on me. I wasn't speeding. My license plate sticker wasn't expired. My lights were working. In that moment, everything I know about being black in America kicked in, and I decided I was not going to stop at night on an unlighted stretch of road for anyone, including and perhaps certainly not for a police officer. I truly feared for my life. ...\n\n... I didn't get a ticket for following too closely; I got a ticket because I didn't pull over, and I didn't pull over because I didn't know what might happen to me on a dark highway.\n\nI pulled over when I reached the exit with lights and people and I felt safe. By the time I got to my exit, another police car was there, and that caused additional trauma.\n\nWhen the officer came to my car, he said I could have caused an accident. I had no idea what he was talking about. I said, ... \"I didn't know who you were.\" What did I mean by that? Yes, I knew he was a police officer, but I didn't know what kind of police officer he was.\n\nThen he quoted the section of a traffic code that I had violated and told me I was following too closely. I was shocked. I couldn't believe this was what the lights were all about.\n\nWhy do I share this with you? First, because I wasn't following too closely. Second, even if I were, I could have been given a warning. And third, these are the kinds of minor and major situations that people like me find ourselves in on a daily basis. It's a situation where grace could be applied, but instead there is punitive and financial judgment. ... For far too many people like me, an innocent traffic stop has ended tragically. And, yes, I know, for many a police officer, an innocent traffic stop has ended in tragedy as well.\n\nThis, Your Honor, is a \"he said, she said\" case. And, what he - a police officer - says carries more weight than what this she has to say. I understand and respect that. I respect the law, [and] I am grateful for the dangerous work our law enforcement officers do each day. ...\n\nIn our binary world, we are divided into winners and losers. Ruling in my favor makes the officer a loser, and ruling in his favor makes me the loser. I'd like to offer a third way.\n\nBy the end of our encounter, I believe both the officer and I realized that we were not the people we thought each other was. That was the win for me and the officer, but more importantly, it was also a win for our society. Being in proximity with others is what changes hearts and minds. And that was the gift of the encounter. I was in fear, but what I didn't know is, the officer was living in fear also. The second or third time he came up to my car, I said I wanted to get out of the car to stretch my legs, but he said I couldn't and something to the effect that he meets a lot of people and he doesn't know what they will do.\n\nI was shocked. By then, he knew I was a 64-year-old woman driving a 13-year-old Volvo. But he was in fear of me? There is something dangerously wrong in our society when good people feel this way about each other. Your Honor, your ruling today can help us all to walk away from here with a new, grace-filled narrative about the scales of justice, or we can continue to react to our unbalanced fears. Your Honor, I'm asking you to dismiss this case. Why? Because I wasn't following too closely, and justice, in this case, can be better meted out as mercy. Thank you, Your Honor.\n\nWhat happened next was as shocking as seeing the trooper's lights behind me on that dark night on a dark road. The state trooper walked over to the prosecuting attorney. They shared a brief, private conversation, and then the prosecuting attorney turned to the judge and said, \"Your Honor, the state would like to dismiss this case.\" She did.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

The former officer used a metal flagpole to attack law enforcement defending the capitol.\n\nLoading...\n\nSept. 02, 2022, 11:46 a.m. ET | Washington\n\nA retired New York Police Department officer was sentenced on Thursday to a record-setting 10 years in prison for attacking the U.S. Capitol and using a metal flagpole to assault one of the police officers trying to hold off a mob of Donald Trump supporters.\n\nThomas Webster's prison sentence is the longest so far among roughly 250 people who have been punished for their conduct during the riot on Jan. 6, 2021. The previous longest was shared by two other rioters, who were sentenced separately to seven years and three months in prison.\n\nMr. Webster, a 20-year NYPD veteran, was the first Capitol riot defendant to be tried on an assault charge and the first to present a self-defense argument. A jury rejected Mr. Webster's claim that he was defending himself when he tackled Metropolitan Police Department officer Noah Rathbun and grabbed his gas mask outside the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta sentenced Mr. Webster to 10 years in prison plus three years of supervised release. He allowed Mr. Webster to report to prison at a date to be determined instead of immediately ordering him into custody.\n\n\"Mr. Webster, I don't think you're a bad person,\" the judge said. \"I think you were caught up in a moment. But as you know, even getting caught up in a moment has consequences.\"\n\nMr. Webster turned to apologize to Mr. Rathbun, who was in the courtroom but didn't address the judge. Mr. Webster said he wishes he had never come to Washington, D.C.\n\n\"I wish the horrible events of that day had never happened,\" he told the judge.\n\nThe judge said Mr. Rathbun wasn't Mr. Webster's only victim on Jan. 6.\n\n\"The other victim was democracy, and that is not something that can be taken lightly,\" Judge Mehta added.\n\nFederal prosecutors had recommended a prison sentence of 17 years and six months. The court's probation department had recommended a 10-year prison sentence. Judge Mehta wasn't bound by the recommendations.\n\nIn a court filing, prosecutors accused Mr. Webster of \"disgracing a democracy that he once fought honorably to protect and serve.\" Mr. Webster led the charge against police barricades at the Capitol's Lower West Plaza, prosecutors said. They compared the attack to a medieval battle, with rioters pelting officers with makeshift projectiles and engaging in hand-to-hand combat.\n\n\"Nothing can explain or justify Mr. Webster's rage. Nothing can explain or justify his violence,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Hava Mirell said Thursday.\n\nDefense attorney James Monroe said in a court filing that the mob was \"guided by unscrupulous politicians\" and others promoting the lie that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from the Republican incumbent. He questioned why prosecutors argued that Mr. Webster didn't deserve leniency for his 25 years of service to his country and New York City.\n\n\"That is not how we measure justice. That is revenge,\" Mr. Monroe said.\n\nIn May, jurors deliberated for less than three hours before they convicted Mr. Webster of all six counts in his indictment, including a charge that he assaulted Mr. Rathbun with a dangerous weapon, the flagpole.\n\nAlso Thursday, a New Jersey man pleaded guilty to using pepper spray on police officers, including one who later died. Officer Brian Sicknick suffered a stroke the day after the riot and died of natural causes. He and other officers were standing guard behind metal bicycle racks as the mob of pro-Trump supporters stormed the Capitol.\n\nJulian Khater pleaded guilty to two counts of assaulting or impeding officers with a dangerous weapon. He could face up to 20 years in prison, though will likely face a sentence ranging from about 6 1/2 to 8 years at a hearing set for December.\n\nThe case against Mr. Khater and a second man have been among the more notable brought by the Justice Department. George Pierre Tanios brought the pepper spray in a backpack. Mr. Tanios previously pleaded guilty and is also set to be sentenced in December.\n\nMr. Webster had testified at trial that he was trying to protect himself from a \"rogue cop\" who punched him in the face. He also accused Mr. Rathbun of instigating the confrontation.\n\nMr. Rathbun testified that he didn't punch or pick a fight with Mr. Webster. Mr. Rathbun said he was trying to move Mr. Webster back from a security perimeter that he and other officers were struggling to maintain.\n\nMr. Rathbun's body camera captured Mr. Webster shouting profanities and insults before they made any physical contact. The video shows that Mr. Webster slammed one of the bike racks at Mr. Rathbun before the officer reached out with an open left hand and struck the right side of Mr. Webster's face.\n\nAfter Mr. Rathbun struck his face, Mr. Webster swung a metal flag pole at the officer in a downward chopping motion, striking a bike rack. Mr. Rathbun grabbed the broken pole from Mr. Webster, who charged at the officer, tackled him to the ground and grabbed his gas mask, choking him by the chin strap.\n\nMr. Webster drove alone to Washington, D.C., from his home near Goshen, New York, on the eve of the Jan. 6 \"Stop the Steal\" rally, where Mr. Trump addressed thousands of supporters. Mr. Webster was wearing a bulletproof vest and carrying a Marine Corps flag on a metal pole when he joined the mob that stormed the Capitol.\n\nMr. Webster said he went to the Capitol to \"petition\" lawmakers to \"relook\" at the results of the 2020 presidential election. But he testified that he didn't intend to interfere with Congress' joint session to certify President Joe Biden's victory.\n\nMr. Webster retired from the NYPD in 2011 after 20 years of service, which included a stint on then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg's private security detail. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1985 to 1989 before joining the NYPD in 1991.\n\nThis story was reported by The Associated Press.

Officer Derek Chauvin faces charges of second-degree murder, second-degree manslaughter, and possibly third-degree murder.\n\nThe trial carries heavy expectations. It comes at a time when Americans are increasingly aware that race can influence police tactics. A series of fatal encounters between police officers and Black men over the past decade, captured on cellphones and spread by social media, has exposed the disproportionate burden of excessive force borne too long by African Americans.\n\nA desire for punishment in such cases is understandable. By proportion of population, Black people are killed by police at more than twice the rate of white people. Few officers have faced consequences in killings that were not justified as defensive. Video footage of the fatal encounter for Mr. Floyd shows Mr. Chauvin kneeling on his back and neck for more than eight minutes - well beyond the point when other officers nearby were able to detect the restrained man's pulse. The incident sparked protests that swept across the country and throughout the world last summer.\n\nWhile the trial is essential, measuring racial justice in the United States on the basis of one verdict and a long sentence risks disappointment. To convict Mr. Chauvin, prosecutors will need to prove he knowingly and intentionally acted in a manner forbidden by law. At the time of the incident, the methods of restraint used by Mr. Chauvin and his fellow officers were standard and approved practice in Minneapolis.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, equating punishment with justice obscures the extent to which public thought has shifted on racial injustice since last summer. To be sure, a Gallup Poll released Friday found that 64% of Black Americans saw Mr. Floyd's death as murder. Only 28% of white respondents agreed. Yet when questions of racial injustice are separated from the immediate legal issues of the trial, polls show Americans share more common ground. A range of surveys since Mr. Floyd's death have confirmed that majorities of Black and white Americans support banning dangerous police tactics and support reforms that make police more accountable to the communities they serve. Polls compiled by the New York-based organization Public Agenda found last summer that nearly 60% of Americans agree that racial bias against African Americans among police and law enforcement is a \"serious problem\" in their community.\n\nThat public consensus is fueling a dramatic shift in government policy. Lawmakers in 15 states - red and blue - and the District of Columbia have introduced more than 330 bills this year addressing police reforms, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. That follows a frenzy of activity last year following Mr. Floyd's death: more than 700 bills in 36 state legislatures. Nearly 100 were enacted. At the federal level, the U.S. House sent a bill last week to the Senate that would ban life-threatening restraint tactics and make police more accountable for their actions on patrol.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

That doesn't mean there aren't steps that can be taken to really minimize the opportunity for people to engage in that kind of behavior.\"\n\nThe trial in Minneapolis provides another venue to build a common understanding of racial justice. Regardless of how the trial unfolds, the American conversation about race has already shifted toward a better understanding of equality, one not based on skin color or neighborhood but on a core principle that all people have a shared nature and an individual dignity worth preserving.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

In 2019, the 23-year-old was placed in a neck hold by Aurora, Colorado, police officers and given ketamine. The acquittal reignites widespread outrage over racial injustice in policing.\n\nLoading...\n\nNov. 07, 2023, 1:44 p.m. ET | Brighton, Colo.\n\nElijah McClain's mother wiped tears from her eyes as a verdict was read Monday acquitting a second Denver-area police officer in the 2019 death of her son.\n\nTwo of three officers to face trial so far avoided prison time after being found not guilty, leaving Sheneen McClain and police reform advocates still searching for justice. Elijah McClain's death fueled national outrage about racial injustice in policing after the 23-year-old Black man was put in a neck hold and injected with an overdose of ketamine after police stopped him as he walked home from a convenience store.\n\nIn the most recent trial, a 12-person jury found Aurora officer Nathan Woodyard, who put Mr. McClain in the neck hold, not guilty of homicide and manslaughter following a weeks-long trial in state district court. He faced years in prison if convicted.\n\nSheneen McClain sat in the front row of the courtroom and left with a fist raised high, just as she did after the first trial last month against two other officers. She declined to comment, but a supporter who accompanied her called the verdict \"pathetic\" and a sign that the justice system was not changing.\n\n\"Her son should be alive, and everybody claims to agree with that, but for some reason we can't hold to account the people that took that away,\" said MiDian Holmes, an activist who befriended Sheneen McClain after they met at a 2020 protest. \"I think she understands and she recognizes that if she can feel, she can fight. This fight is not over for Sheneen McClain. She is going to turn this pain into promise and into progress.\"\n\nA third officer was convicted in the earlier trial of the lesser charges he faced - negligent homicide and third-degree assault. Two paramedics from the Aurora fire department are awaiting trial later this month.\n\nMr. Woodyard declined to comment following his acquittal. Defense lawyer Megan Downing said, \"We believe it was the right verdict, not an easy one.\"\n\nColorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said outside the courthouse with the prosecuting attorneys by his side that his office was undeterred in its pursuit of justice for Elijah McClain.\n\n\"At this moment, I'm thinking about Sheneen McClain, who has fought hard to keep her son's memory alive and to live on a blessing,\" Mr. Weiser said. \"No mother should go through what she has gone through.\"\n\nUnlike the first two officers who were prosecuted, Mr. Woodyard took the stand during his trial. He testified that he put Mr. McClain in the neck hold because he feared for his life after he heard Mr. McClain say, \"I intend to take my power back\" and another officer say, \"He just grabbed your gun, dude.\"\n\nDefense attorneys stressed Mr. Woodyard was not there during the crucial minutes when Mr. McClain's condition was deteriorating. Body camera footage seen by jurors showed Mr. Woodyard stepping away for part of the confrontation.\n\nMr. McClain's death had received little attention until protests over the 2020 killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis sparked renewed outrage. His pleading words captured on police body camera video, \"I'm an introvert and I'm different,\" struck a chord.\n\nA local prosecutor in 2019 decided against criminal charges because the coroner's office could not determine exactly how Mr. McClain died. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis ordered state Attorney General Phil Weiser's office to take another look at the case in 2020, and a grand jury indicted the officers and paramedics in 2021.\n\nThe killings of Mr. McClain, Mr. Floyd, and others triggered a wave of legislation that put limits on the use of neck holds in more than two dozen states, including Colorado, which now also tells paramedics not to give ketamine to people suspected of having a disputed condition known as excited delirium. The condition had been described in a since-withdrawn emergency physicians' report as manifesting symptoms including increased strength. Critics have called it unscientific and rooted in racism.\n\nMr. McClain was stopped the night of Aug. 24, 2019, while walking home from a convenience store, listening to music and wearing a mask that covered most of his face. The police stop quickly became physical after Mr. McClain, seemingly caught off guard, asked to be left alone. He had not been accused of committing any crime.\n\nMr. Woodyard and other officers told investigators they took Mr. McClain down after hearing Officer Randy Roedema say Mr. McClain grabbed an officer's gun. Mr. Roedema later said Officer Jason Rosenblatt's gun was the target.\n\nProsecutors refuted that Mr. McClain never tried to grab an officer's gun, and it can't be seen in body camera footage.\n\nMr. Woodyard said he put his arm around Mr. McClain's neck and applied pressure on its sides to stop the flow of blood to Mr. McClain's brain and render him briefly unconscious. The technique, known as a carotid control hold, was allowed at the time but later banned in Colorado.\n\nParamedics injected Mr. McClain with ketamine as Mr. Roedema and another officer who was not charged held him on the ground. Mr. McClain went into cardiac arrest en route to the hospital and died three days later.\n\nMr. Roedema was convicted earlier this month of the least serious charges he faced, which could lead to a sentence of anywhere from probation to prison time.\n\nMr. Rosenblatt was acquitted of all charges. His lawyer said the most junior officer on scene was a scapegoat in a prosecution driven by politics.\n\nIn both trials, the defense sought to pin the blame for Mr. McClain's death on paramedics Jeremy Cooper and Lt. Peter Cichuniec. While attorneys in the first trial suggested Mr. McClain bore some responsibility for his medical decline by struggling with police, Mr. Woodyard's lawyers seemed more sympathetic to Mr. McClain.\n\nThe city of Aurora agreed in 2021 to pay $15 million to settle a lawsuit brought by Mr. McClain's parents.\n\nThis story was reported by The Associated Press.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

She said she believed the officer was speeding and driving recklessly.\n\n\"To keep up with him I've had to... push the limit and everything and I actually know he was about going about 100 miles an hour because I was hitting 80 and I could not catch up to him, and he was still leaving me behind,\" the woman said in the first of her three videos .\n\n\"I was able to get up to him and honked and flashed my lights to ask him to pull over, and he... I don't know if he ignored me or anything, but he's been, you know, driving recklessly and pushing 100, you know, 80 to 100 miles an hour, you know, throughout the highways,\" she said in the video.\n\nThe woman never personally identifies herself or shows her face on camera, but the name of the YouTube account where the videos were posted is displayed as Claudia Castillo. The first video shows her following the officer, the second continues and eventually shows her getting the officer to pull over , while the third video shows her confronting the officer about his driving while both are parked.\n\nNone of the three videos show evidence of the alleged violation, and the woman claims the officer was speeding before she could begin filming.\n\n\"Just troublesome, you know, to see,\" she said in the second recording. \"I'm sure he's a good guy but, you know, nobody's above the law ... You're a leader in the community, you need to be an example to the community, you need to, you know, you need to lead by example, you need to show what's the right thing to do.\"\n\nAfter getting the officer to pull over at the side of the road, the footage shows the woman explaining the situation to him. The officer then denied speeding.\n\n\"I don't know how fast I was going, but I can tell you this, I'm on the way to work right now. I don't believe I was speeding,\" he said.\n\nHe went on to ask if the woman had an emergency, to which she replied \"Just your speeding.\"\n\n\"I apologize and I'll be sure to slow down then,\" he said.\n\nIn a statement, the local police department said it would look into the matter.\n\n\"The Miami-Dade Police Department will have the officer's immediate command staff investigate the matter, once the officer and citizen are identified. The appropriate course of action will be taken at that point,\" Miami-Dade police director Juan Perez said , according to CBS Miami.\n\nThe filmed encounter comes at a time when both civilians and police departments are questioning the role that recording devices have in relation to police work. While far from a citizen's arrest, the incident highlighted the increased accountability that smartphones and small video cameras are bringing to police departments around the country.\n\nThe \"Ferguson effect\" - named for the Missouri city that saw continued anti-police protests after a white police officer shot dead an unarmed black man in 2013 - suggests that officers tended to become overly cautious as they faced increased public scrutiny, although the concept has been largely debunked .\n\n\"This is a very human dilemma, and cellphones aren't going to get un-invented,\" Drexel University criminology professor Rob Kane told the Monitor in October . \"We have this technology and now we have to learn to live with it.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

But racial bias and criminal punishments for small infractions may damage the very relationships they hope to build, critics say.\n\nLoading...\n\nJan. 27, 2017, 3:17 p.m. ET\n\nPolice officers may hope that their presence in schools will help them build strong relationships with students, improving police-community relations over the long term. But achieving that goal may require rethinking law enforcement's role in education, a new report suggests.\n\nLooking at federal data from the 2013-2014 school year, researchers at Education Week found that students in schools with at least one school resource officer (SRO) were 1.5 times more likely to be arrested than their peers in schools that did not have a police presence. The disparity is particularly stark for black students, possibly because police presence is concentrated in districts with a higher proportion of minority students. Black boys were three times more likely to be arrested at school than white boys, the report found.\n\nRather than building relationships and improving outcomes, students who are arrested or referred to law enforcement can see a drop in school performance and are disproportionately more likely to get involved with the law again as adults, researchers say. Racial bias means that outcomes are particularly poor in communities of color.\n\n\"If you lock kids up when they're young, they're more likely to end up locked up as an adult,\" Joseph Doyle, an associate professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management, previously told The Christian Science Monitor. \"So it looks like tough-on-crime doesn't really work, it just leads to more crime .\"\n\nSpurred by rising fears of violent crime during the 1980s and 1990s, some schools began turning to police to increase safety on campus. With federal funding, their presence only grew. Following tragedies like the school shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado, an increasing number of parents called for security measures like metal detectors and armed officers. By 2013-14, 44,000 \"school resource officers\" worked in schools on a full- or part-time basis, Education Week reported.\n\nIn some cases, hiring these officers has resulted in an impressive drop in incidents. When Burns Elementary School in Charleston, S.C., hired longtime area cop Eric Jourdan, it saw a decline from 35 incidents in the first half of the year to five in the second half of the year, The Post and Courier reported.\n\n\"Our community overall has such a poor perception of the reason for law enforcement,\" Principal Lynn Owings told The Post and Courier. \"Building that relationship with students when they are young will change their lives forever .\"\n\nBut the national picture is less positive. Particularly in schools with a high proportion of minorities, the SROs are overused, taking on disciplinary functions that classroom teachers have traditionally performed, experts say.\n\n\"When you're in charge of kids occasionally you need to discipline them, and when you have SROs, that's who you're going to rely on. That's been the mechanical thing: They're there, so you'll use them,\" Emily Owens, an associate professor of criminology at the University of Pennsylvania, previously told the Monitor.\n\nArresting students, rather than having a classroom teacher discipline them, brings financial and emotional costs. An American Civil Liberties Union report found that arrested students were twice as likely to drop out of high school - and for those who appeared in court, that figure doubled.\n\nEven for those who stay in school, their experience may change.\n\n\"Even though I had good grades, my teachers treated me differently after that,\" explained Keshaundra Neal, arrested after walking past a fight in her school when she was 13, in a report for Voices of Youth in Chicago Education .\n\n\"They saw me as someone who got into fights and got arrested,\" she said. Many students report feeling traumatized by their encounter with law enforcement.\n\nCompounding the problem, the cost of employing school resource officers means many schools with a police presence are less likely to have school counselors who can keep an eye on the psychological and developmental effects of arrests on children, Education Week reported. Detaining students also drains the budget of money that could be used to educate them.\n\nSo how can police officers help ensure safety without becoming disciplinarians who grease the school-to-prison pipeline? Training is key, National Association of School Resource Officers executive director Mo Canady told Education Week. SROs should see themselves not only as members of law enforcement, but also embrace their role as educators on issues like drug prevention and as informal counselors for students, Mr. Canady said.\n\nThe Obama administration supported this training.\n\n\"A routine school disciplinary infraction should land a student in the principal's office, not in a police precinct,\" then-Attorney General Eric Holder said.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

More less than $40,000, while in California, it's over $100,000.\n\nAmid the havoc wrought by the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19), the jobs of first responders like paramedics, emergency medical technicians, firefighters and police officers have become more vital than ever. Despite the risks and specialization required for these jobs, often times they do not earn the kind of money commensurate with the critical responsibilities they take on. Using the latest occupational data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) , we looked at the average salary for police officers in every U.S. state, both current wages and over the last five years. Read on to find out how much police officers earn in each state.\n\nThe national average annual wage of an police officer is $67,600, according to the BLS , a little over $15,000 more than average annual salary for all occupations, $51,960. Depending on the state, however, the average salary of a police officer can vary significantly. Police officer wages are heavily dependent on the cost of living in each state.\n\nBelow is a list of the top-10 highest-paying states for police officers:\n\nIn California, the average salary for police officers is over $37,000 more than the national average, $105,220 vs. $67,600. The gap between the No. 1 best-paying state, California, and the No. 2 state, Alaska, is substantial compared to the overall ranking. In California, police officers, on average, earn over $17,000 more than their counterparts in Alaska.\n\nThe bottom-10 states where police officers make the least money are heavily concentrated in the U.S. South, where cost of living is lower compared to the nation overall. In Mississippi, the lowest-paying state, police officers earn over $31,000 less than the national average wage. It should be noted, however, that only 16 states have police officer salaries that are higher than the national average.\n\nHere's a look at the bottom-10 states for police officer salaries:\n\nFortunately for these states, salaries are improving over the years. From 2014 to 2019, the average annual wage for a police officer in Mississippi increased by nearly 11%, from $32,740 to $36,290. Still, for such a hazardous line of work, even in a state with cheap cost of living, these average wages are quite low.\n\nBelow you'll find the average annual wage for Police officers in all 50 states based on the latest data, from May 2019, according to the BLS.\n\nThe state with the biggest growth in police officer salaries over the last five years is Hawaii. The average police officer salary there grew by 31.3% from 2014 to 2019, from $59,950 to $78,720. California, the highest-paying state, has seen police officer salaries increase by a little over 20% over the same period."

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File)\n\nDunn, a Maryland resident, was a member of the Capitol Police force for 15 years before he announced his retirement in December.\n\nHe was on site during the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and guarded a stairwell where injured officers were gathered, and confronted Trump supporters near former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office.\n\nHe's since become an outspoken eyewitness and critic of what happened that day, testifying in 2021 before the House Jan. 6 Committee that: \"There was an attack carried out on Jan. 6 and a hit man sent them. I want you to get to the bottom of that.\"\n\nDunn has also testified at the trials of rioters involved in the attack, including the Oath Keepers, and has repeatedly shared stories about his experience that day-claiming the Capitol Police force faced violence and that Black officers like himself were \"verbally assaulted with racial epithets, in addition to the physical blows we endured.\"\n\nHe wrote a book about his experience and was one of several police officers awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal from President Joe Biden last year.\n\n\"I question why all Americans aren't united in the pursuit of justice and accountability,\" Dunn wrote in a CNN op-ed Saturday morning, the third anniversary of the attack. \"It has been disheartening to witness the growing support for former President Donald Trump, the instigator of the violence we saw that day.\"\n\nDunn is running as a Democrat in Maryland's reliably Democratic 3rd Congressional District. But he enters a crowded Democratic primary field vying to take the seat being left vacant by the impending retirement of Democratic Rep. John Sarbanes. Maryland Matters reports that there are 15 Democrats who have thrown their hat into the ring. The outlet also reported that Dunn does not currently live in the district, but has committed to moving there if elected-district residency is not a requirement for seeking election.\n\nMaryland Matters reports that candidates will have to file their campaign finance reports by Jan. 31, which will provide an early indication of who's garnering early momentum in the race."

More Lincoln Belmont branch of the Chicago Public Library on Sept. 22, 2022.\n\nThe Great Barrington, Massachusetts, police department received a complaint from a resident who was worried about the graphics included in a copy of the book \"Gender Queer: A Memoir,\" the Berkshire Eagle reported , which prompted a plainclothes officer to visit the school in search of the book.\n\nGreat Barrington Police Chief Paul Storti said in a statement on social media that the complaint made the department \"obligated\" to examine the book, which explores gender and sexual identity and features several illustrations depicting sexual experiences.\n\nMiles Wheat, the principal of W.E.B. DuBois Regional Middle School, told Boston.com the book is part of a teacher's personal collection and not included in the school's curriculum.\n\nThe search drew outrage from some parents and community members, who said the police have no authority to intervene in school matters, and more than 100 students from the district's high school walked out of class in protest.\n\nMassachusetts Gov. Maura Healey said in a statement to the Boston Globe that \"book banning has no place in Massachusetts\" and school superintendent Peter Dillon told Boston.com he \"would have preferred that the complaint came to the school or district and not the police.\"\n\n\"I wish to emphasize again to our residents, teachers, students and wider community that it is not our role to seek out, censor, or 'ban books' in our schools,\" Storti wrote on Facebook. If there is an opportunity to be included in these discussions going forward, we welcome a seat at the table.\"\n\nA number of commenters on the Great Barrington Police Department's Facebook page criticized the department for their response to the complaint. \"The police have absolutely no role in deciding what books belong in the classroom,\" wrote one commentator. \"As a retired high school librarian and science teacher of 33 years, I can't imagine the irreparable harm your department has done to the children you were sworn to protect,\" wrote another. One commenter wrote \"we're MA, for god's sake! we're better than this!\" Massachusetts routinely falls toward the bottom of lists of states that ban the most books.\n\n26. That's how many times \"Gender Queer: A Memoir\" by Maia Kobabe was banned from districts in the 2022-23 school year, according to PEN America. It was the fifth most-banned book of the school year behind \"Tricks\" by by Ellen Hopkins, \"The Bluest Eye\" by Toni Morrison, \"Looking for Alaska\" by John Green and \"A Court of Mist and Fury\" by Sarah J. Maas.\n\nThe topic of book banning in local schools has gained traction in the last several years as states like Texas and Florida take aim at books lawmakers say \"make students feel discomfort, guilt, anguish or any other form of psychological distress.\" PEN America reported 3,362 instances of book bans in public school classrooms and libraries last school year, up 33% from the 2021-22 school year. Florida had the most book ban cases with 1,406 instances (more than 40% of all bans in the country), followed by Texas with 625, Missouri with 333 and Utah with 281. Of those, 42% of banned books cover topics of health (including sexual wellbeing and puberty) and 33% detail sexual experiences between characters. Books with LGBTQ+ characters or themes make up 30% of those banned in the 2022-23 school year.\n\nOn Thursday, the Orlando Sentinel newspaper published a two-page print spread that listed all 673 books that have been removed from classrooms in Orange County, Florida, which includes Orlando, this calendar year. Teachers have been ordered to remove all the titles from their classrooms out of fear they violate the state's laws against any \"sexual conduct\" in public schools, and the list includes books like John Steinbeck's \"East of Eden\" and John Milton's \"Paradise Lost.\" The new laws signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, also a presidential candidate, require media specialists to review any books in school libraries and classrooms and remove them if they include sexually lewd material."

      "text": "The (Only) Four Things To Say If You're Stopped By The Police\n\nBy A.J. Herrington\n\nBy A.J. Herrington ,\n\nContributor.\n\nDon't talk your way into a conviction.\n\nThat, in a nutshell, is the advice that Southern California attorneys Marc and Craig Wasserman have been enthusiastically sharing with the cannabis community for more than two decades. They began specializing in cannabis law after Craig's son decided he wanted to get into the medical marijuana business in California's largely unregulated market, prior to full legalization under 2016's Prop. 64.\n\nBack then, medical marijuana was legal under state law, but many law enforcement agencies still went after patients and collectives. If a patient or provider was busted, they had to prove that their actions, be they growing, possessing or selling marijuana, were for the benefit of legitimate patients. That left people like Craig's son in jeopardy of arrest and prosecution.\n\n\"When he showed the interest, we decided we better go to bat, we better do our research and learn the laws as they existed then,\" says Craig in a telephone interview. \"And that's really when we stepped into the cannabis space.\"\n\nKnowing your rights can help prevent a traffic stop from turning into a DUI conviction.\n\nAs they represented more patients and providers, it became clear to Marc and Craig that many interactions with law enforcement were made worse when people who had been stopped by the police inadvertently gave up their constitutional rights by saying more than the law required.\n\nThe way that prosecutors \"get the convictions is when people say, 'I smoked an hour ago, this is when I used my cannabis,' even 24 hours ago,\" Marc explains.\n\nTo protect their clients, Craig and Marc, who practice as the Pot Brothers at Law , began advising them how to conduct themselves if they were stopped by the police. Over time, the suggestions developed into a copyrighted 25-word script. When properly employed, the brothers explained, these four short and easily memorized lines can help protect one's constitutional rights.\n\nAlthough the script was originally developed for medical marijuana patients and providers, the Wassermans say that anyone can use it to protect their rights. It might even prevent a DUI arrest for someone who may have been enjoying a little marijuana or alcohol but isn't necessarily impaired.\n\nTo aid in understanding the script, during our interview the Pot Brothers at Law ran through the four lines and explained why each is important. Here they are:\n\nIf you've been stopped by the police, the first thing you should ask is why you've been pulled over. Under case law, police officers must complete traffic stops within a reasonable amount of time, so this question gets the clock ticking and moves the interaction along. Comply with requests for identification, registration, and insurance information, but refrain from engaging in casual conversation with the police.\n\n\"They want you to get comfortable talking and then who knows what you're going to say that's going to incriminate yourself,\" Craig says.\n\nCloseup Glass with Alcohol in Cocktail Bar\n\nThe second line of the script allows you to preserve your rights to remain silent and not incriminate yourself. Use it to respectfully answer any questions posed by the law enforcement officer, such as where you're going or if you've been drinking alcohol or smoking marijuana. By avoiding discussion, you protect your rights without giving cause for further investigation.\n\n\"If you say, 'I had one or two' [drinks or joints], you're most likely going in for a DUI and get your blood taken and all that good stuff,\" says Craig. \"But if you say, 'I'm not discussing my day,' they're going to have to decide\" if you appear impaired.\n\nThe Pot Brothers at Law advise their clients to politely decline requests to perform a field sobriety test in California, where they are not required, although laws vary in different states. In any event, the Wassermans advise, do not lie to the police. Telling falsehoods will only compound your problem. Stick to the script, instead.\n\n\"If the cop is talking to you, it means they don't have enough to arrest you on, so don't give it\" to them, Craig suggests. \"And the easiest way to do it is politely say 'I'm not discussing my day,' no matter what they ask.\"\n\nCannabis and a marijuana grinder.\n\nAfter you let the police officer know you're not up for conversation, the next line of the script keeps the interaction moving along and lets you know where you stand. If you've committed a traffic offense, you might get a ticket. If you appear impaired, you'll probably be getting a ride downtown. But if the officer is chasing a hunch, perhaps because you were seen leaving the parking lot of a bar, you'll likely be let go.\n\nIf the police officer informs you that you are being detained, the fourth line of the script protects your right to remain silent. Curiously, a Supreme Court ruling requires you to verbally assert your desire to remain silent. Remaining mute isn't enough to protect yourself. Once you've invoked your rights under the Fifth Amendment, the Pot Brothers at Law are emphatic about the next step to take.\n\n\"Shut the fuck up!\" they exclaim in unison, reciting another line they've had copyrighted. Your right to remain silent won't do you any good if you keep talking.\n\nThe Pot Brothers at Law reiterated that the script is designed to preserve your rights. It's not intended to prevent an arrest, although they've heard from many people who have remained free after using it. And while they wrote the 25 words with medical marijuana patients in California in mind, they note that it can be useful anywhere in the United States, and even in some foreign countries.\n\nMarc and Craig Wasserman, the Pot Brothers at Law, in their Southern California office.\n\n\"We quickly learned through comments and talking to people and through our own understanding, that this is for anybody, everywhere. No matter who you are, what you've been smoking, drinking or doing. It's for any time you have to engage with law enforcement, except for when you're a victim,\" says Marc. \"But any other time you engage with law enforcement, you need to stick to the script because it helps to protect and preserve all of your constitutional and civil rights, remedies, and defenses if you need them in court.\"\n\nIn addition to their marijuana criminal defense practice, the Pot Brothers at Law also advise clients on operating in the regulated cannabis industry, including licensing, mergers, and acquisitions. They have become internet sensations with their script and \"STFU\" slogan, amassing hundreds of thousands of followers of Instagram and Facebook . They even have a line of merchandise on their website, and co-host Cannabis Talk 101 , the only marijuana-themed podcast to be produced in partnership with iHeartRadio. It's a lot of work, but it all gives them more opportunities to share the best way to stay out of jail.\n\n\"Shut the fuck up!\""

A recent study by WalletHub - a personal finance information company - highlights states in the U.S. that offer great environments for police officers-and some states that do not.\n\nFor a look at the ten best states in which to be a police officer, check out our slideshow below.\n\nTopping the list of best states for cops is North Dakota. What makes that state such an attractive place for officers of the law? The state ranked #1 in quality of life - an indication of things like housing costs public image of law enforcement and a state's attributes as a place to raise a family. It also ranked #6 among all states in the job hazards & protections category, and ranked #12 for job opportunities and competition, so its easier to find work, salaries are good and salary growth potential is positive.\n\nIn second place we find Connecticut. Though the Nutmeg State only ranked #31 in the category of job opportunity and competition, it ranked #1 in the job hazards category, meaning it's a relatively safe place to be a police officer. Connecticut ranked 10th on the quality of life category.\n\nA study by personal finance site WalletHub ranks states based on the virtues they offer police ... [+] officers.

It ranked 33rd in the opportunities and competition category, and that was the high point of its results: the state ranked 49th in both the hazards and protections and quality of life categories. For a look at the bottom-ten, check out the list below.\n\nAccording to WalletHub's research, the states with the highest median income for police officers is Illinois, followed by New Jersey, Michigan, Delaware and Alaska. The lowest median income is paid in South Carolina, followed by Arkansas, Louisiana, Maine and Georgia.\n\nThe lowest violent crime rates are enjoyed in (in order) Vermont, Maine, Virginia, New Hampshire and Idaho. The highest violent crime rates are in Washington D.C., Alaska, Nevada, New Mexico and Tennessee.\n\nThe states that have the highest police protection expenses are Alaska and Washington D.C. (tied for first), followed by New York, Maryland and California. The lowest expenses are in Kentucky, followed by Indiana, Maine, West Virginia and South Dakota.\n\nMethodology\n\nIn compiling its lists, WalletHub compared all 50 states and Washington D.C. across 20 metrics that fall within the categories of Opportunity & Competition (weighted at 40 points), Job Hazards & Protections (40 points), and Quality of Life (20 points). Opportunity & Competition encompasses factors such as salary, numbers of officers per capita, salary growth, etc. Job Hazards & Protections refers to issues like deaths rate of officers, 911 calls delivered and violent crime rate, among others. Quality of Life refers to housing costs, public image of law enforcement based on Twitter data, and a state's attributes as a place to raise a family or meet others socially.\n\nData was sourced from the U.S. Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Projections Central State Occupational Projections, Council for Community and Economic Research, as well as other organizations ."

More July 17, 2019 in New York City.\n\nJustin D'Amico, one of the officers who is shown wrestling Garner to the ground in viral footage of the arrest, later filed a felony charge of avoiding taxes that should only apply to individuals with more than 10,000 cigarettes, 22,000 cigars or upwards of 400 pounds of tobacco, according to the New York Post .\n\nGarner was allegedly selling single cigarettes without a tax stamp at the time of his death, and footage shows he only had five packages of Newports in his pockets at the time.\n\nD'Amico told the court the charge was \" a total mistake ,\" according to the Post , and that he erroneously accused Garner because he was stressed out, saying he \"wasn't thinking clearly\" and \"may have rushed the paperwork a bit.\"\n\nHe also wrote in the police report that officers used no physical force while arresting Garner, which D'Amico also characterized as a mistake.\n\nD'Amico also testified he never heard Garner say \"I can't breathe,\" the phrase Garner said 11 times during his arrest that later became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nD'Amico's testimony is part of a judicial inquiry into Garner's  fatal arrest and officials' responses, which began Monday and was filed by Garner's family. The review is part of a process in New York City which allows the public to seek inquiries into government officials in cases of alleged neglect, but the judge will not issue any rulings. This inquiry marks the first time the provision of the city charter allowing for judicial review has been invoked in more than 100 years , officials say. Garner was approached by police officers who accused him of selling untaxed cigarettes in the New York borough of Staten Island on July 17, 2014.. Footage from the arrest shows  Officer Daniel Pantaleo putting his arm around Garner's neck and pulling him down to the ground. Several officers held Garner face down on the sidewalk as he repeated \"I can't breathe.\" Pantaleo was not charged with a crime and was fired from the department five years later over Garner's death. Garner's family reached a financial settlement with the city for $5.9 million in 2015.\n\nNYPD cop admits felony charge against Eric Garner after chokehold death was 'total mistake' ( Forbes )\n\nOne Community.

Last month, a federal jury convicted Reffitt of five felonies, making him the first person to be convicted of federal crimes in relation to the January 6 riot. Nearly 800 people have been arrested for alleged involvement in the riot, with more than 250 pleading guilty to federal charges, though most have been misdemeanors.\n\nOne Community. Many Voices.

More automobile accident on September 11, 2022.\n\nAnthony Varvaro, a six-year major league baseball player and current New York City police officer, was killed in an automobile accident on September 11, 2022, on the New Jersey Turnpike . He was 37.\n\nThe Staten Island native will be mourned by his wife, four children, teammates and brethren on a day commemorating one of the darkest moments for New York City's uniformed officers.\n\nA true New York City product, Varvaro starred in baseball and football at Curtis High School before his lauded college career at St. John's University in Queens. While at St. John's he earned All-American honors during his junior season, which led to the Seattle Mariners drafting him in the 12th round of the 2005 MLB Draft.\n\nVarvaro reached the majors in 2010 with the Mariners, staying in the big leagues through 2015 with the Atlanta Braves and the Boston Red Sox. He had his second Tommy John surgery in 2015 and valiantly returned to the mound in 2016 after a long rehab.\n\nAfter finishing 2016 in the minor leagues, Varvaro stopped waiting for another break, instead finding a different calling during the 2016 offseason. The opportunity to join another exclusive brotherhood was too strong for the hurler to turn down. After 166 MLB appearances over six seasons and over $2 million in salary earnings, it was time for Varvaro to wear a different uniform.\n\n\"I kind of felt like my body was breaking down a bit, I felt like my career may have been coming to an end,\" Varvaro said to the Torch in 2016 . \"I probably could have played a little longer, but that's when an opportunity with the Port Authority Police Department arrived.\"\n\nHe served as a transit officer with the Port Authority since December 2016. Varvaro also remained active in the community, being named president of the Snug Harbor Little League in 2021.\n\nIn the wake of his death, the Port Authority issued the following statement on behalf of Chairman Kevin O'Toole and Executive Director Rick Cotton.\n\n\"Officer Varvaro represented the very best of this agency, and will be remembered for his courage and commitment to service.\""

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nAn Australian police officer has been convicted of manslaughter after a court ruled his use of a Taser on a 95-year-old woman led to her death.\n\nThe jury found Senior Constable Kristian White guilty following an eight-day trial in Sydney , where prosecutors argued that his actions were \"utterly unnecessary and obviously excessive.\"\n\nThe incident took place in May 2023 at Yallambee Lodge, a nursing home in Cooma, Australia .\n\nClare Nowland, a dementia patient who used a walker, was holding a steak knife when officers responded to staff calls for assistance. Body camera footage shown in court revealed White saying \"nah, bugger it,\" before deploying his Taser, causing Nowland to fall and hit her head. She died in the hospital a week later.\n\nPolice said Nowland's fatal injuries were caused by her head striking the floor rather than the electric shock itself.\n\nThe jury, however, rejected White's defense that his actions were proportionate, given the circumstances. Police Assistant Commissioner Peter Cotter described the footage of the incident as \"confronting,\" but that it would \"not be in the public interest\" for people to see why.\n\nWhite remains on bail and could face up to 25 years in prison when sentenced.\n\nThis case has reintroduced debates about the appropriate use of Tasers, particularly in situations involving vulnerable individuals. In January, the New South Wales (NSW) police reviewed their taser policy and made no changes. Nowland, who weighed just 95 pounds and stood five feet two inches tall, was described moving slowly toward officers at the time of the incident.\n\n\"The court has found Claire Nowland died as a result of the actions of a police officer. This should never have happened,\" said NSW Police Commissioner Karen Webb.\n\nShe offered her \"deepest condolences\" to Nowland's family.\n\nNowland's family and legal representation questioned why such force was used on a frail, elderly woman at the time of the altercation.\n\nAndrew Thaler, a family spokesperson, said \"The question will be, how was it appropriate to use this level of force on a 95-year-old woman?\"\n\nNicole Lee, president of People with Disability Australia, criticized the police response, saying \"She's either one hell of an agile, fit, fast and intimidating 95-year-old woman, or there's a very poor lack of judgment on those police officers.\"\n\nProsecutors emphasized that the officer failed to assess the reality of the threat posed by Nowland, who had dementia and was navigating the room with a walker.\n\nWhite, 34, argued in court that he was trained to view anyone wielding a knife as inherently dangerous, regardless of age or condition.\n\nWhite remains free on bail, with proceedings adjourned until tomorrow for arguments on a Crown application seeking his detention. He has been suspended from NSW Police without pay.\n\nWhite's long-term employment is under review and is subject to legal processes, Commissioner Webb told reporters after the verdict.\n\nJustice Ian Harrison told the court he wanted to hear more evidence about the circumstances White could deal with if taken into custody.\n\nNowland is survived by eight children, 24 grandchildren, and 31 great-grandchildren. She is fondly remembered for her active lifestyle, including skydiving to celebrate her 80th birthday.\n\n\"The family would like to thank the judge and jury for carefully considering the matter and the DPP prosecution team for their hard work,\" said lawyer Sam Tierney in a statement.\n\nThis article includes reporting from The Associated Press\n\nShannon McDonagh is a Newsweek content reporter based in London.

His role included monitoring groups like the Proud Boys.\n\nDuring the trial, Lamond, who pleaded not guilty, argued he had treated Tarrio as a source, not a friend.\n\nHowever, text exchanges between the two reveal a relationship that prosecutors claim went beyond professional boundaries, including messages that suggest Lamond provided Tarrio with \"real-time updates\" on the police investigation on the burning of the banner.\n\nTarrio was later sentenced to more than five months in jail for burning the banner stolen from a historic Black church in downtown Washington and for bringing two high-capacity firearm magazines into the district.\n\nProsecutor Joshua Rothstein said during opening statements for Lamond's trial: \"He knew the difference between right and wrong, and he knew it was a crime to lie to law enforcement. This play-by-play information allowed the Proud Boys to be one step ahead of law enforcement.\"\n\nThe defense has dismissed these claims as inflammatory, arguing that the prosecution is presenting a skewed version of events.\n\nLamond's attorney, Ana Jara, previously stated: \"Context matters, especially in conversations.\" She also accused prosecutors of \"cherry-picking\" evidence to paint a misleading picture.\n\nMeanwhile, Lamond testified : \"I don't support the Proud Boys, and I'm not a Proud Boys sympathizer.\"\n\nTarrio was arrested in the banner-burning case in Washington, D.C., just days before the January 6, 2021, riot on the U.S. Capitol when Proud Boys members joined a mob's attack on the Capitol.\n\nThough Tarrio wasn't at the Capitol during the riot, he has since been sentenced to 22 years in prison after a jury convicted him and other Proud Boys leaders of seditious conspiracy charges stemming from the January 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nAccording to Lamond's indictment, Tarrio and Lamond exchanged messages about the January 6 riot and discussed whether Proud Boys members were in danger of being charged in the attack.\n\n\"Of course I can't say it officially, but personally I support you all and don't want to see your group's name and reputation dragged through the mud,\" Lamond wrote.\n\nLamond, of Stafford, Virginia, was placed on administrative leave in February 2022.\n\nLamond, who retired in May 2023 after 23 years on the force, now faces sentencing on April 3 for his conviction on all four counts.\n\nThis article includes reporting from The Associated Press.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNatalie Venegas is a Weekend Reporter at Newsweek based in New York.

Copies of the citations provided to Newsweek state Hill was traveling at a \"high rate of speed\" with a \"visual estimation of 60 mph\" in a \"high traffic of pedestrians and vehicles\" area.\n\nHill was penalized $179 for the careless driving citation and $129 for the seatbelt violation. Officer Manuel Batista signed both citations.\n\nThese new details come after Hill was stopped while driving to the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens where the Dolphins played their season opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars . During the stop, he was roughly handcuffed and placed on the ground with several officers around him.\n\nAlthough briefly detained, Hill was released in time to continue to the Dolphins' win where he even poked fun at the incident during a touchdown celebration.\n\nAfter reviewing the police body camera footage of Hill's detainment, former Boca Raton Police Chief Andrew J. Scott told Newsweek on Tuesday, \"I don't think any of the officers did anything wrong .\"\n\nBody cam footage shows officers repeatedly asking the NFLer to roll down his tinted car window, but Hill does not comply and rolls the window up.\n\n\"Had Mr. Hill complied with the officer's request initially, and kept his window down, and listened to what the officer said, he would have been on his way in a matter of 10 minutes, gotten his citations, and moved on. That did not happen,\" said Scott, who testifies across the country on police practices and procedures, including the use of force.\n\nScott continued, \"As a well-trained police officer, this is now a potentially dangerous situation for me. I can't see the driver. He's not following commands. He's in a 5000-pound vehicle that he could speed away. Maybe he's going to grab a weapon. I'm concerned. Let me pull him out and get him onto the ground, and let's find out what's going on.\"\n\nAnother segment of the body cam footage shows officers commanding a handcuffed Hill to sit down on the sidewalk. One officer holds Hill's shoulder while another comes up behind him, grabs him around the back to the front of his chest, and seats him on the pavement.\n\n\"Hold on, brah. I just had surgery on my knee! I just had surgery on my knee,\" Hill exclaims.\n\nScott says of the scene, \"He [the officer] doesn't push him down. He doesn't throw him down. He places him on the sidewalk to make sure that Mr. Hill is complying with what is being requested.\"\n\n\"Having said all of that, I'm not seeing anything in the body-worn cameras that would cause me to say my officers overreacted or my officers didn't do what their training suggested that they should do,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Neill Franklin , the former Baltimore City Police Department Commissioner and Maryland State Police Department veteran appeared on CNN on Tuesday, claiming Miami-Dade police actually \"escalated\" the incident.\n\n\"When they were trying to get him to sit down and he says he just had surgery on his knee, one officer responds, saying something to the effect of 'What a coincidence. Did you just have surgery on your ears?' You know, talking about him not listening to them right away.\"\n\n\"This is appalling, and this is one of the main problems we have in policing today - that police officers are not following their training,\" he continued. \"They're not using de-escalation techniques that they're trained in, and in this particular case, as I said before, they actually escalated the situation.\"\n\nFranklin went on, \"They had his driver's license. They knew who he was and where he was going. There was absolutely no reasonable suspicion whatsoever to believe that their safety was at risk, so for them to even have him step out of the car ... what they did was completely against training. It did not follow case law for the reasoning they used to get him out of the car. Their safety was not at risk.\"\n\nDo you have a story Newsweek should be covering?

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has described the attacks on police officers during the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol as \"very minor incidents.\"\n\nThe president made the comments as he defended pardoning or commuting the prison sentences of more than 1,500 people convicted in connection with the attack in his first sit-down interview since returning to the White House.\n\nTrump's actions on Monday freed people who were convicted of violent attacks on police officers, as well as the leaders of far-right extremist groups convicted of orchestrating plots to prevent the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nSeveral police officers died during and after the riots, while more than 100 were injured. One officer died of a stroke after sustaining injuries at the Capitol, while four officers died by suicide in the aftermath.\n\nTrump's remarks to Fox News ' Sean Hannity on Wednesday downplay the impact of the riot, and risk eroding trust between police officers and his administration.\n\nTrump told Fox News on Wednesday that the people granted pardons this week had been \"treated so badly\" while in prison.\n\n\"They were in there for three-and-a-half years, a long time, and in many solitary confinement, treated like nobody has ever been, treated so badly,\" he said. \"They were treated like the worst criminals in history.\"\n\nTrump repeated his claim that the 2020 election had been stolen from him, saying that people at the Capitol were \"protesting the vote because they know the election was rigged and you should be allowed to protest a vote.\"\n\nWhen Hannity interjected that the rioters should not have been able to invade the Capitol, Trump insisted that most people convicted were \"absolutely innocent.\"\n\nHe added: \"These people have served horribly, a long time. It would be very, very cumbersome to go and look, you know how many people we're talking about? 1,500 people. Almost all of them are, should not have been, this should not have happened.\n\n\"And the other thing is this, some of those people with the police, true, but they were very minor incidents, okay, you know they get built up by that couple of fake guys that are on CNN all the time. They were very minor incidents.\"\n\nThe family of Brian Sicknick, an officer who died the day after the attack, told CBS News: \"There are no words that adequately describe the pain of losing Brian, and the suffering we have endured every day since, never to end. The pardons are intended to 'end a grave national injustice that has been perpetrated on the American people, and to begin the process of national reconciliation.' It is up to the American people to decide whether this purpose will be achieved, involving far more serious questions than how our family feels about the death of a son and brother, and the undoing of the justice that was previously determined by the Court's sentencing of Brian's assailants.\n\n\"It is our hope that the truth of what happened that tragic day will survive, irrespective of partisan political objectives. We are proud of our son's defense of American democracy, and the continued efforts of his fellow officers to safeguard the seat of government, and the Constitution which guides it; our hearts go out to them as they cope with all that has occurred, and we pray for their strength and fortitude to continue their important mission.\"\n\nWinston Pingeon , a former police officer who defended the Capitol on January 6, 2021, told BBC 's Newsnight program that the pardons are \"a slap in the face.\"\n\n\"It's so utterly disrespectful to these officers who showed up on January 6, just like they have every day since, to make many personal sacrifices of themselves in service to Congress , in service to our nation and to American people, of trying to make this world a better place,\" he said.\n\nThe Fraternal Order of Police , which endorsed Trump, and the International Association of Chiefs of Police said they were \"deeply discouraged\" by the pardons.\n\n\"The IACP and FOP firmly believe that those convicted of such crimes should serve their full sentences. Crimes against law enforcement are not just attacks on individuals or public safety - they are attacks on society and undermine the rule of law,\" they said.\n\n\"Allowing those convicted of these crimes to be released early diminishes accountability and devalues the sacrifices made by courageous law enforcement officers and their families.\n\n\"When perpetrators of crimes, especially serious crimes, are not held fully accountable, it sends a dangerous message that the consequences for attacking law enforcement are not severe, potentially emboldening others to commit similar acts of violence.\"\n\nSenator Thom Tillis told Reuters: \"I saw an image today in my news clippings of the people who were crushing that police officer. None of them should get a pardon. You make this place less safe if you send the signal that police officers could potentially be assaulted and there is no consequence.\"\n\nTrump's sweeping pardons will likely continue to face scrutiny.\n\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson announced on Wednesday that House Republicans will establish a new select subcommittee to investigate the attack on the Capitol and counter \"false narratives.\"\n\nIf you or someone you know is considering suicide, contact the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline by dialing 988, text \"988\" to the Crisis Text Line at 741741 or go to 988lifeline.org\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nKhaleda Rahman is Newsweek's National Correspondent based in London, UK.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nA former Washington, D.C., police officer accused of leaking confidential information to a Proud Boys national leader became a \"double agent\" for the far-right extremist group, a federal prosecutor said on Monday.\n\nMetropolitan Police Lieutenant Shane Lamond was arrested in May 2023 and is charged with one count of obstruction of justice and three counts of making false statements.\n\nThe case against Lamond stems from allegedly leaked sensitive information to Enrique Tarrio, the group's national leader, after members burned a Black Lives Matter banner on December 12 2020, according to federal prosecutors.\n\nAt the start of Lamond's trial on Monday, prosecutors argued that the former police officer was a \"Proud Boys sympathizer\" who tipped off Tarrio about his impending arrest over the banner-burning incident and provided \"real-time updates\" on police investigations. He is also accused of later lying to investigators about their communications.\n\n\"He knew the difference between right and wrong, and he knew it was a crime to lie to law enforcement,\" prosecutor Joshua Rothstein said during opening statements for Lamond's trial.\n\n\"This play-by-play information allowed the Proud Boys to be one step ahead of law enforcement,\" the prosecutor added.\n\nThe defense has dismissed these claims as inflammatory, arguing that the prosecution is presenting a skewed version of events. Lamond's attorney, Ana Jara, said, \"Context matters, especially in conversations\" and accused prosecutors of \"cherry-picking\" evidence to paint a misleading picture.\n\nMeanwhile, the trial's first witness, Lieutenant Ahsan Mufti, who investigated the banner burning and obtained a warrant for Tarrio's arrest, testified that Lamond withheld critical information about Tarrio's direct confession to the banner-burning that would have helped his investigation.\n\nTarrio had publicly confessed to the crime on social media before his arrest. Mufti also acknowledged that Lamond had been cooperative in other aspects, such as identifying Tarrio in photos.\n\nLamond had pleading not guilty in May 2023 leading U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson to decide the case after hearing testimony.\n\nLamond's connection with Tarrio began in 2019 when he supervised the intelligence branch of the department's Homeland Security Bureau. His role included monitoring groups like the Proud Boys.\n\nHowever, text exchanges between the two reveal a relationship that prosecutors claim went beyond professional boundaries. Lamond reportedly referred to Tarrio as \"brother\" in their communications, which spanned hundreds of messages.\n\nTarrio was sentenced to more than five months in jail for burning the banner stolen from a historic Black church in downtown Washington and for bringing two high-capacity firearm magazines into the district.\n\nTarrio was arrested in the banner-burning case in Washington, D.C., just days before the January 6, 2021, riot on the U.S. Capitol when Proud Boys members joined a mob's attack on the Capitol.\n\nThough Tarrio wasn't at the Capitol during the riot, he has since been sentenced to 22 years in prison after a jury convicted him and other Proud Boys leaders of seditious conspiracy charges stemming from the January 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nAccording to Lamond's indictment, Tarrio and Lamond exchanged messages about the January 6 riot and discussed whether Proud Boys members were in danger of being charged in the attack.\n\n\"Of course I can't say it officially, but personally I support you all and don't want to see your group's name and reputation dragged through the mud,\" Lamond wrote.\n\nLamond, of Stafford, Virginia, was placed on administrative leave in February 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, Lamond's case, being presided over by Judge Jackson, could see Tarrio himself called as a witness.\n\nThis article includes reporting from The Associated Press.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNatalie Venegas is a Weekend Reporter at Newsweek based in New York.

A group of rioters were said to be attacking a group of police officers in the area where Lee threw the bomb, and it hit an officer's shield before filling the mouth of the tunnel with smoke.\n\n\"No police officer should have to endure these attacks and provocations,\" McFadden said during the court hearing, per AP.\n\nLee applied to become a police officer six months after the riot, and Montgomery County Police Department said he was hired one year after that attack on the Capitol. The department said it was not aware of his alleged involvement in the riot until learning of an FBI investigation in July 2023.\n\nAfter Lee's arrest last October, the Montgomery County Police Department announced he had been suspended without pay and said in a press release that it was \"taking steps to terminate his employment.\" The AP reported that Montgomery County Police Department spokesperson Shiera Goff said officials will continue with termination procedures following Lee's conviction.\n\nThe Montgomery County Police Department also said Lee had been on administrative leave after he shot and killed a stabbing suspect in July 2023, but his unpaid suspension came after his October arrest on riot-related charges.\n\nLee is scheduled to sentenced on November 22.\n\nSince the January 6 riots at the Capitol, over 1,400 individuals have been charged with federal crimes related to the Capitol riot, with more than 900 pleading guilty.

She also allegedly posted a message in the Oath Keepers Telegram chat during the riot that said: \"We are acting like the founding fathers-can't stand down.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nA Texas police officer has gone above and beyond the call of duty when he completed a food delivery after arresting the driver during a traffic stop.\n\nIn Beaumont on September 15, Officer Taylor Bridges of the Beaumont Police Department stopped and arrested a delivery driver.\n\nBridges pulled over the driver after discovering multiple outstanding warrants, but after making the arrest he noticed something in the car-an undelivered food order.\n\nInstead of ignoring the food and carrying on straight on to the station, Bridges decided to finish the delivery, ensuring the meal arrived at its destination.\n\nAs he arrived at the house with the food in hand, a Ring video camera captured the unusual moment.\n\nKaren Funchess, the customer awaiting the order, was shocked to see Bridges standing at the front door instead of a regular delivery driver.\n\nIn the footage, Bridges explained what had happened and why he was there: \"The guy that was supposed to be delivering your food, he's got a warrant, so he got pulled over on the way over here. I'm taking him to jail, but I wanted to go ahead and deliver your food,\" he said in the footage.\n\nDespite being a little confused by the police officer arriving at the door, Funchess thanked the officer for taking the time to ensure she got her food order.\n\nOfficer Haley Morrow from the Beaumont Police Department told Newsweek : \"We are proud of Officer Bridges for going above and beyond his call of duty to ensure the delivery was completed. While it was not something he was required to do, he said he felt like it was the right thing to do. Of course, he never expected anyone to know other than the woman who received the food. His actions reflect the compassion and dedication we strive for in serving our community.\n\n\"While he has not been formally recognized, (we do yearly awards in January) we certainly commend his thoughtful and kind-hearted gesture. This is just one example of the many ways our officers demonstrate care and commitment to the people of Beaumont, both on and off duty,\" Morrow added.\n\nHaving caught the moment on the video doorbell camera, Funchess shared the unusual delivery experience in a clip you have to see to believe.\n\nFood delivery in the U.S. is big business, with 37 percent of adults ordering takeout at least once a week, according to a 2022 YouGov poll. Takeout food was understandably particularly popular during the COVID lockdowns in 2020, but the industry hasn't slowed since, showing a projected 9.76 percent annual growth rate.\n\nAmazingly, this isn't the first time a police officer has made a food delivery order while on duty. In 2022, another officer in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, appeared at a door with a bag of food.\n\nHaving arrested the delivery driver, the police officer said: \"I know I'm not who you were expecting, but your driver got arrested for some things he didn't take care of. So I figured I'd complete the DoorDash for you.\"\n\nSomething similar also happened in 2021 , when an officer in Jonesboro, Arkansas, completed a food delivery after arresting the driver. The officer was praised by his department for going \"above and beyond the call of duty.\"\n\nUpdate on 09/30/2024, 04:40 a.m. ET: This story was updated with comment from the Beaumont Police Department.\n\nAlice Gibbs is a Newsweek Senior Internet Trends & Culture Reporter based in the U.K. For the last two years she has specialized in viral trends and internet news, with a particular focus on animals, human interest stories, health, and lifestyle.

      "text": "Maryland Cop Who Recklessly Shot a 5-Year-Old Boy Got Qualified Immunity\n\nQualified Immunity\n\nJacob Sullum | 1.13.2025 4:40 PM\n\nDuring an August 2016 standoff with an armed woman at an apartment in Baltimore County, Maryland, a police officer fired his rifle through an interior wall into the kitchen. The bullet struck the woman, Korryn Gaines, in the upper back, then ricocheted off the refrigerator, striking her 5-year-old son, Kodi, in the cheek.\n\nThe officer, Baltimore County Cpl. Royce Ruby, later testified that he fired the \"head shot\" without a clear view of Gaines, saying he could see only her braids and the barrel of the shotgun through his rifle scope. He also said he could not see Kodi but knew that he was in the kitchen and that \"there's a possibility\" the boy would be hit by the bullet. A witness testified that Gaines, explaining his decision to take the shot, described himself as \"hot\" and \"frustrated.\"\n\nIt was understandable that Ruby was hot. The police had cut off power to the apartment building, which was sweltering without air conditioning. It was also understandable that he was frustrated. At that point, the standoff, during which more than 30 officers surrounded the building, had dragged on for more than six hours. Police had been told that Gaines \"had a history of mental illness and that she had been off her medication,\" as the Maryland Supreme Court later noted . \"Officers testified that Ms. Gaines acted erratically, sometimes negotiating with officers, at other times threatening them and cutting off contact.\"\n\nIt is harder to fathom why Ruby decided to fire his rifle even though he recognized that he was endangering a little boy and even though he was not facing an \"imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.\" The Maryland Supreme Court accepted that Gaines \"may have raised her shotgun\" but \"was not aiming it directly toward officers.\" It nevertheless ruled that Ruby was entitled to qualified immunity, which shields police officers from federal civil rights claims unless their alleged misconduct violated \"clearly established\" rights.\n\nBased on that conclusion, the court overturned $32 million in damages that a jury had awarded Kodi. The boy's father, Corey Cunningham, is now asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review the Maryland Supreme Court's decision. \"Obviously unlawful conduct alone clearly establishes the law such that qualified immunity does not apply,\" his petition argues, citing Supreme Court precedents to that effect. \"Conduct that is so egregious and obviously unlawful as to shock the conscience necessarily forecloses qualified immunity.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court, the Cato Institute notes in a brief supporting Cunningham's petition, \"has held that some rights violations are sufficiently obvious to violate clearly established law even without factually similar precedent.\" It urges the justices to clarify that a court should not grant qualified immunity to \"a police officer who committed a conscience-shocking rights violation simply because it could find no prior decision involving nearly identical facts.\" In this case, Cato says, \"it is self-evident that the officer's conscience-shocking conduct violated the right of Kodi, an innocent bystander, to be free from arbitrary state action.\"\n\nThe deadly encounter with Gaines began after she failed to appear in court for alleged traffic violations. Trying to serve a warrant for her arrest, two Baltimore County police officers knocked on the door of her apartment and announced themselves. Getting no response, they kicked in the door and saw Gaines sitting on the floor with a shotgun in her lap. She remained armed but contained throughout the standoff.\n\nBefore he fired his rifle, Ruby claimed, he saw Gaines \"raise her shotgun into a firing position and aim toward the hinge side of the front door, from which she could have hit officers stationed on the other side.\" But that account, the Maryland Supreme Court noted, was inconsistent with Ruby's testimony that \"all he could see through his scope were Ms. Gaines's braids and the barrel of the gun.\" Other witnesses \"testified that more of her body would have been visible had she been aiming the gun as Corporal Ruby contended.\"\n\nAfter Ruby fired his rifle, thereby injuring Kodi as well as his mother, he entered the apartment. Hearing \"the shotgun go off and being reloaded,\" he shot Gaines three more times, killing her. One of his rounds again struck Kodi, who this time was hit in his elbow. Kodi \"underwent multiple surgeries to remove bullet fragments from his face\" and \"required multiple reconstructive surgeries on his elbow.\"\n\nWhen Ruby first opened fire, Cato's brief notes, he did so \"without any imminent threat to life or limb.\" Because \"he was 'hot and frustrated,'\" he \"fired his rifle through the wall of a kitchen where he knew a five-year-old child...was present but not visible.\" Ruby \"admitted to knowing that his first shot could hit Kodi.\"\n\nDespite those facts, the Maryland Supreme Court concluded \"it was not clearly established that Corporal Ruby would violate Kodi's right to substantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment\" by firing his rifle in these circumstances. The court conceded that \"'clearly established' does not mean that there must be a case with precisely matching facts or that found a violation in the same specific context.\" But its subsequent analysis seemed to require just that.\n\n\"Although it is 'possible' that sufficiently 'reckless and irresponsible' actions like 'shooting into a crowd at close range' could rise to the level of a Fourteenth Amendment violation,\" the court said, \"the parties have cited no case decided by the time of the shooting here that had reached such a conclusion....At the time of the shooting, no decision from any appellate court in the country-much less a controlling decision or 'a robust consensus of persuasive authority,' had held that an officer who took action similar to that of Corporal Ruby violated the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n\nDissenting Justice Michele Hotten saw things differently. \"This case is a catastrophic example of poor decision-making and the overzealous exercise of state-sanctioned force,\" she wrote . \"The decision by an officer to shoot through a wall, at a target he could not see, when he knew a child was on the other side of that wall and could be injured or killed, is patently offensive to a 'universal sense of justice.'...As made clear by the facts, the shooting of Ms. Gaines and the injury to Kodi were unnecessary, avoidable, and legally unjustifiable. At best, this decision joins an ever-increasing line of cases in which few, if any, abusive exercises of state power are deemed violative of a person's Substantive Due Process rights. At worst, this case serves to justify future shootings by police, taken in frustration and in disregard to the risk posed to known bystanders.\"\n\nThe majority's position on qualified immunity illustrates a baffling situation that 5th Circuit Judge Don Willett has decried . \"To some observers,\" he wrote in a 2019 case, \"qualified immunity smacks of unqualified impunity, letting public officials duck consequences for bad behavior-no matter how palpably unreasonable-as long as they were the first to behave badly.\"\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch noted the same danger as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. \"Some things are so obviously unlawful that they don't require detailed explanation,\" Gorsuch wrote in a 2015 case, \"and sometimes the most obviously unlawful things happen so rarely that a case on point is itself an unusual thing. Indeed, it would be remarkable if the most obviously unconstitutional conduct should be the most immune from liability only because it is so flagrantly unlawful that few dare its attempt.\"\n\nBased on similar concerns, the Supreme Court has said that alleging a violation of \"clearly established\" law does not necessarily require locating a precedent with closely similar facts. The issue, it explained in the 2002 case Hope v. Pelzer , is not whether the \"very action in question has previously been held unlawful\" but whether officials had \"fair warning that their alleged [misconduct] was unconstitutional.\" In Hope , the Court deemed it \"obvious\" that handcuffing a shirtless prisoner to a hitching post for seven hours in the hot sun violated the Eighth Amendment's ban on \"cruel and unusual\" punishment.\n\nThe Court reiterated that qualified immunity does not apply to \"obvious\" constitutional violations in the 2020 case Taylor v. Riojas , which involved a Texas prisoner who was confined in \"a pair of shockingly unsanitary cells.\" One \"was covered, nearly floor to ceiling, in 'massive amounts' of feces\"; the other was \"frigidly cold\" and \"equipped with only a clogged drain in the floor to dispose of bodily wastes.\"\n\nAlthough Hope and Taylor \"both involved Eighth Amendment claims, their holdings are general,\" Cato notes. Yet \"persistent confusion about the obviousness exception in qualified immunity doctrine has engendered analytical inconsistency and avoidable injustices, like the one that occurred in this case.\"\n\nThe Maryland Supreme Court's \"erroneous approach-granting qualified immunity simply because there is no case exactly on point, no matter how manifestly unlawful the rights violation-is regrettably common in the lower courts,\" Cato says. It cites cases where cops or jailers received qualified immunity after shooting a 10-year-old boy in the leg \"while attempting to shoot an unthreatening family dog\"; after stealing $225,000 in cash and rare coins while executing a search warrant; and after putting a prisoner in solitary confinement for five months \"because he asked why he could not visit the commissary.\" To prevent such outrageous outcomes, Cato says, the Supreme Court \"should reaffirm that Hope and Taylor apply to any case involving obvious rights violations.\"\n\nStart your day with Reason .

The incident, which occurred in October, gave the elderly man severe injuries, including a broken neck, a broken eye socket, and a brain bleed.\n\nOn October 27, Officer Joseph Gibson responded to a minor accident involving 71-year-old Lich Vu. In body camera footage of the incident, the pair began arguing after Gibson told Vu that he was going to \"have to write you a ticket for improper U-turn.\"\n\n\"I didn't U-turn,\" Vu replied.\n\nWhen Gibson directed Vu to sign a document agreeing to \"take care\" of the citation, Vu appeared confused and refused to sign.\n\n\"We are not arguing about this, OK?\" said Gibson. \"We argue in court....If you don't sign this, you go to jail, OK? I don't want to take you to jail.\"\n\nVu continued to dispute the ticket. Eventually, video shows him growing frustrated, lightly slapping Gibson's chest, and saying \"Shut up.\" Immediately, Gibson grabbed Vu's wrists and slammed him to the ground. Video shows Vu's face striking the pavement and the elderly man lying motionless as Gibson handcuffs him.\n\nThe Associated Press reports that Vu was taken to a local hospital , where he is still receiving treatment.\n\nOn Thursday, Gibson was charged with one count of aggravated assault and battery. \"The Oklahoma County District Attorney's Office takes all use-of-force incidents very seriously,\" District Attorney Vicki Behenna commented in a statement . \"We evaluate the law and the facts in each individual case, and in this particular case determined the Officer's actions were an unreasonable use-of-force.\n\nThe Oklahoma City Fraternal Order of Police is backing Gibson, stating that the officer \" handled this call for service with professionalism.\" The group added: \"It is very disappointing to see a police officer face felony charges for actions taken in good faith while serving in the line of duty.

      "text": "Florida Police Officer Arrested and Charged in Fatal Shooting of 23-Year-Old Airman Roger Fortson\n\nPolice Abuse\n\nC.J. Ciaramella | 8.27.2024 12:59 PM\n\nThe former Florida Panhandle police officer who shot and killed Roger Fortson, a 23-year-old Air Force service member, earlier this year has been charged with manslaughter and arrested, the Associated Press reported .\n\nState Attorney Ginger Bowden Madden's office announced Friday it had filed charges against former Okaloosa County deputy Eddie Duran, 38, for manslaughter with a firearm in the May 3 killing of Fortson. The A.P. reported that Duran turned himself in and was booked into jail on Monday.\n\nFortson was fatally shot after Duran arrived at his apartment complex in Fort Walton Beach, Florida, responding to a call about an alleged domestic disturbance. Duran knocked on Fortson's door, and Fortson opened it while holding a legally owned handgun at his side.\n\n\"This decision marks the first step towards justice for the family of Roger Fortson,\" Benjamin Crump, a prominent civil rights attorney representing Fortson's family, said in a statement to local media. \"Nothing can ever bring Roger back, and our fight is far from over, but we are hopeful that this arrest and these charges will result in real justice for the Fortson family. Let this be a reminder to law enforcement officers everywhere that they swore a solemn oath to protect and defend, and their actions have consequences, especially when it results in the loss of life.\"\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office initially framed the fatal shooting as self-defense: \"Hearing sounds of a disturbance, he reacted in self defense after he encountered a 23-year old man armed with a gun and after the deputy had identified himself as law enforcement,\" a May 4 statement from the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office read.\n\nHowever, body camera footage released by the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office shows the deputy knocking on Fortson's door and announcing himself several times. Fortson eventually opened the door, holding a handgun at his side. The officer said \"step back\" and immediately began firing. Fortson only had time to raise his empty hand, palm outward. Three to four seconds elapsed between Fortson opening the door and the deputy firing six rounds at him.\n\nOkaloosa Sheriff Eric Aden fired Duran on May 31 after an internal affairs investigation concluded that \"Mr. Fortson did not make any hostile, attacking movements, and therefore, the former deputy's use of deadly force was not objectively reasonable.\"\n\nIn fact, Fortson lived alone. His girlfriend told investigators he was in his living room playing video games and on a FaceTime call with her, not arguing, when there was a loud knocking at the door. When the banging continued and got louder, Fortson's girlfriend said he put down his phone and told her he was going to get his gun because he didn't know who it was.\n\n\"This tragic incident should have never occurred,\" Aden said in a statement accompanying the internal investigation. \"The objective facts do not support the use of deadly force as an appropriate response to Mr. Fortson's actions. Mr. Fortson did not commit any crime. By all accounts, he was an exceptional airman and individual.\"\n\nAs I wrote shortly after Fortson's funeral , the tragedy illustrates a problem Reason has written about over and over again: \"The government insists that its citizens have a Second Amendment right to own guns and defend their homes with them, but it also insists that it's reasonable for police to respond with deadly force when they're startled by the sight of a gun, or what could be a gun but might be a harmless object, or the knowledge that a gun is nearby, as in the case of Philando Castile .\"\n\nFurthermore, \"warrior-style\" police training seminars drill into officers that they could be killed by a suspect at any moment and have to be ready to use deadly force without hesitation.\n\nDuran told investigators that he shot Fortson because Fortson had \"aggression in his eyes,\" and \"it is him or me at this point and I need to, I need to act as opposed to react.\"\n\nReason recently reported on a New Jersey-based police training company that glorified violence and promoted unconstitutional tactics. After being exposed by a New Jersey government watchdog and banned in nine states, the company declared bankruptcy and relocated to Florida.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "SCOTUS Revives Lawsuit Against Missouri Cop Who Jailed a Man 'for Being an Asshole'\n\nPolice Abuse\n\nJacob Sullum | 10.11.2024 5:20 PM\n\nOn a Saturday night in May 2021, Mason Murphy was walking on the shoulder of a rural road in Sunrise Beach, a small Missouri town, when he was accosted by a local police officer, Michael Schmitt, who asked him to identify himself. Since Murphy was minding his own business and was not, as far as he knew, doing anything illegal, he did not think he should have to comply with that request. Murphy's objection resulted in a nine-minute argument with Schmitt, who ultimately handcuffed Murphy and took him to jail, where he was detained for two hours.\n\nWhy? Schmitt had trouble answering that question. \"I didn't want him walking down my highway,\" he told another officer at the jail. Schmitt also suggested that Murphy was being held \"for being an asshole\" and that he would stay in jail \"until he decides to play nice.\" Even after consulting with a senior officer and a local prosecutor, Schmitt could not come up with a valid reason to arrest Murphy, who was released without being charged.\n\nFive months later, Murphy sued Schmitt for violating his First Amendment rights by arresting him in retaliation for constitutionally protected speech. A federal judge dismissed Murphy's claim, and last year the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit upheld that decision. But this week the U.S. Supreme Court revived Murphy's lawsuit, remanding the case for further consideration in light of Gonzalez v. Trevino , a June 2024 decision that made it easier for victims of retaliatory arrests to make a case for compensation.\n\n\"This decision is a huge step forward, not just for Mason Murphy, but for all Americans who have been retaliated against by government officials for their speech,\" said Marie Miller, an attorney at the Institute for Justice, which filed Murphy's Supreme Court petition. \"Our work is building lasting precedent, making it easier for people to hold officials accountable when their rights are violated. We will continue fighting until all Americans are protected against government retaliation.\"\n\nAlthough Schmitt evidently did not realize it at the time, Murphy had broken the law: He had violated Section 300.405.2 of Missouri's statutes, which says: \"Where sidewalks are not provided any pedestrian walking along and upon a highway shall when practicable walk only on the left side of the roadway or its shoulder facing traffic which may approach from the opposite direction.\" Murphy was walking on the right side of the road when Schmitt approached him-a fact to which the officer alluded during the initial encounter, most of which was recorded by Schmitt's body camera.\n\n\"Have I committed a crime?\" Murphy asked. \"You're walking down my highway in the dark,\" Schmitt replied. \"You're walking on the wrong side of the road. You're about to get hit. I have a feeling you're drinking.\" In a radio call, Schmitt likewise described Murphy as an \"intoxicated subject\" who was \"refusing to identify.\" Because \"I have a feeling that you are drinking,\" Schmitt told Murphy, \"I wanna make sure you're safe.\"\n\nMurphy, who was 20 at the time, said he did not drink. Contrary to Schmitt's repeated claims, Murphy was completely sober, and there is nothing inherently illegal about walking along a highway in the dark. \"Walking on the wrong side of the road,\" by contrast, is illegal in Missouri. But it seems clear Schmitt did not know that, because otherwise he would not have struggled to come up with a charge he could file against Murphy after arresting him. Schmitt's apparent ignorance of the law reinforces Murphy's argument that his real offense was challenging a cop's authority.\n\nSchmitt's comments before and after the arrest reinforce that impression. \"I'm not trying to charge you,\" he told Murphy. \"I'm just trying to figure out who you are.\" But if Murphy persisted in refusing to give Schmitt his name, the officer said, \"I'll take you on down to jail and run your fingerprints. We can do it the hard way or the easy way.\"\n\nMurphy, who was dismayed and frustrated but remained calm, thought that threat was legally unjustified. \"I haven't done a thing wrong,\" he said. \"I don't know why police think they can do this.\" Schmitt's response: \"Because we can.\"\n\nMurphy did not think that explanation was adequate. \"I'm gonna take you to jail,\" Schmitt warned. \"You're the one making it hard on yourself.\"\n\nWhen Murphy said \"that's not lawful,\" Schmitt insisted that it was, because \"you are walking down the highway in the dark.\" Murphy was unpersuaded, saying Schmitt had the authority to demand identification only \"if I have committed a crime or if you suspect me to have committed a crime.\" Schmitt said he was \"tired of arguing with you.\"\n\nThis continued for a while. Schmitt kept insisting that Murphy was drunk, which Murphy kept (accurately) denying. Schmitt kept insisting that Murphy was legally obligated to give his name, an assertion that Murphy continued to question.\n\n\"I don't appreciate you giving me grief,\" Schmitt said. \"I'm just trying to do my job.\" Murphy disagreed: \"I'm not giving you grief. You're giving me grief.\"\n\nEventually, Schmitt delivered on his threat. But even as he was handcuffing Murphy, he still had not answered the question that Murphy had repeatedly asked: \"What crime have I committed?\"\n\nAfter the arrest, the argument became more heated. \"You both are fucking idiots,\" Murphy told Schmitt and a Laurie, Missouri, officer who had responded to his request for assistance. \"Dumb as shit.\" Schmitt told him to \"shut the fuck up.\"\n\nSchmitt was still trying to figure out exactly why he was arresting Murphy. \"What's my charges?\" he asked the other officer. \"Refusal to identify?\" Maybe, the other cop said, assuming Schmitt could \"articulate that you had a reason to deal with him.\" Or the charge \"could be disobeying a lawful order,\" he suggested. \"You can figure it out.\" But Schmitt never did.\n\nDuring the ride to the county jail, Murphy's Supreme Court petition notes, he \"continued to orally contest the lawfulness of Schmitt's actions. He called Schmitt names and criticized and insulted him, including for not wearing a seat belt. But Murphy was not violent. Schmitt argued with Murphy and called him degrading names, too. In short, both men were rude and abrasive in their comments to each other.\"\n\nAfter 25 minutes, Schmitt and Murphy arrived at the county jail. Schmitt called Scott Craig, a senior officer who is now Sunrise Beach's police chief, and explained that Murphy had been walking along the highway and was \"refusing to identify himself.\" He asked what he could charge Murphy with. \"I don't know,\" Craig replied, suggesting that Schmitt consult the on-call prosecutor, because unless Murphy was drunk \"there's really not anything\" and \"that's gonna be a tricky one.\"\n\nAfter that conversation, the petition says, Craig \"took Murphy into a room at the jail, where they joined at least three other officers, including the jail supervisor, Officer Jerry Pedigo. Murphy again asked what crime he had committed. The officers did not tell him. Murphy argued with the officers about Schmitt's demand that he identify himself and continued to question why he was at the jail. Pedigo told Murphy, 'In here you're not going to run your mouth to me, 'cuz I'll just as soon punch you in the face and put you in that chair.' Murphy asked Pedigo if he would really punch him in the face. Pedigo confirmed, 'Absolutely. If you keep running your mouth to me.'\"\n\nAfter Murphy was locked in a cell, according to the petition, \"Schmitt told Pedigo, 'I'm going to talk to the PA [Prosecuting Attorney], see what I can get on him.' Officers called Murphy more degrading names and learned his name from a credit card in his wallet. Rather than release Murphy upon learning his identity, Schmitt said, 'He can still sit here for being an asshole.'\"\n\nSchmitt \"later made a phone call for a record check on Murphy and said, 'Please let there be a warrant.' When the record came back clean, Schmitt said, 'Damn.' He said that Murphy would be on a 12-hour hold 'until he decides to play nice,' that Murphy 'was just all full of insults and rude things to say all the way down here,' and that 'I didn't want him walking down my highway.'\"\n\nPedigo was later fired for threatening Murphy. After reviewing video of the interactions at the jail, Camden County Sheriff Tony Helms said he was outraged by what he saw. \"It was wrong,\" Helms told a local newspaper the month after the incident. \"I was furious. We strive so hard and all it takes is one person-one person not following policies and procedures, one person threatening to do something like this to make all of us look bad. Just like any profession, there are good cops and there are bad cops. I can't make any excuses for the type of behavior seen in the video. It was unacceptable, and I apologize to the victim and to the people of Camden County.\"\n\nWhether Murphy will get more than that apology depends on what happens now that the Supreme Court has sent his case back to the 8th Circuit. Five years ago in Nieves v. Bartlett , the Court held that an arrest can violate the First Amendment even if it was based on probable cause, provided the claimant can present \"objective evidence that he was arrested when otherwise similarly situated individuals not engaged in the same sort of protected speech had not been.\" Last June in Gonzalez v. Trevino , the Court said that showing does not require \"very specific comparator evidence\" indicating that \"identifiable people\" engaged in similar conduct but were not arrested.\n\nMurphy conceded that Schmitt had probable cause to arrest him for walking on the wrong side of the highway, although Schmitt never filed that charge. But Murphy argued that \"walking on the wrong side of the road occurs all the time on the highways with wide shoulders, and the police rarely, if ever, arrest a person for walking on the wrong side of the road.\" His lawyers said the fact that the police nevertheless arrested Murphy, \"who just ha[d] been protesting police conduct,\" suggested that decision was retaliatory. They added that \"reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery will show that no one else in recent memory has been detained or arrested...in either Sunrise Beach or Camden County for walking on the wrong side of the road.\"\n\nWhat happened to Murphy is strikingly similar to a scenario that Chief Justice John Roberts described in Nieves . \"At many intersections,\" Roberts wrote, \"jaywalking is endemic but rarely results in arrest. If an individual who has been vocally complaining about police conduct is arrested for jaywalking at such an intersection, it would seem insufficiently protective of First Amendment rights to dismiss the individual's retaliatory arrest claim on the ground that there was undoubted probable cause for the arrest.\"\n\nAn 8th Circuit panel nevertheless concluded that Murphy had not supplied sufficient evidence that he was treated differently from other pedestrians who walk on the wrong side of the road. Although \"jaywalking and walking on the wrong side of the road are similar,\" the majority said, \"the present allegations do not show violations of §300.405 are so common as to be 'endemic' or are so frequently observed as to give rise to a 'reasonable inference' that officers 'typically exercise their discretion' not to arrest.\" The majority disregarded Schmitt's recorded statements at the jail, because the Supreme Court \"has been clear\" that \"[ a] particular officer's state of min d is simply 'irrelevant'\" and \"provides 'no basis for invalidating an arrest.'\"\n\nWriting in dissent, Judge L. Steven Grasz said Murphy \"plausibly asserted that the Sunrise Beach Police Department does not regularly enforce this law.\" He noted that \"most, if not all, of the 'objective evidence' about whether Sunrise Beach police officers commonly see people walking on the wrong side of the road, but typically exercise their discretion not to arrest, would not be in Murphy's possession before discovery.\"\n\nUnlike the majority, Grasz thought what happened at the jail was relevant to Murphy's claim. \"If the Sunrise Beach Police Department regularly enforces the Missouri statute prohibiting a person from walking on the wrong side of the road, one would suspect Officer Schmitt and the other officers he spoke with would have had little trouble identifying that law as the basis for the arrest,\" he wrote. \"Instead, viewing the factual allegations in the complaint in a light most favorable to Murphy, Officer Schmitt arrested Murphy for challenging and criticizing him before later exploring various legal justifications for the arrest. Indeed, the allegations of post hoc decision-making indicate pretext, which supports application of the Nieves exception.\"\n\nUnder Gonzalez , Murphy has a shot at proving his claim even if he can't identify specific individuals who were not handcuffed and taken to jail for walking on the wrong side of the road. If discovery is allowed, he should be able to demonstrate that such arrests \"rarely, if ever,\" happen, which would support his argument that he was singled out for punishment because Schmitt did not like his attitude.\n\nMurphy could have avoided arrest if he had simply complied with Schmitt's demand that he identify himself. Instead, he asserted his rights as he understood them, insisting that Schmitt legally justify his inquiry. That clearly annoyed Schmitt, who expected meek compliance instead of an argument. But arguing with a police officer is not a crime, and now Murphy has a chance to vindicate the right to question authority.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Supreme Court Won't Hear a Qualified Immunity Case Where a Cop Disclosed an Abuse Report to a Woman's Abuser\n\nPolice Abuse\n\nC.J. Ciaramella | 11.14.2024 2:00 PM\n\nA California woman won't be allowed to sue the police officer who allegedly leaked a confidential abuse report to her violent boyfriend after the Supreme Court declined to review her case, ending her nearly decade-long legal battle to hold police officers responsible for abetting her abuse.\n\nThe Supreme Court declined this week to take up a petition for writ of certiorar i filed in August by Desiree Martinez. Martinez filed a federal civil rights lawsuit in 2015 against several police officers in Clovis, California, who she accused of ignoring multiple attempts to report her abusive boyfriend. She says that's because her boyfriend, Kyle Pennington, was also a Clovis police officer.\n\nBut the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled that those officers, including one who tipped off her boyfriend, are immune from Martinez's lawsuit under qualified immunity-a legal doctrine that shields state and local government officials from federal civil suits if their alleged misconduct was not \"clearly established\" by existing case law.\n\nQualified immunity allows government officials to avoid liability even in cases where courts find that they violated the plaintiffs' constitutional rights. Defenders of qualified immunity say it protects police from frivolous lawsuits, but in practice it also short-circuits credible allegations of civil rights violations before they ever reach a jury.\n\nMartinez was represented by the Institute for Justice, a libertarian-leaning public interest law firm.\n\n\"This is obviously hugely disappointing,\" Anya Bidwell, an Institute for Justice senior attorney, said in a press release. \"Qualified immunity should not be a one-size-fits-all doctrine that protects on-the-beat cops and desk-bound bureaucrats alike. My heart breaks for Desiree. But one day, when we defeat qualified immunity, it will be because she and other heroes like her had the courage to stand up.\"\n\nAccording to Martinez's Supreme Court petition, in one instance she filed a confidential abuse report against Pennington to the Clovis police. Later, during a late-night argument, Pennington called another Clovis officer, Channon High. Pennington put her on speakerphone and asked Martinez, \"So you're telling the cops what I did to you?\"\n\nMartinez denied it, but High interjected, \"Yes, she did. I see a report right here.\"\n\nMartinez claims Pennington hung up the phone and sexually and physically abused her. Pennington was later convicted of violating a restraining order, and prosecutors dropped more serious charges against him in exchange for a guilty plea to a single misdemeanor domestic abuse charge.\n\nMartinez's 2015 lawsuit alleged High violated her substantive due process rights under the 14th Amendment by disclosing her confidential report to Pennington.\n\nThe long legal saga that followed shows how qualified immunity shuts the courthouse door on alleged victims of government abuse before their claims can ever be judged on the merits.\n\nA U.S. district court initially ruled that High wasn't entitled to qualified immunity from Martinez's suit, writing that \"it was clearly established that an officer sharing a domestic violence victim's confidential information to the alleged abuser would be a violation of the victim's substantive due process rights.\"\n\nHigh appealed to the 9th Circuit, which likewise concluded that \"Officer High violated Ms. Martinez's due process rights by knowingly placing her in greater danger of Mr. Pennington's assaults.\" (When considering a motion to dismiss a civil lawsuit, courts are obligated to assume the plaintiff's factual allegations are true.)\n\nFrom that sentence, a reader might assume that the 9th Circuit likewise found that High wasn't entitled to qualified immunity-but not so!\n\nAlthough the 9th Circuit previously ruled in 2006 that police officers violated due process by disclosing complaints to their subjects, it decided that the facts of that case were not sufficiently similar to Martinez's. Therefore Martinez's right to file a domestic abuse complaint without having it disclosed to her abuser was not clearly established, and High couldn't have had fair notice that her conduct violated Martinez's rights.\n\nWhether or not an alleged victim of government abuse can sue the officials responsible often depends on whether they can find a case with a nearly identical background. The practical effect of this is that qualified immunity drags out lawsuits by years and permits constitutional violations as long as they are novel.\n\nWhile the Supreme Court has overturned some individual qualified immunity cases that were particularly outrageous -like one where correctional officers locked a psychiatric inmate in a cell filled with feces and raw sewage-it has continually declined to reconsider the doctrine as a whole.\n\nUntil it does, or until Congress gets its act together, plaintiffs like Martinez will have no recourse.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Cop Who Fired Blindly Into Breonna Taylor's Home Is Convicted of Violating Her Constitutional Rights\n\nBreonna Taylor\n\nJacob Sullum | 11.4.2024 2:45 PM\n\nLouisville, Kentucky, police did a lot of questionable things before, during, and after the March 2020 drug raid that killed Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old EMT and aspiring nurse. Their lapses included a misleading, legally deficient search warrant affidavit ; a reckless, middle-of-the-night home invasion that led to a lethal confrontation; and a conspiracy to cover up the misrepresentations that preceded the raid. But the most baffling aspect of the incident was Detective Brett Hankison's decision to blindly fire 10 rounds from outside Taylor's apartment through a bedroom window and a sliding glass door that were covered by blinds and curtains.\n\nOn Friday, after deliberating for more than 20 hours over three days, a federal jury in Louisville convicted Hankison of willfully violating Taylor's Fourth Amendment rights under color of law by firing five rounds through the bedroom window. Although none of the bullets struck Taylor, federal prosecutors argued that Hankison endangered her life by unlawfully using deadly force.\n\nBecause the charge \"involved the use of a dangerous weapon and an attempt to kill,\" Hankison faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. The jury acquitted him of a second count under the same statute, which alleged that he violated the constitutional rights of Taylor's neighbors, who were endangered by bullets that penetrated their apartment.\n\nHankison, who was fired from his job with the Louisville Metro Police Department in June 2020, is the only officer directly involved in the raid to be convicted of a crime. In March 2022, a state jury acquitted him of wanton endangerment, a charge based on the same use of force. Hankison was indicted on federal civil rights charges five months later. Last year, his first prosecution on those charges ended with a mistrial after jurors failed to reach a verdict.\n\nDuring his second federal trial, Hankison again testified that he was trying to help two fellow officers inside Taylor's apartment, Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly and Detective Myles Cosgrove, thinking they were under sustained fire. Here is what was actually happening, as described in a Justice Department press release about Hankison's conviction:\n\nDuring the execution of the warrant at Taylor's home, officers knocked on Taylor's door and announced themselves as police at approximately 12:45 a.m. No one answered the door, and the officers saw no indication that anyone in the home was awake or had heard their announcement. The police then rammed the door open and Taylor's boyfriend, believing that intruders were breaking in, fired his handgun one time at officers, two of whom fired back, hitting and killing Taylor.\n\nTaylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, has consistently said he heard no announcement and had no idea the intruders who had broken into the apartment were police officers. He was initially charged with attempted murder of a police officer, but prosecutors dropped that charge two months later, implicitly conceding that Walker had a strong self-defense claim. The bullet he fired struck Mattingly in the leg. In response, Mattingly and Cosgrove fired a total of 22 rounds down a dark hallway, where Taylor, who was unarmed, was standing near Walker.\n\nHankison, who could not see what was happening because he had moved from the doorway to the side of the apartment, testified that he mistook his colleagues' hail of bullets for gunfire from a semi-automatic rifle. \"I saw those windows and doors lighting up,\" he said . \"It looked like there was a strobe light in there....In my mind, an AR-15 is being shot, and it sounds like it's getting closer and louder.\" He added that it \"sounded like a semiautomatic rifle making its way down the hallway and executing everybody.\"\n\nEven so, Hankison's response is hard to fathom, since he had no way of knowing who might be hit by his rounds. The Associated Press notes that \"several witnesses, including Louisville's police chief,\" testified that Hankison \"violated Louisville police policy that requires officers to identify a target before firing.\"\n\nDefense attorney Don Malarcik nevertheless insisted that Hankison had done nothing wrong. \"He did exactly what he was supposed to do,\" Malarcik told the jurors during his closing argument. \"He was acting to save lives.\"\n\nNot so, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Songer. Hankison \"violated one of the most fundamental rules of deadly force,\" Songer told the jury. \"If they cannot see the person they're shooting at, they cannot pull the trigger.\"\n\nAccording to Yvette Gentry, Louisville's former interim police chief, Cosgrove-who fired 16 rounds into the apartment, including the one that killed Taylor-did something similar. Gentry canned Cosgrove in December 2020, saying he had fired \"in three distinctly different directions,\" which indicated he \"did not identify a target\" and instead \"fired in a manner consistent with suppressive fire, which is in direct contradiction to our training, values and policy.\"\n\nLike Hankison, Cosgrove said he mistook police gunfire (Mattingly's) for incoming rounds. He told investigators he was \"overwhelmed with bright flashes and darkness,\" which led him to believe \"there's still these gunshots happening due to those bright lights.\" Cosgrove, who later found work as a sheriff's deputy in Carroll County, Kentucky, suggested that he fired his gun without thinking. \"I just sensed that I've fired,\" he said. \"It's like a surreal thing. If you told me I didn't do something at that time, I'd believe you. If you told me I did do something, I'd probably believe you, too.\"\n\nAn investigation by Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron nevertheless concluded that both Cosgrove and Mattingly had fired in self-defense, meaning that criminal charges were not justified. The fact that Walker also seems to have fired in self-defense underlines the recklessness of the \"dynamic entry\" tactics that police reflexively used in this case.\n\nTaylor's death inspired extensive local protests and became a leading exhibit for the Black Lives Matter movement, along with George Floyd's death in Minneapolis two months later. In September 2020, the city of Louisville agreed to a $12 million settlement of a lawsuit filed by Taylor's family. But except for Hankison's unsuccessful prosecution, the raid did not result in any state charges.\n\nThe Justice Department, by contrast, obtained indictments against Hankison and three other current or former Louisville officers connected to the raid: former Detective Joshua Jaynes, who filed the search warrant affidavit; Sgt. Kyle Meany, who signed off on it; and Detective Kelly Goodlett, who allegedly \"conspir[ed] with Jaynes to falsify the search warrant for Taylor's home and to cover up their actions afterward.\"\n\nJaynes' affidavit , which linked Taylor to a former boyfriend's drug dealing based on little more than guilt by association, \"contained false and misleading statements, omitted material facts, relied on stale information, and was not supported by probable cause,\" the Justice Department says . Jaynes, like Hankison, is charged with willfully violating Taylor's Fourth Amendment rights. The former detective, who was fired in December 2020 for lying in his affidavit, is also charged with falsifying records in a federal investigation and with conspiracy for \"agreeing with another detective to cover up the false warrant affidavit after Taylor's death by drafting a false investigative letter and making false statements to criminal investigators.\"\n\nMeany faces the same civil rights charge. He is also charged with making a false statement to federal investigators by claiming that police sought a no-knock search warrant for Taylor's apartment because the police department's SWAT unit had requested it.\n\nGoodlett, the detective who allegedly conspired with Jaynes, pleaded guilty in August 2022, a few weeks after her indictment. Jaynes and Meany have not been tried yet. Last August, a federal judge dismissed enhanced civil rights charges against them, rejecting the claim that their alleged misconduct \"involved the use of a dangerous weapon\" or \"resulted in Taylor's death.\" Jaynes and Meany were re-indicted in light of that ruling last month.\n\n\"Brett Hankison was found guilty by a jury of his peers for willfully depriving Breonna Taylor of her constitutional rights,\" Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said on Friday. \"His use of deadly force was unlawful and put Ms. Taylor in harm's way.\" Although \"this verdict is an important step toward accountability for the violation of Breonna Taylor's civil rights,\" Garland added, \"justice for the loss of Ms. Taylor is a task that exceeds human capacity.\"\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "The NYPD Took 7 Years To Fire This Cop. Then the Union Hired Him.\n\nPolice\n\nJoe Lancaster | 5.28.2024 3:20 PM\n\nOne of the reasons that it can be so difficult to hold police officers accountable is due to the incredible power wielded by police unions . Even when departments are willing and able to fire bad cops, unions can often get them reinstated, usually at great expense to taxpayers.\n\nAs it turns out, even if it can't save a bad cop's job, the union itself may just hire him.\n\nThe New York Post reported that Hugh Barry, a former sergeant with the New York City Police Department (NYPD), is now employed with the Sergeants Benevolent Association (SBA), the police union that specifically represents NYPD sergeants.\n\nBarry was fired from the NYPD after shooting and killing 66-year-old Deborah Danner in October 2016. Barry was among multiple officers responding to a noise complaint against Danner, a black woman who had struggled with schizophrenia for three decades. According to The New York Times , after Barry persuaded her to put down a pair of scissors she was holding, Danner allegedly \"picked up a baseball bat and tried to swing\" it at him, at which point he shot her twice. (An EMT would later testify that Danner had already put down the scissors by the time Barry arrived, and she only picked up the bat after he tried unsuccessfully to grab her.)\n\nBoth then-Mayor Bill de Blasio and then-Police Commissioner James O'Neill quickly condemned the shooting, with de Blasio calling it \"tragic and unacceptable\" and O'Neill stating, \"We failed.\" They faulted Barry for deploying his firearm instead of a less lethal alternative like a Taser. De Blasio and O'Neill promised a thorough investigation, and Barry was suspended within hours of the shooting.\n\nIn May 2017, Barry was charged with second-degree murder, first- and second-degree manslaughter, and criminally negligent homicide. In February 2018, Barry was acquitted of all charges in a bench trial.\n\nBut while the department moved to fire Barry after the shooting, he would not face any administrative proceedings until January 2022 -after which NYPD officials waited over 18 months before deciding his fate. In September 2023, the department finally forced him out, nearly seven years after he killed Danner.\n\nBarry shot and killed a woman under questionable circumstances, and both the police commissioner and the mayor immediately criticized his conduct. While he would be acquitted by a judge on criminal charges, the city would later pay $2 million to settle a lawsuit brought by Danner's sister, who was present at the shooting.\n\nAnd yet it took nearly seven years for the NYPD to fire Barry, who was placed on \"modified\" duty after the trial, which entails nonenforcement tasks; he earned $152,000 in 2020 alone, as his employer was actively pursuing his termination.\n\nEvery step of the way, the SBA-Barry's union, as an NYPD sergeant-supported him and pushed for his reinstatement. In June 2017, just two weeks after Barry's indictment, the SBA ran a full-page ad in the New York Post and the New York Daily News , in which SBA President Ed Mullins charged that Barry was \"being used as a pawn in political gamesmanship.\" In the following years, the union tweeted numerous times from its official account, invoking Barry positively when commenting on unrelated stories. After his acquittal, Mullins said Barry \"was wronged all along\" and added that he \"should be restored to full duty.\"\n\n(In August 2023, just weeks before Barry was officially terminated from the NYPD, a federal judge sentenced Mullins to two years in federal prison after he pleaded guilty to embezzling $600,000 from the SBA.)\n\nGiven its consistent support, it's perhaps unsurprising that the SBA would then choose to hire Barry, who as of this writing is listed on the union's website as a \"reimbursement coordinator.\"\n\nIn practice, police unions' primary purpose seems to be shielding bad cops from accountability and defending their conduct no matter what. In 2020, two officers with the Buffalo Police Department shoved an unarmed 75-year-old man , whose head hit the pavement and started bleeding. An arbitrator hired by the police union later sided with the officers, determining that the man's fall \"might well have had as much to do with the fact that he was holding objects in each hand or his advanced age\" as the fact that he was forcibly pushed.\n\nBetween October 2015 and March 2021, the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department reinstated 37 terminated officers-17 of whom had been deemed a \"threat to safety\"-after arbitrators overruled the department, costing district taxpayers $14.3 million.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "He Allegedly Killed a Cop During a No-Knock Raid. Will the Jury Agree It Was Self-Defense?\n\nCriminal Justice\n\nBilly Binion | 11.7.2023 5:22 PM\n\nBELTON, TEXAS-A man in small-town Texas is facing life in prison for allegedly killing a police officer. But the trial-which commenced Monday after a nearly decade-long wait-is a confluence of police use of force, the war on drugs, and the right to self-defense. Its outcome will in part answer the following question: How far does a self-defense claim go when it's exercised against the state?\n\nAt around 5:45 a.m. on May 9, 2014, a SWAT team in Killeen, Texas-consisting of about two dozen officers-descended on Marvin Guy's modest apartment on Circle M Drive. They were there to execute a no-knock drug raid, a controversial approach that allows law enforcement to forcibly enter a residence, usually with a fabulous display of force, without first announcing themselves. An informant had reportedly told police that Guy was dealing cocaine.\n\nThe raid did not go as planned.\n\nOfficers smashed Guy's bedroom window and attempted to breach the door with a battering ram. But something appeared to be lodged behind the door, preventing police from immediately gaining entry and leaving them clogged outside the residence. In the rapidly unfolding mayhem, Guy fired several shots outside of his broken window, allegedly hitting four officers. Police quickly fired over 40 rounds in return. One officer, Detective Charles Dinwiddie, died.\n\nGuy was arrested and ultimately charged with one count of capital murder and three counts of attempted capital murder. But he says he believed the police to be intruders when he was awoken and disoriented early that morning. Witnesses for the prosecution yesterday described the neighborhood as one that was known for its high crime rate. Less than a week before the raid, someone broke into Guy's neighbor's residence across the street in similar fashion, forcing entry via a first-floor window and choking a female resident nearly to death.\n\nA series of protracted delays-stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, Guy's declining health, disputes over the district attorney's office releasing all the evidence, and a slew of defense attorneys either quitting or being fired-have lengthened Guy's stay at the county jail, where he has been held for almost a decade on $4 million bond. For years, the state sought the death penalty , which also slowed trial preparations, as proceedings with the ultimate punishment on the table take more time. Prosecutors withdrew that last year, instead opting to pursue life in prison, to speed the process.\n\nThe case is not the first to pit self-defense against no-knock raids. The tactic has come under intense scrutiny in recent years. In 2020, Breonna Taylor was killed by police during a similar raid after her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, grabbed a firearm he legally owned and fired one shot at police, believing them to be intruders. (Police claim they announced themselves before breaking down Walker's door; Walker says he didn't hear them.) Charges against him were ultimately dismissed . In 2021, a Florida man went to trial facing three counts of first-degree attempted murder of a law enforcement officer after he shot at deputies during a 2017 drug raid targeting his father. The government also charged the defendant, Andrew Coffee IV, with murdering his girlfriend, Alteria Woods, who was shot and killed by police, as prosecutors posited that Woods died as a result of Coffee's actions. A jury acquitted him of those charges.\n\nThe topic is particularly relevant in Guy's case, as Texas has the Castle Doctrine, a legal principle grounded in the eponymous idea that someone's home is their castle. As such, they have no duty to retreat when they believe they're facing a deadly threat. An exception: It does not apply when the person in question is engaged in illegal activity. The Killeen Police Department (KPD) allegedly found traces of white powder in Guy's car, on the floor of his apartment, and in the trash, amounting to 1 gram of \"suspected cocaine.\" He was not charged with a drug crime.\n\nBut even if the jury decides Guy is not entitled to protection via the Castle Doctrine, they could still find he acted in self-defense. The state, however, has a radically different theory: At trial yesterday, Bell County Assistant District Attorney Fred Burns laid the groundwork for the notion that the problems cascading from the raid weren't a result of Guy not having enough information. On the contrary-it's because he knew too much, Burns said.\n\nThat theory began to take shape during the testimony of David Daniels, a retired SWAT officer with KPD who was hit by a bullet during the raid. In this telling, Guy had barricaded the door to his apartment not because he was afraid of intruders but because he knew SWAT was coming and plotted to kill the police when they arrived. \"We were ambushed,\" Daniels said. It was not yet clear how the state would prove Guy's clairvoyance about the department's plans.\n\nThe subject of no-knock raids has been a fraught one for KPD. The city recently reached a settlement with the family of a man who was killed during a 2019 raid. In 2021, the local council voted to ban the tactic. Unfortunately, that came too late here.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "\"Say No To Police Profanity\"\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nPolice\n\nEugene Volokh | 12.8.2023 3:48 PM\n\nAn interesting column by one of my favorite commentators, Prof. John McWhorter. An excerpt:\n\nPrecincts across the nation do, in fact, have rules against profanity on the job. However, they are barely enforced if at all .... This casual cursing at people is not a mere matter of the informality of our times and it must stop. It is a much more serious matter than it may seem....\n\nProfanity can be a form of hostility. To be sure, I am skeptical of claims that injurious words always constitute \"trauma\" (just as I am that \"silence is violence\"). However, profanity can still be a game changer. In interactions with cops it influences public perception. One study (of many similar) showed that, when presented with a silent video of a person detained by a police officer with captions in which the officers' profanity was left out, observers judged the interaction as more reasonable than when the profanity was included in the captions. Other studies similarly document that, when it comes to the cops, profanity matters-profoundly influencing how citizens view their interactions with police....\n\nOn the other hand, we must not fall for a crude, blanket notion that police officers must never be caught in a recording using, say, the word \"fuck\" on the job for any reason. This would operate upon an almost willfully uninformed sense of how language actually works. Any word remotely interesting likely has a lot of meanings....\n\nFuck-subject of one whole study on police interactions since it seems so fertile within them-has many meanings and functions. Rather a bouquet of them, in fact. It can be a passing, frustrated interjection, in the function of the Peanuts gang's \"Rats.\" It can signal joy of a demotic flavor, a lexical kind of camaraderie, as when then-Vice President Biden used it when Obamacare was signed into the books.\n\nWe must also allow that speech norms are less formal than they once were. It's safe to say that, now, most people use four-letter words in work settings in ways that would have been unthinkable in the era of fedoras, camisoles, lawsuits over what got sent through the mail, and married couples sleeping in twin beds on television. We can't penalize police officers for being caught ever using profanity for any reason on the job.\n\nYet the issue here is not especially complex or subtle. In interactions with the public, police officers should not use profanity in ways that connote hostility, impatience, or dominance. More economically, the idea is that they should not use it in ways that are mean.\n\nSeems reasonable to me, and indeed I expect that most government employers should and would forbid their employees from using profanity in an angry or aggressive way when speaking with the people they serve. (Certainly the First Amendment doesn't generally bar government employers from imposing such restrictions on speech that is part of the employee's job.) I appreciate that police officers may sometimes need to signal a form of aggressiveness; \"drop the gun or I'll shoot\" is aggressive, but justified. But I suspect that aggressive profanity generally adds a needless level of tension, hostility, and indignity to most situations.\n\nOf course, mentioning the word in the course of describing facts (e.g., \"In that altercation you were describing, who exactly was the person who said 'fuck you' to you?\") is a completely different matter; and I also agree that there should generally be tolerance for some casual nonhostile profanity, given modern norms: \"Fuck!\" as an expression of surprise, or of annoyance at one's own minor mistake, is still unprofessional, but probably not an occasion for firing or serious discipline. But those, as McWhorter notes, are separate questions.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

The 2020 case was heard by U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan in Brooklyn.\n\nFurther details are left out as well. The two BLM rioters threw the Molotov cocktail into an empty police car in New York City, and cut a deal with prosecutors to plead guilty in exchange for reduced charges. The defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit arson and possess an explosive device, with a maximum possible sentencing of five years. As a part of the deal, the defendants paid the city of New York $30,137 each and the prosecutors recommended a sentence of 18 to 24 months.\n\nThe January 6 rioter, Thomas Webster, swung a metal flagpole at a police officer, tackled the officer, and choked him while he attempted to remove the officer's gas mask and helmet. Webster did not plead guilty, instead arguing that he acted in self-defense. The jury did not find his argument convincing and found Webster guilty of five felonies : assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers with a dangerous weapon; obstructing officers during a civil disorder; entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds, while carrying a dangerous weapon; engaging in disorderly or disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds, while carrying a dangerous weapon, and engaging in physical violence in a restricted building or grounds, while carrying a dangerous weapon.\n\nWebster was also found guilty of the misdemeanor of engaging in an act of physical violence in the Capitol building or grounds. In addition to 10 years in prison, Webster received three years of supervised release post-release and a fine of $2,060.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com .

      "text": "Fact Checking Joe Biden's Comment on the Death of Brian Sicknick\n\nHe claimed that January 6 rioters killed a police officer. Brian Sicknick died on January 7 of two strokes after defending the Capitol.\n\nDuring a press conference after his meeting with Vladmir Putin on Wednesday, President Joe Biden was asked about Putin justifying crackdowns on political opposition by saying he didn't want something like the January 6 attack on the Capitol to happen in Russia. Biden responded : \"It's one thing for literally criminals to break through cordon, go into the Capitol, kill a police officer and be held unaccountable, than it is for people objecting, marching on a Capitol and saying you are not allowing me to speak freely, you're not allowing me to do A, B, C, or D. And so they're very different criteria.\"\n\nBiden is referring to Officer Brian Sicknick, a Capitol Police officer who died on January 7 after having defended the Capitol the day before. After initial claims from Capitol Police that Sicknick had died of injuries sustained at the Capitol attack, the medical examiner's report indicated that Sicknick's cause of death was two strokes. Sicknick had been sprayed with a chemical agent during the attack, but in an interview with the Washington Post , the medical examiner, Francisco J. Diaz, said there was no evidence Sicknick experienced internal or external injuries, nor that the chemicals had caused an allergic reaction. From the Post : \"Diaz said Sicknick suffered two strokes at the base of the brain stem caused by a clot in an artery that supplies blood to that area of the body. Diaz said he could not comment on whether Sicknick had a preexisting medical condition, citing privacy laws.\"\n\nDiaz did say, however, that the events of January 6 \"played a role in [Sicknick's] condition.\" Experts told CNN that stress from a traumatic experience can certainly bring about a stroke, leaving open the possibility that Sicknick's role in defending the Capitol and being attacked by rioters may have led to his strokes.\n\nWithout further context, Biden's comment that rioters \"kill[ed] a police officer\" might lead listeners to believe Sicknick was murdered on January 6. Such an interpretation would be inaccurate: Sicknick died after suffering two strokes, and while those strokes may have been brought on by the events of January 6, there is no way to definitively prove a connection.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com .

      "text": "When the Law Doesn't Contain All the Answers\n\nEven if the legal system convicts one officer of one crime, that does not relieve us of our responsibility to confront our country's truth about race.\n\nHere we go again. The video of George Floyd prostrate on the pavement, a police officer's knee on his neck for nine minutes, is truly sickening to watch. It feels almost pointless to express one's disgust and anger at the injustice of it because the misconduct of the officer (with that chilling stare directed at the panicked and horrified onlookers literally begging for him to stop) seems so obvious. Who could defend what is depicted in that video? Thankfully, no one really has, but give it time, it's a big country. Some people have a psychological or financial interest defending the indefensible, so they will. These people should be ignored-their goal is more to provoke than to engage in a meaningful discussion.\n\nBut even if the rest of us on planet Earth, who may not agree on much, are in broad agreement that the Floyd death represents a horrifying example of misuse of the power and authority our legal system delegates to law enforcement with the aim of protecting life, not snuffing it out, that agreement isn't unifying. It's sad.\n\nThe officers involved were immediately terminated by the city of Minneapolis, and a phalanx of state and federal civil rights investigators and prosecutors have been committed to investigate and presumably prosecute the case. The wheels of justice have begun to turn. Under our system of laws, that's what should happen, and no one that matters is saying it shouldn't.\n\nYet that doesn't seem enough. People are angry. Of course, if somehow the accused officer escapes punishment as defendants, even guilty ones, sometimes do in our system, we will not want to hear a legal rationale or a chin-stroking reference to \"better that 10 guilty men go free, than blah blah blah ... \" But even presuming a state or federal conviction, I doubt that many of us will have the feeling that \"the system worked.\"\n\nGeorge Floyd will still be dead.\n\nFor almost 20 years, since the time I began a rewarding and brief two-year portion of my varied legal career serving as a senior official in the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, I have followed with interest high-profile instances of alleged police misconduct. On one occasion, in 2002, I went to Inglewood, California, for DoJ after a home video showed a black teenager, hands in cuffs, getting his head slammed onto the hood of a cruiser and punched by an officer. The echoes of the Rodney King incident and riots from a decade earlier were audible throughout Los Angeles and the country as CNN played the video seemingly on a loop. The officers involved were fired immediately by the mayor of Inglewood while I was there meeting with him, local prosecutors, and FBI agents. (The mayor's actions that day, right or wrong, probably avoided a riot.)\n\nAs it turns out, an enhanced slow motion review of the video by the FBI showed that the teen, while his hands were cuffed behind his back, grabbed the officer's scrotum and squeezed, precipitating the punch and push to the head until he let go. The officers on the scene (unaware they were being recorded, as this was before the age of the cell-phone camera) called in supervisors to review the use of force and all prepared contemporaneous reports acknowledging what happened. Their stories matched the video of the incident that they didn't know was being filmed. In short, they did what you would want them to after an incident when use of force is necessary-they knew their department policy, called it in to their bosses, and explained it without lying or minimizing. Neither the state nor DoJ brought charges, and if I recall correctly, an arbitrator upheld the officers' union grievances to the firing and they were rehired with back pay after a year or two. Legally, the State of California and DoJ made the right call-the use of force was not criminal, and was likely justified by the circumstances.\n\nThe Inglewood saga is just one example of the fact that, viewed through the lens of the legal standards applied in federal criminal civil rights case for \"willful\" deprivations of constitutional or statutory rights, police misconduct cases must meet a very high bar. Moreover, \"narratives\" that develop around high profile civil rights cases sometimes don't withstand close factual scrutiny. In 2014, I predicted within a week of the Michael Brown incident in Ferguson, Missouri, that no federal charges would be brought, notwithstanding the strength of the \"Hands Up! Don't Shoot\" narrative at that time. Eventually, the Holder Justice Department issued a report going beyond a decision not to charge-it essentially cleared officer Darren Wilson and concluded that his use of force was proper. Similarly, state charges weren't successful and no federal charges were brought in the Freddie Gray case in Baltimore, a case involving a handcuffed Gray allegedly being given a \"rough ride\" in the back of a transport vehicle, which resulted in injuries from which he never recovered.\n\nSo, what do these cases where the officers were cleared have to do with George Floyd, a case where, it seems, the evidence appears cut and dried and some conviction seems likely?\n\nThese cases are instructive because they involve black men. Regardless of the result, they all demonstrate that the issues surrounding how our society, including but not limited to the police, perceive and treat black men, cannot be adequately addressed in the context of the prosecution of an individual case, regardless of the outcome.\n\nIt is not that the charging decision or verdict in a given case doesn't matter-it clearly does. But a civil rights prosecution of an officer asks narrow questions about a snapshot in time: Did the officer, at the time force was used, have a reasonable fear for death or imminent bodily harm to justify it? Did the officer approach the situation intending to deprive the victim of federally protected rights?\n\nApplying these standards, as a lawyer with some familiarity with the relevant law, I can tick through a list of high-profile police misconduct cases that weren't prosecuted, as well as those that were, and find that most reached the \"correct\" result applying existing legal standards. On one very important level, \"the system\" worked in such cases-a criminal prosecution was or was not legally warranted. It is easy under such circumstances to look at unrest or even rioting in minority communities in response to a decision not to charge and wonder: \"What are people complaining about? The legal outcome was correct!\"\n\nBut the answer is simple, if troubling: The law, even applied correctly, doesn't remedy what we know is wrong. We can hope that the George Floyd killing can provide some insight into the feeling of frustration in many minority communities surrounding policing issues, because we can see, or at least sense, the depth of the problem. Assuming the system properly tries and convicts the kneeling officer of some serious offense, will you feel any better about George Floyd's death? I won't. As a lawyer, I can easily analyze the narrow question of whether one officer's conduct was legal. But that analysis is independent of the uncomfortable truth that it is hard to imagine that George Floyd wouldn't be alive if he were white . That truth is one that our society, our culture, all of us, not just our law enforcement officers, must confront. Even if the legal system convicts one officer of one crime, that does not relieve us of our responsibility to confront our country's truth about race. We sense that some responsibility-not legal responsibility, mind you, but something else-rests with all of us when we know, just know , that our society has shaped our law enforcement's view of black men, black men's view of law enforcement, and has further shaped the individuals involved through millions of encounters, presumptions, fears, and interactions that combine to make the nightmare on the video spring to life.\n\nIt is impossible to conclude that even a fully functioning and just legal system that produces the legally correct results can soothe the discomfort felt watching George Floyd stop moving before our eyes. Recognizing that law doesn't contain all the answers should help us understand why, in those instances where that same legal system rightly exonerates the police in the death of a black man, the community where that man grew up doesn't necessarily care as much about the \"correct\" legal answer in terms of use of force policy or federal civil rights law. Whether or not an individual officer is guilty or innocent may provide an answer of sorts, but it's not to the question they are truly asking. The question on their minds is too often \" would this man be dead if he weren't black? \"\n\nOftentimes, we know the answer in our heart, cringe, and then focus on the easier question of legality lest we get too uncomfortable thinking about it.\n\nGeorge Floyd is still dead.\n\nBob Driscoll is chair of the White Collar and Government Investigations Group at McGlinchey in Washington, D.C., and a former deputy assistant attorney general for civil rights with the Department of Justice.\n\nYour membership includes the ability to share articles\n                with friends.

      "text": "What a Decades-Old Experiment Can Teach Us About Derek Chauvin and George Floyd\n\nStanley Milgram discovered that obedience to authority has a powerful hold.\n\nIt has been 60 years since Yale social psychologist Stanley Milgram conducted his famous experiment on obedience to authority, but the trial of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin on multiple criminal charges, including third-degree murder, for the death of George Floyd has given us new reason to look back at Milgram's experiment .\n\nChauvin's trial will determine what, if any, legal responsibility he bears for the death last May 25 of Floyd. Milgram's experiment leads us to a more difficult question: How was a single police officer, Derek Chauvin, able to kneel on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes without being effectively challenged by the other police officers on the scene?\n\nMilgram began his experiment in July 1961, the same month that the trial in Jerusalem of Adolf Eichmann, a high-ranking Nazi official who played a key role in transporting Jews to German extermination camps, started. Milgram's experiment was designed to show how willing people were to obey authority even when what was asked of them was cruel. Eichmann's trial dovetailed with Milgram's concerns. The colorless Eichmann's actions were the classic example of what the historian Hannah Arendt in her account of the trial, Eichmann in Jerusalem, called the \"banality of evil,\" and in his 1974 book, Obedience to Authority , Milgram paid tribute to Arendt, noting that the concept of the banality of evil \"comes closer to the truth than one might dare imagine.\"\n\nMilgram's experiment consisted of taking volunteers and dividing them into the roles of teacher and learner. The division was planned so that the volunteer always ended up as teacher, while the learner was a paid participant. The volunteer was instructed by the experimenter to give electric shocks to the learner (a paid participant) for wrong answers. How far would the teacher go in obeying the experimenter was the issue Milgram focused on. The answer was very far-a conclusion consistent with that of subsequent Milgram-like studies.\n\nThe learner was placed in an adjacent room, and as the test progressed was given increasingly large, fake shocks. At 75 volts the learner was instructed to start to scream. From 150 volts to 330 volts the learner was instructed to scream with increasing intensity. After that, the teacher's questions were met by silence. In the end 65 percent of the teachers continued to shock the learner up to the maximum 450 volts.\n\nWhat makes the Milgram experiment especially relevant to Chauvin's trial is the nature of Floyd's death. He was not killed by a panicky policeman firing his gun. Nor was he killed by an angry policeman in a rage. Floyd's death, like Milgram's experiment, played out over time and for that reason has seemed particularly horrifying.\n\nAccording to the official charge statement filed in district court against Chauvin, he had his knee on Floyd's neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, and for 2 minutes and 53 seconds of this time, Floyd was unresponsive. Chauvin and the three other policemen on the scene were not forced into a rushed decision on how to treat the handcuffed Floyd.\n\nIn the case of Chauvin, we will have to wait for his trial to learn more about his thinking during his encounter with Floyd. What is clear from the video of the scene is that Chauvin ignored Floyd's multiple cries of \"I can't breathe,\" just as the teachers in the Milgram experiment ignored the cries of pain from the actors playing the learner. But there is a key additional element at work in Minneapolis, where Chauvin's impact on the other police officers on the scene parallels that of the Milgram experimenters who were able to influence various teachers to ignore the learner's cries of pain.\n\nThe official charge description in the Floyd case points out there was discussion of how to treat Floyd among the police on the scene. When officer Thomas Lane asks Chauvin, \"Should we roll him on his side?\" Chauvin says no, and when Lane then says, \"I am worried about excited delirium or whatever,\" Chauvin again brushes him off, saying, \"That's why we have him on his stomach.\"\n\nAfter this exchange, neither Lane nor two other officers who were present, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao, tried to intervene on Floyd's behalf. Lane was on his fourth day on the force and Keung just his third . Chauvin, a 19-year police veteran, was deferred to as an authority figure rather than regarded as a peer. As the charge description notes, \"None of the three officers moved from their positions.\"\n\nMight Floyd still be alive if the three other policemen on the scene, now charged with aiding and abetting Chauvin, had refused to go along with Chauvin's actions? We can only guess. The Milgram experiment helps us see that in police departments in which racism-covert or overt-exists having police officers willing and able to intervene when racial abuse occurs is crucial. Calls to defund the police don't begin to meet this problem.\n\nIn the widely viewed Darnella Frazier video of George Floyd's final minutes, what stands out is how many in the crowd realize the danger Floyd is in. One man says, \"He's not responsive, bro.\" It is the police who collectively fail to respond to the peril in which they have placed Floyd.\n\nYour membership includes the ability to share articles\n                with friends.

      "text": "Don't Create False Villains To Serve a Greater Good\n\nThe available evidence indicates a Columbus police officer acted with remarkable professionalism and poise.\n\nRarely have we seen more blatant public vitriol and reckless irresponsibility from significant public figures than in the reactions to two separate police-related events that occurred the same day this week. I'm speaking, of course, about the conviction of Derek Chauvin in Minneapolis and the police shooting of Ma'Khia Bryant in Columbus.\n\nFirst, I'd like to say I'm not surprised by much today, but I was taken aback by the rage in some parts of the right at the conviction of Derek Chauvin. Here's Tucker Carlson (the most-watched host in cable news) and Candace Owens (one of the most-followed right-wing personalities on social media) in an appalling extended segment on Fox News:\n\n. @RealCandaceO on Tucker Tonight - Wow pic.twitter.com/oEerVrYNSw\n\n- Benny Johnson (@bennyjohnson) April 21, 2021\n\nTo say, as Owens does, that \"this was not a trial about George Floyd and Derek Chauvin,\" that it was instead a trial about \"whether the media was powerful enough to create a simulation and decide upon a narrative absent any facts,\" is to completely disconnect from reality.\n\nAt trial, the prosecution entered powerful evidence that our eyes did not deceive us-Chauvin departed from proper procedure, he kept Floyd in a dangerous position even when he was not a threat, and the pressure Chauvin and other officers placed on Floyd caused his death. This was evidence the jury heard.\n\nAnd then this moment from Tucker was just strange. The laugh was unprofessional. So was his treatment of respectful disagreement.\n\nTucker Carlson had a complete meltdown tonight in response to a former New York corrections officer who criticized Derek Chauvin for using excessive force on George Floyd. Here's how the interview (abruptly) ended. pic.twitter.com/mBOxrsbhaJ\n\n- Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) April 21, 2021\n\nI could fill an entire newsletter with strange and dangerous reactions from prominent right-wing voices after the Chauvin verdict. The pathologies of right-wing infotainment are one reason why I have so little patience for most of the right's relentless criticism of the mainstream media. Somehow, in all their rage and fury, they've created a competing media ecosystem that's actually worse than the institutions they hate. Take the log out of your own eye.\n\nBut then, over in Ohio, many of the biggest public figures and news outlets in America got busy reminding us exactly why so many in the right feel such deep frustration. They reminded us why it's often accurate to critique left-wing media narratives, especially when it's obvious that those narratives will force people to deny or to ignore the witness of their eyes just as thoroughly as the far-right ignored the witness of their own eyes in the Chauvin trial.\n\nThe police shooting of 15-year-old Ma'Khia Bryant was tragic and deeply, deeply sad. It was also nothing like the police murder of George Floyd. Yet immediately important voices tied the deaths together. For example, here's the ACLU of Ohio:\n\nThe systems that allowed George Floyd to be murdered remain FULLY intact. Moments after we celebrated a win for police accountability in Minneapolis, news broke that @ColumbusPolice murdered a 15 year old Black girl. Her name was Ma'Khia Bryant. Say her name. #BlackLivesMatter pic.twitter.com/tufTaia9lR\n\n- ACLU of Ohio (@acluohio) April 21, 2021\n\nThis is a civil liberties organization rushing to judgment, imposing guilt. Twitter exploded with rumors. Early news reports raised concerns. Did the police actually kill the girl who called for help?\n\nThe Columbus police acted quickly to release body camera footage of the incident. I'm not going to embed it in this newsletter, because it shows the killing of a teenage girl, but you can watch it if you follow the link.\n\nAt the news conference, the interim chief of police stated that they received a 911 call in which a \"female caller\" said that someone was trying to \"stab them\" and \"put their hands on them.\" The key body camera footage shows a roughly 20-second span of time. The officer gets out of his car, and for the first few seconds things seem relatively calm. Then-suddenly-a girl shoves another girl to the ground, a man appears to kick the girl on the ground, and then the camera pivots to the very brief shot of Bryant attempting to stab a girl wearing pink.\n\nThe officer yells \"get down\" multiple times, opens fire, and obviously hits Bryant. She falls to the ground, and the girl in the pink runs away. Only when officers slowed down the video in the press conference was it abundantly clear that Bryant had a knife in her hand and was moving with a stabbing motion.\n\nTo say that this video complicated the ACLU's \"murder\" allegation was an understatement. All at once, the narrative didn't just change. It potentially flipped entirely. The available evidence indicated not only that the cop wasn't a villain, he may be a hero. He may have stopped a murder.\n\nBut that didn't stop a veritable avalanche of downright bizarre and sometimes misleading news coverage and commentary. For example, look at this tweet from Valerie Jarrett, who was a very senior adviser to President Obama:\n\nA Black teenage girl named Ma'Khia Bryant was killed because a police officer immediately decided to shoot her multiple times in order to break up a knife fight. Demand accountability.   Fight for justice. #BlackLivesMatter .\n\n- Valerie Jarrett (@ValerieJarrett) April 21, 2021\n\nThis is surpassing strange. A knife attack isn't some schoolyard scrap. It's attempted murder. Other news outlets kept downplaying or ignoring key facts. The New York Times tweeted (and later deleted) a 30-second video of protesters that completely omitted any mention of the attempted stabbing.\n\nA segment on CNN referred to the girl in the pink, who faced the prospect of imminent, brutal death, merely as \" the girl who was close to Ma'Khia when she was shot .\" No, she was the girl Bryant appeared to be trying to kill. In the same segment, prominent \"antiracism\" scholar/advocate Ibram X. Kendi asks: \"What would have happened\" if the attacker had been rich and white?\n\nKendi chastises Columbus cops for shooting a girl threatening to stab two others: \"What would have happened\" if the attacker had instead been rich and white? pic.twitter.com/60i7NC5BX4\n\n- Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) April 22, 2021\n\nI could go on and on with examples of public figures who ignored or minimized the actual facts of the case to jam the Columbus shooting into the George Floyd/police brutality frame. LeBron James tweeted ( and later deleted ) a picture of the officer who shot Bryant with \"YOU'RE NEXT\" and \"#ACCOUNTABILITY\" in all-caps.\n\nBut then even more video emerged that should solidify our opinion (absent compelling contrary evidence) that the police officer was not only legally justified in shooting Bryant (the minimum standard), but that he also acted with an incredible amount of situational awareness and professionalism.\n\nA wider angle video from across the street captured every key moment, from the instant the officer rolled up, to the fateful three seconds between the first visible violent act and the shooting. Bryant was clearly attacking. The officer was not aggressive in his approach. He was walking slowly and calmly. His gun didn't even come out of its holster until Bryant lunged at her apparent intended victim.\n\nWhy do I go beyond saying that it appears the officer acted with an incredible amount of situational awareness and professionalism? Simple. In a span of mere seconds, he not only identified a deadly threat in progress, he also fired his handgun precisely, hitting only his intended target, quite possibly saving the life of the girl in her grasp.\n\nAll of that is hard to do. Very hard. He chose the best of bad options and saved a life.\n\nNo, he did not have time to rush up and grab Bryant before Bryant could plunge the knife into her victim. Had he tried to grapple Bryant, the victim and likely the officer could have been stabbed multiple times.\n\nNo, he shouldn't have tried to use a taser. Tasers often fail, and failure is the last thing you need when an innocent life may be ending right in front of your eyes.\n\nNo, he shouldn't have \"aimed for the leg.\" That's a movie move. Officers (and soldiers) are taught to shoot for center mass in part because legs are hard to hit, and hitting center mass is most likely to bring down your target.\n\nEven hitting center mass, by the way, can be a challenge. People who are unfamiliar with guns often have no idea how hard it is to shoot a handgun accurately, especially under extreme stress. Police frequently hit bystanders when they open fire. In 2012, a volley of fire from two New York police officers hit nine bystanders , despite the fact that they reportedly opened fire from a distance less than ten feet from their target.\n\nNo, he shouldn't have fired just one shot, waited to see its effect, then fired another. When a person is less than a second away from being stabbed, you don't have time to shoot/wait/shoot/wait. You shoot until the threat is over. Any other choice unacceptably risks the life of the potential murder victim.\n\nYes, all this sounds quite brutal. It is, and it's terrible. But stabbings are unspeakably brutal as well, and we would be rightly outraged if an incompetent officer allowed a girl to kill another girl when he possessed the power to stop the crime.\n\nSo given all the realities above, I'll do my best to answer Kendi's question. What would happen if a rich white girl was trying to stab another girl to death? I hope the exact same thing. I hope the officer would be as aware to spot the knife, as decisive, and as accurate as the officer who opened fire. He did his job. He deserves thanks, not to have his face displayed from coast to coast online as some kind of villain.\n\nReaders know that I wrote frequently about the need for police reform. There is too much police brutality in the United States of America. There are too many police shootings. But it is simply wrong to try to force every police shooting into the same narrative. It is very wrong to treat cops who stop murders the same as we treat cops who commit murders. And there is no better way to harm the cause of justice than by treating an innocent man as guilty for the sake of an alleged greater good.\n\nOne more thing ...\n\nLike when Steve Jobs invented the iPad and provided the product you didn't know you needed, one of my jobs is to provide you with content you didn't know you craved. What do you know about the (relatively) nearby supermassive star Betelgeuse? Not enough, it turns out. Let's fix that problem:\n\nDavid French is a columnist for the New York Times.

      "text": "Fact Checking Black Lives Matter's Statement About Ma'Khia Bryant's Death\n\nA press release from the group makes claims that have not been proven and leaves out relevant facts about the event.\n\nThe Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation released a statement on April 23 in response to the death of Ma'Khia Bryant. The website states: \"Ma'Khia Bryant called the police for help. Columbus police officer Nicholas Reardon showed up and shot this 16-year-old child point blank within a matter of seconds.\"\n\nFamily members of Bryant have said she placed the call herself, but as USA Today noted , \"Columbus officials have not yet clarified several details of the case, including whether Bryant made the 911 call.\" Other news outlets have also reported that the identity of the caller has not been established, and Glenn McEntyre, the assistant director of the Columbus Department of Public Safety, told The Dispatch Fact Check that the department did not know who had placed the phone call. \"The caller did not give a name,\" said McEntyre. McEntyre noted that the investigation was being handled by the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation, which is housed in the Ohio Department of Justice. Press secretary for the Ohio attorney general's office Steven Irwin said in an email to The Dispatch Fact Check : \"I do not have any additional information to share regarding BCI's investigation in this case, which remains active and ongoing.\"\n\nThe Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation's brief description of Bryant's death also leaves out some important context: Police arrived on the scene where an altercation was already taking place. Body camera footage appears to show that Bryant pushed one person to the ground and was swinging a knife at another young woman when Reardon fired his weapon.\n\nThe investigation into this shooting is ongoing. But the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation leaves out relevant facts and context in its representation of events.\n\nThe Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com .

      "text": "The Awful Realities of the Breonna Taylor Case\n\nThe grand jury's decision might have been proper, but the laws that led the police to violently enter her home and confront her armed boyfriend are unjust.\n\nYesterday a grand jury in Kentucky refused to charge the officers who killed Breonna Taylor. This result was both lawful and deeply unjust. Let me explain why.\n\nIn August, I wrote an extended newsletter called \" Supreme Court Precedent Killed Breonna Taylor .\" It was a bold headline and a bold claim, but both were justified. The court's precedent had created the legal cover for police tactics that placed police and lawfully armed citizens on a violent collision course-one that has resulted in tragic deaths before, and (unless the law is changed) will result in tragic deaths again.\n\nI don't want to rehash the entire argument, but the essence is this: In a series of opinions reaching back more than two decades, the Supreme Court has permitted the use of no-knock police raids not just to preserve life, but also to preserve evidence . It has also granted officers specific legal privileges even when they've violated citizens' constitutional rights, including, a) exemptions from the exclusionary rule (which blocks the use of unlawfully obtained evidence in criminal trials) for raids that violate knock-and-announce requirements and, b) exemptions from attempts to impose heightened obligations for the use of force when officers are violating the Fourth Amendment by unlawfully intruding in a citizen's own home.\n\nPolice departments across the country have taken advantage of this wide latitude. They've sought no-knock warrants liberally. They've blurred the line between no-knock and knock-and-announce with \"quick knock\" practices. And they've engaged in surprise, late-night violent entries into private dwellings for the sole purpose of preserving evidence.\n\nNow, let's compare this line of precedent with a different series of laws, including a key SCOTUS case. In District of Columbia v. Heller , the court held that citizens have an individual constitutional right to keep a handgun in their home for their personal defense. Other states, including Kentucky , go farther and have enacted laws recognizing the so-called \"castle doctrine\" and stand-your-ground laws. At the risk of oversimplifying these doctrines, they in general hold that a person does not have a duty to retreat when he is lawfully present in a place and he reasonably believes he faces an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm.\n\nTo be clear, castle doctrine statutes often explicitly state that individuals do not have the right to shoot police officers who attempt to enter a dwelling in the pursuit of their official duties, but there's a caveat-the person prohibited from \"using force\" must know or \"reasonably should have known\" that the person entering was a cop.\n\nDo you see how these doctrines create virtually inevitable armed clashes? In the darkness and confusion of a violent entry, a homeowner may not know who is charging straight into his house. If he can't reasonably and immediately (we're talking about mere seconds at issue) know that he's facing police officers executing a warrant, he has a right under the law to open fire.\n\nAt the same time, when the police are performing their official duties-even if they're at the wrong house or even if the warrant itself is unlawful-they also have the right to open fire if they reasonably perceive a mortal threat. Thus, a gun battle can commence with both parties acting completely lawfully .\n\nIs this what happened in Breonna Taylor's case? It appears so.\n\nThanks to extraordinary reporting from the New York Times's Rukmini Callimachi , we now have a much better picture of what happened on the terrible, fatal early morning hours of March 13, 2020. Let's break down the key elements step-by-step.\n\n1. The police obtained a no-knock warrant to raid Taylor's apartment based on allegations thata suspected drug dealer named Jamarcus Glover had received packages at Taylor's home (Glover and Taylor had a previous relationship). The police sought the no-knock warrant out of a desire to preserve evidence.\n\n2. Before the warrant was served, the police were directed to knock and announce rather than execute the warrant without knocking. At approximately 12:40 a.m. on March 13, the police pounded on Taylor's door. Taylor was inside with her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker. He lawfully possessed a handgun.\n\n3. At this point the facts are in dispute. Police claim that they knocked and announced they were police. A witness corroborates this account, but other witnesses dispute it, claiming they never heard the cops identify themselves. Walker claims that he was startled by the pounding, asked who was there, never heard a response, and was worried that it might be Glover. So he grabbed his gun.\n\n4. The police then broke down the door to enter the apartment. Walker and Taylor saw them in the darkness, and Walker fired a single shot, striking one officer in the leg, severing his femoral artery and gravely injuring him. Under the available evidence (Walker hadn't heard the police identify themselves and unknown individuals were violently entering his home), Walker had a legal right to shoot at the intruders, even if they were police .\n\n5. At the same time, the instant the officers saw that Walker was pointing his gun at them-and certainly when he pulled the trigger- they had their own legal right to shoot back . They were performing their official duties, and an armed man was quite plainly placing them in immediate, mortal danger.\n\n6. They did not, however, have the right to use indiscriminate force. Two officers fired directly at Walker. They hit Taylor, who was standing nearby. But given the proximity of Taylor to Walker, it would be virtually impossible to prove that the officers' startled response-aimed directly at the perceived threat-was reckless enough to be criminal.\n\n7. There was, however, a third police officer who fired, and he fired his weapon irresponsibly. The grand jury properly indicted former detective Brent Hankison for \"wanton endangerment.\" I say \"former\" because the Louisville Metro Police Department had already fired him for showing \"extreme indifference to the value of human life.\"\n\nAs the New York Times reported, \"Hankison fired into the sliding glass patio door and window of Ms. Taylor's apartment building, both of which were covered with blinds, in violation of a department policy that requires officers to have a line of sight. Some of the bullets entered a nearby apartment where a pregnant woman, her husband and their 5-year-old child were asleep.\"\n\nAt his news conference explaining the grand jury's decision, Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron declared that \"Justice is not often easy.\" He said it \"does not fit the mold of public opinion, and it does not conform to shifting standards.\"\n\nThis is certainly correct, but it's incomplete. The grand jury's decision was proper, but the laws that led the police to violently enter Taylor's home and confront her armed boyfriend in the middle of the night are unjust. The practices of the Louisville police department capitalizing on those laws are also unjust. The Washington Post's Radley Balko has done indispensable work following this case, and these three paragraphs from his most recent piece simply sting:\n\nThe most serious questions here concern the investigation itself, and why these officers were asked to serve a warrant on Taylor's home in the first place. ... There is the fact that despite the surveillance on Taylor's home, the police didn't know there was another person inside. There are the police bullets that were inadvertently fired into surrounding apartments. There's the cut-and-paste language used to secure the no-knock portion of the warrant. There's also the fact that the officer who procured the warrant was not part of the raid team. There's the fact that five officers involved in the Taylor raid were involved in another violent, botched raid on an innocent family in 2018.\n\nAnd there's the 2015 study by criminologist Bryan Patrick Schaefer, who was allowed to embed himself with the Louisville police department. As Schaffer [sic] wrote, \"Of the 73 search warrant entries observed, every entry involved using a ram to break the door down. Further, the detectives announce their presence and purpose in conjunction with the first hit on the door. A detective explained, 'As long as we announce our presence, we are good. We don't want to give them any time to destroy evidence or grab a weapon, so we go fast and get through the door quick.'\"\n\nSchaefer added that in the raids he observed, the difference between how police served a no-knock warrant and a knock-and-announce warrant was \"minimal in practice.\"\n\nIn the contest between the rights of a woman to sleep peacefully in her own home and for her boyfriend to defend it against violent entry and the right of the state to make a violent entry, the law should prefer the homeowner. No, that doesn't mean removing from police the ability to defend themselves. It means dramatically restricting their ability to make a violent entry in the first instance. It means revitalizing the Fourth Amendment, and reviving its importance in our constitutional republic. \"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\"\n\nYesterday, the grand jury correctly applied the law to the facts, and its decision not to charge the officers who fired the fatal shots was almost certainly correct. But Breonna Taylor's death was still deeply unjust, and the injustices will continue until the law is reformed.\n\nOne last thing ...\n\nYesterday I had a great time recording our first Advisory Opinions Live with my brilliant co-host, Sarah Isgur.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez described her experiences during the storming of the Capitol on January 6. Ocasio-Cortez's description of her evacuation led some to believe that rioters broke into her office while she was in there:\n\n. @AOC just said on her insta live that rioters broke into her office during the insurrection. this is honestly bone chilling. pic.twitter.com/7LR33uIliu\n\n- hannah 🍅 (@hannahcroteau) February 2, 2021\n\n. @AOC describes her thoughts about dying as she hid from a domestic terrorist who had breached her office and was screaming, \"Where is she?

Where is she?' And I just thought to myself, 'they got inside.' ... And this was the moment where I thought everything was over. I mean I thought I was going to die. ... I look through this door hinge and I see this white man in a black beanie just open the door of my personal office and come inside the personal office and yell again 'where is she?'\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez went on to explain that her aide called her out to let her know it was safe, and that the man looking for her was, in fact, a Capitol Police officer there to evacuate her from the building.\n\nWhile some of those who went viral sharing this claim on Twitter later corrected the record, such as Croteau and Moynihan, such corrections received only a fraction of the likes and retweets that the original posts received. That the man was a police officer got lost in some of the news coverage of Ocasio-Cortez's story as well: Social media posts left out that context, potentially misleading readers, and in some instances, news coverage of Ocasio-Cortez's video did not clearly state that the man trying to enter Ocasio-Cortez's office and the police officer she saw upon exiting were the same person. Newsweek 's article on the matter stated that \"Ocasio-Cortez said that rioters actually entered her office\" and that \"members of the mob banged against the door.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez's comments were also misrepresented by some who suggested that she lied about being present in the Capitol during the attack, as her office is in the Cannon Building-an office building used by members of Congress-meaning she wasn't in the Capitol building itself. In fact, Ocasio-Cortez explicitly explained that her office was not in the Capitol in her livestream, saying : \"There's the Capitol Hill complex, but members of Congress except for, you know, the speaker and other very, very high ranking ones don't actually work in the building with the dome. There's buildings like right next to the dome, and that's where our actual offices are.\"\n\nAs Ocasio-Cortez indicated, the Cannon Building is part of the larger Capitol complex and is connected to the Capitol through a tunnel. The Cannon Building was evacuated on January 6 because of fears that the riot would overtake it.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Ocasio-Cortez described the Capitol police officer who came into her office as looking at her with \"a tremendous amount of rage and hostility.\" She said that after the fact her legislative director agreed with her that he wasn't sure if the officer \"was there to help us or hurt us.\" Her claims on the matter are unverified, with no evidence to suggest that the officer who evacuated her was aligned with the rioters.\n\nWhile Ocasio-Cortez described fearing that those banging on her door looking for her were rioters, she explained in the same video that such was not actually the case. She also explained that she was not in the Capitol building.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com .

      "text": "Fact Checking Vivek Ramaswamy's Claims About January 6 Defendants\n\nNo, peaceful protesters are not being 'imprisoned without bail.'\n\nLast week, Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy posted a tweet claiming the United States has a \"two-tiered\" justice system. \"Antifa & BLM rioters roam free while peaceful January 6 protesters are imprisoned without bail,\" he wrote. \"Biden's 'Department of Injustice' has executed over 1,000 arrests for nonviolent offenses related to January 6.\" He vowed that as president, he would pardon \"targets of politicized federal prosecutions & those denied due process.\"\n\nAmerica now has a two-tiered justice system: Antifa & BLM rioters roam free while peaceful January 6 protesters are imprisoned without bail. Biden's \"Department of Injustice\" has executed over 1,000 arrests for nonviolent offenses related to January 6, casting a dark shadow over...\n\n- Vivek Ramaswamy (@VivekGRamaswamy) September 6, 2023\n\nThe claim that peaceful January 6 protesters have been held without bail, which has become widespread in some quarters of the right, is false.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, as of September 7, 2023, more than 1,146 individuals have been arrested in connection with the Capitol riot in nearly all 50 states, including 398 charged with assaulting or impeding a law enforcement officer. Details and documentation for every arrest made thus far are publically available on the Department of Justice website . According to NPR-which has been separately tracking every criminal case related to the storming of the Capitol-632 of the arrestees have been sentenced thus far, 64 percent of whom have received prison time, and the median sentence has been 120 days.\n\nWhile it is true that some arrestees have been held without bail, this is only the case for those defendants who have been deemed to be at high risk of obstructing justice, a danger to the community, or a flight risk. \"It's just the ones who are accused of violent crimes that are being held without bond,\" Gabriel Malor, a Virginia-based appellate lawyer told The Dispatch . \"Even some of the ones actually accused of violent crimes are being let out, usually with an ankle monitor.\" Richard Barnett , for example, was found guilty on eight counts in January 2023, including taking a dangerous weapon into the Capitol and interfering with a police officer-and was ordered to wear an ankle monitor and serve home detention while awaiting his trial date. Others, like Kyle Fitzsimons -a Maine native who assaulted law enforcement officers at the Capitol, forcing one to take medical retirement from a partially torn rotator cuff and labrum-were denied bail. Fitzsimons, who was identified as being a danger to the community and flight risk by a federal judge, was sentenced in July to 87 months in prison on 11 charges, including seven felonies. When reached for comment, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia was unable to give The Dispatch a precise breakdown of charges or the total number of detainees held without bail-but the number is far fewer than 1,000.\n\nGOP Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado responded to additional false statements surrounding January 6 detainees in a recent letter to Todd Watkins, the vice chairman of the El Paso County Republican Party. \"Of those still held in custody, 85% are charged with assaulting a law enforcement officer, a felony,\" Buck wrote. \"The remainder are charged with conspiracy or possession of a deadly weapon on Capitol grounds, also felonies.\" According to the letter, none of those being held currently or at any point were accused of nonviolent misdemeanor crimes. \"All defendants held without bond at any point were charged with felonies,\" Buck emphasized.\n\nBecause defendants are facing federal charges stemming from actions taken within the District of Columbia, those not offered bail and still awaiting trial are held in the D.C. Central Detention Facility (CDF). A bipartisan congressional delegation toured the wing where detainees continue to be housed in March 2023, after which some Republicans, such as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, claimed that defendants weren't receiving access to some of the educational and recreational services provided to other inmates and were being held for too long. On the contrary, some Democrats on the tour argued that defendants were receiving uniquely favorable conditions compared to other inmates. The CDF has long received criticism for poor conditions, and an inspection carried out by the U.S. Marshals Service in November 2021-which was completed after complaints were raised by the lawyers of a number of January 6 defendants-determined that there was evidence of \"systemic failures\" at the facility including the punitive withholding of food, widespread drug use among detainees, and inconsistent access to water.\n\nRamaswamy's claim that \"Antifa and BLM rioters roam free\" is also largely untrue. More than 10,000 protesters were arrested nationwide during the unrest following the death of George Floyd in the summer of 2020, though most for low-level offenses like violation of curfew and failure to disperse. Some, however, such as the two young lawyers who torched a police vehicle in Brooklyn, were sentenced to time in prison for their actions, and hundreds were arrested on burglary, looting, and assault charges.\n\nA spokesperson for the Ramaswamy campaign refused to offer clarification or comment when asked about the candidate's tweet by The Dispatch.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com .

      "text": "Autocrat-Immunity Disease\n\nThat we're having a conversation about presidential immunity from criminal acts is insane.\n\nI take a relatively narrow view of legitimate government power. Some of you will disagree, but indulge me for a moment.\n\nYou know those videos that go around about once a year in which some jackass police officer from San Bernardino or some comparable hellmouth pulls over an unoffending motorist (disproportionately young women) and then laughingly presents the obviously terrified driver with a Thanksgiving turkey or a Best Buy gift card or something like that? I think every one of those guys should be fired-and where there is a law to prosecute them under, they should go to jail. These pranks are a grotesque abuse of police power, subjecting innocent people to stress, anxiety, and serious physical danger (traffic stops increase the risk of being involved in a wreck) because some gormless state functionary is bored and decides that his life will never have any meaning until he stars in a viral video on YouTube.\n\nIf the police in Springfield, Missouri, wanted to hand out turkeys to little old ladies, they could walk into any bingo hall or strip-mall parking lot and do it. But that wouldn't be a very good video, would it? Why? Because the entertaining part is the fear and anxiety inflicted on people who already are suffering the indignity of living in Springfield, Missouri. Getting pulled over by the police is an involuntary detention, i.e., the mildest form of arrest. And before all you lawyers out there fire up your emails, I don't care how fine you want to cut it: If you can't say \"Go f-k yourself, ossifer\" and drive off without getting shot and/or put in jail, then you're under arrest, whatever the lawyers call it. For a normal person, that's extremely stressful-and if you are the kind of guy who is willing to use his badge and gun to subject someone to that kind of stress in a quest for social-media likes and giggles, then you shouldn't have a badge or a gun. The eternal problem with police work is that the kind of people who have the capacity to use violence when doing so is legitimate and necessary live in a Venn diagram circle with a great big overlap with the world of vicious bullies with mental problems. That's why so many cops are criminals .\n\nThat's a relatively petty example. Let's look at another one where I was in the minority.\n\nAs I wrote at the time , I believe Barack Obama should have been impeached and removed from office for-and let's not polish it up too much-murdering an American for political reasons. The American in question, Anwar al-Awlaki, was an absolute heap of garbage, a jihad apologist who became known as \"the Osama bin Laden of Facebook.\" And here, I'd like to emphasize the final two words in that epithet: of Facebook . Not the Osama bin Laden of Tora Bora or Nairobi or Dar es Salaam, but the Osama bin Laden ... of Facebook . He was an al-Qaeda apologist and recruiter who was no doubt guilty of a whole raft of crimes for which he was never tried on account of his being a smoking cinder. He could have been captured and put on trial, if he hadn't been blown up. Alternatively, he could have been killed in combat-in Afghanistan or somewhere else-and you wouldn't have heard any complaints from little ol' me. My libertarian heart would have been content.\n\nBut he wasn't killed in combat, because he was ... the Osama bin Laden of Facebook . He didn't die on some battlefield in Afghanistan. He was killed in Yemen, on his way to breakfast, in an operation that targeted him, specifically, for being the Osama bin Laden of Facebook, i.e., a wretched propagandist and troll and an advocate of evil things. The Obama administration would attempt to ret-con the homicide and insist after the fact that he had gone \"operational,\" whatever that means in this context, which is approximately squat. Al-Awlaki's beliefs were reprehensible. But there are lots of people out there with reprehensible political views, and nobody is planning a drone strike on the Claremont Institute or on Steve Bannon's favorite bar, or whatever cuckold-fetish sex dungeon full of \" exceptional, muscular well-hung single men \" Roger Stone is swanning around in these days.\n\nThe Obama administration wasn't shamefaced about assassinating an American political dissident-and it wasn't exactly a covert operation: They bragged about maintaining a \"kill list\" to the New York Times . Anwar al-Awlaki was Barack Obama's answer to Ricky Ray Rector, the brain-damaged guy whose execution Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas oversaw with unseemly gusto (seriously, Slick Willie did everything short of hiring a marching band to play \"The Washington Post March \") in order to burnish his tough-guy credentials prior to running for president. (Rector, who had shot himself in the head after committing one murder and several other shootings, was so brain-scrambled that he left the pecan pie he was served at his last meal on the tray, telling guards he was \"saving it for later\" as he was led off to the death chamber. Just straight-up, high-grade pathos.) But, hey-they got the Osama bin Laden of Facebook ! Eventually, they got the real Osama bin Laden, too, and no tears were shed. But repulsive cretin that he was, Anwar al-Awlaki was a U.S. citizen, killed by the U.S. government, having been targeted for things he had said and written. Citizenship is supposed to mean something in these United States.\n\nI threw a fit about the al-Awlaki assassination at the time, and my fit caught the attention of, among others, Sen. Rand Paul, who read some of my columns into the congressional record while staging a 13-hour filibuster of John Brennan's nomination to run the CIA, demanding that the Obama administration at least forswear conducting drone attacks on U.S. citizens inside the United States (as though they stopped being U.S. citizens when abroad). This was a pretty modest ask, to be sure, but that's a libertarian for you.\n\nA fair-weather libertarian, at that. A very strange thing has happened to Sen. Paul. When Donald Trump's lawyers went to court to argue that the president could order SEAL Team 6 (everybody loves writing and saying \"SEAL Team 6\"!) to assassinate a rival presidential candidate and then remain immune from criminal charges unless impeached and removed from office, Sen. Paul developed an acute case of sudden-onset mushmouth, answering : \"It's a very specific legal argument, and I'm afraid I'm just not up on it enough to be able to comment.\" For context, Trump's current claim is that the president can do literally anything he wants without facing criminal charges . How far we have come from knocking off the Osama bin Laden of Facebook!\n\nAll of this is, of course, insane.\n\nAfter hearing Sarah Isgur talk about typefaces on a recent podcast, I now know how she feels when she reads my writing about legal issues. I am sure there are all sorts of cocktails-at-Harvard-Law nuances and good points and important technical questions and such that I am here going to run roughshod over, but-this conversation is insane . The job of the president-his office-is to \"faithfully execute the laws of the United States.\" By definition, crimes cannot be legitimate official acts-acts of office-for the president, or for anybody else in government. There isn't a damn thing in the law or in our Constitution providing blanket criminal immunity to presidents for crimes committed in office. We have a prudential convention holding that sitting presidents shouldn't be indicted, for practical reasons, based on a Richard Nixon-era (ho, ho!) Justice Department opinion. The Constitution, which does confer certain privileges and immunities on members of Congress, does not confer these on the president. In fact, the Constitutional Convention considered the question and declined to extend any privileges to the president save the guarantee of his salary. You can read all about the legal and constitutional issues in full in Saikrishna Prakash's very interesting paper , but consider this:\n\nAny interpretation of the Constitution that demands impeachment and removal before arrest and prosecution of a President makes it possible for a chief executive to continue to violate the law, including criminal laws, and to continue to subvert the Constitution. The arrest of a sitting President serves two distinct purposes: to ensure presence at trial and to incapacitate someone who might commit further crimes and constitutional wrongs. Of course, incapacitation is impossible if the criminal justice system must await a protracted House impeachment and Senate trial that might never occur or, worse yet, might result in an acquittal of someone guilty of crimes but not impeachable offenses.\n\nIn fact, we had a president arrested while in office, long before anybody was thinking about immunity for Donald Trump: Ulysses S. Grant (talk about \"Hyperion to a satyr\"!) was arrested by a Washington policeman for habitually speeding in his buggy after having been previously issued a warning by the same officer. President Grant didn't claim immunity-he commended the officer for doing his job and enforcing the law, no matter who the offender is. President Grant, as you students of history will know, had some serious stuff to deal with during his administration. And he was the general who had saved the Union, not some two-bit gameshow host and quondam pornographer. The Grant episode was a small thing, but it was a small thing that illustrates one of the big things.\n\nCertain conservative lawyers, including my friend Andrew C. McCarthy, have spent years building an imperial model of the presidency that puts the chief executive effectively above the law. I've discussed this at some length with Andy, though not recently, and his argument is, put simply, that the president personifies a branch of government, and that separation of powers prevents one branch from exercising dominion over another, meaning that, as a practical matter, the only cures for a lawless president are impeachments and elections. I think that argument is bonkers-and I have great respect for Andy-but, even if it weren't bonkers, it would be an argument that applied to sitting presidents. Even Andrew McCarthy concedes that there is no question that presidents can be criminally prosecuted for private conduct, advising only that there may be ambiguities in distinguishing private from official acts. Where there is less ambiguity is in Trump's demand for \"total immunity,\" which Andy describes in a recent column as \"provocatively wrong and dumb.\"\n\nDonald Trump does not personify a branch of government today-he does not personify anything other than cowardice, venality, and bad taste. That supposed libertarians such as Sen. Paul can be so easily buffaloed into accepting his \" infinite crimes \" model not only of the presidency but also of the post-presidency is a reminder of how easy it is to morally corrupt such a figure-a reminder that weak men are not only contemptible but dangerous . Consider that Sen. Paul's partner in that filibuster, Sen. Ted Cruz, described Donald Trump as a \"sniveling coward\" and characterized him as utterly unfit for the office-and has just endorsed Trump for president, again, calling on Republicans to unite behind him. Trump, for his part, recently was quoted in the New York Times saying that Ted Cruz \" shouldn't even exist .\" But after a guy has called your wife ugly and your father a murderer and you still can't get on your knees for him fast enough, where else is there to sink? Oh, don't worry-if there is a lower place to sink, Ted Cruz will find it. You know that one guy who supposedly slunk away from the Alamo after Col. Travis drew his famous line in the sand? That's Ted Cruz.\n\nWhen Trump boasted that he could murder someone on Fifth Avenue in broad daylight and not lose any support, everybody thought he was just talking about the rubes up in the cheap seats. Turns out there are cheap seats in the Senate, too, and rubes to fill them. I wouldn't have thought, watching that Obama-era filibuster, that such figures as Sen. Paul and Sen. Cruz would turn out to be leading enablers of tyranny in the United States. I would have expected them to err on the other side, if anything. But man is a fallen creature, and these two apparently have fallen from a considerable height and landed on their heads, not that they've used the atrophied organs within their thick skulls in the better part of a decade or so, if not longer.\n\nThe question of blanket criminal immunity for such a figure as Donald Trump is rooted in a few different things: One is a persistent misunderstanding of the respective roles and status of the president and Congress in our constitutional order; another is the servile character of such men as Cruz and Paul and others of their ilk, whose main political position is supine; a third is failure to understand that in The Tragedy of Julius Caesar , the hero is Brutus, whose great failure was in disposing of Caesar but letting Caesarism live. We don't want assassins for the problems we currently face-but we do want a few men and women, maybe even senators, with enough guts and self-respect to say in plain English what needs to be said.\n\nSunday marked the 100th anniversary of the death of Vladimir Lenin, who has as much of a claim to having been the great monster of the 20th century as Adolf Hitler did. I have often remarked that a telling episode in Lenin's life is that in the early stages of the revolution, some of his more liberal-minded colleagues proposed abolishing capital punishment. Lenin spat at the idea: \"You cannot make a revolution without executions,\" he said. On another occasion, Lenin remarked: \"We shall return to terror and to economic terror.\" And so he did.\n\nI wonder if we have learned anything in the century since his death? A. Kursky, a leading Soviet economist and champion of central planning , wrote, with great hubris, in 1949: \"The fact that the socialist national economy is planned precludes the possibility of crisis, unemployment, and economic upheavals.\" Everything, as Kursky and fellow apostles saw it, could be incorporated into the plan and thereby controlled. \"The state ... utilises economic categories like value, money, price, wages, and credit. The role and significance of these categories in Soviet economy differ [in] principle, however, from what they are under capitalism. In the Soviet system of economy they are used as instruments for planning the Socialist national economy.\"\n\nIronically, socialist notions about central planning drew heavily from what had once been cutting-edge capitalist thinking, particularly the late-19th-century mania for \"scientific management\" associated with Frederick Winslow Taylor. (I have long thought it both ironic and telling that one of the great and thoughtful libertarian advocates of our time, Charles Koch, should echo these ideas, perhaps unintentionally, calling his big businessthink book The Science of Success . ) Science-not understood as entirely distinct from engineering-enjoyed tremendous prestige in the late 19th century when Taylorism took off, and it is not hard to see why-consider the practical advances of the century: the first steam locomotive, Erie Canal, first electric motor, first telegraph, first isolation of aluminum, invention of Bessemer process for steel manufacturing, the opening of the London underground, the opening of the first petroleum refinery, the first audio recording, completion of the transcontinental railroad, first commercial typewriter, Edison, Tesla, Maxim, Singer, Benz, Marconi, X-rays.\n\nThe notion that scientific principles could solve any practical problem seemed, at the time, self-evident. First, you rationally plan discrete industrial actions, then you rationally plan the whole factory based on those rational foundations, and then you achieve the dream of rationally planning the entirety of society as though it were one big, scientifically managed factory-the dream not only of communists but also of fascists and of many liberal capitalists of a progressive bent, who foresaw a day in which rationally administered monopolies would do away with what all the smart businessmen used to call \"destructive competition,\" replication of effort, redundancy, etc., along with redirected all of the resources wasted on irrational projects such as marketing and advertising. You can still hear echoes of that kind of thinking when Bernie Sanders complains, \"You don't necessarily need a choice of 23 underarm spray deodorants or of 18 different pairs of sneakers when children are hungry in this country.\"\n\nThe problem, of course, is information. You don't actually have a Laplace's Demon to run the economy. The great insight of F.A. Hayek and Ludwig von Mises and the rest of the Austrian school is that information cannot be aggregated and stockpiled like gravel or canned peas-it is a lively, active, slippery, and often short-lived commodity, and it is dispersed throughout society, residing here and there in every household, firm, and shop, unavailable for use \"as instruments for planning the Socialist national economy.\"\n\nFor a long time, the Soviets believed that solving the planning problem was a matter of technology-that you needed a kind of meta-Taylorism to enable your Taylorism. And the Soviet government for a time invested in some interesting and far-sighted projects related to computer science and information technology, believing that the problem was the means rather than the end, that the problem was one of execution rather than one of conception. The socialists and their admirers thought they were getting rational planning-what they got was \"terror and economic terror.\"\n\nWe haven't yet reverted to economic terror, but we have inflicted a lot of needless stupidity on ourselves. Every time somebody tells you that we're going to use this or that tariff to \"create jobs\" and that this or that subsidy will have such miraculous economic effects that it will-all together now!-\"pay for itself,\" the corners of Lenin's death-rictus move one angstrom up in the direction of a smile.\n\nNew York Times headline: \" Frozen Iowa Is Set to Vote as G.O.P. Presidential Contest Gets Underway .\" Something that is in progress is under way ; an underway is the complement to an overpass , a means of passing underneath a street or railroad track, usually meant for pedestrians. Yes, I've mentioned this before-and will again, until it sinks in.\n\nOne additional thing worth noting about the U.S. Grant story related above: At the time of President Grant's arrest for being a menace on the public roads, Washington had something you didn't see in very many American cities: black police. And President Grant was indeed arrested by one of these, William H. West, a former slave and Civil War veteran (Company K, 30th United States Colored Infantry) who had been on the police force only a year. Unlike a few of our contemporaries, Officer West apparently had a notion in his head that he should be \"dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\"\n\nYou can buy my most recent book, Big White Ghetto , here .\n\nYou can buy my other books here .\n\nYou can see my New York Post columns here .\n\nPlease subscribe to The Dispatch if you haven't.\n\nYou can check out \"How the World Works,\" a series of interviews on work I'm doing for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, here .

Not that it was anything other than the team's usual excellent work-but I found the section on No Labels depressing. I have friends who are involved in No Labels, and I think their hearts are in the right places and that, in many ways, their vision is the right one. But the notion that their critics, excitable and daft as they are, might be involved in some kind of legally actionable conspiracy against them is meretricious.\n\nBut the critics here are even worse, of course: Jonathan V. Last, whom I like and admire, is quoted saying \"anybody who participates in this No Labels malarkey should have their lives ruined.\" Lives ruined? That is not a sensible or healthy way to think about political disagreement-in this case, honest and good-faith disagreement. Other people said even more indefensible things. If you think that people who disagree with you politically need to have their lives ruined, then you are on a road that leads to nowhere good, and it is one that I, for my part, will not follow you down. And, of course, the tragedy of it is that this kind of thinking and approach leads to precisely the kind of politics that I assume decent and well-intentioned people would like to avoid.\n\nAs a purely practical matter, mob politics is not obviously the most attractive model for a mob that's small enough to fit into the bar at Café Milano.\n\nKevin D.

Anthony Rupp III, a civil rights attorney, called out \"Turn on your lights, a------\" to Officer Todd McAlister in December 2016 after he and his wife saw the officer \"rapidly approach\" with no running lights on and nearly hit two women crossing the street, according to his initial lawsuit filed in March 2021.\n\nA decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals last week reversed an earlier ruling by a Buffalo U.S. district judge who had dismissed Rupp's case. Rupp's statement, however profane, could be considered an \"eminently reasonable\" effort to prevent an accident, the higher court ruled.\n\n'SPEED RACER' ACTOR'S $1M ESTATE TIED UP IN COURT AFTER HE DIED IN PLANE CRASH WITHOUT A WILL: DOCS\n\nR. Anthony Rupp III named Officer Todd McAlister, Officer Nicholas Parisi, the commissioner of the Buffalo Police Department and the city of Buffalo in his lawsuit. (Google Maps / Fox News)\n\nMcAlister apparently did not share the same view as the court at the time of the interaction; he stopped his car and told Rupp that \"you know you can be arrested for that,\" according to court documents. Rupp alleges that he reiterated to the officer that he almost caused an accident and noted that McAlister should not be driving without his headlights on after dark. McAlister then \"got out of his vehicle and told Rupp he was detained,\" according to the complaint.\n\n3RD LAWSUIT AGAINST PANERA CLAIMS CAFFEINATED 'CHARGED LEMONADE' CAUSED 'PERMANENT CARDIAC INJURIES'\n\nTwo other officers came to the scene, including Parisi, who is also named in the suit. Parisi refused to ticket McAlister for driving without headlights, Rupp said.\n\nInstead, Rupp was issued a ticket for violating Buffalo's noise prohibition, but the citation was later dismissed, court documents show.\n\nA day after the incident, Rupp wrote a letter to the Buffalo Police Department's commissioner to complain.\n\nRupp and his wife first saw McAlister's car when they left Chef's Restaurant. Rupp shouted at the officer after he nearly struck two women as they walked from a parking lot to the restaurant, according to the lawsuit. (Google Maps)\n\n\"I wrote that letter because I thought these guys needed more training,\" Rupp said. \"They needlessly provoked an incident. They were in the wrong. They confronted me. They used the power of their badge to cite me.\"\n\nNow, Rupp is suing the police department, the two officers and the city of Buffalo. He told the Buffalo News that he is only seeking $1 and an acknowledgment that the officers acted inappropriately.\n\nPROMINENT NYC REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER AND TOP EXECS CHARGED IN $86M FRAUD SCHEME\n\nAlthough he was incensed, Rupp told the outlet that he didn't initially intend to seek legal action. He changed his mind, however, when McAlister and Parisi were involved in the arrest of an unarmed man who died of an asthma attack while in handcuffs two months later.\n\nA 2017 investigation into the death of Wardel \"Meech\" Davis found insufficient evidence to criminally charge the two officers for the incident.\n\n\"When I saw that it was the same two cops who were involved in my incident, when they retaliated against me because I [angered] them and Meech Davis [angered] them by resisting arrest, I went forward with a lawsuit that I never would have brought,\" Rupp told the Buffalo News.\n\nR. Anthony Rupp III is suing the Buffalo Police Department. (Lindsay DeDario / Reuters Photos)\n\nRupp is accusing the officers of violating his First Amendment rights and his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights protecting against false arrests. He also argues that the city of Buffalo insufficiently trained these officers and failed to intervene.\n\nIn court documents, lawyers representing Buffalo argued that Rupp's legal claims were unsupported. A U.S. district judge agreed, ruling in March 2021 that the officers had sufficient probable cause to ticket Rupp: \"Given both the volume and nature of Rupp's yell in the presence of bystanders, a reasonable person of normal sensitivities could be annoyed and have their quiet, comfort, and repose disturbed,\" the ruling read.\n\nBut in its Jan. 31 decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals wrote that a \"rational juror\" could easily view Rupp's words as an \"attempt to avert a possible accident.\" If all five words he had uttered were expletives, they said, the shout might reasonably be seen as \"unreasonable noise.\"\n\nThe defendants' attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

It's seeking an injunction against the criticism policy.\n\nHall recognized Massie to speak nearly two hours into the meeting, when the city council asked for feedback on a planned pay increase for the city attorney, but he repeatedly told her to stop for saying that official was already paid too much and had not done an \"exceptional\" job as the proposal claimed.\n\nShe said the city attorney had \"not complied with the Constitution, state law, or his duties of professional conduct\" in handling complaints about a mayoral candidate and \"had been dilatory in responding to public records requests,\" in FIRE's paraphrase. The city attorney was present.\n\nHall told Massie she was in violation of the criticism policy, said it \"doesn't matter\" that she was sharing, in her words, \"factual information,\" and asked her \"Do you want to be escorted out of here or are you going to stop talking?\"\n\nShe kept speaking, citing her First Amendment rights and \"case law,\" and calling the policy unconstitutional. Hall called for Massie's removal and arrest, acknowledging her daughter was present, and warned the same would happen \"any time you attack any staff member\" in the future.\n\nShernicoff detained Massie, placed her arms behind her back, \"forcibly removed Massie from the chamber,\" handcuffed her against a wall and took her to a detention facility, where a female officer searched her by \"placing her hands under Massie's clothing and under Massie's undergarments,\" the suit says. She was charged with criminal trespass.\n\nContrary to Hall's promise that Massie's daughter could go with her, the 10-year-old \"was left in the City Council chamber\" and \"Shernicoff refused to permit Massie to make a phone call or otherwise attempt to locate her daughter.\"\n\nFIRE is seeking actual, compensatory, and punitive damages against Hall and Shernicoff, whose conduct \"recklessly and callously disregarded and was indifferent to Massie's rights because they acted with the intent to suppress her nondisruptive political speech.\"\n\n\"I wanted to teach my children the importance of standing up for their rights and doing what is right - now I'm teaching that lesson to the city,\" Massie said in FIRE's press release.\n\n\"No American should be told to 'stop talking' or go to jail simply for speaking their minds at a city council meeting,\" FIRE attorney Adam Steinbaugh said.\n\nFIRE reminded the city of Surprise it got a favorable settlement this spring in a lawsuit against Eastpointe, Michigan, whose now-former mayor, Monique Owens, shouted down and silenced constituents who criticized her at a city council meeting.\n\nThe city dropped a policy similar to Surprise's, formally apologized, paid each plaintiff a symbolic $17,910 plus attorney's fees and established Sept. 6, the day Owens shouted them down, as First Amendment Day.\n\nThe City of Surprise did not immediately answer a request for comment."

Police body cam footage showed Hill coming out of the garage of a friend's house holding up his phone in his left hand when he was shot, the Associated Press reported.\n\nCoy, who now faces a minimum of 15 years in prison, said he thought Hill was holding a revolver in his right hand. The object turned out to be a set of keys.\n\n\"I thought I was going to die,\" Coy testified. He also admitted he knew he made a mistake when he rolled Hill over and saw there was no gun. \"I was horrified,\" he said.\n\nCoy was investigating a complaint in the area that someone was sitting in a running vehicle. Hill, who was sitting in an SUV when the cop first found him, said he was waiting for a friend. Hill later got out of the vehicle and went up to the friend's door. The former officer said he then lost sight of Hill, but was concerned he was trying to break into the house.\n\nThe former cop said when he spotted Hill again with his flashlight, he told him to come out, which he did with his left hand raised. Coy said could not see Hill's right hand, but then saw what he thought was a silver revolver.\n\nProsecutors said Hill had followed Coy's directions, and was lying wounded for almost 10 minutes before aid was provided.\n\n\"We're taught, 'Do what the cops tell you to do and you can survive that encounter,'\" Franklin County assistant prosecutor Anthony Pierson said during closing arguments. \"That's not what happened here.\"\n\nThe jury convicted Coy of murder, reckless homicide, and felonious assault. He will be sentenced on Nov. 25. Coy's defense attorneys have vowed to appeal the verdict.\n\nMisty Severi is an evening news reporter for Just The News. You can follow her on X for more coverage."

He'll also go through remedial training in social media usage.\n\nLewis wrote the decision comes \"after considerable investigation and deliberation.\" Chief Rick Mann conducted the investigation and gave a recommendation to the town manager.\n\nTarboro is a town of about 10,700, not far off Interstate 95 in the eastern part of the state. U.S. 64 runs from I-95 to the Outer Banks.\n\nTrump, by the split-second turn of his head , escaped with a wound to his ear when a 20-year-old opened fire last Saturday evening at the Republican presidential nominee's rally in Butler, Pa. Not long afterward, 500 miles south in Tarboro, Richardson used an expletive when posting, \"D---. Only an inch away from making America great again...\"\n\nThe post has since been removed and Richardson apologized on the site. Trump continued his campaign this week at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wis., on Thursday accepting the party nomination with Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, as his vice-presidential running mate. They'll be in Grand Rapids, Mich., on Saturday.\n\nTrump will also be in Charlotte on Wednesday, hosting a rally at the Bojangles' Coliseum.\n\nA month away from his 24th anniversary with the department, Richardson on Monday was placed on unpaid leave. His previous salary was $68,926 following a 4% cost of living increase this year.\n\nLewis, in an email to The Center Square earlier this week , wrote, \"While we will not know the longstanding impact of this incident, we take this matter very seriously and understand that there is a possibility that such statements can have a negative impact on public trust. The Tarboro Police Department always strives to operate with the highest standards of professionalism and integrity.\"\n\nHe indicated Richardson had met those standards while on duty for the town.\n\nRichardson is not alone in facing repercussions for social media posts after the assassination attempt. Published reports show workers of all types, including university educators and everyday blue-collar workers, ran afoul of company policies and in many cases lost their jobs."

Mark Butler of the Navasota Police Department was killed in a head-on collision Wednesday when a suspected bank robber drove on the wrong side of the road in a desperate attempt to flee another pursuing patrol car, officials said.\n\nWitnesses say the heroic officer purposely put himself in the speeding woman's path to save other drivers traveling down the highway.\n\n\"I don't believe we would have made it out if it wasn't for the officer. He selflessly gave himself up so nobody else would perish,\" Jonathan Crider told KBTX of the harrowing moments before the crash.\n\nCrider and his landscaping coworkers were directly in the path of the accelerating black Jeep Wrangler - until Butler maneuvered his patrol car in front of them, the man recalled.\n\n\"We changed lanes five seconds before the impact. He didn't swerve or brake. He sacrificed himself to save everyone behind us. I truly owe my life to him.\"\n\nButler wasn't even a member of the police squad that was pursuing the suspected bank robber at the time of the crash, according to officials.\n\nThe tragic saga had kicked off just 20 minutes earlier when College Station police made contact with a woman who was attempting to cash a fraudulent check at a local bank.\n\nThe woman fled in her Jeep and the officers gave chase until they witnessed her drive south in the northbound lanes of Highway 6.\n\nThey \"terminated the pursuit,\" but continued to \"follow the suspect as she drove the wrong way on Highway 6,\" the department said.\n\nThat's when Butler \"maneuvered his marked patrol vehicle and collided with the suspect, preventing her from hitting other motorists on the highway,\" according to the Officer Down Memorial Page.\n\nThe woman, who has not yet been identified, died at the scene. Butler was rushed to the hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries.\n\n\"Today was a heartbreaking reminder of the danger our law men & women face every time they leave home for work,\" Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said on X Wednesday.\n\nAccording to the Officer Down Memorial Page, Butler was a United States Army veteran.\n\nHe had served nearly four years with the Navasota Police Department.\n\nThe crash, as well as the suspected check fraud, are still under investigation."

It looks like people are trying to break into our police station,\" Doyle said, pointing out how Gantt appeared to be egging the crowd on with a megaphone.\n\nEventually officers were ordered to make arrests for property damage, and the footage showed them calmly entering the crowd before pandemonium broke out.\n\nDoyle previously lashed out at demonstrators in a fiery press conference over the weekend, expressing exasperation for the way officers have been treated.\n\n\"The Ferguson Police Department since 2014 has been a punching bag for this community,\" Doyle said, explaining that the department had done \"everything the activist community has advocated for\" since the 2014 Michael Brown shooting, in which the unarmed teen was killed by a white officer.\n\n\"Body-worn cameras, implicit bias training, crisis intervention training ... we even changed the uniforms at this department because people said the old uniforms triggered them,\" he said.\n\n\"So what are you protesting?\"\n\nGantt is being held on a $500,000 cash-only bond, charged with assault of a special victim, resisting arrest and property damage.

He used a riot shield to push against a line of officers blocking the West Terrace entrance, pinning one to a doorway.\n\nYet if Democrats and the Biden Justice Department had treated J6ers - violent or not - the same way they treated Black Lives Matter protesters, pro-Palestinian protesters or regular criminal offenders, we would not be discussing pardons today.\n\n\"There were double standards in how sentences were applied to the J6 protesters versus other groups,\" Vance said on CBS's \"Face the Nation.\" \"A double standard that was not applied to many people, including of course the Black Lives Matter rioters who killed over two dozen people and never had the weight of a weaponized Department of Justice come against them.\"\n\nCritics will say this is whataboutism, but for a party so focused on criminal-justice reform and \"restorative justice,\" the Democrats were quick to indict J6ers as \"insurrectionists\" and equate them with \" domestic terrorists .\" Many J6ers were overcharged, denied bail and a speedy trial and sentenced to excessive prison terms.\n\nThe federal prosecutors in my cousin's case sought a more-than-15-year prison sentence. He had no criminal record. He'd never even gotten a speeding ticket. He owned no firearms. Yet when FBI agents banged on the door to arrest him at his father's home Jan. 19, 2021, they did so with guns drawn.\n\nA hulky guy with glasses and an avid reader, Patrick was a high-school honors student and speaks three languages. His politics skewed right in his teens, but COVID hardened his libertarian views. He was living with his mother in Fairfield County, Conn., at the time and working in residential construction with his father. He says watching fundamental rights \"being trampled upon with basic impunity\" made him speak up for the first time.\n\nHe got thrown off Twitter twice for posting that masks aren't effective. He wanted to make his voice heard.\n\nOn Jan. 6, 2021, Patrick and his father watched Trump's speech at the Ellipse, then marched to the Capitol. Patrick separated from his father, took a selfie on the scaffolding set up for President Joe Biden's inauguration and joined a crowd at the West Terrace entrance.\n\nSurveillance and bodycam video of the mêlée at that entrance is extensive. Patrick uses a clear-plastic police riot shield to push against the line of officers blocking the doorway. \"Just go home, man,\" Patrick yells.\n\n\"Pick the right side,\" a police officer shouts.\n\nA person behind Patrick squirts what looks like bear spray at the police. A man to Patrick's left reaches under the helmet of one of the officers, Daniel Hodges, and grabs his face. Hodges later said the man \"tried to gouge out my eye.\"\n\nThe crowd yells \"Heave-ho\" and pushes in unison to break the line of officers blocking the entrance. Hodges screams, wedged between a door frame and the shield Patrick holds.\n\n\"Let me back,\" Patrick yells. He pulls Hodges' face shield back down to, he tells me, protect him from the bear spray and tear gas. \"He's hurt,\" Patrick shouts, pointing to Hodges.\n\n\"I really was screaming at the top of my lungs to have them go back so that we might be able to extricate Officer Hodges from the situation,\" Patrick tells me.\n\nAt trial, Hodges conceded Patrick alerted another officer that Hodges was injured, and he was whisked to safety. Yet Hodges also says he was \"crushed\" by the force of Patrick's shield the whole time.\n\nPatrick never made it into the building. After Trump released a video later that day telling protesters to go home, he drove with his father back to his dad's house in South Salem, New York.\n\nAt his sentencing, US District Judge Trevor McFadden called Patrick a \"poster child of all that was dangerous and appalling\" about Jan. 6. Patrick apologized to the court, saying, \"My actions on January 6, 2021, will remain the greatest embarrassment of my life.\"\n\nHe's more nuanced with me. \"I don't regret going. I don't regret my thoughts at the time,\" he says. \"But I think that, ultimately, I went down there to effect positive change, and through rashness or anger, I managed to defeat my own purpose.\"\n\nI watched Jan. 6 on TV in shock and disgust. I couldn't understand how these people - protesting in the name of MAGA - thought battling police or calling for the hanging of Vice President Mike Pence helped their cause. I thought this would be a dark footnote to the Trump presidency and Trump's reputation would never recover.\n\nI was wrong. The Democrats all but ensured Trump's survival.\n\nFor all the Democrats' and the media's talk about \"insurrection,\" nobody was charged with that crime. Biden lied repeatedly that J6 protesters killed Officer Brian Sicknick, even though he died of two strokes caused by an artery clot the next day. Vice President Kamala Harris likened Jan. 6 to Sept. 11. The Democrats' entire platform became about \"saving democracy,\" and they used this as a pretext to prosecute Trump.\n\nWhen Patrick was arrested, he thought his father would be able to bail him out after the arraignment. \"I did not understand that there was going to be a judge from New York - a no-cash-bail state - who would say that I'm a monster and that I was too dangerous to be allowed out in the community,\" he says. \"That really was a wakeup call.\"\n\nPatrick was flown to Oklahoma and spent time in several different jails before ending up in the DC jail. Patrick calls that a bright spot in his incarceration because the entire ward was filled with J6ers. Due to the risk of COVID, they were only allowed out of their cells for one hour a day, but he says they helped each other contact their families, find lawyers and created a \"community much greater than any group of incarcerated people could expect.\"\n\nThey sang the national anthem every day, signed each other's pocket Constitutions and played charades once a week. In May, Patrick got out on bond with supervised release until trial.\n\nPatrick's father says \"nobody wanted to take the case,\" and he was advised that his son accept a plea deal. They refused.\n\nFederal prosecutors charged Patrick with several counts of assaulting an officer, including with a dangerous weapon, disorderly conduct and a slew of other offenses. His case was joined with that of five other J6 defendants he'd never met. He was forced into a trial group with two of them over his attorney's objections.\n\n\"I feel as if it was prejudicial to my case to be joined with these people,\" Patrick tells me. \"The government also dragged its heels for quite some time on allowing discovery.\"\n\nPatrick opted for a bench trial because, he says, \"the jury pool was so against us, against January 6 defendants, that it would have been impossible to get a fair trial there.\"\n\n\"Being a man of principle, no, I don't regret going,\" Patrick's father says about the Jan. 6 protest. But he calls the trial a \"kangaroo court\" and concedes, \"I was fairly naïve moving into the whole thing - that's where I really find fault with myself.\"\n\nThat the officer Patrick pinned with the shield was Daniel Hodges also didn't help his case. Hodges has become one of the most outspoken Jan. 6 police officers. He campaigned for Biden and then Harris, traveling to Michigan with her team. After Trump pardoned the J6ers, Hodges spoke at a press conference with Rep. Eric Swalwell, calling on members of Congress to oppose Trump's \"horrific agenda\" and warning the J6ers are now free to \"try it again.\"\n\n\"There was a lot of pressure placed upon the prosecutors and judge in my case to seek a conviction and to obtain one because there was so much media attention,\" Patrick says, \"combined with an officer who was only too happy to appear before Congress and to speak to the media.\"\n\nHodges did not return my request for comment.\n\n\"The Justice Department was energized in a way to explicitly convict. It was not a fact-finding mission. It was a retributive, vindictive mission,\" Patrick says.\n\nOn Jan. 22, 2022, Patrick was convicted of seven felony counts, including assaulting an officer with a dangerous weapon, and remanded to prison. In April 2023, he was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years. He spent the bulk of his incarceration at the Elkton federal prison in Ohio, housed mainly with child molesters.\n\nAs a teenager and in my early 20s, I took part in a lot of radical-left protests. I missed the riot at the World Trade Organization protests in Seattle in 1999, but I got teargassed at a 2000 Washington, DC, International Monetary Fund demonstration. I know something about the madness of crowds. I asked Patrick about this at dinner.\n\n\"It is something very fundamental to human beings that if you get enough people in a certain spirit in one area, that they're likely to behave less like rational individuals and more like a mob,\" he says. \"If you get into a shoving match with the cops, it's not the best. I know that.\"\n\nPatrick says most of the people he's met who traveled to Washington for the Jan. 6 protests had \"good intentions,\" though he concedes in a crowd that size there was likely a small percent who didn't. Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, whose sentence Trump commuted, had a cache of weapons stashed in a Virginia hotel room that day. Eric Munchel wore tactical gear and carried stolen zip ties in the Capitol. The guy wearing the \"Camp Auschwitz\" sweatshirt is probably not a mensch.\n\nThe overzealous prosecution of J6ers, though, has made these people martyrs to some on the right.\n\nPatrick is responsible for his actions Jan. 6, 2021. I don't condone violence. I'm not downplaying the significance of attacking the Capitol. But seven-and-a-half years is too much for the crimes he committed.\n\nA pro-Palestinian activist, Ruben Camacho, was sentenced to just 48 hours of community service for punching a female police officer at a protest outside the Democratic National Committee headquarters in 2023. Edward Schinzing was sentenced to 15 months for breaking into and setting fire to a federal courthouse in Portland in 2020, with employees and prisoners still inside. A Black Lives Matter rioter who torched a Minneapolis pawn shop, causing the death of a person inside, was sentenced to 10 years in prison. That's five years less than prosecutors wanted for my cousin.\n\nPatrick is now 27 years old. He's softspoken with a dry sense of humor. Despite the pardon, his J6 conviction will follow him for the rest of his life - whenever he applies for a job or apartment or goes on a date. He was already debanked. But he is not a threat to society, and more prison time would likely only harden him, not make him a better candidate for release. Isn't that a pillar of the Democrats' criminal-justice reform?\n\nAt our dinner, Patrick didn't want to dwell on the bad experiences in prison. He spoke about how J6ers looked out for each other, helped new inmates navigate the prison phone system and organized rides and a hotel room when they were released at 1 a.m. Jan. 21.\n\nHe joked about getting caught once using a cellphone and the sense of humor the guard who assigned him to a 45-day stint in the special housing unit - a modern form of solitary confinement with one cellmate - must have had for pairing him with Frank Monte, New Jersey's number-one Trump stalker. \"I stayed away from cell phones after that,\" he says.\n\nPatrick plans to hike the Appalachian Trail this summer. Before Jan. 6, he'd been planning a trip to Japan. He taught himself Japanese. But he says he called the Japanese consulate last month, and it told him he can't visit the country with a criminal conviction, despite the pardon.\n\nIn the longer term, Patrick plans to move to New Hampshire or Montana to be around more \"liberty-minded people.\" He wants to build his own house and start a family.\n\n\"I'm not anybody special. I have a regular job. I love this country, but that's about it. In the great-man theory of history, I'm not one of them,\" Patrick says. \"I'm just overjoyed I'm free, that I'm able to interact with my family, to be with my loved ones, to enjoy my full rights.\"\n\nCaroline McCaughey covers politics and policy for The New York Sun.\n\nAdvertisement"

She also had a bench warrant out for her arrest.\n\nAfter Hair arrested her, he was supposed to bring her to police headquarters and later to the Las Colinas Detention Center in Santee, Calif., for questioning.\n\nIn bodycam footage released by the SDPD, the suspect was heard propositioning the officer for sex after asking him if he was married.\n\n\"You're not too bad. What's it gonna hurt me if I work the system, you know what I mean? That's the way I see s-t,\" she told Hair.\n\n\"Are you single?\" she added, to which he responded, \"Yeah, but you're not.\"\n\n\"I'm down to f-k right now,\" she told him, before he interrupts, \"Don't say that right now ... Don't say that right now because everything is being recorded right now.\"\n\nAs the pair approach the detention center, Hair can be heard asking the female suspect what she is doing in the backseat.\n\nHair turned off his bodycam and slowed his vehicle as he drove onto a residential street, the outlet added.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, Hair called for a fellow officer to help him out of the police car over the embarrassing mishap.\n\n\"I asked him if he was okay. He said yes, and then asked if I had my patrol car key with me ... I asked why he was asking and what did he need,\" the unidentified officer said of Hair, describing him as panicked. \"Officer Hair then asked me if I could go meet him.\"\n\n\"I asked him his location and he said, near Cottonwood ... I asked him why he needed me, and he said he would tell me when I got there. He said he was really embarrassed.\"\n\nInvestigators reported that Hair believed the woman was suffering from a medical emergency, according to NBC San Diego .\n\nHair and the woman denied anything untoward happened, as the officer claimed he was \"checking\" on the suspect in the back.\n\n\"When I was waking her up, that's when I noticed that this door closed on me. That's when I was trying to kind of open the door,\" Hair said in the clip.\n\nSan Diego police found traces of semen on Hair's belt, CBS reported.\n\n\"He wanted to get with me when I was done with the warrant or whatever I got arrested for,\" she said.\n\nIt's unclear if he faces any criminal charges over the ordeal.\n\nThe Post has reached out to the San Diego Police Department for comment.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Police officer demoted following sensitive social media post\n\n(The Center Square) - Ten days without pay and a demotion, including salary adjustment, is the punishment for a small-town police officer in North Carolina following a sensitive post to social media after an assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump.\n\nBrandon Richardson, formerly a detective sergeant with the Tarboro Police Department, is being reclassified to corporal rank and pay, Town Manager Troy Lewis wrote in an email to The Center Square on Friday afternoon. He'll also go through remedial training in social media usage.\n\nLewis wrote the decision comes \"after considerable investigation and deliberation.\" Chief Rick Mann conducted the investigation and gave a recommendation to the town manager.\n\nTarboro is a town of about 10,700, not far off Interstate 95 in the eastern part of the state. U.S. 64 runs from I-95 to the Outer Banks.\n\nTrump, by the split-second turn of his head , escaped with a wound to his ear when a 20-year-old opened fire last Saturday evening at the Republican presidential nominee's rally in Butler, Pa. Not long afterward, 500 miles south in Tarboro, Richardson used an expletive when posting, \"D-. Only an inch away from making America great again...\"\n\nThe post has since been removed and Richardson apologized on the site. Trump continued his campaign this week at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wis., on Thursday accepting the party nomination with Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, as his vice-presidential running mate. They'll be in Grand Rapids, Mich., on Saturday.\n\nTrump will also be in Charlotte on Wednesday, hosting a rally at the Bojangles' Coliseum.\n\nA month away from his 24th anniversary with the department, Richardson on Monday was placed on unpaid leave. His previous salary was $68,926 following a 4% cost of living increase this year.\n\nLewis, in an email to The Center Square earlier this week , wrote, \"While we will not know the longstanding impact of this incident, we take this matter very seriously and understand that there is a possibility that such statements can have a negative impact on public trust. The Tarboro Police Department always strives to operate with the highest standards of professionalism and integrity.\"\n\nHe indicated Richardson had met those standards while on duty for the town.\n\nRichardson is not alone in facing repercussions for social media posts after the assassination attempt. Published reports show workers of all types, including university educators and everyday blue-collar workers, ran afoul of company policies and in many cases lost their jobs."

      "text": "DC police officer attacked on Jan. 6 says he feels 'betrayed' by pardons\n\nFormer D.C. Metropolitan police officer Michael Fanone lamented that President Donald Trump pardoned the rioters he once arrested.\n\nTrump spent his first hours in office issuing mass clemency for the 1,583 people who faced charges for their actions at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Some 1,230 had been convicted or pleaded guilty. Another group of about 200 pleaded guilty to felonies that included assaulting officers. Fanone was on the job and at the scene that day.\n\n\"I have been betrayed by my country, and I've been betrayed by those that supported Donald Trump. Whether you voted for him because he promised these pardons or for some other reason, you knew that this was coming. And here we are,\" Fanone said on CNN's The Source with Kaitlan Collins . \"Tonight, six individuals who assaulted me, as I did my job on Jan. 6, as did hundreds of other law enforcement officers, will now walk free.\"\n\nFanone was among those whom former President Joe Biden preemptively pardoned for testifying to the defunct Jan. 6 committee. The former officer had not been charged with any crime at the time of Biden's announcement, which happened hours before Trump was inaugurated.\n\n\"All I can say is that I think it's a sad commentary on where we are as a nation that a sitting president thought it necessary to issue a preemptive pardon to a witness in a congressional investigation because the subject to that investigation is now the president and had promised to pursue politically motivated revenge,\" Fanone said of his pardon. \"Again, it's just more examples of the outrageous behavior of the current president of the United States.\"\n\nThese clemencies come after Vice President J.D. Vance assured pardons were coming for those who \" protested peacefully \" in the days leading up to Inauguration Day. At the time, Vance said, \"If you committed violence on that day, obviously, you shouldn't be pardoned.\"\n\nSome convicted rioters had already left prison before the end of the day Monday."

      "text": "Tyreek Hill and the continued vilification of the country's police officers\n\nTyreek Hill is not a victim.\n\nTwo weeks ago, a viral video of the NFL wide receiver showed what happened when he broke traffic laws, ignored and disobeyed the commands of police officers, and was arrested. Hill thought he was above the law and instigated a confrontation with law enforcement officers. Despite this, Hill has been allowed to play in every game so far this season.\n\nMany have tried to portray him as a victim, the latest person brutalized by the police force in this country. It's the latest example of the left-wing, anti-police narrative that dominates the country and misrepresents situations to advance this dogma.\n\nAfter calling for the officer he had a confrontation with to be fired, the star player for the Miami Dolphins met with police last week. He said that \"there's been some small steps forward\" with his incident. However, this is problematic. There is no need to \"move forward.\" The police were not the problem. Tyreek Hill was.\n\nUnfortunately, Hill's response and the implied sentiments of \"moving forward\" are indicative of the contemporary despicable propaganda that depicts the police as evil and those in physical confrontations with police officers as docile, innocent victims. And in Hill's case, to perpetuate this anti-police narrative, the fact that it wasn't the police who instigated the situation is being ignored.\n\nHowever, rogue, radical, left-wing politicians have eradicated the notion of respecting police officers long ago. Anyone who suffers the consequences of disrespecting and disobeying the police is now automatically viewed as a victim. Police are essentially expected to acquiesce to anyone who disobeys. The people who risk their lives daily to serve and protect have become targets of contemporary politics and categorized as villains. This is why Hill is being hailed as some kind of victim instead of being viewed as the problem.\n\n\"The reason for the spin is the left-wing anti-police slant that is the bread and butter of the liberal mainstream media outlets which gleefully pushed the 'Defund The Police' agenda without ever stopping to consider the consequences of such lunacy,\" David Gelman, a criminal defense attorney and former deputy district attorney, said. \"Bottom line, serving up the officer as the bad guy serves their purpose. As [for] Hill, he conducted himself like an idiot.\"\n\n\"The officer told him to keep the window down,\" Gelman said. \"That is an easy command to obey. That is a safety issue. He has no idea who Hill is. A raised tinted window presents a huge officer safety issue as the officer can not see what is going on inside the vehicle. This is how officers get shot and killed during seemingly 'routine' motor vehicle stops. All Hill had to do was roll down the window. He did not do that and created the initial circumstances that led to the arrest.\"\n\nHill's claim (and the claim of those who support him) was that the police officer was needlessly aggressive. But this is little more than the perpetual victimization mentality that vilifies responsible residents and lionizes careless and reckless rulebreakers. This is the primary reason for the vitriol directed toward the police in this instance. It's unwarranted.\n\n\"The officer's actions appear to have been driven by legitimate safety concerns and a desire to gain control of the situation as he continued to deal with Hill and simultaneously attempted to deal with random people who were trying to interject themselves into the situation,\" Gelman said. \"Having said that, while the officer could not allow Hill (or any other driver to dictate the situation), the matter escalated very quickly, and there may have been ways to de-escalate the situation. The goal here was to issue the tickets and send him on his way without endangering the officers.\"\n\n\"Hill should have complied,\" the criminal defense attorney said. \"Then none of this happens. Once Hill is non-compliant, the officer must deal with that. The officer is being 'aggressive' to maintain control of the situation. Having said that, since he is issuing him tickets, the officer can keep him there as long as necessary to do that. This gives Hill incentive to comply. Time is on the side of the officers in that regard. But you need to consider the officer safety issue created by Hill's initial compliance. The officer is not required to place his life at risk because a driver is mad about being stopped.\"\n\nThe country has lost sight of this central issue. People view police officers as expendable to justify the disrespectful and ignorant actions exhibited by a wealthy, arrogant professional athlete. Tyreek Hill was not a victim, as he and many in the media have said. He was the aggressor who sought to manipulate the political climate to rationalize his unnecessary antics.\n\nThose who act like Tyreek Hill when interacting with law enforcement are the problem, not the police officers. The sooner everyone recognizes that, the better."

      "text": "Police officer who arrested golfer Scottie Scheffler showed 'poor decision making'\n\nNewly released documents show the Louisville , Kentucky, officer who arrested professional golfer Scottie Scheffler could have avoided the conflict when he arrested the world's No. 1 golfer.\n\nAccording to the Louisville Metro Police Department's report released Friday, Detective Bryan Gillis \"determined Mr. Scheffler was refusing to follow lawful orders from an officer directing traffic, grabbed Mr. Scheffler's left arm and attempted to open the driver's door of the vehicle.\"\n\nThe report adds that Gillis ran \"alongside the vehicle briefly while yelling for help before being dragged to the ground,\" after which Scheffler stopped his car.\n\nLMPD Lt. Craig Browning said in the report that Gillis was guilty of \"tactically poor decision making\" by \"reaching into a vehicle that is running, is in drive, and the operator has the ability to pull away/accelerate.\"\n\nPhotos from the report show Gillis sustained a minor scratch to his wrist and ripped pants.\n\nFootage of a phone call Scheffler made from jail shows the golfer wasn't initially aware Gillis was a law enforcement officer.\n\n\"I sat there and tried to diffuse the situation, and then I was literally reaching out trying to find a police officer, not knowing he was one,\" Scheffler said. \"It's my fault. I mean, he's wearing a uniform. He's wearing a yellow vest. I just didn't see it.\"\n\nThe report was released as it was also revealed three of the LMPD officers, including Gillis, present during the arrest initially failed to turn on their body cameras.\n\nAccordingly, there is no body-worn camera footage of the events leading up to Gillis's run-in with Scheffler.\n\nIn Gillis's body camera footage in the moments after the arrest, Scheffler says, \"Are you the one that I dragged? I'm sorry. Sir, I did not know you were a police officer. I'm terribly sorry.\"\n\nGillis responded, \"I mean, you hurt my wrist, my ankle, my knee and ripped my pants. ... I'm directing traffic. It says police on me.\"\n\nScheffler was arrested at the PGA Championship in May as he attempted to enter the golf course where he was set to tee off. Due to a pedestrian being fatally struck by a bus earlier in the day, some areas of entrance to the course were blocked off. After arguing with the golfer about accessing the course, Gillis arrested Scheffler despite reports that Scheffler was driving a marked player car.\n\nJefferson County Attorney Mike O'Connell dismissed all charges against Scheffler last month, calling them \"a big misunderstanding .\"\n\nThis is not the first time Gillis has failed to conduct himself appropriately as a member of the Louisville police department.\n\nAfter being briefly suspended in 2013 for having an intoxicated civilian in his police car while doing donuts, he was found to be \"at fault\" in an accident later that year. In 2019 and 2021, Gillis was orally reprimanded for being \"at fault\" in accidents. His most recent violation came in June 2021 after he was disciplined for chasing a \"vehicle that did not commit a violent felony or wanted on a warrant.\""

      "text": "Sworn police officer count at highest number since pandemic\n\nA new survey by the Police Executive Research Forum indicates that the number of sworn police officers among PERF members has increased for the first time since at least 2020 .\n\nThe small increase comes after a large decline in the number of officers since the COVID-19 pandemic and George Floyd protests, which popularized the \"Defund the Police\" movement, with a peak of 6,492 officers resigning in 2022.\n\n\"I just think that the past four years have been particularly challenging for American policing,\" said Chuck Wexler, executive director of PERF, a nonprofit policing think tank based in Washington. \"And our survey shows we're finally starting to turn a corner.\"\n\nThe survey noted that larger agencies are overrepresented in the survey, though those are also the ones facing the most significant hiring challenges.\n\nSome departments, such as the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, offered increased bonuses in response to hiring challenges after a continual decline in officer hiring. It is unknown if that contributed to the added hiring, as MPD's numbers have not shown any significant changes with the $25,000 hiring bonus.\n\nBut a police agency in Alameda, California, offered a $75,000 hiring bonus and its chief said it worked.\n\n\"Ever since we put this incentive in place, we have had hundreds of applications come in,\" Alameda Police Chief Nishant Joshi said in September 2023.\n\nBut money may not be a solution for every department.\n\n\"I don't think it's all about money,\" Wexler said. \"I think it's about the way people perceive their job and feel they are going to be supported. You have West Coast departments that are paying six figures but still seeing major challenges in hiring.\"\n\nOther smaller departments have disbanded entirely, shifting police duties to other agencies near their areas, or county sheriffs.\n\nThe survey also featured retirements hitting their lowest number since 2019, but smaller agencies still face the highest percent change in retirements among medium- and large-sized agencies.\n\nDespite optimism from Wexler on the survey, he says the profession is \"not out of the woods yet.\""

His defense attorney, William Shipley, said he was nonviolent.\n\n\"He primarily remained a singular member of a much larger group of individuals, and mostly observed the conduct of others,\" Shipley wrote.\n\nTuck was employed as a police officer in Longwood, Florida, and then in Apopka spanning from 2012 to 2020. He allegedly told a federal probation officer that he quit his police job in October 2020 \"because of the whole George Floyd thing.\"\n\nHis father will be sentenced next Tuesday.\n\nThey are just a couple out of more than 1,500 people indicted on charges related to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has promised that he will pardon those criminally charged in the riots once he returns to office."

Gwinn-Villaroel announced at a press conference that Detective Bryan Gillis did not have his body camera activated during the interaction last Friday, and that he \"has received corrective action for this policy violation.\"\n\n\"Detective Gillis should have turned on his body worn camera, but did not. His failure to do so is a violation of the LMPD policy,\" Gwinn-Villaroel said.\n\nScheffler was arrested after allegedly trying to go around the scene of an earlier fatal traffic accident involving a bus and a pedestrian Friday morning. He was charged with second-degree assault of a police officer, third-degree criminal mischief, reckless driving, and disregarding traffic signals from an officer directing traffic. He was released on personal recognizance later that morning and competed in the PGA Championship.\n\nAuthorities released footage from the scene where Scheffler was arrested, but said they were unaware of any that captured the initial interaction between Scheffler and Gillis.\n\nOfficials did not comment on the charges against Scheffler, simply saying they would respect the legal process. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said he believes all parties want to move forward.\n\n\"We have to respect the legal process and that's what we are going to do, and we're going to let that play out,\" Greenberg said on Thursday. \"We want to move forward. Mr. Scheffler has made it clear that he wants to move forward and I know that everyone else involved with LMPD wants to move forward.\"\n\nIn a statement posted on his Instagram story last week, Scheffler insisted that the incident was \"a big misunderstanding\" and said he \"never intended to disregard any of the instructions.\""

      "text": "A police officer is killed in action, and a civilian panel outrageously recommends her suspension\n\nP olice officers in the country continue to be under attack, but the aggressors are not criminals on the street approaching them with guns. The latest assault on police is from watchdog groups that monitor police interactions, supposedly to ensure accountability. In Chicago, they are trampling the grave of an officer killed in action, and they are doing it because she showed some decency and allowed a woman being detained to cover up her body.\n\nThe Civilian Office of Police Accountability, a watchdog group for the Chicago Police Department, released a report last week recommending a three-day suspension for a police officer who turned off her body camera in the middle of police interaction. The officer was Ella French. She was killed in action during a traffic stop in August.\n\nThe recommendation was based on a review of an incident in February 2019, according to Fox News . During a raid that French was a part of, police officers entered a house looking for a suspect when they encountered Anjanette Young, who was getting undressed for bed. While police were executing a search warrant, Young was handcuffed while naked. She interacted with French, who uncuffed Young and turned her bodycam off so that Young could get dressed.\n\nFrench's decision to turn off her bodycam led to COPA's posthumously published recommendation that she be suspended.\n\n\"COPA has considered Officer French's complimentary history, her lack of prior disciplinary history, and her over three years of service to the department, and her status as PPO at the time of the incident in mitigation. Officer French failed to timely activate her body-worn camera and failed to document the detention and search of the male and his vehicle in an Investigatory Stop Report. Accordingly, COPA recommends a three-day suspension\" the report stated.\n\nThe review of the incident and recommendation for suspension was originally concluded in April, months before French was killed, Fox News reports. COPA claims it had no choice but to include French's name in this report due to protocol.\n\n\"Per ordinance (Municipal Code of Chicago 2-78-145), COPA must make reports open to public inspection. COPA can only redact information to the extent it is exempted from disclosure by the Freedom of Information Act or any other applicable law. COPA released the report, previously completed April 27, 2021, as required by ordinance.\"\n\nIncidentally, even though the review of the raid was conducted because Anjanette Young filed a complaint, Young's complaint was not with French. In fact, she praised French as the only officer who had demonstrated \"dignity or respect\" toward her that night. That did not stop COPA from proceeding with its absurd recommendation.\n\nAdditionally, Anjanette Young released a statement after French was killed in action.\n\n\"Officer French was the only officer who showed Ms. Young any dignity or respect on the night of the raid,\" Young's statement said. \"Ms. Young is praying for Officer French's family and offers her sincerest condolences to them and all of Officer French's friends and colleagues.\"\n\nThe incident reveals the horrors of dealing with bureaucratic, agenda-driven watchdog groups the members of which seem to be filled with ideology and devoid of common sense.\n\nIt is one thing to include French's name in a list for a suspension months after she was killed. Whether it was protocol or not, somebody somewhere should have the foresight to know better and adjust accordingly.\n\nBut what is more troubling is that French, had she survived, was going to be punished for showing some decency, something it would be nice to see more police show. If COPA wants to reprimand police officers for doing good, it seriously undermines its own credibility."

Video footage and images show the officers joined in the crowd that climbed over barricades and let out chants such as, \"Whose house? Our house?\"\n\nThe government later told defense attorneys that 12 Washington officers with the Electronic Surveillance Unit were undercover on Jan. 6 , as well as additional officers from the Narcotics Special Investigation Division. Nicholas Tomasula, one of the officers, said he was tasked with recording what unfolded and nothing else but said he joined in when the crowd was chanting and urged people to \"go, go, go\" up a flight of stairs at the Capitol.\n\nAnother officer, Shane Lamond, was charged in 2023 with obstruction of justice and making false statements after allegedly communicating with the leader of the Proud Boys group.\n\nFormer FBI agent John Guandolo has also testified that he was with agents on Jan. 6, and saw other agents among the crowd.\n\nSome defendants, including William Pope, have continued seeking more information about the undercover officers, including their identities, and details have slowly emerged from court filings, witness testimony, and other documents and proceedings.\n\nA Florida man, meanwhile, became this week one of the latest Jan. 6 convicts to be sentenced.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg sentenced Isreal Easterday, 23, to 30 months in prison.\n\nThe sentence was below the 151 months that prosecutors sought for Mr. Easterday, who was convicted by a jury on nine counts, including assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers using a dangerous weapon, after spraying officers with pepper spray outside the Capitol.\n\nMr. Easterday carried out the actions as he held a Confederate flag and wore a hat that said he loved then-President Donald Trump, according to court filings.\n\nProsecutors described Mr. Easterday's violent conduct, destruction of evidence, and lack of remorse in asking for a lengthy sentence. Defense lawyers said that their client's conduct was serious but that the case \"centers on 20 seconds in which a teenager made the worst decision in his life, is extremely remorseful, and whose conduct did not result in any lasting physical injuries.\" They requested a prison sentence of 12 months and one day.\n\nJudge Boasberg, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, said Mr. Easterday's young age was a factor in diverging so sharply from the recommendation from prosecutors. He said Mr. Easterday, who grew up on a family farm and was homeschooled, \"may not have fully appreciated what was going on\" at the Capitol, the Associated Press reported.\n\nMr. Easterday apologized for his actions and told the judge after receiving the sentence that he would not let the judge down.\n\nJudge Boasberg also ordered Mr. Easterday to complete 500 hours of community service and pay $2,000 in restitution.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

JD Vance (R-Ohio), took their \"Make America Safe Again\" message to police departments in two battleground states on Aug. 20, pledging to improve circumstances for police officers.\n\nThe Republican candidates' appearances are part of their campaign strategy while Democrats gather at their own nominating convention in Chicago.\n\nDuring his speech at the Livingston County Sheriff's Office in Howell, Michigan, Trump said: \"When I'm president of the United States again, we will never even think about or mention the words, 'defund the police.'\"\n\nInstead, officials need to \"re-fund\" the police, he said, and also should grant officers greater protection against lawsuits and prosecutions that they may unfairly face \"for doing their jobs,\" Trump said.\n\n\"Under my leadership, no community will be surrendered to violent criminals; no citizen will be abandoned to migrant crime.\"\n\nRecord numbers of illegal immigrants have been entering the United States since President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris took office in 2021. Some have been arrested and charged for high-profile violent crimes in recent months.\n\nWhile Biden has blamed Congress for inaction on a bipartisan border bill, Trump counters that, during his presidency, he issued executive orders to close the border and take other actions to clamp down on illegal immigration.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Vance spoke in Kenosha, Wisconsin.\n\n\"We don't just have a vision on the Trump campaign. We don't just have a bunch of promises on the Trump campaign. We have got four years of Donald Trump's successful leadership that brought public safety to our streets, and that is something to celebrate and look forward to,\" Vance said.\n\nHis audience was also filled with law enforcement officers.\n\nVance said that, if he and Trump are elected, they will end \"sanctuary cities\" that shield illegal immigrants from federal immigration authorities, deport violent illegal aliens, and protect police from \"frivolous lawsuits.\"\n\n\"The reason that it's so hard for the police to do their job, sometimes, is they know: If they do their job, they're going to get sued for it,\" Vance said.\n\nRepublican vice presidential nominee Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) greets a police officer before a campaign rally in Kenosha, Wis., on Aug. 20, 2024. Andy Manis/Getty Images\n\nWhile the Democratic National Committee's policy platform touted a 50-year low in violent crime, Trump and his campaign say more reliable data suggest that's not the case.\n\nAfter Harris and Biden took office, \"the FBI ditched the crime data reporting system used for more than 100 years for a 'modernized' system that many of the nation's largest police departments ... aren't using,\" the Trump campaign said in an emailed statement. \"There's not less crime; there's just less *reporting of crime.*\n\nTrump suggested crime data are skewed because police are arresting fewer people while they lack support, are understaffed, and want to avoid legal peril.\n\nThe National Crime Prevention Research Center says FBI statistics are inaccurate because \"victims don't report most crimes.\" The National Crime Victimization Survey provides more accurate insights, the center said, adding that the report shows reported and nonreported violent crimes went up 42 percent between 2020 and 2022, the most recent year available.\n\nTrump and Vance will appear together in Asheboro, North Carolina, on Aug. 21 to highlight their plans to \"Make America Strong Again.\"\n\nOn Aug. 22, Trump will travel to the U.S.-Mexico border in Montezuma Pass, Arizona, while Vance will travel to Valdosta, Georgia, to talk about improving immigration policies to \"Make America Secure Again.\"\n\nOn Aug. 23, Trump will hold a rally in Glendale, Arizona, and will also lead a \"No Tax on Tips\" session in Las Vegas as part of the Trump-Vance weeklong \"barnstorming\" tour of states that could help decide the Nov. 5 presidential election that pits them against the Democrats' Harris-Walz ticket.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "Trump Not Considering Pardon For Officer Convicted In George Floyd's Death\n\nAuthored by Tom Ozimek via The Epoch Times,\n\nPresident Donald Trump said March 7 that he is not considering pardoning Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer serving a multi-decade sentence on a range of charges related to the 2020 death of George Floyd.\n\nA reporter told Trump in the Oval Office that \"your allies are calling on you to pardon Derek Chauvin,\" before asking whether he's considering a presidential pardon.\n\n\"No, I haven't even heard about it,\" the president replied. \"No. I haven't heard that.\"\n\nTrump's remarks come in the context of a petition launched this week by conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, who called for a presidential pardon for Chauvin, who is serving a 221⁄2-year sentence for unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and manslaughter.\n\nFloyd's final moments were captured on video, as Chauvin restrained him with a knee to the neck or upper back area while attempting to arrest him for using a counterfeit $20 bill at a store.\n\n\"As you know, this was the inciting event for the [Black Lives Matter] riots that caused $2 billion in property damage in cities across the United States and set America's race relations on their worst footing in recent memory,\" Shapiro's petition reads.\n\n\"Yet the evidence demonstrates that Derek Chauvin did not murder George Floyd.\"\n\nTwo autopsies were conducted after George Floyd's death. The official autopsy by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner concluded Floyd died from cardiopulmonary arrest due to law enforcement restraint and neck compression, classifying it as homicide. It noted contributing factors such as heart disease, fentanyl intoxication, and methamphetamine use, but did not list them as the primary cause.\n\nThe report also found no life-threatening injuries to Floyd, including no evidence of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation, though experts have noted that neck compression can still be fatal without leaving clear physical marks.\n\nAn independent autopsy commissioned by Floyd's family determined he died from asphyxiation due to sustained pressure on his neck and back. It also ruled the death a homicide but emphasized that police restraint was the sole cause, without highlighting preexisting conditions or drug use as significant factors.\n\nSpeaking on his radio show, Shapiro highlighted the fact that drugs were present in Floyd's system and that he had heart disease, both of which have been confirmed by the official autopsy.\n\n\"George Floyd was high on fentanyl; he had a significant pre-existing heart condition,\" Shapiro said .\n\n\"George Floyd was saying he could not breathe before he was even out of the car. He was in the car saying he could not breathe.\"\n\nShapiro argued that there was massive pressure on the jury to find Chauvin guilty-including from top government officials including former President Joe Biden-and that \"there was no opportunity for blind justice to work\" in the case.\n\nChauvin is serving concurrent sentences on state and federal charges, with a potential presidential pardon only applying to the federal case. He has appealed his conviction multiple times, in all instances unsuccessfully.\n\nIn November 2023, Chauvin was stabbed by a fellow inmate, a former gang leader and one-time FBI informant.\n\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who prosecuted Chauvin, said after the stabbing that he was \"sad to hear that Derek Chauvin was the target of violence.\"\n\n\"He was duly convicted of his crimes and, like any incarcerated individual, he should be able to serve his sentence without fear of retaliation or violence,\" Ellison said.\n\nFollowing Shapiro's call for Trump to pardon the former Minnesota police officer, Ellison told CNN that the convictions against Chauvin are \"solid\" and that a pardon would represent \"blatant disrespect for the law.\"\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "The Officer Who Killed Ashli Babbitt Had Long History Of Disciplinary & Training Problems; Report\n\nAuthored by Jonathan Turley,\n\nI have previously written about the dubious investigations of the shooting of Ashli Babbitt on Jan. 6th and the alleged violation of the standards for the use of lethal force by the officer who shot her. I strongly disagreed with the findings of investigations by the Capitol Police and the Justice Department in clearing Captain Michael Byrd, who shot the unarmed protester. Now, Just the News has an alarming report of the record of Byrd that only magnifies these concerns.\n\nLiberal politicians and pundits often refer to multiple deaths from the Jan. 6th riot. In reality, only one person died that day, and that was Babbitt, who was shot while trying to climb through a window.\n\nHowever, the media lionized Byrd and portrayed the killing of the unarmed Babbitt as clearly justified. That is in sharp contrast to the approach that the media has taken in other shootings by law enforcement.\n\nAn unjustified killing by police on that day was inconsistent with the public narrative pushed by the pundits and the press.\n\nAs I have previously written, what occurred on Jan. 6th was a disgrace. However, it was a riot , not an insurrection. (It was certainly not an act of terrorism as claimed by some Democratic politicians). A protest at the Capitol resulted in a complete breakdown of the inadequate security precautions, a failure that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi privately admitted but only recently was disclosed .\n\nThe failure of Pelosi and others to properly prepare for the protest, despite the offer of President Donald Trump of 10,000 National Guard troops , does not excuse the conduct of the rioters who attacked the Capitol, interrupted the constitutional process, and committed property damage.\n\nBabbitt was one of those rioters. She was wrong in her actions, but the penalty for breaking a window and unauthorized entry is not death in this country. I previously spoke with her mother, Micki Witthoeft, and her husband, Aaron Babbitt, about their continuing effort to expose what occurred that day.\n\nThe new report confirms what many of us had previously heard about the Byrd controversy.\n\nBabbitt, 35, was an Air Force veteran and Trump supporter who participated in the riot three years ago. She was clearly committing criminal acts of trespass, property damage, and other offenses. However, the question is whether an officer is justified in shooting a protester when he admits that he did not see any weapon before discharging his weapon.\n\nJust to recap what we previously discussed in the earlier column:\n\nWhen protesters rushed to the House chamber, police barricaded the chamber's doors; Capitol Police were on both sides, with officers standing directly behind Babbitt. Babbitt and others began to force their way through, and Babbitt started to climb through a broken window. That is when Byrd killed her.\n\nAt the time, some of us familiar with the rules governing police use of force raised concerns over the shooting. Those concerns were heightened by the DOJ's bizarre review and report, which stated the governing standards but then seemed to brush them aside to clear Byrd.\n\nThe DOJ report did not read like any post-shooting review I have read as a criminal defense attorney or law professor. The DOJ statement notably does not say that the shooting was justified. Instead, it stressed that \"prosecutors would have to prove not only that the officer used force that was constitutionally unreasonable, but that the officer did so 'willfully.'\" It seemed simply to shrug and say that the DOJ did not believe it could prove \"a bad purpose to disregard the law\" and that \"evidence that an officer acted out of fear, mistake, panic, misperception, negligence, or even poor judgment cannot establish the high level of intent.\"\n\nWhile the Supreme Court, in cases such as Graham v. Connor , has said that courts must consider \"the facts and circumstances of each particular case,\" it has emphasized that lethal force must be used only against someone who is \"an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, and ... is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.\" Particularly with armed assailants, the standard governing \"imminent harm\" recognizes that these decisions must often be made in the most chaotic and brief encounters.\n\nUnder these standards, police officers should not shoot unarmed suspects or rioters without a clear threat to themselves or fellow officers. That even applies to armed suspects who fail to obey orders. Indeed, Huntsville police officer William \"Ben\" Darby was convicted of killing a suicidal man holding a gun to his head. Despite being cleared by a police review board, Darby was prosecuted, found guilty, and sentenced to 25 years in prison, even though Darby said he feared for the safety of himself and fellow officers. Yet law professors and experts who have praised such prosecutions in the past have been conspicuously silent over the shooting of an unarmed woman who had officers in front of and behind her on Jan. 6.\n\nByrd went public soon after the Capitol Police declared that \"no further action will be taken\" in the case. He then demolished the two official reviews that cleared him.\n\nByrd described how he was \"trapped\" with other officers as \"the chants got louder\" with what \"sounded like hundreds of people outside of that door.\" He said he yelled for all of the protesters to stop: \"I tried to wait as long as I could. I hoped and prayed no one tried to enter through those doors. But their failure to comply required me to take the appropriate action to save the lives of members of Congress and myself and my fellow officers.\"\n\nByrd could just as well have hit the officers behind Babbitt, who was shot while struggling to squeeze through the window.\n\nOf all of the lines from Byrd, this one stands out: \"I could not fully see her hands or what was in the backpack or what the intentions are.\" So, Byrd admitted he did not see a weapon or an immediate threat from Babbitt beyond her trying to enter through the window. Nevertheless, Byrd boasted, \"I know that day I saved countless lives.\" He ignored that Babbitt was the one person killed during the riot. (Two protesters died of natural causes and a third from an amphetamine overdose; one police officer died the next day from natural causes , and four officers have committed suicide since then.) No other officers facing similar threats shot anyone in any other part of the Capitol, even those who were attacked by rioters armed with clubs or other objects.\n\nThe new report confirms prior accounts that Byrd had prior disciplinary and training issues. According to Just the News, they included \"a failed shotgun qualification test, a failed FBI background check for a weapon's purchase, a 33-day suspension for a lost weapon and referral to Maryland state prosecutors for firing his gun at a stolen car fleeing his neighborhood.\"\n\nGiven this history and the shooting of Babbitt, Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., the chair of the House Administration Oversight Subcommittee investigation, wrote to express concern over Byrd's promotion to captain. Those incidents included Byrd firing at a car and allegedly misrepresenting the incident in claiming that \"he fired at a vehicle trying to strike him when the evidence fellow officers found at the scene indicated he shot at the vehicle after it had already passed him and no longer posed a threat.\" The letter states the Office of Professional Responsibility found that the evidence did not support his claim and \"OPR concluded that the evidence suggests Byrd 'discharged his service weapon at the vans after they passed him by.'\"\n\nThe concern is that the political environment - and powerful interests in Congress - demanded that Byrd be cleared . As discussed in my new book, \" The Indispensable Right,\" the Justice Department had publicly pledged to bring \" shock and awe \" in prosecuting anyone associated with the riot. Finding that the only person killed that day was an unjustified shooting would not exactly fit with the narrative.\n\nThe incidents also include allegations of improper handling of his weapon, including r eports that Byrd left his service weapon in a public bathroom in the Capitol Visitor Center complex used by tourists and visitors.\n\nThe Babbitt family has continued to fight to force the facts into the open and has filed a civil case. A trial is now set for 2026 .\n\nHere is his letter detailing the disciplinary problems of Captain Byrd: 11.20.2024 Letter From Rep.

      "text": "In The Jan 6 Killing Of Ashli Babbitt, A Leftist Double-Standard On Cop Misconduct\n\nVia Brian McGlinchey at Stark Realities\n\nContrary to exaggerated, partisan rhetoric that frames the Jan 6, 2021 Capitol Hill riot as a \"deadly insurrection,\" the truth is that only one homicide occurred that day. The victim, an unarmed Trump supporter, was shot and killed by a police officer with a history of irresponsible handling of firearms, who opted against a nonlethal response to an act of trespassing , and who fired his weapon in the absence of any imminent threat of death or serious injury to himself or others in his vicinity.\n\nUS Capitol Police (USCP) Lieutenant Michael Byrd's killing of Ashli Babbitt came just six months after George Floyd's death under the knee of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, an incident that sparked outrage, widespread calls for police reform, and nationwide rioting. In the case of Babbitt's killing, however, the collective reaction from the American left and major media at best amounted to an indifferent shrug . Worse, many reflexively heralded Byrd as a hero and viewed Babbitt as a deserving recipient of the bullet that perforated her trachea and lung.\n\nThe contrast illustrates how partisan framing short-circuits people's ability to uniformly and objectively apply principles to the facts before them . Put another way, an intellectually honest person can reject Babbitt's politics, condemn her unlawful conduct on Jan. 6 and rightly conclude that she was the victim of an unjustified police shooting.\n\nIn 2021, the Department of Justice announced it had completed an investigation of the shooting and found \"insufficient evidence to support a criminal prosecution.\" The DOJ did not, however, assert that Byrd's use of deadly force was warranted . Last year, Babbitt's husband filed a civil suit against the federal government, seeking $30 million in damages; the trial is slated to commence in July 2026 .\n\nBabbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran from San Diego who operated a pool business with her husband, attended the \"Save America\" rally in Washington on Jan. 6 before joining others who proceeded to the Capitol grounds. After things escalated and rioters breached the Capitol building, she entered it, and a female police officer reportedly instructed her to walk toward the House side of the complex.\n\nHere's how the DOJ described what happened next; I've bolded three words I'll address shortly:\n\nMs. Babbitt was among a mob of people that...gained access to a hallway outside \"Speaker's Lobby,\" which leads to the Chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives. At the time, the USCP was evacuating Members from the Chamber, which the mob was trying to enter from multiple doorways. USCP officers used furniture to barricade a set of glass doors separating the hallway and Speaker's Lobby to try and stop the mob from entering the Speaker's Lobby and the Chamber, and three officers positioned themselves between the doors and the mob.\n\nMembers of the mob attempted to break through the doors by striking them and breaking the glass with their hands, flagpoles, helmets, and other objects. Eventually, the three USCP officers positioned outside the doors were forced to evacuate . As members of the mob continued to strike the glass doors, Ms. Babbitt attempted to climb through one of the doors where glass was broken out. An officer inside the Speaker's Lobby fired one round from his service pistol, striking Ms. Babbitt in the left shoulder, causing her to fall back from the doorway and onto the floor.\n\nThough it's not narrowly relevant to Byrd's decision to pull the trigger, the DOJ's passive-tense claim that the three officers on Babbitt's side of the doors \"were forced to evacuate\" is important because it indicates an extreme inclination to put the best spin possible on officers' decisions . Video shows those three officers failing to make any meaningful effort to stop those who were hammering the glass doors. After enduring mounting verbal abuse and violations of their personal space, they simply walked away from the doors, clearing the way for the rioters to remove the glass from a side window and for Babbitt to proceed through the opening.\n\nAccording to the 32-page complaint filed in the civil suit, one of those three officers later told investigators, \"I grapple with this, you know, if I should've stayed.\" More pointedly, one of the members of the Containment and Emergency Response Team (CERT) who ascended the stairs from behind the mob told investigators, \"I was thinking why, why the fuck did they leave?\"\n\nSome of the most damning information in the civil complaint comes from Byrd's own mouth. In a 2021 NBC interview conducted by an excessively sympathetic Lester Holt, Byrd said:\n\n\"I could not see exactly what was happening [on the other side of] the door...it's impossible for me to see what's on the other side because we had created such a barricade - it was high enough that the visibility was impossible.\"\n\n\"[Babbitt's] failure to comply required me to take the appropriate action to save the lives of members of Congress and myself and my fellow officers.\"\n\n\"It was later [that] I found out that the subject did not have a weapon, but there was no way to know that at that time , and I could not fully see her hands or what was in the backpack or what the intentions [were].\"\n\n\"Of course we had our weapons drawn as part of our training. You had [false reports of] shots fired onto the House floor, you're trained to take a tactical defensive position and prepare for the threat.\"\n\nThere are many unsettling things about Byrd's statements, chief among them his admission that he saw no weapon in Babbitt's hands, and had \"no way to know\" if she was armed or what her intentions were. \"Without additional information indicating that a person is likely armed, officers cannot conclude that someone has a weapon just because they cannot see definitively that the person does not have a weapon,\" wrote Geoffrey Alpert, Jeff Noble, Seth Stoughton at Lawfare .\n\nAmong other incriminating elements of Byrd's NBC interview:\n\nByrd asserts that Babbitt's mere failure to comply with orders not to proceed through the door justified the use of lethal force.\n\nHe implies that (false) reports of shots fired somewhere else in the Capitol gave him a green light to start shooting noncompliant people in his vicinity; in other words, he seems to have made a blanket assessment that every trespasser in the building posed an imminent danger justifying deadly force.\n\n\"Officers cannot rely on generalized assumptions. They must base their conclusions on specific and individualized facts,\" the Lawfare authors note.\n\nUnsatisfied with merely defending his killing of Babbitt, Byrd used the NBC interview to declare himself as a hero , telling Holt, \"I showed the utmost courage on January 6... I know that day I saved countless lives.\" That latter boast is truly extraordinary, especially considering it was made with the benefit of hindsight. It would be one thing for Byrd to try attributing his deadly decision to a reliance on bad information amid the chaos of Jan. 6; it's another to lionize himself with a baseless claim of rioters' murderous intent.\n\nUnder USCP policy, lethal force is only authorized when \"the officer perceives that the subject poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person.\" As Babbitt rose to awkwardly enter through the open window - where she would next have to awkwardly navigate a furniture barricade on the other side - there was no indication that she had the ability to seriously injure or kill anyone.\n\nAs seen in video of the shooting , Byrd's positioning was problematic; the civil complaint characterizes it as an \"ambush.\" From the perspective of the rioters, Byrd was positioned on the far left, at an angle some 160 degrees from Babbitt, who was on the right side of the doors. Before stepping forward and killing Babbitt, Byrd was tucked inside another doorway, with only his pistol extending past the opening.\n\nIt's very unlikely Babbitt saw his raised pistol and knew she was being threatened with death if she went through the window. Indeed, one of those three officers who inexplicably abandoned the doorway on Babbitt's side told investigators, \"I saw him . . . there was no way that woman would've seen that .\" What's more, Byrd told Holt that he repeatedly screamed \"get back..stop...get back...no,\" but made no claim that he verbally warned Babbitt that she was on the verge of being shot.\n\nBy all indications, Babbitt's unarmed ascent to the window was a circumstance that called for the use of nonlethal force . That could have taken many forms - a firm shove back through the window, yanking her forward to the floor, or perhaps using pepper spray or a taser. While not clear how the various officers were equipped, note that police aren't justified in resorting to deadly force just because it's all they have available. It's telling that, among multiple armed officers on that side of the doorway, Byrd was the only one who opened fire.\n\nThe civil complaint also credibly accuses Byrd of failing to handle his firearm in accordance with USCP policy, by:\n\nUnholstering it before any imminent threat had emerged to justify doing so\n\nFailing to hold his pistol at a \"low ready\" position and instead pointed it at people who posed no imminent threat\n\nPutting his finger inside the pistol's trigger guard, \"tapping it on and off the trigger for at least 14 seconds before he shot and killed Ashli.\" Across law enforcement, the military and in civilian self-defense, it's a universally-embraced principle that one's finger shouldn't be put inside the trigger guard until a decision to fire has been made.\n\nAfter shooting Babbitt, Byrd took to his radio, his voice filled with panic - and a self-serving falsehood . \"We got shots fired in the lobby. We got shots, shots fired in the lobby of the House chamber. Shots are being fired at us and we're sh... uhh, prepared to fire back at them,\" he said, seemingly so desperate to justify his action that he falsely reported coming under fire himself.\n\nIn the aftermath of incidents involving excessive use of force, we often find the officer in question has a blemished service record. That's the case with Byrd, whose checkered past includes irresponsible handling of firearms. In 2019, Byrd was suspended for 33 days after he left his loaded weapon in a Capitol Visitor Center complex bathroom for nearly an hour; it was discovered by another officer.\n\nEven more concerning was a 2004 off-duty incident. Byrd fired his service weapon at a stolen car fleeing his neighborhood - hitting it from behind . Investigators said Byrd's claim that he fired at the car in self-defense as the driver attempted to hit him was \"inaccurate.\"\n\nThey also determined that Byrd put his innocent neighbor in the line of fire as he pulled the trigger. Stray rounds hit nearby homes, according to the Babbitt civil complaint. Foreshadowing Byrd's decision-making on Jan. 6, the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) concluded he'd fired in a \"careless and imprudent manner. \" That finding was overruled, however, via an appeal to the Disciplinary Review Board.\n\nIn another off-duty incident, Byrd was given a seven-day suspension without pay in 2015 after accosting a police officer providing security at a high school football game, showering him with profanities and reportedly calling him \"a piece of shit, asshole and racist\" who was only concerned with policing the \"black side\" of the football field.\n\nFurther underscoring the double-standards at play in the Babbitt case, imagine the response from the left if there were a controversial shooting in which a white male police officer had demonstrated a similar, racially-charged loss of composure years before killing an unarmed black female trespasser.\n\n\"The ironies of Babbitt's death abound-and not just because in this case the cop with the quick trigger finger was black and his victim was a white woman, \" wrote Jonathan Tobin. \"Both those who are supporting Byrd and those who consider the pass he got from his superiors an injustice have probably been on the opposite side of similar controversies in the past year. Some of those who think Babbitt was the victim of a police murder have defended officers accused of killing unarmed black persons. And many who are lauding Byrd as a defender of democracy were outraged by the same killings.\"\n\nStark Realities undermines official narratives, demolishes conventional wisdom and exposes fundamental myths across the political spectrum.

They're like, 'Yeah, no problem. We're going to post guys over here,' \" the officer continues.\n\nThe footage paints a more complete picture of the anger and frustration moments after Thomas Matthew Crooks was able to fire eight shots at the former president from an AR-style assault rifle. A spectator was killed, two others were injured, and Trump suffered a bullet wound to the ear . The Journal obtained the videos under a public-records request Thursday.\n\nA police officer in one of the videos at one point refers to a suspicious individual who had been lost by authorities. The unidentified officer referred to \"a gentleman with a flat face that we were looking for earlier. He was creeping people out.\"\n\nThe officer's account, which was broadcast over radio channels, was captured by one of the body cameras. \"He was watching people out in the woods by the water tower. I'm not sure he is the gentleman down or not,\" the officer says.\n\nAround 10 minutes after the shooting, another officer says to a fellow officer \"I thought you guys were on the roof. I thought it was you. I thought it was you.\"\n\nTo which \"No\" can be heard in response.\n\n\"What the fuck! Why were we not on the roof? Why weren't we?\" the officer replies.\n\nNEW: Butler PA officers at Trump rally after the shooting, discussing that they had warned USSS about vulnerabilities far in advance. \"I f**ing told them to post guys over here. I told the Secret Service Tuesday!\" pic.twitter.com/A367aXZKRR\n\nAs the Epoch Times notes further, the footage also shows the moment an officer with the Butler Township Police Department tried to get on the roof of a building where suspected gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks was perched. Another officer helped lift the responding officer to the roof after rally attendees alerted police that there was an individual on the roof near the rally where Trump was set to speak.\n\nBREAKING: Bodycam video just released shows a police officer being lifted up to the roof of the AGR building, interrupting Thomas Crooks just seconds before he started shooting to assassinate President Trump at the Butler rally. pic.twitter.com/NVU0yR515w\n\nIn the clip, an officer is seen moving toward a building before another officer tries to hoist him onto the roof. The officer is then seen trying to climb onto the building before he drops down.\n\nOnly officers' hands are seen as he tries to get onto the roof in the video, which does not show Crooks.\n\n\"If I'm interrupted, and I move my gun, you are going to have to reassess that whole situation at this point, so yes, you can make a case that those two officers saved the president's life,\" Slupe told the paper.\n\nHe then asked, \"Can you imagine 10 seconds before that? That the president was looking straight ahead and where that bullet could have potentially landed.\"\n\nMore than three weeks after the assassination attempt, federal officials have not disclosed the Crooks's motive. So far, few details have emerged about the suspect, and his family has not issued a public statement responding to the incident.\n\nIt shows an officer with the Beaver County Emergency Services Unit standing next to a dark-suited man, who appears to be a Secret Service agent, according to a press release from Grassley's office.\n\nIn the clip, at least three other law enforcement officials can be seen, although it is not clear exactly how many were present on the roof when the footage was filmed.\n\nOn the ground next to them appears to be the body of Crooks. Although the shooter's body has been partially blurred in the video, a long trail of blood on the roof can be seen.\n\nThe Beaver County officer and the purported Secret Service agent can be heard discussing the timeline of events they believe led up to the assassination attempt, including whether the man lying on the ground next to them is the same man seen in a photo sent out by a member of Beaver County's sniper team.\n\n\"So, this is the guy ... that the sniper saw,\" the agent says.\n\n\" Yes, a Beaver County sniper seen [sic] and sent the pictures out, this is him,\" the officer replies.\n\nThe Secret Service agent then asks whether or not an abandoned bike that was found in the area belonged to the shooter.\n\n\"We don't know,\" the officer responds.\n\nThe Beaver County officer then shows the agent photos on his phone.\n\n\"I don't know if you got the same ones I did?\" the officer asks the agent, referring to the photos.\n\n\"I think I did, yeah, he's [the shooter] got his glasses on,\" the agent replies.\n\nThat footage shows law enforcement talking about a need to use a drone to secure and inspect a water tower that was onsite, according to his office.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "Former DC Officer Fanone Hunkers Down In Blue Ridge Mountains; \"Fully Expects\" Shootout With Trump Agents\n\nAuthored by Debra Heine via American Greatness,\n\nFormer D.C. Metropolitan police officer Michael Fanone is not handling President-Elect Donald Trump's resounding victory Tuesday night very well.\n\nAccording to a sympathetic Washington Post report Thursday, the notorious J6 celebrity cop is holed up in the Blue Ridge Mountains, chugging beers, and preparing for a potential shootout with the Trump agents he believes are coming for him.\n\n\"Better f-ing arm yourselves,\" Fanone told WaPo reporter Kara Voght, as he slammed down his fifth or sixth Sapporo.\n\n\"I didn't vote for that motherf-er,\" he added, \"and I fought tooth and nail to prevent this day from f-ing coming.\"\n\nFanone, 44, has indeed been extremely vocal about his experiences at the U.S. Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, and the injuries he allegedly suffered.\n\nFanone is part of a quartet of celebrity cops juicing every second of their involvement in the four-hour disturbance nearly two years ago, earning lucrative book deals, congressional awards, and cable news gigs in the process.\n\nFanone has lots to say in his memoir - heavily sprinkled with obscenities - while ranting about Donald Trump and his supporters.\n\n(Fanone begins with a brazen lie that Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick died of \"wounds\" sustained on January 6.)\n\nIn December 2022, he told Washington Post reporter Peter Hermann that he had been \"ostracized for being outspoken about the Capitol riot\" by those who want to \"play down the violence that day.\"\n\nHe lamented that members of the MPD's Special Operations Division had called him \"a piece of sh-t,\" after he told everyone that he suffered a heart attack, a concussion and a traumatic brain injury during the riot.\n\nFanone told the Post he'd left the police force not long after he'd testified to Congress in July 2021.\n\nHe published his book, \"Hold the Line: The Insurrection and One Cop's Battle for America's Soul,\" and went on tour with a left-wing J6 activist group called \"Courage For America.\"\n\nThe group - run by Zac Petkanas, a Democratic strategist who previously worked for presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) - \"supports abortion, LGBT interests, liberal immigration-expansion policies, and increased government spending,\" according to Influence Watch.\n\nCourage For America's main goal was to \"Make sure the MAGA agenda doesn't get passed without strenuous opposition.\"\n\nEventually, the J6 grifts wound down and Fanone had trouble finding another source of income.\n\n\"When he came back, he'd tried to get a job-at Walmart, at Costco, at Cabela's-and nothing came through,\" the Post reported.\n\n\"No one gives you a reason, but it's pretty obvious,\" Fanone said.\n\nThat reason, according to the Post is \"his belief that half the country thinks he's a traitor.\"\n\nFanone now runs a private security business.\n\nHis woes were compounded earlier this year when Raw Story reported that \"Trump surrogate\" Ivan Raiklin, a retired Army Reserve lieutenant colonel and former U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency employee, had appointed himself  \"secretary of retribution\" and had compiled an enemies list of 300 \"deep state\" bad actors that included Fanone.\n\nSome of these \"deep state\" actors are reportedly making plans to retire after Trump is sworn in.\n\n\"Moles inside the FBI are telling us that DOZENS of senior executives at HQ are preparing their retirement papers in anticipation of what's to come,\" FBI whistleblower Steve Friend posted on X Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's former Department of Defense Chief of Staff Kash Patel revealed on Thursday that Trump plans a bombshell declassification operation in his second term.\n\n\"He's going to come in there and maybe give them the Epstein list, maybe give them the P Diddy list and they are terrified,\" Patel told conservative podcast host Benny Johnson.\n\nThe Democrats'  hysteria about an alleged \"enemies list\" was stirred up after Trump had declared himself to be \"justice and retribution\" for those who \"have been wronged and betrayed.\"\n\nAs the election returns came in Tuesday night, spelling doom for Democrats, Fanone told Voght \"it's the end of the f-ing world!\" as he smiled \"with a kind of crazed glee.\"\n\nFanone said he'd rather be killed in a shootout than be imprisoned by Trump.\n\n\"I'll die right here on my f-ing house,\" he said. \"I'm not going to be in some 'Apprentice' f-ing military tribunal.\"\n\nFanone insisted that he was not some \"prepper weirdo,\" 'just someone who understands how law enforcement can be weaponized against people\"\n\nHe added:\n\n\"I fully expect that to happen.\"\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

On January 6th 2021, I traveled to Washington DC with my wife Tammie to watch the Trump Rally. As the rally was completing, the President of the United States told the crowd to go to the West Lawn and \"peacefully\" protest, which we did. As we arrived at the West Lawn, the police officers removed the barricades and waved us onto the West Lawn. I had video of this but the FBI later raided my home and confiscated this Video. I never went into the Capital Building or damaged any property but I did later observe people causing damage to the Capital Building so I took a few pictures of these people and then returned to my motel room, we returned home the next morning.\n\nOn January 16th, I was charged with trespassing on the West Lawn on January 6th even though the President had ask me to go there and the police had moved the barricades and waved me onto the West Lawn. The FBI contacted me around midnight and asked me to turn myself into the Federal Marshalls at the Federal Courthouse in Macon by 9:00 am the next morning . I voluntarily turned myself into the Federal Marshalls at the Federal Courthouse in Macon Ga. Upon arrival I was advised by Federal Marshalls that Pelham Police Investigator Adam Lamb, Assistant Chief Rod Williams and Chief Mccormick had turned me in to the FBI after finding out I was in DC.\n\nIn 2020 I was working as a Police Officer for the Pelham Police Department and also owned a Firearms Gunsmithing Company named \"Cazy Coon Armory\" My business was named after my pet Raccoon that was named Rocket but we always called him \"Crazy Ole Coon\". On November 13th 2020, Pelham Police Department Investigator Adam Lamb had showed up to my home stating Police Cheif McCormack had fired me for having a Logo with a picture of a Racoon on it with the words \"Crazy Coon Armory\" telling me that the logo had the word \"Coon\" on it and that made it a Racist Logo. The police department said they didn't know I had an outside business with that name even though it was on my resume and on my application for employment. I had also worked on several of of the Pelham Police Department weapons including pistols and full auto rifles at Crazy Coon Armory. The paperwork they asked me to sign stated I was being fired for being a Racist . I refused to sign this separation letter. After I was fired, without even being giving a chance to resign, I decided to expose the Pelham Police Department and it's very corrupt Chief for several of the crimes they had committed and were committing including insurance fraud, illegal gambling and cover ups. I was posting this corruption on my Facebook Page and the City of Pelhams Facebook Page every night which made the Police very angery and this was the reason for turning me into the FBI so they could silence me.\n\nAfter the Marshalls read me this affidavit, I was put into a jail cell for several hours before being brought before a Federal Magistrate Judge . Even though I was a Law Enforcement Officer with no other criminal record, I was placed in handcuffs, leg irons and belly chains and was advised not to speak . And even though I'm a certified Law Enforcement Officer, have never been arrested or charged with any other crime in my life and had gotten up before daylight and driven over 100 miles to turn myself in, the judge advised me that I was a flight risk and ordered me to wear an ankle monitor, be place under House Arrest, placed on Pre Trial Probation, forced to post $25,000 bond and was placed on Tap 4 internet restrictions saying I couldn't use any computers our internet. At that time I was not allowed to make a plea and was not allowed to plea until over 18 months later. I was appointed a public defender without even being asked . I had a very experienced federal attorney that was willing to take my case for free but I was advised that I could not have an attorney of my choosing and could only hire an attorney from the Washington DC District that was certified to take cases in federal court in DC. The only attorney I could find meeting these requirements wanted over $100,000 plus $10,000 per hearing which I had 5, which would have been a total of $150,000.00 and my case isn't even over yet.\n\nUpon my release from jail late on January 16th, I returned home where my home and firearms business was immediately raided by Federal Agents that were waiting at my property. Numerous Federal Agents searched my home and property without a warrant and all my weapons and ammo were confiscated from my home and from my licensed firearms business, all for a crime that I would not lose my 2nd ammendment rights even if I were convicted. I was forced, with threat of prison, to give Federal Agents:\n\n*My Email Passwords and User Info with written permission to access these accounts. *My Bank Account Passwords *My Bank Account Numbers with written permission to access these accounts. *My Safe Deposit Box Info with written permission to search this box *All my Social Media User Names and Passwords with written permission to access accounts. *I was not allowed to change any password or information without permission from the Federal Government. *I'm not allowed to take out any new lines of credit without prior Government approval. *I was forced to swear under oath that I did not have any money, firearms or other items buried anywhere or have any storage units. *I was forced to swear under oath that I did not have any photographs or videos hidden or buried. *I Was not allowed to possess any phone, camera or recording devices other than the one phone I was allowed by probation to have and the FBI took that phone the next day and kept it for weeks. *I was forced, with threat of prison, to fill out a financial statement listing: *My Checking account balances and passwords *My Savings account balance and passwords *Credit Card Balance, and account information and password. *My vehicle loan information and value *My Vehicle Tag #, Year, Make & Model *My home loan information and home and property value. *The amount of cash on hand. *The value of my clothes. *The value of my home furnishings. *Names, Addresses, Birthdays and Social Security Numbers of all my family members. *Names, phone numbers and Addresses of my friends. *Names, Addresses and Birthdays of any Ex Wives and Children.\n\nEarly the next morning Federal agents confiscated all my FFL files including my FFL Log Book and 4473 files. Later that day, my home was raided again by Federal Agents who confiscated my phone and searched all my computers and electronic devices. My phone was not returned for 2 weeks. I was under court order to not use any other phone or computer so I was without any communication with friends, family or my attorneys for two weeks. This also gave the Federal Government access to all my email and text message communications between my attorney and myself. I was then forced to pay for home phone service and to pay for phone monitoring services and monthly fees for my ankle monitor. Approximately a year later my home was again searched without a warrant and without any explanation and I was threated with a probation condition violation if I complained about the searches of my property and that a probation violation would have a 17 year felony sentence.\n\nThree weeks later, my home was again raided and all my electronic devices including my phone, computer, thumb drives, hard drives and memory cards were searched then confiscated. My desktop computer was confiscated without explanation and Federal Agents said they didn't know when my computer would be returned. This computer contained all the files needed to file my taxes that month, all my social security files I needed to file for my retirement benefits and all my private correspondence between my attorneys. This computer also contained all the software needed to run my business. My computer and phone were not returned for two weeks. When I received my phone back I noticed that all my pictures and videos that I had taken January 6th were missing including the video evidence I had of the Capital Police removing barriers and waving me onto the West Lawn of the Capital that I was charged with trespassing on. I also noticed my FFL Digital Logbook had been removed from my computer and my FFL Logbook backup files had been removed from my Google Drive Account that I had been forced to give the login information. Federal Agents had already taken my hardcopy FFL Logbook and 4473 files in a previous search of my firearms business so they now had all my FFL Files not even leaving me a copy. Even though I've only been charged with a non violent, misdemeanor crime, I've been on house arrest for almost two years for a crime that carries a maximum punishment of less than a year. I have not been allowed to plea in this case.\n\nWhen I asked about my 6th Amendment right to a speedy trial, I was advised by Federal Court Judge Randolph D. Moss that the Sixth Amendment had been suspended due to Covid-19 and the large number of arrest made from the January 6th incident. The Sixth Amendment also gives me the right to a Fair Trial, does this mean I didn't have the right to a fair trail either? I'm not sure how a Federal Court Judge can legally suspend one of the Bill of Rights.\n\nIn June 2022, I was told by prosecutors that I could plea guilty to Trespassing on the Grass or face going to court in Washington DC on several other (made up) felony charges that they knew I had not committed. So because I had no chance of a fair trail and facing several false charges, I was forced to plead guilty to Trespassing on the Restricted West Lawn. My plea agreement stated the maximum amount of probation I could receive would be one year but for this non violent misdemeanor crime, I was sentenced to:\n\n1: Two additional months of House Arrest with Location Monitoring for a total of 18 months. 2: Three additional years of Supervised Federal Probation with travel restrictions for a total of 4 years and 8 months of Supervised Federal Probation even though the plea agreement I had signed stated a maximum of 1 year probation. 3: Firearm Confiscation and Restrictions in clear violation of my 2nd amendment rights. 4: Mandatory random drug testing even though I have no drug history. I have passed all these tests. 5: Mandatory mental health evaluation, even though I have no mental health history. I passed this test. 6: $525.00 in restitution for damage to the Capital Building even though I never entered or even touched the Capital Building. I paid this fine. 7: 60 hours of community service. I completed all the community service.\n\nAfter my sentencing, my home was again searched by a Federal Probation Agent who searched backpacks, closed closets, closed drawers, including my girlfriends underwear drawers even though they had a court order advising that Probation Agents could only take illegal items that are \"In Plain Sight\".\n\nMy home has now been searched 7 times in 4 years . It's been searched by the FBI, the Federal Marshalls, the DOJ, and Federal Probation several times. Everyone always come wearing SWAT vests and heavily armed even though the only crime I've ever been accused of is illegally walking on the grass. The government then, using a fake name and phone number, attempted to send firearms to my FFL business through www.guns . on two different occasions in one week. I recognized this persons voice as Assistant U.S. Attorney Graciela Rodriguez Lindberg. Another person then, using another fake name and number called asking if they could bring a firearm to my business for an appraisal. I recognized this person's voice as my probation officer even though he was giving me another name. I told the person that I could not look at the gun and advised him that my business was closed. I also lied and told this person that I was out of state at the time so they would leave me alone. I'm on travel restrictions and can't go out of state so my probation officer almost immediately called and asked my location and when I told him I was home, a person stating he had just spoken to to me about the gun appraisal arrived at my home even though I had refused to look at the gun and had told him I was out of state. This person had a different voice, was extremely pushy and would not take no for an answer even when I told him several more times that I couldn't look at his firearm. This person then opened his vehicle trunk stating he was going show the gun to me anyway. At this time I drove away on my off road buggy leaving him at my home. When I later returned home this person was gone.\n\nI was then contacted by Police Officer Safety & Training Officials stating my law enforcement certification is being revoked for not reporting my arrest to them even though the federal government had taken my phones, computers, I had federal imposed internet restrictions and was on house arrest with no way to contact POST. Also the Federal Agents who confiscated my phones and computers advised me they would contact P.O.S.T. for me because of all my communication restrictions. Now I've been contacted by the Department of Justice stating they were processing my request for a refund on my FFL renewal even though I haven't requested a refund. The D.O.J. then contacted me by phone and stated my Federal Firearms License is being revoked even though I haven't committed any crime that would prevent me from possessing a firearm or FFL. Today I was contacted by my probation officer stating the ATF had contacted him stating that the ATF had requested me to send my FFL files to the ATF and that I had not responded to their request. I hadn't received any requests from the ATF and can't understand why they contacted my probation officer. The ATF has my phone number, Email Address, Mailing Address, and Physical Address that's required for my FFL, I'm very easy to contact. Even though the ATF field officer is required to do regular inspections of my FFL Business, I haven't be contacted by the field officer since I was arrested three years ago and the only correspondence I've had with the ATF was a letter in February 2023 stating I owed them $90 for my FFL renewal. I sent this letter back with a check which they cashed.\n\nToday the ATF Agent contacted me stating my FFL renewal was denied because I failed a background check and stated I was now a convicted felon and could never own a firearm again . After notifying my attorney, the agent called back the next day stating that the FBI had \"accidentally mis-coded\" my case into the computer and I was not a felon or restricted person but they refused to give my FFL back even though they now had no reason to deny me. The ATF advised me that I was required by law the send them all my FFL Files. I advised the agent that all my FFL Files had been confiscated the day after my arrest. Now I've been contacted by an ATF Agent who stated he couldn't find any agency that would admit taking my files and then threatened me several times with felony charges for Retention of Files for not returning 4473 files that the government had already confiscated 3 years previous. I advised the ATF that my files had been confiscated previously by two unknown government agents who took my files and left without identifying themselves or giving me any paperwork. The ATF Agent called me a liar several times and every time he called me a liar, I hung up on him. I advised the agent that I would try to find a backup copy of my digital log book somewhere but I was going out of state to take my wife to court as a witness in an unrelated case for about a week and that I had court approval for this trip. A few days later I traveled to court about 5 hours away in Tuscaloosa Alabama and asked my neighbor, who is a Newton Georgia Police Officer, to watch my property and feed our animals until we returned home. On the third day out of state, I received a notification from my security system stating my power had been off but was back on. I was told by authorities that the power had went out for about 30 minutes in the entire city of Newton for an unknown reason. I looked at my security cameras to check on my home and animals and noticed a package holding my storm door partially open and it had been placed there while the power and my cameras were out. I asked the officer to check the package and asked if he would make sure someone hadn't mailed a firearm to my home FFL for repair because I'm restricted from possessing firearms . The officer stated that the box didn't have a shipping label and appeared to contain FFL files and folders. It appears that the Federal Agents (DOJ, I believe) who illegally took my files got scared of all the inquiries and returned my files. The only markings on this box was my federal case number. The Officer took the FFL files into evidence, put them into the evidence room at Newton Police Department and contacted the ATF Agent. The next day the officer called me to say he had notified the ATF about recovering the files and that the ATF Agent was going to recover the files from the police department. The ATF continued to threaten me with felony charges of Retention of Files even after the files were recovered by the ATF Agent.\n\nI've contacted my court appointed attorney's office 6 times over the past year advising them that I needed to speak with my attorney with no response other than the secretary advising me that the attorney is very busy. It's now September 2024 and my home has again been searched by the Federal Government who again found nothing illegal in my home. On January 30th 2024, I contacted my attorney's office and asked for a transcript of my motion for a speedy trial. During this previous hearing, I was advised that I didn't have the right to a fair and speedy trial because the 6th Amendment had been suspended by the Federal Court because of Covid and the large number of arrest during January 6th. My attorney's secretary told me that there was no transcript because the judge said there was no court reporter during this hearing and the video of the proceedings are not available to the public. I was also warned at the beginning of that Speedy Trial hearing that it was a Federal Felony for me to record my own hearing.\n\nThis is the type of government corruption that all January 6th defendants have faced and if they can do this to me then they can do it to you one day also. This is just 1 of over 1500 similar stories with many of them much, much worst than mine. January 20th 2025\n\nPresident Donald Trump issued Me and 1500 other January 6th defendants a Full Presidential Pardon.

      "text": "German Cops Affiliated With AfD Face Dismissal Under Govt Decree, Leaked Memo Reveals\n\nAuthored by Thomas Brooke via Remix News,\n\nOfficials who are involved in the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party will be removed from service with the federal police, according to an internal memo leaked to the German newspaper Junge Freiheit .\n\nThe memo refers to a decree issued by Federal Interior Minister Nancy Faeser, of the Social Democrats (SPD). Faeser has warned federal police officers against sympathizing with the AfD and also stated that they should not join the party as members.\n\n\"They should expect to be fired,\" said Faeser.\n\nThe federal police have 54,000 employees, of whom 45,000 are police officers. It is unclear how many officers are currently members of the party, however, many police are members of other parties, which means the decree and threats from Faeser are not about maintaining political neutrality.\n\nFor example, the president of the federal police, Dieter Romann, is a member of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). A screenshot taken from the police intranet was shared exclusively with Junge Freiheit, which reads:\n\n\"If membership in such a party becomes known, there are sufficient actual indications that justify the suspicion of a disciplinary offense, at least if the officer is actively involved in such a party.\"\n\nFinally, there is an open threat of termination for officers found to be members of the party.\n\n\"If disciplinary proceedings are initiated in these cases, officers must expect disciplinary consequences up to and including dismissal,\" the intranet site reads.\n\nTo underline the threat, the words \"disciplinary consequences up to and including dismissal\" are marked in bold in the text.\n\nThe police source who spoke to Junge Freiheit, and wishes to remain anonymous, told the paper:\n\n\"For me, this represents a significant restriction on the free formation of my own will as a police officer. In my opinion, making involvement with a party that represents more than a fifth of the population a criminal offense is an unacceptable curtailment of the basic rights of civil servants - even taking into account the obligation of neutrality. Any activity for the AfD is prohibited.\"\n\nThe internal memo is entitled:\n\n\"Candidacy for a confirmed right-wing extremist party? Not a good idea as a federal civil servant!\"\n\nIt is clear, therefore, that this does not only apply to the police but a range of civil service professions.\n\nDismissal from the civil service is not only sought in the case of candidacy but also for \"other behavior that requires a targeted adoption of the political content of such a party.\" This is \"to be regarded as activism in this sense.\"\n\nThe memo reads that the constitutional state \"cannot tolerate\" this because \"the free democratic basic order is rather endangered if the constitutional state remains inactive and allows officials who are entrusted with state tasks and who are obliged to stand up for the free democratic basic order to question the constitutional order in its absolute core.\"\n\nIn this internal warning, the German Federal Police explicitly refers to a decree of the Federal Ministry of the Interior dated Aug. 29, 2024. This provides for the \"mandatory initiation of disciplinary proceedings\" if one runs for the AfD, which is classified as \"certainly right-wing extremist\" in the German states of Saxony and Thuringia.\n\nFurthermore, the provision applies not only to membership in the AfD but also to membership in \"right-wing extremist groups such as the 'Free Saxons' or the AfD's youth organization, 'Young Alternative.'\n\nIn order to enable the new disciplinary measures against politically undesirable officials, according to the memo, Police Service Regulation 100 (\"Leadership and deployment of the police\") was amended. The Federal Police informs its officers that section 1.5 \"Leadership and Cooperation\" has been revised.\n\nThe AfD is expected to become the second largest party in the Bundestag after the federal elections on Feb. 23 with polls currently placing them on 22 percent - its highest level of support for over a year.\n\nRead more here...\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

The police department reports it was filmed on April 26 in a warehouse parking lot while Herman was on duty for the local precinct.\n\nIn the film, Herman refers to himself as \"Officer Johnson\" and acts as a police officer performing a traffic stop. The driver avoids receiving a ticket by bribing the officer with her exposed breast. According to the police department, Herman caressed the OnlyFans mode's breast during the skit.\n\nThe video exclusively films below his chest area and does not reveal Herman's face.

      "text": "Evidence Mounts - Chauvin Did Not Murder Floyd The strange evolution of the prosecution's asphyxiation charge.\n\nI n his motion for a new trial, former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, through his attorney Eric Nelson, made an obvious point. Quoting case law , Nelson reminded the court of \"the prosecutor's inherently unique role in the criminal justice system, which mandates that the prosecutor not act as a zealous advocate for criminal punishment, but as the representative of the people in an effort to seek justice.\"\n\nHad the State prosecutors set out to honor this mandate and seek justice, they would not have presented the medical evidence they did. In fact, they would not have charged Derek Chauvin with second-degree murder or charged his colleagues as accomplices.\n\nProsecutors knew they had a problem. To make the murder charge stick in the Chauvin case, they had to secure an \"asphyxia\" diagnosis from a physician.\n\nIf justice were the goal, prosecutors would have taken two critical steps to assure that the medical testimony supported the charge of murder. The first was to run a controlled experiment to see if Chauvin's actions could possibly have resulted in the death of George Floyd. The second was to make the court and the defense aware of the potential compromise of its star medical witness, Hennepin County Medical Examiner Dr. Andrew Baker.\n\nDr. John Dunn did run such an experiment, and he made a video of the same. Dr. Dunn comes well credentialed. He is a former member and chair of the medico-legal committee for the American College of Emergency Physicians, board certified in legal medicine, and co-author with a pathologist of a chapter on forensics for a text published by the American College of Legal Medicine. He has followed the case from the beginning, studied the videos, and reviewed Floyd's autopsy report.\n\nNot content to speculate, Dr. Dunn enlisted the help of two men to determine whether or not the prone restraint used by Chauvin on Floyd could have asphyxiated and killed him. He recruited a 230-pound man to play the role of Floyd and a 170-pound man to play Chauvin's role. At the time of the incident, Floyd weighed 223 pounds, and Chauvin, with his gear, weighed about 170.\n\nThe Chauvin proxy applied the handcuffs and placed the \"suspect\" in the prone restraint position. For a 10-minute period, he put his left knee on the man's neck and shoulder, matching the pressure Chauvin put on Floyd. Throughout the experiment, Dunn used a pulse oximeter to monitor the oxygen level and pulse of the man being held in this prone restraint.\n\nAs Dunn attests and the video shows, \"The results were that there was no impact on the oxygen level or the pulse of the restrained man for the full 10 minutes, and no ill effects at the time or two days later when he was interviewed.\" Arguably, Dunn's experiment has more evidentiary value than any contrary proof offered by the State.\n\nDunn believes that Floyd died from cardiac arrhythmia - a lethal heart rhythm. He observes that Floyd was suffering from severe cardiac disease aggravated by the drugs in his system including methamphetamine and fentanyl. \"Exertion and excitement from intoxication and the arrest situation along with the amphetamine stimulant drug effects increase the arrhythmia risk,\" says Dunn.\n\nAs the State's charging documents make clear, even the officers on the scene were aware that Floyd may have been suffering from the severe effects of intoxicants. While restraining Floyd, rookie officer Thomas Lane said to Chauvin, \"I am worried about excited delirium or whatever.\" Chauvin responded, \"That's why we have him on his stomach.\" Chauvin was acting in the interest of Floyd's safety in his positioning, not acting to kill him.\n\nA week or so before Floyd's death, I saw a Kansas City police officer use the same technique on a prone female suspect for at least 10 minutes. My thought on seeing this: 'Thank God, she's white.\" Not wanting to make the officer nervous - the woman was large and violent - I chose not to shoot video. In retrospect I wish I had. The technique does not look good, but the officer in question was able to restrain the woman until backup arrived with no apparent ill effect to her or to him.\n\nProsecutors knew they had a problem. To make the murder charge stick in the Chauvin case, they had to secure an \"asphyxia\" diagnosis from a physician. Neither Dr. Baker nor another forensic pathologist who reviewed the case for prosecutors supported that diagnosis.\n\nSo prosecutors doctor-shopped until the congenial Dr. Martin Tobin, a pulmonologist, essentially recruited himself to the case. With no relevant experience in death investigation, Dr. Tobin charmed the jury and the New York Times into believing that Floyd's drug use and heart problems had nothing to do with his death.\n\nKey to Dr. Tobin's testimony was his contention that Floyd's hypopharynx was cut off by neck pressure. Under oath, Dr. Tobin testified to the existence of research that supports his contention implicating a closed-off hypopharynx in asphyxia deaths. But, tellingly, prosecutors failed to present any such research in support of Tobin's claim.\n\nTobin's testimony would not have sufficed without at least some support from Dr. Baker. In Chauvin's request for a new trial, his attorney cited \"evidence that, under pressure from prosecutors, Dr. Baker altered his findings and conclusions regarding the death of George Floyd.\" This is not an idle accusation.\n\nIn the way of background, Baker prepared the autopsy on May 26, 2020, the day after Floyd died. He met with prosecutors that same day. On May 29, in a criminal complaint charging Chauvin with manslaughter and third-degree murder, the State attested as follows (emphasis added):\n\nThe autopsy revealed no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxiation or strangulation . Mr. Floyd had underlying health conditions including coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease. The combined effects of Mr. Floyd being restrained by police, his underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in the system likely contributed to his death.\n\nIn an amended complaint on June 3, the State upped the charge against Chauvin to \"Second Degree Murder - Unintentional - While Committing a Felony.\" The complaint noted the results of the toxicology test, namely \"the presence of fentanyl and evidence of recent methamphetamine use.\"\n\nNow, however, Baker supplied the State with one new detail that would prove to be essential for conviction: \"The ME listed the cause of death as \"[c]ardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint and neck compression \" (italics added). Baker first announced the \"neck compression\" detail in a June 1 press release.\n\nIn a May 17 article in The American Spectator , George Parry details the nature of the pressure brought to bear on Baker. The conduit for that pressure was Dr. Roger Mitchell, a former Washington, D.C., medical examiner and deputy mayor of Washington. Parry's source was a motion for sanctions against the prosecution filed by attorneys representing Chauvin's partner and alleged accomplice, Tou Thao.\n\nAlthough some questioned Parry's (and my own ) reliance on the Thao motion, three days after Parry's article the State confirmed that Thao's attorneys were over the target. Admitted the State in its response to Thao's motion , \"At some point before Dr. Baker issued his findings and autopsy report on June 1, 2020, Dr. Roger Mitchell, who was acquainted with Dr. Baker professionally as a colleague and fellow forensic pathologist, reached out to Dr. Baker, and they discussed this case\" (italics added).\n\nProsecutors go on to say they learned of Mitchell's conversations with Baker during a routine meeting to discuss the medical aspects of the case on November 5, 2020. \"Ultimately,\" they report, \"the State opted not to utilize Dr. Mitchell as a testifying expert witness.\" They should never have even considered him.\n\nOn July 2, 2020, Mitchell had given an interview to the Guardian , in which he said, \"From what the world has seen, we know that George Floyd's intoxication, or George Floyd's heart condition, played absolutely no part in his death.\"\n\n\"From what the world has seen?\" In that one statement, Mitchell summarized the effect a misleading video snippet was having on the State's case. The mob was now dictating Minnesota justice.\n\nThe increasingly radicalized Mitchell was speaking out wherever he could find a microphone. His diagnosis of society's ills was as skewed as his diagnosis of Floyd's. Mitchell said on a podcast around the same time as his meeting with the prosecutors, \"my people are starving. My people are hungry. My people have foots on their necks.... White supremacy has placed itself at the center disenfranchisement of black and brown people in this country.\"\n\nFive prosecutors and a paralegal sat in on the November 2020 meeting with Mitchell. If anyone recorded the conversation, no one provided the defense with the audio. The four defendants - Chauvin, Lane, Thao, and Alexander Keung - have had to rely on the State's own account of that meeting. Prosecutors surely presented Mitchell's story in its best possible light, but even that light is troubling.\n\nThe accusations against Mitchell in Thao's motion came from the meeting summary prepared by the State and shared with the defense in a belated document dump. The summary was sufficiently well buried that defense attorney Eric Nelson was unaware of the Mitchell meeting at the time of the trial.\n\nThao's motion quotes from the prosecutors' notes taken at the November 5 meeting with Mitchell. Here are some of the highlights:\n\n\"Baker said that he didn't think the neck compression played a part.\"\n\nDr. Mitchell called Dr. \"Baker first to let him know that he was going to be critical of Baker's findings.\"\n\n\"In this conversation, Mitchell said, you don't want to be the medical examiner who tells everyone they didn't see what they saw. You don't want to be the smartest person in the room and be wrong. Said there was a way to articulate the cause and manner of death that ensures you are telling the truth about what you are observing and via all of the investigation. Mitchell said neck compression has to be in the diagnosis.\"\n\nGeorge Parry covered this well, but in brief, Baker told Mitchell neck compression played no role in Floyd's death, and Mitchell threatened to write a disparaging op-ed about Baker in the Washington Post unless he said it did. Thao's attorneys knew what they were saying when they demanded \"sanctions for prosecutorial misconduct stemming from witness coercion.\"\n\nIn an angry response that reads as though written by Keith Olbermann, the State answered Thao by saying, \"These preposterous accusations are simply false, and Defendant Thao does not offer even a shred of evidence to support this baseless conspiracy theory.\" There it is, the ultimate refuge from a losing argument - a charge of \"conspiracy theory.\"\n\nAs Thao's motion noted, Mitchell was not at all coy about his second cited attempt at coercion, namely his efforts to destroy the career of of Dr. David Fowler, the one medical witness to testify in Chauvin's defense. But that is a story for another day.\n\nThe story for today is Chauvin's sentencing in two weeks and his request for a new trial. Time after time, prosecutors have failed to honor their \"inherently unique role.\" On the medical front alone, they either ignored the evidence that cast Chauvin's guilt into doubt or buried it. If their goal truly is \"to seek justice,\" they should at the very least run an experiment comparable to the one performed by Dr. Dunn to put their theory of the case to the test. Even police officers deserve due process, not just the semblance of it.\n\nJack Cashill's latest book, Barack Obama's Promised Land: Deplorables Need Not Apply , is now on pre-sale.

      "text": "Bombshell Claim: Medical Examiners Bullied Over Floyd's Cause of Death Minneapolis police officer's defense alleges that medical witnesses were subjected to coercion and retaliation.\n\nL ast week, counsel for Tou Thao, one of the former Minneapolis police officers charged in the death of George Floyd, filed an explosive motion for sanctions against the prosecution that alleges, among other things, that the testimony of Hennepin County Medical Examiner Andrew Baker in the trial of Derek Chauvin \"was directly and indirectly coerced by the State and its agents\" and that the former chief medical examiner for the State of Maryland, who testified for the Chauvin defense that Floyd's death was due to cardiac arrhythmia, has been subjected to threats against his medical license.\n\nThe motion avers, in part, the following:\n\nOn May 26, 2020, Dr. Baker, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner, conducted an autopsy of Mr. Floyd. On that same date, Dr. Baker advised \"prosecuting attorneys\" that \"[t]he autopsy revealed no physical evidence suggesting that Mr. Floyd died of asphyxiation. Mr. Floyd did not exhibit signs of petechiae, damage to his airways or thyroid, brain bleeding, bone injuries, or internal bruising.\"\n\nIn woke America, due process of law and the right to defend oneself in a court of law must not stand in the way of achieving social justice.\n\nOn May 29, 2020, the criminal complaint against Derek Chauvin stated that the full report of the medical examiner was pending, but that the preliminary findings \"revealed no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation.\"\n\nPrior to June 1, 2020, Dr. Roger Mitchell, former medical examiner for Washington, D.C., called Dr. Baker to discuss these preliminary findings. Citing an \"Exhibit 1\" (not accessible on the court's website), paragraphs 5 and 6 of the motion state the following:\n\n5. Dr. Mitchell spoke with Dr. Baker before Dr. Baker finalized his findings on June 1, 2020. Id. During the conversation between Dr. Mitchell and Dr. Baker, the following transpired:\n\na. Dr. Mitchell \"called Baker and said first of all Baker should fire his public information officer.\" Id.\n\nb. \"Then Mitchell asked [Baker] what happened, because Mitchell didn't think it sounded like Baker's words\". Id.\n\nc. \"Baker said that he didn't think the neck compression played a part ... \" Id.\n\n6. Over the weekend, Dr. Mitchell thought about Dr. Baker more. Id. After the phone conversation between Dr. Mitchell and Dr. Baker, Dr. Mitchell decided he was going to release an op-ed critical of Dr. Baker's findings in the Washington Post. Id. Dr. Mitchell first called Dr. Baker to let him know. Id. The following transpired:\n\na. Dr. Mitchell called Dr. \"Baker first to let him know that he was going to be critical of Baker's findings\". Id. \"In this conversation, Mitchell said, you don't want to be the medical examiner who tells everyone they didn't see what they saw. You don't want to be the smartest person in the room and be wrong. Said (sic) there was a way to articulate the cause and manner of death that ensures you are telling the truth about what you are observing and via all of the investigation. Mitchell said neck compression has to be in the diagnosis.\" Id. (Emphasis in original.)\n\nAccording to the motion, following these conversations, Dr. Baker issued a press release in which the \"final autopsy findings included neck compression,\" which was \"contrary to Dr. Baker's conclusion before speaking with Dr. Mitchell twice.\"\n\nThe motion later addresses the purported actions of Dr. Mitchell in regard to Dr. David Fowler, former chief medical examiner of the State of Maryland, who testified for the defense in the Chauvin trial \"that in his opinion the death [of Mr. Floyd] was undetermined.\"\n\nIn fact, Dr. Fowler testified that Mr. Floyd died while being restrained by the police of a sudden onset cardiac arrhythmia due to his heart disease, which included high blood pressure and narrowing of the arteries. He added that the presence of fentanyl and methamphetamine in Floyd's system were contributing factors as was \"possible\" carbon monoxide poisoning from auto exhaust.\n\nAs set forth in the motion, eight days after Dr. Fowler's testimony, Dr. Mitchell \" wrote an open letter \" to Maryland's attorney general, the director of the Maryland Department of Health, the United States attorney general, and the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, calling for an \"immediate investigation into the practices of the physician [Dr. Fowler] as well as the practice of the Maryland State Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) while under his leadership.\" The letter also stated that Dr. Fowler's opinion testimony was \"baseless, revealed obvious bias, and raised malpractice concerns\" and \"is outside the standard practice and conventions for investigating and certification of in-custody deaths\":\n\nOur disagreement with Dr. Fowler is not a matter of opinion. Our disagreement with Dr. Fowler is a matter of ethics. The disingenuous testimony of Dr. David Fowler exposes the frailty of the current Medical Examiner/Coroner System and illustrates the lack of existing oversight and uniformity of practice. If forensic pathologists can offer such baseless opinions without penalty, then the entire criminal justice system is at risk.\n\nThe letter calls for, among other things, \"Investigation into the medical license of [Dr. Fowler] for possible ethical violations associated with death in custody diagnosis.\"\n\nThe letter, which was publicly circulated, has a \"click to sign\" feature. As reported by the Baltimore Sun , the letter was \"signed by 431 doctors from around the country.\"\n\nThe motion seeks disclosure of evidence purportedly in the possession of the prosecution to \"determine whether Dr. Mitchell was a state-actor/agent when he threatened Dr. Baker and/or Dr. Fowler.\" How that discovery will play out and whether sanctions will be imposed against the prosecution remain to be seen.\n\nAnd it also is an open question as to whether the defense can prove the claim that Dr. Mitchell committed the \"crime of coercion\" by threatening to \"unlawfully injure Dr. Baker's trade unless Dr. Baker changed his autopsy findings.\"\n\nBut, in the meantime, Dr. Mitchell's open letter regarding Dr. Fowler's purported \"ethical violations,\" which demands an \"investigation into\" Dr. Fowler's medical license, seemingly supports one of the motion's most damning allegations, to wit:\n\nDr. Mitchell has set the stage that he will threaten the trade and professional reputation of any physician who suggests that Mr. Floyd's death could be labeled as \"undetermined.\"... Dr. Mitchell has essentially stated that any medical expert who wants to testify that Mr. Floyd's death could be undetermined should, and will, face penalties by him. Dr. Mitchell's accusations and spurring of legal fallacies creates a chilling effect for Mr. Thao and violates his due process rights in that it has become extraordinarily difficult to find medical experts who are willing to state that Mr. Floyd's death was undetermined in fear of their professional reputation and licensure.\n\nGiven Dr. Mitchell's open letter, this averment is a masterpiece of lawyerly understatement. And, placed in the context of the threatened mob violence that has permeated and polluted the prosecution of these former Minneapolis police officers, it doesn't begin to state the enormity of the problem facing the defense.\n\nIn that regard, consider the threat sent to Barry Brodd, the retired police officer and use-of-force expert who testified during the Chauvin trial that the defendant's actions had been reasonable and met the standards of accepted police protocols.\n\nWithin a matter of days following his testimony, Brodd's former home in California was vandalized. According to the New York Post , three women, Rowan Dalbey, 20, Kristen Aumoithe, 34, and Amber Lucas, 35, have been arrested and charged with felony vandalism of that residence.\n\nLucas is reportedly a self-professed Black Lives Matter activist who attended protests in the aftermath of George Floyd's death and is also, according to her social media, a lifestyle and wine influencer, as well as a commissioner for the Commission on the Status of Women in Sonoma County.\n\nPolice allege that the women struck the property in the early morning hours of April 17, days after Brodd testified in the Chauvin case. The trio allegedly smeared pig's blood on the front door and garage of the residence and tossed a pig's head onto the front porch.\n\n\"It appears the suspects in this vandalism were targeting Mr. Brodd for his testimony,\" said a police spokesman. \"Mr. Brodd has not lived at the residence for a number of years and is no longer a resident of California.\"\n\nAnd so it goes. Apparently it's not enough to force Thao and the other police defendants to stand trial in a venue where they have no hope of having their fate decided by a fair and impartial jury uninfluenced by the threat of mob violence. Now they also must contend with the efforts of those who, by their retaliation against the Chauvin defense witnesses, have given examples of what may happen to anyone contemplating testifying on behalf of Thao and his co-defendants.\n\nSo it is that, in woke America, due process of law and the right to defend oneself in a court of law must not stand in the way of achieving social justice.\n\nNothing must be left to chance.\n\nGeorge Parry is a former federal and state prosecutor.

      "text": "Mammas, Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cops Fear the algorithms, not just the danger.\n\nF our law enforcement officers were shot dead in Charlotte, North Carolina, last week. On hearing the news, I was reminded of my mother's frequent warnings about police work. Her message? Steer clear. With her husband and her brother patrolling the mean streets of Newark, she didn't need the added anxiety of having her sons do the same. Today, for the children and spouses of cops, that anxiety must be unbearable - and not just because of the obvious danger.\n\nYou may not have heard of the Charlotte shooting. It vanished from the national news in a flash. Despite the magnitude of the offense, within two or three days the national media had dropped the story cold.\n\nThe demographics of the case dictated its disappearance.\n\nREAD MORE from Jack Cashill: After Three Days of Deliberation, Jan. 6 Jury Convicts Great-Grandmother Rebecca Lavrenz\n\nThe New York Times article, \"What We Know About the Shooting in Charlotte,\" established the template. Although this was \"one of the deadliest recent attacks on law enforcement in the United States,\" the Times felt no obligation to mention the race - or show photos - of the officers or the perp. For the record, Terry Clark Hughes Jr. was black and the four dead officers white . If you read this publication, you likely surmised that. The media algorithms have become that obvious.\n\nAfter the shootout, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper told the Times what the media selectively forgets: \"Dangerous assignments are part of the job, but [the police] step up and do it anyway to protect our communities and protect our families.\" Danger has always been part of the job. For some young people, it makes the job attractive. If potential recruits steer clear of urban police departments - almost all are perilously understaffed - it is not the fear of bad guys that dissuades them. It is the fear of the algorithms.\n\nHaving served on the Kansas City Police Department (KCPD) in a different era, Master Detective Albert DeValkenaere did not discourage his son Eric from following in his footsteps. For 20 years , Detective Eric DeValkenaere did his job efficiently and honorably while raising a loving family on his modest salary. His virtues, however, offered no protection against the algorithms. The headlines spell out his fate:\n\nThe \"black man\" who died at the hands of DeValkenaere had the same last name - \"Lamb\" - as the ironically named black \"victim\" in Tom Wolfe's 1987 novel Bonfire of the Vanities . What Wolfe wrote as satire has become media boilerplate.\n\nToday, almost every urban area has a DeValkenaere or two, a white police officer presumed guilty of \"killing a black man,\" a grave offense found in no criminal code but applied as though it were. These media dramas inevitably feature black men as innocents - honor students, gentle giants, little boys with Skittles - and whites, ideally cops, as evil. Kansas City's Cameron Lamb, the media told us, was the loving father of three boys.\n\nWhat makes this case noteworthy is that DeValkenaere has a Republican attorney general, Andrew Bailey, willing to fight for him. In the respondent's brief Bailey prepared for the Missouri Court of Appeals, Western District, Bailey described in detail how the algorithms played out for DeValkenaere that December day in 2019.\n\nLamb, 26, began his final day by striking his live-in girlfriend Shanice Reed and throwing her belongings onto the sidewalk. The pair continued to argue outside. When Reed fled in her purple Mustang, Lamb chased her in his red pickup truck. The vehicles flew past KCPD officer Adam Hill on residential streets at speeds up to 90 miles per hour. Hill thought there was a \"rolling disaster going down the streets\" and requested a police helicopter to follow the vehicles.\n\nAt some point, Lamb gave up the chase and headed home. Still angry, he was driving in excess of 60 and blowing through red lights. The call went out to detectives DeValkenaere and Troy Schwalm in separate cars. Independently both concluded, in Schwalm's words, \"there was something more to it versus just driving fast.\"\n\nThe helicopter officer directed Schwalm and DeValkenaere to the back of a house where Lamb seemed to be stashing his truck. \"[B]e careful,\" he told them. \"I last saw him in the area underneath the trees behind the house.\"\n\nSchwalm took the lead. After parking in front of the house, Schwalm walked down a shared driveway toward the backyard, gun in the \"low ready\" position. DeValkenaere walked up the cluttered far side of the house to provide backup.\n\nWhen Schwalm approached, Lamb was trying to back the truck into a garage beneath the house, an uneasy fit. Schwalm told him to put the truck in park. Lamb refused to comply. Walking into a situation \"nature unknown,\" DeValkenaere advanced around the far side of the house, gun at low ready.\n\nLooking down at the truck from a retaining wall, he saw Lamb reach for a gun beneath his seat. He shouted, \"[H]e's got a gun, he's got a gun,\" but refrained from shooting until Lamb brought the gun \"up and around the left-hand side of the steering wheel.\"\n\n\"I can't let this happen,\" DeValkenaere reflected - the \"this\" meaning the shooting of his partner. DeValkenaere fired a shot into the center mass of Lamb's body, retreated briefly around the corner of the house, and fired three more rounds in Lamb's direction. As DeValkenaere testified, he would not have shot the driver \"had he not pointed that gun at my partner.\" Schwalm did not have a clear line of sight into the truck.\n\nAfter the shooting, DeValkenaere did not touch Lamb or his gun. Several other KCPD officers arrived soon after the shooting - two within 30 seconds - and took over the scene. At least four other officers would testify they saw the gun on the ground below Lamb's dangling left arm. One used his foot to pin the gun to the ground in case Lamb was still alive. Crime scene investigators verified the presence of the gun. Later, the medical examiner found two live rounds in Lamb's pocket.\n\nNone of this mattered to Jackson County, Missouri, Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker. Although not an official Soros plant, she might as well be. Appointed prosecutor in 2011, Baker was elected twice thereafter in this heavily Democratic county. Baker's official profile boasts of her \"being unafraid of tackling difficult cases.\" She seems particularly proud of those cases in which she and her colleagues \"convicted a series of police officers accused of wrongly using excessive or deadly force on citizens.\"\n\nDeValkenaere was one of those officers, a trophy on Baker's mantle. Charged with \"involuntary manslaughter in the first degree and armed criminal action,\" he went to trial in November 2021, six months after Derek Chauvin's trial in Minneapolis. Fearing a jury as frightened as Chauvin's, DeValkenaere and his team opted for a bench trial. Circuit court Judge J. Dale Youngs presided.\n\nBaker's prosecutors made the outrageous claim that DeValkenaere or another cop must have planted the gun, but Youngs made no reference to this in his ruling . In fact, he found DeValkenaere's testimony and that of the officers \"very credible.\" He conceded, too, that DeValkenaere had gone to the back of the house \"to provide cover for Sergeant Schwalm who had rushed into the backyard with his weapon drawn.\"\n\nIn sentencing DeValkenaere, Youngs applied the Chauvin standard. Lest the \"community\" think him too lenient, he explained that \"Eric Devalkenaere is not Derek Chauvin who murdered George Floyd.\" As I've argued in these pages and at length, Chauvin did not \"murder\" George Floyd. Like DeValkenaere, he was guilty of policing while white.\n\nFor Youngs, the \"one issue of law that ... countermanded every other factual issue in the case\" was whether Schwalm and DeValkenaere were \"lawfully present on the premises when they engaged Cameron Lamb.\" After reflecting on the nuances of the Fourth Amendment, Youngs found DeValkenaere guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the second degree and armed criminal action and sentenced him to six years in prison. That simple. The community approved.\n\nAttorney General Bailey was stunned. He argued that Lamb had no right under any circumstances to point a gun at the officers. \"In short,\" Bailey contended, \"even if he trespassed or committed a constitutional violation by unlawfully entering the curtilage, DeValkenaere did not act with criminal negligence in shooting Mr. Lamb. To the contrary, DeValkenaere lawfully used force to defend Schwalm from Mr. Lamb's use of unlawful, deadly force.\"\n\nCuriously, a year after the trial, Baker seemed to agree that a person has a right to defend an endangered partner. Said Baker's office , \"Missouri law governs this case, specifically self-defense and defense of others, leading us to decline charges after a careful review.\" The woman they declined to charge had killed a Kansas City fireman.\n\nThe fireman had intervened to stop her beau from harassing a female clerk at a convenience store. Angry, the young man rushed to his car to retrieve a handgun illegally converted to fully automatic. In the parking lot, the two men struggled over the gun. The fireman got the best of the struggle and had the young man subdued when he managed to hand the gun off to his girlfriend. She promptly shot the fireman in the back, killing him. Needless to say, the woman and her beau were black, the fireman white. The algorithms giveth, and they taketh away.\n\nDevalkenaere's father, Albert, understood the political calculus. In a heartfelt missive, he shared several facts of his son's case that the media chose not to. Lamb, it appears, had good reason to flee. Both the gun and the truck were stolen, and he was under the influence of at least two narcotics. He had also beaten his girlfriend that morning and may have suspected the cops were aware of that.\n\nWhat Bailey did not mention in his brief is what the media could not mention enough: The white Devalkenaere shot a \"black man.\" In Democratic strongholds like Jackson County, that is the algorithm that drives justice and that has been driving would-be officers away from Kansas City.\n\nWhile the city's homicides are at a record high - including an embarrassingly visible murder at the Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl parade - police staffing levels are at a record low, with some 300 spots unfilled . Area mammas have gotten the message: They're not letting their babies become police officers.\n\nBailey was making his pitch as much to Missouri's Republican governor, Mike Parson, as he was to the appeals court, which, for procedural reasons, refused to reverse the ruling by Youngs. The lame duck Parson represents Devalkenaere's last hope. God willing he will find the stones to ignore the mobs and the media and do the right thing.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "Who Had Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick 'Murdered'? His reported 'death by fire extinguisher' was no accident. Congress needs to find out pronto who ordered the hit.\n\nT his plot seems too diabolical to be true, but true it is. Late in the day of January 7, 2021, unknown operatives within the D.C. establishment made the conscious decision to have Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick \"murdered.\" Two of them relayed the news of the Sicknick murder to the New York Times . Reporters Zolan Kanno-Youngs and Tracey Tulley described these operatives as \"law enforcement officials.\"\n\nBabbitt was, in fact, one of four protestors to die that day, three as a result of police action.\n\nIn the unrevised version from January 8, 2021, the reporters told Times readers that \"pro-Trump rioters ... struck [Sicknick] in the head with a fire extinguisher.\" For authenticity's sake they added this chilling detail: \"With a bloody gash in his head, Mr. Sicknick was rushed to the hospital and placed on life support.\"\n\nTo secure Sicknick's status as a martyr to the cause of democracy, the operatives saw to it that Sicknick's cremated remains were laid in honor in the Capitol Rotunda. The previous last American to be so honored was Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and, before her, civil rights hero John Lewis. Sicknick's remains were then buried with full honors at Arlington National Cemetery. He had served six years in the Air National Guard.\n\nIn analyzing a given event, it is sometimes hard to distinguish conspiracy from incompetence. In this case, incompetence led to conspiracy. At 2:44 p.m. on January 6, a panicky Capitol Police officer, Lt. Michael Byrd, ignored all standard police protocol and fatally shot 35-year-old Ashli Babbitt, a 14-year Air Force veteran. This shooting was part of no one's plan. (READ MORE from Jack Cashill: First, They Came for the J6ers )\n\nByrd was positioned on the far side of the heavily barricaded doors leading to the House lobby. On the exposed side stood three Capitol Police officers. A few minutes before the shooting, Babbit had walked by herself down the long, narrow corridor leading to the lobby doors.\n\nFollowing her was citizen journalist Tayler Hansen who recorded her movements. Hansen offered the officers some water, while Babbitt joked with them. These were her people. She had spent most of her military career in police work.\n\nWithin a minute or two, a trailing crowd of roughly thirty people quickly filled up the hallway behind Babbitt. In that crowd was Zachary Alam, thirty, a repeat offender with no social media ties to Donald Trump or MAGA. Alam moved to the front of the crowd, reached between the officers, and began punching the glass panels while yelling, \"F*** the blue.\"\n\nAppalled by Alam's behavior, Ashli's police training kicked in. \"Call f***ing back-up!\" she shouted at the feckless officers as they stood in place with their backs to the doors, doing nothing. \"She was basically yelling at these officers telling them to do their jobs,\" said Hansen.\n\nFor more than a minute after the first window was cracked, protestors argued with the officers but did not touch them or threaten them. Nor did they smash any more windows. In a subsequent press release the Department of Justice (DOJ) observed, \"Eventually, the three USCP officers positioned outside the doors were forced to evacuate.\" The video does not bear this out at all. The officers were not in any imminent danger.\n\nAs soon as the officers pulled away, Alam grabbed a helmet from a protestor and broke out all the glass from the transom on far the right side. \"Ashli was actively trying to disarm these people,\" said Hansen, \"trying to calm them down through this entire kind of confrontation with these police officers.\"\n\nAfter yelling for Alam to stop, Ashli took matters into her own hands, literally. A southpaw, she yanked at Alam's backpack with her right hand. As he spun around, she slugged him square in the face with her left fist. His glasses flew off on impact.\n\nFleeing the madness, Ashli hopped with some assistance into the window frame now fully free of glass. Only a person as small as she could have managed that feat. Just seven seconds after she slugged Alam, said Hansen, \"Michael Leroy Byrd ended up issuing the kill shot with no verbal warning.\"\n\nComplicating matters for the operatives was that the shot had been recorded by John Earle Sullivan, a black provocateur with BLM roots. Sensing a payday for his footage, Sullivan had his agent contact CNN on January 6 and enter into a one-week agreement for use of the critical forty-four seconds. CNN paid him $35,000.\n\nThis video undermined the Democrat narrative. Babbitt was, in fact, one of four protestors to die that day, three as a result of police action, but her death was the most visible. The shooting of a petite, attractive, unarmed young Air Force veteran made it difficult to sell the saga of heroic police officers fending off a rabid mob, especially since all the dead were J6ers, and none of the police was seriously injured.\n\nSara Carpenter, one of ten women I profile in my new book, Ashli: The Untold Story of the Women of January 6 , shed unwitting light on the plot to \"murder\" Sicknick. A medically retired NYPD officer, Carpenter was driving back to New York after her day at the Capitol when she called an old friend who lived in Maryland.\n\nWhen Carpenter mentioned where she had been that day, her friend started screaming at her, \"You killed somebody,\" the \"you\" referring to the protestors. \"You killed a Capitol Police officer with a fire extinguisher.\" The friend's husband had once been a Capitol Police officer. Carpenter presumed he had inside information.\"It sent me reeling,\" she told me.\n\nFortunately for the operatives, the 42-year-old Sicknick just happened to die on January 7 from a stroke. They then wedded Sicknick's real death to the fire extinguisher rumor and commissioned the aforementioned \"law enforcement officials\" to sell this cruel fiction to the New York Times . It appeared under the shocking headline, \"He Dreamed of Being a Police Officer, Then Was Killed by a Pro-Trump Mob.\"\n\nIndependent journalist Glenn Greenwald made a screen shot of the Times account before it could be revised. \"This horrifying story about a pro-Trump mob beating a police officer to death was repeated over and over, by multiple journalists on television, in print, and on social media,\" said Greenwald. He called this counterfeit murder \"the single most-emphasized and known story of the event.\" It cowed the entire GOP into silence.\n\nThe D.C. medical examiner's office performed Sicknick's autopsy on January 8. To preserve his fictional murder as fact, the medical examiner sat on the autopsy report for more than 100 days and might never have released it were it not for pressure from a Judicial Watch lawsuit .\n\nThere is considerable debate as to whether January 6 was a trap or even an inside job. Beyond debate is the fact that someone had Brian Sicknick murdered. His reported \"death by fire extinguisher\" was no accident. Congress needs to find out pronto who ordered the hit.\n\nJack Cashill's new book, Ashli: The Untold Story of the Women of January 6 , is now available for purchase.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "'Shots Fired! Shots Fired!' Bryan Pray and others prove that the media presents a skewed narrative of policing in America.\n\nT he police officer keyed his microphone and spoke the two most important words of his career: \"Shots fired.\" He had just fatally shot a man, in the kind of split-second life-or-death decision that every law enforcement officer trains for, but none of them ever wants to experience. He repeated the communication several times - \"Shots fired!\" - and then added, \"Send all units.\"\n\nWhen fellow officers arrived, Officer Bryan Pray was emotionally distraught by what had happened. \"I can't even talk right now, man. I didn't want that to happen to him, man.\" The policeman in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, had just killed Kevan Ruffin, after a nightmarish encounter in the early-morning hours of July 2.\n\nOfficer Pray had been dispatched by a 911 call shortly before 6 a.m. reporting a disturbance involving a knife-wielding man. Arriving at the scene of the incident, the officer found a woman crying hysterically. She said she had been attacked by a black man with two knives or swords, who looked at her with \"pure hatred\" on his face and called her \"the devil in the flesh.\" She had escaped without serious injury, and her attacker had gone eastbound up an alley toward South 15th Street.\n\nOfficer Pray got back in his patrol car and went in pursuit. He spotted Ruffin, pulled over on the opposite side of the street, parked the vehicle, stepped out and addressed the suspect: \"How you doing, Ruffin? Are you fine this morning?\" Ruffin was known to Sheboygan police; he suffered from mental illness, and his mother had called police the day before to advise them that his problem was getting worse. Just how much worse, Officer Pray quickly learned. As soon as he stepped out of his patrol car, Ruffin crossed the street and advanced toward him. \"Step back,\" the cop warned, pointing his taser. \"You're gonna get tased, bro.\"\n\nRuffin continued advancing slowly, a knife in each hand, then suddenly charged full-speed. Officer Pray fired the taser, but it didn't halt Ruffin's charge, and next the cop pulled his pistol, retreating as he yelled, \" Step back! You will get shot! \" He fired three shots, but Ruffin seemed unfazed. Officer Pray was now sprinting away from his enraged assailant as he fired four more shots. After the seventh shot, Ruffin fell face-down in the street, and Officer Pray then sent the radio call: \"Shots fired! Shots fired! Four-fifty-eight, headquarters, shots fired!\"\n\nWhat had happened in the middle of South 15th Street was tragic and, in hindsight, perhaps avoidable. Maybe if Kevan Ruffin's family had been able to get him institutionalized before he began hearing voices, or maybe if Officer Pray had stayed in his patrol vehicle instead of stepping out into the street, that fatal encounter could have been avoided. Under the circumstances, however, Ruffin's attack left Officer Pray with no alternative and, earlier this month, the local prosecutor concluded his investigation and announced that no charges would be filed . \"Officer Pray's actions were reasonable and unfortunately his use of deadly force was necessary,\" Sheboygan County District Attorney Joel Urmanski wrote.\n\nAbout 100 miles south of Sheboygan, the town of Kenosha erupted in three nights of destructive riots after a police officer shot Jacob Blake, with powerful Democrats like Joe Biden declaring that Blake's death demonstrates the power of \"systemic racism\" in America. Yet it is unlikely that Biden or any other leading Democrat could tell you how many people are shot by police in an average year, nor could they meaningfully discuss the racial breakdown of those cases.\n\nThe next time Biden emerges from his basement isolation, perhaps someone should ask him if he's ever heard of Kevan Ruffin. Of course, that would be unfair because, unless you live in Sheboygan, you probably never heard about Ruffin's death, which is not one of the cases the media have turned into a national cause célèbre . Indeed, I never would have heard of this shooting in Sheboygan had I not gotten in the habit of watching a YouTube channel called \"Police Activity.\" Police departments across the country are now using body cameras that record officers' interactions with the public. The Police Activity channel features those videos made public, as is often the case in what are called \"officer-involved shootings.\"\n\nWhat you learn from watching these videos is how quickly and unexpectedly a law enforcement officer's job can go from routine to life-or-death. Consider an incident that happened last year in Buena Park, California. Officer Bobby Colon and Officer Jennifer Tran were on patrol when Officer Colon, riding in the passenger seat of the patrol car, noticed a Range Rover with an expired tag. He instructed Officer Tran to hit the blue lights and make a traffic stop. Questioned by Officer Colon, the driver of the Range Rover seemed cooperative, and claimed that the vehicle belonged to his cousin. Officer Colon told the drive to \"hang on,\" and returned to the patrol car, where he learned by radio dispatch that the Range Rover had been reported stolen.\n\nThis was now what cops call a \"felony stop,\" and standard procedure would have authorized the two officers to draw their pistols and command the driver to exit the stolen vehicle. However, because the driver, 18-year-old David Patrick Sullivan, \"continued to be calm and cooperative.\" the officers decided against that, not wishing to unnecessarily \"escalate\" the situation. They exited the patrol car and approached the Range Rover, where Officer Colon opened the door and asked Sullivan to \"step out of the car.\" Suddenly, Sullivan started the Range Rover, shifted into reverse, rammed the police patrol car and went careening backwards, running over a sign and hitting another vehicle. Sullivan exited the Range Rover, yelled obscenities at the cops, and charged toward Officer Colon, who opened fire with his pistol. Within a few seconds, after Officer Tran had also fired, Sullivan fell to the ground.\n\nWhat happened? As it turned out, Sullivan had gone to his job that morning at a convenience store, stolen about $2,000 worth of cash and merchandise from his employer, then stolen the Range Rover from a customer. Evidently the teenager expected to get away with his crimes and became enraged at the cops who foiled his caper. After an investigation that lasted nearly 10 months, Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer concluded that \"Officers Colon and Tran were reasonably justified in believing that Sullivan posed a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to themselves, and nearby civilians,\" and they were cleared of any wrongdoing.\n\nUnless you live in Southern California (or watched bodycam video of the incident on Police Activity's YouTube channel ), you never heard about the shooting of David Sullivan. He was white, and therefore the national media didn't care about him getting shot by cops. It is only when cops kill a black suspect that CNN and the rest of the media mob shift into 24/7 coverage mode, with hourly updates to incite racial tensions and provoke \"mostly peaceful protests\" that invariably turn into violent riots. This kind of sensational media coverage gives the public a distorted picture of crime and law-enforcement in America. In fact, as researcher Heather Mac Donald has pointed out , last year police shot more unarmed white suspects (25) than unarmed black suspects (14). The Left's rhetoric about \"white privilege\" and \"systemic racism\" simply don't match the facts.\n\nLots of people get shot by police without CNN ever mentioning their deaths. In June, a drunk man began threatening customers at a grocery store in Glendale, Arizona. When police showed up, they found the man in the parking lot, brandishing a knife. He advanced toward Officer Meghan Lyall, obscenely threatening to kill her and ignoring her repeated commands to drop the knife - until she shot him . Jon David Brouseau, 55, survived. He was white, so there was no 24/7 CNN coverage, no protests, no riots.\n\nNor did CNN pay any attention to the July 4 shooting of David Garcia in Phoenix. Cops showed up at a house where a man had been threatened with a knife. As they investigated the scene, police noticed Garcia, 28, asleep in a car in the driveway of the home. For about 10 minutes, officers questioned Garcia and asked him to step out of the car. And then one of officers saw that Garcia had a pistol. A few seconds later, Garcia was shot dead. No riots. No national media coverage. Apparently, it is only black lives that matter to the media this election year.\n\nNone of this means anything one way or another about the Jacob Blake shooting in Kenosha, or the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, or any of the other similar cases that have become the subject of national controversy. The mobs carrying protest signs, hurling bricks at cops, smashing windows, and looting stores are being manipulated by distorted media coverage. If these rioting mobs would just stay home and watch Police Activity videos on YouTube, they'd get a more realistic picture of what cops face every day.\n\nOfficer Bryan Pray, who shot Kevan Ruffin, is himself black, and had tried hard to build good relationships with the black community in Sheboygan. A former football star, Officer Pray had \" worked with the Black Lives Matter movement and spoke out about police reform recently .\" But when Ruffin suddenly charged at him, Officer Pray had to make a split-second decision. After the shooting, he broke down in tears. A police lieutenant asked if he was all right. \"Physically, I am fine,\" he answered, \"but emotionally ... I just killed somebody, man.\"\n\nIt's a tough job, being a cop. Maybe the media, the protest mobs, and the politicians ought to express some gratitude toward the men who do that job.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "Chauvin Did Not Murder George Floyd And prosecutors knew it.\n\nT hanks to the release of depositions in a sexual harassment law suit, we now know just how thoroughly corrupt was the prosecution of former Minneapolis police offer Derek Chauvin and his three colleagues in the May 2020 death of George Floyd.\n\nThe depositions were taken this summer in response to a lawsuit filed by Amy Sweasy, a former Hennepin County prosecutor, against her then boss, former County Attorney Mike Freeman. Sweasy alleges that Freeman engaged in sex discrimination and professional retaliation. Whatever Freeman did or did not do to Sweasy, however, pales in comparison to what both of them and their colleagues did to the cops they prosecuted and the justice system they undermined. (READ MORE from Jack Cashill: What Isaacson Doesn't Get About Elon Musk)\n\n\"Did, in fact, a racist white cop actually murder a man named George Floyd, a civil rights leader in Minneapolis, on Memorial Day 2020,\" asked Tucker Carlson in Episode 32 of his Xwitter podcast on Friday. After documenting just some of the consequences of the presumed murder, from decriminalizing theft to defunding the police, Carlson added, \"The answer is, well, no. He didn't murder George Floyd.\"\n\nHis findings ... \"did exonerate the police officers - there was no evidence of asphyxiation or strangulation.\"\n\nCarlson zeroed in on the most critical of the revelations, the diagnosis of how Floyd died. Sweasy, for one, knew how he did not die. As she revealed in her deposition, Sweasy spoke with Hennepin County Medical Examiner Dr. Andrew Baker the day after Floyd's death.\n\n\"I called Dr. Baker early that morning to tell him about the case and to ask him if he would perform the autopsy on Mr. Floyd,\" said Sweasy under oath. \"He called me later in the day on that Tuesday and he told me that there were no medical findings that showed any injury to the vital structures of Mr. Floyd's neck. There were no medical indications of asphyxia or strangulation,\" Sweasy added.\n\nBy day two, Baker knew the risks involved in telling the truth. Sweasy continued, \"He said to me, 'Amy, what happens when the actual evidence doesn't match up with the public narrative that everyone's already decided on?' And then he said, 'This is the kind of case that ends careers.'\" Although Sweasy knows very well why Baker altered his diagnosis, Carlson may not.  This story bears retelling in the light of Sweasy's unwitting confirmation.\n\nAs I reported on these pages in August 2021, an exhibit surfaced in the case of Chauvin colleague Tou Thao that should have resulted in a new trial for Chauvin and the release of Thao and the other two arrested officers, Thomas Lane and Alexander Kueng.\n\nThe exhibit, a memorandum, was that powerful.  It memorialized a November 2020 conference between Dr. Roger Mitchell, former Washington D.C. chief medical examiner, and several prosecutors. Sweasy was not among the prosecutors present. Nor was Freeman. All but one were from the attorney general's office.\n\nThe memorandum detailed Mitchell's effort to coerce Baker into including neck compression in his diagnosis of Floyd's death. As noted above, Baker conducted an autopsy on Floyd on May 26, 2020, the day after Floyd's death. Baker reported that same day to the Hennepin County prosecutors, \"The autopsy revealed no physical evidence suggesting that Mr. Floyd died of asphyxiation. Mr. Floyd did not exhibit signs of petechiae, damage to his airways or thyroid, brain bleeding, bone injuries, or internal bruising.\"\n\nThree days later - Friday, May 29 - the state filed its initial complaint against Derek Chauvin. According to the complaint, \"The full report of the [medical examiner] is pending but the [medical examiner] has made the following preliminary findings. The autopsy revealed no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation.\" Without a diagnosis of asphyxia, however, the state could not accuse Chauvin and the police officers of committing or abetting \"Murder-2nd Degree.\" This is where Mitchell came into play.\n\nA well-connected black political activist, Mitchell boasted of his involvement in Baker's diagnosis to the attorneys present. Their summary of that interaction reads in part:\n\nWhen the preliminary result came out via the criminal complaint, Mitchell found the statement was bizarre. Mitchell was reading and said this is not right. So Mitchell called Baker and said first of all Baker should fire his public information officer. Then Mitchell asked what happened, because Mitchell didn't think it sounded like Baker's words. Baker said that he didn't think the neck compression played a part and that he didn't find petechiae. Mitchell said but you know you can not have petechiae and still have asphyxia and can still have neck compression.\n\nMitchell first called Baker on Friday, May 29. He \"thought about it more that weekend\" and on Monday he called Baker telling him he was about to send an op-ed to the Washington Post critical of Baker's findings. \"In this conversation,\" the memorandum continued, \"Mitchell said, you don't want to be the medical examiner who tells everyone they didn't see what they saw. You don't want to be the smartest person in the room and be wrong.\"\n\nBy that Monday cities across America had gone up in flames, none more ferociously than Minneapolis. The ever thoughtful Mitchell showed Baker a way out of the jam. According to the memorandum, \"[Mitchell] said there was a way to articulate the cause and manner of death that ensures you are telling the truth about what you are observing on the body and via all of the investigation. Mitchell said neck compression has to be in the diagnosis.\"\n\nLate on that same Monday, Baker's office sent out a press release that began, \"Cause of death: Cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression .\" (Italics added). With a stroke of the pen and the complicity of the prosecutors, Baker turned four innocent cops into murderers and justified the self-destructive social revolution that followed.\n\nThere was, of course, evidence of methamphetamine and opiates in Floyd's system but not enough to kill.\n\n\"There was extreme premium pressure, yes. The city was burning down,\" Sweasy's former colleague Patrick Lofton said in his deposition. He and Sweasy withdrew from the cases against Lane, Kueng, and Thao on June 3, 2020, just a week after Floyd's death. They did not believe the three officers should be criminally charged. \"I can tell you that everyone that I associate with to any degree, professionally or personally, agreed with our decision,\" Lofton testified. He described the pressure on the prosecutors as \"insane.\"\n\nLofton wrote his letter of withdrawal, he said, \"because I have to sleep at night.\" He and Sweasy might have slept better had they gone public with what they knew, namely that Chauvin and his colleagues were being tried for a crime they did not commit.\n\nDunn believes that Baker did an \"assiduous and thorough autopsy.\" His findings, he argues, \"did exonerate the police officers - there was no evidence of asphyxiation or strangulation, not any evidence of damage or compromise of the airway of breathing of Mr. Floyd from the prone restraint.\" In fact, Dunn made a video recreating the final minutes of Floyd's life. His conclusion, \"The prone position restraint is not harmful or lethal.\"\n\nThere was, of course, evidence of methamphetamine and opiates in Floyd's system but not enough to kill. Floyd was a user. He had acclimated to fentanyl. There was compelling evidence, however, \"that Mr. Floyd had three-vessel coronary artery disease of the heart\" as well as an \"enlarged heart from high blood pressure.\" The methamphetamine use increased the risk of Floyd having a sudden heartbeat regularity problem. \"Mr. Floyd was upset and anxious,\" concludes Dunn. By resisting arrest, he set himself up for \"sudden death from cardiac arrest, a sudden heart stoppage.\"\n\nAs much as Dunn appreciates Carlson's willingness to tackle this issue, he believes Carlson erred in attributing the death to Floyd's drug use. \"The media can't get it right when they have no guidance,\" he concludes. \"Two years of mayhem and destruction were ignited because of medical lies.\"\n\nJack Cashill's new book, Untenable: The True Story of White Ethnic Flight from America's Cities , is now available in all formats.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "The Real Reason for Daunte Wright's Death His death is a tragedy, but we need to look at the full picture of why it happened.\n\nW e will never hear the last of these names. Eric Garner. Alton Sterling. Michael Brown. George Floyd. Rashad Brooks.\n\nAnd now Daunte Wright.\n\nWe will never hear the last of them because there will always be more. And because certain people are invested in forcing us to hear about them.\n\nBut what they demand we hear isn't the truth.\n\nIs it a tragedy that Daunte Wright is dead? Of course it is. Should he have been shot dead on Sunday by a Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, police officer? Why, no, he shouldn't have been.\n\nWe can get this out of the way very easily. The Brooklyn Center police department employed, it appears, a female cop who after 26 years on the force can't tell the difference in a stressful situation between a taser and a Glock pistol. To call this a failure of hiring and training would be a rather generous statement.\n\nThere was something of a hue and cry over the firing of the city manager in that Minneapolis suburb because he called for the officer to be given due process, but the fact of the matter is that the most likely result of due process in the Daunte Wright case is firings up the chain of command anyway. The officer in question, Kim Potter, who was a former police union local president, has already resigned . The police chief, Tim Gannon, has also resigned . Mike Elliott, the African American Democrat mayor of Brooklyn Center, seems pretty intent on throwing under the bus as many underlings as possible in order to save himself, but he probably ought to go, too.\n\nParticularly after what the mob did to Brooklyn Center in response to the Daunte Wright shooting.\n\nWe could have an argument about \"diversity hiring\" here. We could also have an argument, as Reason.com was insistent on raising Monday , about the deadly stupidity of laws like the one Minnesota has criminalizing the hanging of air fresheners or other items from the rearview mirror of a car. Reason 's Billy Binion pronounced Daunte Wright dead as a result of that idiotic statute.\n\nHe's wrong. That law, disgracefully ridiculous though it might be, did not kill Daunte Wright.\n\nDaunte Wright, or at least the life he led, killed Daunte Wright.\n\nHe wasn't pulled over because he had air fresheners hanging from his rearview mirror. He was pulled over because he had expired tags on his license plate. Then it was noticed that he had air fresheners hanging from his rear view.\n\nThen it was noticed he had an outstanding warrant.\n\nThen it was noticed he resisted arrest.\n\nThen it was noticed he got back in his car and drove away from the police. Which he had done before, as it turned out; Wright had fled from officers in June. The circumstances from which that police encounter arose make for scintillating reading. He was reported to the police for waving a gun around, and when the cops showed up it turned out Wright didn't have a permit for the gun.\n\nHe ran away. And he was cited and ordered to appear in court. He didn't, which occasioned the warrant for his arrest.\n\nThat's not all that appears on Wright's record. There was the February arrest for aggravated robbery. There was a disorderly conduct charge arising from a 2019 incident. There was the guilty plea in late 2019 to possession and sale of marijuana. And there was an arrest warrant for armed robbery; Wright was accused of choke-holding a woman and threatening her at gunpoint, demanding $820 intended to pay her rent.\n\nDaunte Wright dropped out of high school, then fathered a child out of wedlock he couldn't support with minimum-wage jobs and petty drug dealing. He had borrowed $50 from his parents to take his car to a car wash and had his girlfriend in the car with him, with expired license tags. He was stopped by the police, resisted arrest, and then attempted to drive away - which raised the likelihood that he would expose his girlfriend to bodily harm. She was apparently injured when, as he bled out following being shot by Officer Potter, he crashed the car attempting a getaway.\n\nIn other words, this is someone who chose to be a penny-ante John Dillinger. He ended up with the full ante.\n\nHis parents are justifiably upset at his death. The loss of a child is one of the most heartbreaking events anyone could bear. Certainly our sympathies go out to them.\n\nBut Daunte Wright's father called him \"a great kid.\" He said he was \"a normal kid. He was never in serious trouble. He enjoyed spending time with his 2-year-old son. He loved his son.\"\n\nGreat kids don't fight with and then flee the cops. Great kids don't bring the police around because they're waving guns. Great kids aren't arrested for aggravated robbery or for dealing drugs.\n\nOr, in the community Daunte Wright came from, maybe they do. Maybe that's great.\n\nIf so, that's a lot bigger problem than the incompetence of the politicians and police in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota.\n\nBut that isn't something you'll hear much about, is it?\n\nYou aren't even allowed to talk about the fact that this 20-year-old kid had already messed up his life and may have been well on his way to becoming a career criminal. Daunte Wright had perpetuated the cycle of out-of-wedlock childbirth, academic failure, the inability to learn and deploy a marketable skill, and escalating criminal behavior that so horrifically afflicts the black community in this country.\n\nIf Daunte Wright's life was \"great\" and not substandard, then we will never be rid of these tragedies. And they're all fundamentally the same - career criminal on the fringe of society, a failure in life, involved in drugs (if not high at the time; we'll know later what the toxicology report shows), likely faced with prolonged jail time upon arrest and resisting arrest.\n\nHow do you prevent deaths like Daunte Wright's? You try to prevent young men from living lives like Daunte Wright's.\n\nBut you aren't allowed to say that. Neither Joe Biden nor Kamala Harris, both of whom had the opportunity to lead but instead chose to pander to the mob, would say it. Nor would Minnesota's Gov. Tim Walz , another pandering Democrat responsible for more of his state's destruction than perhaps all of his predecessors combined.\n\nWright's family hired - of course! - the race-hustling attorney Ben Crump, who has made his entire livelihood trying cases like this in the media as the cities where they happen burn. Crump's street-criminal clients, or more specifically their families, often pull nice settlements out of local governments despite weak evidence of actual malfeasance.\n\nThis case, owing to the Barney Fife nature of the gunplay involved, might be Ben Crump's best yet . Which isn't saying much.\n\nSo he was on the scene in Brooklyn Center almost before the body was cold.\n\n\"Daunte Wright's life matters,\" Crump said.\n\nWell, of course it matters. It matters to Ben Crump. Daunte Wright will be a nice paycheck for him. And so will the next Daunte Wright, and the one after that. Before too long, Ben Crump will be able to buy a million-dollar house in Topanga Canyon near Black Lives Matter founder Patrisse Cullors' fresh crib.\n\nIt isn't a coincidence that nobody is interested in preventing lives like Daunte Wright's but rather celebrating them. Daunte Wright's funeral will be a lot bigger deal than David Dorn's . There will be murals painted and stores burned and looted in his honor.\n\nAnd then there will be a fat settlement. Daunte Wright will end up worth a whole lot more dead than he ever was alive.\n\nSo long as this tragic cycle can't be called out for the horrific farce that it is, it will continue. But it can't. And the next Daunte Wright will only keep the wheel turning around and around.\n\nEmail (required) *\n\nFirst Name\n\nLast Name\n\nExample: Yes, I would like to receive emails from The American Spectator | USA News and Politics.

Upon his return to the car, an officer approached him and informed the Broncos assistant he was not allowed to leave his vehicle unattended. Wilhoite responded by telling the officer to \"shut the f*ck up.\" The officer repeated the warning, and Wilhoite repeated the insult while chest-bumping the officer.\n\nThe officer shoved Wilhoite and received a punch in the face in response. The officer suffered injuries to both knees, pain in his jaw, and may have damaged his left wrist, according to Klis.\n\nThe officer rose to his feet and fired his taser at Wilhoite as he climbed back in his vehicle to flee the scene. The former 49er and now former coach was arrested a short time later.\n\nWilhoite faces charges of second-degree assault on a police officer, obstruction of a peace officer, and criminal mischief. He had coached Denver's outside linebackers group since 2023.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

      "text": "Glenn Youngkin Slams Biden's Clemency of Men Who Murdered VA Police Officer 'Beyond Outraged'\n\nVirginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) criticized President Joe Biden for granting clemency to \"two violent criminals\" who killed a police officer, stating that he was \"beyond outraged.\"\n\nIn a press release on Saturday, Youngkin stated that what made Biden granting clemency to Ferrone Claiborne and Terence Richardson \"even more unconscionable\" was that \"the Biden U.S. Attorney advised the White House\" against commuting the sentences.\n\nYoungkin noted in the press release that \"both\" men had \"admitted to being responsible for the brutal killing of Officer Allen Gibson in Sussex County Circuit Court.\"\n\nClaiborne and Richardson were \"acquitted of the 1998 murder\" of Officer Allen Gibson, a Sussex County police officer, according to WRIC News. The outlet noted that while the men were \"acquitted by a federal jury,\" they ended up receiving \"a life sentence in 2001 when being tried for a related drug charge.\"\n\nHowever, in an unusual move, they still received a life sentence in 2001 when being tried for a related drug charge. Previously, a legal analyst told 8News that it was a \"miscarriage of justice\" to cross-reference a charge someone had been acquitted of when sentencing, adding that he had never seen that before.\n\n\"I am beyond outraged and in utter disbelief that President Biden would announce clemency for Ferrone Claiborne and Terence Richardson-two men who admitted to being responsible to brutally killing Officer Allen Gibson,\" Youngkin said in a statement. \"What makes this even more unconscionable is the Biden U.S. Attorney advised the White House not to commute these sentences as they are violent offenders.\"\n\n\"The pain and sorrow this clemency causes the Gibson family is unimaginable,\" Youngkin added. \"To know that the men who took Officer Gibson's life will walk free is not just a grave injustice-it is a heartbreaking blow to those who continue to mourn his sacrifice. This is despicable; a grim day for justice and for the families who trust that our system will hold the guilty accountable.\"\n\nYoungkin's criticism of Biden commuting the sentences of Claiborne and Richardson came a day after Biden commuted the sentences of almost 2,500 people.\n\nAs Breitbart News previously reported , in December, Biden issued presidential pardons to 39 Americans who were \"convicted of non-violent crimes,\" and commuted the sentences of almost 1,500 others.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

The unnamed man is said to be in his 60s and the new allegations relate to a new complainant who states she was attacked by the officer between 1997 and 2002.\n\nThat officer was previously arrested in October, then on suspicion of \"misconduct in public office, attempted rape and three counts of indecent assault\" allegedly against two girls between 1995 and 1999.\n\nA second police officer, also unnamed, had been arrested in December. He is described as being in his 50s and was arrested on suspicion \"suspicion of sexual assault and misconduct in public office and one count of indecent assault in connection to incidents that reportedly occurred around 1995-1996.\"\n\nThe IOPC describes the complainants against the officers as \"four survivors of child sexual exploitation and abuse in Rotherham\" and that the alleged attacks took place while the Rotherham-based police officers \"were both on and off duty\".\n\nA spokesman for the IOPC said the allegations are: \"very serious complaints and we will ensure they are thoroughly and robustly investigated\"\n\nThe arrests follow the IOPC's Operation Linden, one of its largest investigations ever, which investigated the actions of South Yorkshire Police around the mass rape of children in Rotherham. The IOPC was moved earlier this month to deny it had attempted to bury its findings, or that it had been told not to investigate senior officers, characterising these whistle blower claims as \"completely inaccurate\".\n\nAn estimated 1,400 young girls were sexually abused by predominantly Pakistani gang members in the town, the Jay and Casey reports found.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

      "text": "REPORT: Police Officer Issues Extremely Rare Citation, Arrests Man After He Was Honked At\n\n(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\n\nA police officer reportedly issued a rare citation to a Texas resident who honked his car horn.\n\nVideos of the exchange circulated widely online after Marshall Petre, who filmed the encounter, honked at the officer, CBS News reported Wednesday. Petre, a Collin County resident, alleged the officer passed him on his police motorcycle at high speed with no lights or sirens on, so he honked at him out of concern for the safety of himself and others.\n\nThe officer left after the brief interaction, then returned shortly thereafter to hand Petre a ticket, tow his truck and arrest him, according to CBS News.\n\nPetre said there were no signs of traffic or trouble when he merged onto Highway 75.\n\n\"I check my mirror, go to move over and ... he comes swinging past me,\" Petre said in an interview with the outlet. \"He didn't have lights, sirens, nothing - he was just driving down the road.\"\n\nHe said the deputy sped past him then got caught in the regular flow of traffic.\n\n\"You got a reason for your speed?\" Petre said while questioning the officer in the first of two videos.\n\n\"If he would have lost control of that motorcycle ... if I would have just clipped the front of his vehicle and he had an accident, and potentially could have died from it,\" Petre told the outlet. \"I would've had to live with that guilt. I don't want to carry that.\"\n\n\"You flew past me, I almost killed you!\" he said in a video of the altercation.\n\nPetre said he saw the officer take the next exit and followed him. He started recording the exchange after pulling up behind the officer at a four-way stop and honking his horn.\n\nThe deputy then drove away and Petre said he stayed behind and spoke with a construction worker who had witnessed the incident. He began filming the second video after the officer returned minutes later.\n\nThe deputy then issued Petre a citation for illegal use of a horn, according to CBS News.\n\nState code allows the use of a horn \"only when necessary to insure safe operation.\" The Texas Department of Public Safety reported 3.9 million traffic violations issued in 2022 and just eight of them were for the illegal use of a horn, according to the outlet.\n\nPetre's ticket came with a $189 fine, but his problems continued mounting from there. Dallas County had previously issued an arrest warrant for the Collin County man after he allegedly failed to pay a speeding ticket he had received in the summer, the outlet reported.\n\nThe officer arrested Petre and arranged for his truck to be towed.\n\nHe spent 16 hours in custody and was forced to pay $600 to release his truck from the impound lot.\n\nPetre felt he had the right to question the deputy despite how the situation unfolded.\n\n\"He just wanted to come back and make a point - be proven,\" he said. \"And he proved it. He did what he wanted to do.\" (RELATED: Video Shows Police Surrounding Rapper's Home Days Before Tour Set To Begin)\n\nA Collin County Sheriff's Office spokesperson said the case is \"under review,\" according to the outlet.\n\nPetre has pled not guilty and has requested a jury trial. A court hearing was scheduled for him Oct. 29, but there is no further information regarding the case at the time of publication.\n\nhttps://dailycaller.com/author/Leena/\n\nTRENDING\n\n©2025 The Daily Caller, Inc.\n\nThe Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006\n\nSubscription Type\n\nUnlimited digital access to The Daily Caller\n\nPremium Article: Subscribe for $1 to read the rest.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nAlready have an account?

      "text": "Police Officer Hiring Increased For First Year Since 2020, Survey Says\n\nREUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nThe hiring of police officers is rising for the first year since 2020, a new survey shows.\n\nPolice departments across the U.S. have struggled to remain staffed for the past few years as officers left in droves following the Defund the Police movement and the Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests and rioting that peaked after the death of George Floyd in 2020. For the first time since the nationwide unrest and lockdowns, total staffing has increased among police agencies with some small and medium bodies reporting more sworn officers than in January 2020, according to data obtained by the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF).\n\n\"For the first time since the start of the pandemic, agencies reported a year-over-year increase in total sworn staffing. Responding agencies reported hiring more sworn officers in 2023 than in any of the previous four years. Agencies saw fewer resignations in 2023 than they did in 2021 or 2022, though they still had more officers resign last year than in 2019 or 2020. And retirements dropped back down to roughly where they were in 2019 after being elevated for the previous three years,\" the survey reads.\n\nTrending: New PERF survey shows police agencies have turned a corner with staffing challenges https://t.co/CIDihkx36X\n\n- Chuck Wexler (@CWexlerPERF) April 28, 2024\n\n\"Small and medium agencies now have more sworn officers than they had in January 2020.  In large agencies, sworn staffing slightly increased during 2023, but it is still more than 5 percent below where it was in January 2020,\" the survey continues. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Police Report Contradicts Pro-Defund The Police DC Councilman's Mugging Story)\n\nTotal sworn officers hired by police agencies landed at 11,098 in 2023, the survey shows. This rebound was nearly 30% more than in 2020, when only 8,558 total sworn officers hired were reported. In 2020, police agencies hired nearly 18% less total sworn officers than in 2019, when 10,430 were hired.\n\nPolice agencies reported 151,335 total sworn officers on January 1, 2024, a 0.4% increase from 150,714 total sworn officers reported on Jan. 1, 2023, according to PERF. Sworn staffing data from 2024 was still 4.9% lower than Jan. 1, 2020, when there were 159,199 reported total sworn officers.\n\nIn 2022, a total of 6,492 sworn officers resigned from police agencies, according to PERF's survey. In 2023, 5,090 sworn officers resigned - a 21.6% decrease from the year prior. Meanwhile, 5,333 sworn officers retired in 2023, a nearly 24% decrease from 7,003 sworn officer retirements in 2022.\n\nTRENDING\n\n©2025 The Daily Caller, Inc.\n\nThe Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006\n\nSubscription Type\n\nUnlimited digital access to The Daily Caller\n\nPremium Article: Subscribe for $1 to read the rest.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nAlready have an account?

Police in Grantsville received a call from concerned citizens, over three little pigs on the loose in the area, according to Fox 13 . The pigs were wreaking havoc in the neighborhood by getting into people's yards and terrorizing their gardens. Several officers responded to a call about a sighting of the runaway pigs , and Cooper was quick to jump to action.  One of the pigs gave him a good run for his money before he was finally able to showcase his skills by tackling it to the ground.\n\nThe police department  shared the video to their Facebook page , honoring Cooper's quick-actions.\n\nThe internet is loving this video, but the pig has seen better days.\n\nThe video clip showed the runaway swine tearing up a front lawn, and heading up a residential driveway. Cooper could be seen entering the frame as he chased it across the perfectly landscaped grass, belonging to an unsuspecting resident. Nobody knew that this pig was about to be taken into police custody.\n\nThe pig took off, in an attempt to get away from Cooper, while someone filmed the hysterical scene.\n\nCooper made a few lunges toward the swine, who responded by changing course and switching the direction it was running in.\n\nSome of the pig's evasive moves proved successful, but eventually Cooper closed in.\n\nThe pig darted behind a basketball net at the residence, and Cooper put his athleticism on full display by lunging at the pig, and throwing himself down on top of it.\n\nCooper wrapped his arms around the runaway piggy and carried it down the driveway.\n\n\"It's kind of all hands on deck because, and when you're dealing with an animal with a mind of its own, you obviously can't communicate ... their instincts are to fight or flight and most of the time they run and they're pretty fast,\" Cooper told Fox 13.

      "text": "Dem-Run Cities See Massive Exodus Of Police Officers As Crime Rages On\n\n(Photo by LEONARDO MUNOZ/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nSome of the largest Democrat-run cities in the country saw their police forces shrink as they grappled with persistently high homicide rates following the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a Daily Caller News Foundation analysis of Census Bureau data.\n\nNew York City , Los Angeles , Portland , Austin and Washington, D.C. , all run by Democrats, collectively had about 1,500 fewer law enforcement officers on staff in 2023 than they did prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a DCNF analysis of the Census Bureau's 2019 and 2023 Annual Survey of Public Employment and Payroll.\n\nPolice departments shrunk in these cities as they failed to reverse the spike in homicide rates coinciding both with the COVID-19 pandemic and with the wave of racial justice movements seeking to reform law enforcement that cropped up following the death of George Floyd.\n\nPortland, for instance, had a homicide rate of 13.2 per 100,000 residents as of 2023, an almost 140% increase from its pre-pandemic rate of 5.5 per 100,000, according to Census and city data. Concurrent with the increase in murder rates, the number of police officers in Portland shrunk by 183 between 2019 and 2023, falling from 911 to just 728. (RELATED: DC Prosecutor Oversaw Massive Drop In Felony Convictions While Violent Crime Ravaged City)\n\nPortland, under pressure from racial justice activists in 2020, slashed police funding by $15 million and eliminated funding for 84 police officer positions, according to Oregon Public Broadcasting. Following the cuts, homicides in Portland jumped by 83%, which was among the highest of any major city that year, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported .\n\nDemocratic Mayor Ted Wheeler supported law enforcement cuts at the time but, less than a year later, he reversed course and attempted to restore some funding to Portland's police department.\n\nAs crime remains persistently high, many are opting to leave Portland, with the city losing over 4,000 residents between July 2022 and July 2023, according to the Census Bureau.\n\nPortland police officers and pro-Palestinian students face off during a demonstration on the campus of Portland State University (Photo by JOHN RUDOFF/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nD.C. also bent the knee to racial justice activists in 2020, likewise reducing its budget by $15 million, according to local outlets. D.C. had 113 fewer officers on payroll in 2023 than it did in 2019, according to Census data.\n\nD.C.'s city council was controlled by Democrats at the time of the budget cuts.\n\nThe homicide rate in the nation's capital, meanwhile, was 72% higher in 2023 than it was in 2019, rising from 23.5 murders per 100,000 residents to 40.4 murders per 100,000, according to police and Census data.\n\nDemocratic D.C. Councilman Charles Allen, who led the effort to cut police funding in the city, is the target of a recall campaign , with critics arguing his approach to public safety helped lead to the increase in violent crime.\n\nNew York City, which has the largest police department in the country, lost 843 officers between 2019 and 2023, according to Census data. New York, like Portland and D.C., has also failed to bring its homicide rate below pre-pandemic levels.\n\nNew York's homicide rate per 100,000 inhabitants remains 23% higher than it was in 2019, according to municipal and Census data. The New York Police Department (NYPD) is understaffed, which is creating concerns for public safety, the NYC Police Benevolent Association said in March.\n\nMonths earlier, in January, Democratic Mayor Eric Adams rolled back plans to cut funding to the NYPD, the New York Post reported .\n\nLos Angeles, which also has one of the largest police departments in the country, saw its force shrink by 242 members between 2019 and 2023, according to Census figures. The homicide rate in the city, meanwhile, was 32% higher in 2023 than it was in 2019, per city and census data.\n\nMany Los Angeles residents are discontent with the state of law enforcement in their city, with 51% of voters saying in a February poll that they disapprove of the job Democratic District Attorney George Gascón is doing.\n\nAustin, which lost 104 police officers between 2019 and 2023, saw its homicide rate jumping by 76% during that period, Census and municipal shows. The city cut its police budget by roughly a third in 2020, the Texas Tribune reported .\n\nRepublican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott sent in state police to aid Austin as it faced a police staffing shortage in March 2023, according to the Texas Tribune. City leaders pushed to end that partnership after data showed state police were disproportionately arresting Black and Hispanic residents with state police eventually pulling out in December 2023, according to Texas Public Radio.\n\nThe mayor's offices in each of these cities did not respond to the DCNF's requests for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight.\n\nNow that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate  media and \n\t\t\t\t\tjoining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes \n\t\t\t\t\tto marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; \n\t\t\t\t\tsenators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want \n\t\t\t\t\tto limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our \n\t\t\t\t\tindependence.\n\nWe don't complain -- we can't stand complainers --  but we do call it how we see it. We have a fight on our \n\t\t\t\t\thands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.\n\nWe're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. \n\t\t\t\t\tOur original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates \n\t\t\t\t\tthem -- because we won't bend the knee to political correctness.\n\nOne reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of \n\t\t\t\t\tour being, and we think she's worth saving from today's craziness.\n\nHelp us save her.\n\nA second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train.  We have \n\t\t\t\t\ttrained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political \n\t\t\t\t\tspectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There's a good chance they were trained at Daily \n\t\t\t\t\tCaller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, \n\t\t\t\t\tNewsmax, Daily Wire and many others.\n\nSimply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a \n\t\t\t\t\tfair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.\n\nSince 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress. We're in the Oval Office. \n\t\t\t\t\tAnd we're in up to 20 million homes every single month. That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible \n\t\t\t\t\tto ignore.\n\nWe can overcome the forces lined up against all of us. This is an important mission but we can't do it unless you - \n\t\t\t\t\tthe everyday Americans forgotten by the establishment - have our back.\n\nPlease consider becoming a Daily Caller Patriot today, and help us keep doing work that holds politicians, \n\t\t\t\t\tcorporations and other leaders accountable.

      "text": "'I'm So Sorry': Former Police Officer Kim Potter Weeps Under Grilling By Prosecutors\n\nFormer Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, police officer Kim Potter broke down and apologized while testifying in her trial over the shooting death of Daunte Wright in April.\n\nPotter, 49, became emotional multiple times on the stand, first while recounting the incident to her defense attorney. She broke down at least two more times while being grilled by prosecuting attorney Erin Eldridge over the events of April 11, once just before a lunch recess was called and once more just before Eldridge concluded her first cross examination of Potter.\n\nDuring the latter exchange, Potter wept, exclaiming that she is \"sorry\" for killing Wright, a 20-year-old black man. \"I'm sorry it happened. I'm so sorry,\" Potter said while burying her face in her hands.\n\nErin Eldridge: You'd agree that, as a police officer, you have the duty to render aid and communicate information to other officers, right?\n\nKim Potter: Yes.\n\nEE: And it's part of your job to assist those who are hurt or injured. True?\n\nKP: Yes.\n\nEE: And to communicate to other officers what you know about a particular scene, right?\n\nKP: Yes.\n\nEE: Give them whatever information you can to help them do their jobs to help render assistance, things like that. Right?\n\nKP: Yes.\n\nEE: But you didn't do any of those things on April 11, did you?\n\nKP: No.\n\nEE: You stopped doing your job completely. You didn't communicate what happened over the radio, right?\n\nKP: No.\n\nEE: You didn't make sure any officers knew what you had just done, right?\n\nKP: No.\n\nEE: You didn't run down the street and try to save Daunte Wright's life, did you?\n\nKP: No.\n\nEE: You didn't check on the other car that had been hit, did you?\n\nKP: No.\n\nEE: That all happened just down the road from you.\n\nKP: Yes.\n\nEE: You were focused on what you had done because you had just killed somebody.\n\nKP: I'm sorry it happened. I'm so sorry.\n\nEE: Mrs. Potter, from your reaction today and your reaction on your video, you didn't plan to use deadly force that day, did you?\n\nKP: No.\n\n\"I'm sorry it happened ... I didn't want to hurt anybody.\"\n\nKim Potter took the stand Friday in her own defense, breaking down as the prosecution questioned her about what she did immediately after shooting Daunte Wright. pic.twitter.com/aVPnnDqSHI\n\n- CBS News (@CBSNews) December 17, 2021\n\nPotter first cried during her testimony when recounting to her defense attorney the moment she fatally shot Wright while he was attempting to flee officers:\n\nI remember a struggle with officer Luckey and the driver at the door. The driver was trying to get back into the car. ... I went around officer Luckey as they were trying to get back in the door, in between the door and officer Luckey and the driver, and the driver is getting into the car. ... They're still struggling and I can see Sergeant Johnson and the driver struggling over the gear shift because I can see Johnson's hand, and then I can see his face. ... He had a look of fear on his face. It's nothing I'd seen before. ... We were struggling. We were trying to keep him from driving away. It just went chaotic. And then I remember yelling 'Taser! Taser! Taser!' and nothing happened and then he told me I shot him.\n\nShe stopped speaking and covered her face with her hands before reaching for tissues to dab her eyes.\n\nAfter she concluded her testimony, her defense team rested its case. Judge Regina Chu gave brief instructions to the jury to avoid discussing the case or reading reports of the trial over the weekend before dismissing them until Monday morning for closing arguments.\n\nPotter is facing charges of first- and second-degree manslaughter. Potter faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted.\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

Khan was off duty at the time and driving his personal vehicle.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Chicago Police Officer Mohammed Khan was caught kicking an elderly rabbi's car mirrors after issuing a ticket.\n\nRabbi Abraham Wineberg's family believes he was targeted for being a Jew.\n\nKhan pleaded guilty last year but has faced no discipline from the police force. pic.twitter.com/XzsTeJW7MX\n\n- Kassy Akiva (@KassyAkiva) March 24, 2025\n\nFootage shows Khan peering through the rear window at Jewish and Hebrew prayer books and paraphernalia. He then returned on foot, and was seen in the footage kicking off one of the vehicle's mirrors, which was left dangling by its wire. A few minutes later, he is seen from another angle returning again to break the other mirror, which Wineberg's family says was completely cut off with a tool. The vehicle was then later towed.\n\nEvidence of vandalism on Rabbi Wineberg's vehicle.\n\nThe next morning, Khan is seen on footage talking to a second police officer, who issued another ticket around 10 a.m. Khan - whom the family had never spoken to before - told Wineberg's granddaughter's husband, Yisroel Wolf, that morning that he was unsure who damaged the vehicle.\n\n\"When we confronted him the next day, he tried to use his status as a police officer to get out of the crime, telling me 'I'm a police officer, I would never do such a thing, I don't know what you're talking about.'\" Wineberg told The Daily Wire. \"That's how we realized he was the one who wrote the ticket.\"\n\nThe ticket issued, which was viewed by The Daily Wire, has an illegible signature in the \"issued by\" section.\n\n\"He didn't legibly sign his name or put his badge number on the ticket, so he knew he was doing something wrong,\" Wolf said.\n\nWolf added that he thought it was unusual the car was towed because after speaking to his neighbors, it's more typical to just ticket illegally parked cars.\n\n\"I believe the act is deeper than road rage because Khan left the scene and then returned twice, once with a tool to cut the mirror,\" Wolf said. \"It is evident that Khan targeted the car because it belonged to a Jew.\"\n\nJewish and Hebrew prayer books and paraphernalia in Rabbi Wineberg's car.\n\nKhan was sentenced to 40 hours of community service, 10 hours of anger management, and $800 to pay for damages, according to Wolf.\n\nWolf receives an email every few months from the Chicago Police Department's Bureau of Internal Affairs telling him that their investigation into his complaint about Khan is still ongoing, despite Khan pleading guilty.\n\nThe family's patience has run out and they filed a complaint to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois Eastern Division earlier this month to seek action. The complaint seeks damages under the Fourth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment, and common law of the State of Illinois for malicious acts that damage property.\n\nThe suit alleges that the incident caused Wineberg \"a great amount of stress and emotional distress\" which was compounded \"by the realization that Khan had evidently acted in such a fashion after noticing that the owner of the car was likely Jewish.\"\n\n\"Why is Khan still in the force? Why are they still investigating? He already pleaded guilty. If this was a Jewish cop and a Muslim victim would this be the same story?\"\n\nWolf said the ordeal was deeply upsetting for his family because his wife's grandparents were coming to meet his newborn daughter for the first time and had to drive home in an unsafe vehicle.\n\n\"He left very upset, it pretty much ruined the entire weekend for him and their drive back to Michigan was very scary because my grandmother had to act as the mirror and look out for him because we could only tape on one mirror as the other was missing,\" Wolf said. \"For people their age, that is very scary.\"\n\nWolf said Wineberg accidentally parked in the handicapped spot because it was dark and he was unfamiliar with the neighborhood.\n\nKhan has been a full-time, active Chicago police officer since 2017, according to public records .\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "Former Memphis Police Officer Becomes First To Plead Guilty To Federal Charges In Tyre Nichols' Death\n\nA former policeman with the Memphis Police Department who was one of the five officers charged in the beating death of 29-year-old Tyre Nichols in January pled guilty to two federal charges Thursday.\n\nDesmond Mills Jr., 33, reached a plea deal with federal and state prosecutors, pleading guilty to excessive force and obstruction of justice in exchange for prosecutors recommending a 15-year prison sentence, the Associated Press reported . Mills' plea at the Memphis Federal Courthouse was part of an agreement that he would also plead guilty to similar charges at the state court. Mills now faces a sentencing hearing on May 22 in front of a judge.\n\n\"This one today was very difficult for me because this was really the first time I actually heard somebody tell and say what they actually did to my son,\" Nichols' mother RowVaughn Wells said, according to the AP. \"So, this was very difficult. But I'm hoping that Mr. Mills, it was his conscience that allowed him to make this plea agreement, and not because of his lawyers telling him it was the right thing to do.\"\n\nNichols was fatally injured during a confrontation with five Memphis police officers on January 7, 2023, after he was pulled over. During the initial traffic stop, Nichols was pepper-sprayed and tased. He then attempted to flee the Memphis police officers, but they caught up with him, and footage from a camera mounted on a nearby pole area showed officers kicking and beating him while he was on the ground.\n\nThe plea agreement details that Mills pepper-sprayed Nichols three different times and pulled out his baton while yelling at him, \"I'm about to baton the (expletive) out of you,\" before hitting him repeatedly while Nichols was on the ground. The plea agreement also says that Nichols was never given the opportunity to comply with the commands given to him.\n\nMills and the other officers discussed among themselves \"taking turns hitting Nichols, hitting Nichols with straight haymakers, and everybody rocking Nichols. During these conversations, the officers discussed hitting Nichols to make him fall and observed that when Nichols did not fall from these blows, they believed they were 'about to kill' him,\" according to the plea agreement.\n\nThe five officers accused of beating Nichols to death were fired from the Memphis Police Department later that month before facing federal and state charges. Mills, along with Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Emmit Martin III, and Justin Smith were all charged with using excessive force, failing to intervene, deliberate indifference and conspiring to lie, and obstruction of justice.\n\nPreviously, all five officers pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder in a state court. Mills becomes the first officer to plead guilty to any of the charges.\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "Ex-Cop Who Responded To Pipe Bombs Sentenced In January 6 Case\n\nThe first police officer to arrive at the scene of pipe bombs discovered near the U.S. Capitol was sentenced in a January 6th case on Thursday.\n\nA federal judge sentenced Michael Riley, who has since retired from Capitol Police after more than 25 years on the force, to 120 days home detention and two years probation.\n\nA jury found Riley, 51, guilty of obstruction over the deletion of Facebook messages with a Virginia fisherman who was sentenced to probation for his participation in the Capitol riot.\n\nThe sentence dealt to Riley, who must also pay a $10,000 fine, is considerably less than the 27 months in prison sought by prosecutors, according to The Washington Post . Still, U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said Riley displayed \"shocking conduct\" for a law enforcement officer, \"particularly one who was a member of the U.S. Capitol Police, and one who served on the day of the attack on the Capitol, the building you spent 25 years protecting.\"\n\nRiley was the first responding officer on January 6, 2021, upon the discovery of a pair of pipe bombs outside the Republican National Committee's and Democratic National Committee's offices in Washington, D.C., per his lawyers . Riley then provided assistance to an injured officer on Capitol Hill during the Capitol riot later that day.\n\nMore than two years later just who planted the pipe bombs, which federal officials said were viable but did not detonate, remains a mystery. Authorities have released security footage of a masked suspect wearing a hoodie and this January they increased the reward for information leading to an arrest up to $500,000 .\n\nFollowing the U.S. Capitol breach, Riley traded Facebook messages with a man named Jacob Hiles, advising Hiles to remove posts about being inside the U.S. Capitol on January 6 due to ongoing investigations, noting that he was \"looking out\" for someone who agreed with his political views.\n\nAlthough the jury did not reach a verdict on an obstruction count related to that exchange, Riley got penalized for deleting private messages after Hiles shared that he told the FBI that he was in contact with a Capitol Police officer and trying to create a cover story, according to the Justice Department .\n\n\"The regret, the remorse I have over this situation is unmatchable. I reached out to someone I never should have contacted. For this, I accept full responsibility,\" Riley told the judge.\n\nRoughly 27 months after the chaos on January 6, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia says more than 1,020 arrests have been made in connection to January 6, the day a crowd of people entered the U.S. Capitol and disrupted lawmakers who were meeting to certify Joe Biden's 2020 election victory. Some 533 defendants have pleaded guilty, including four to a federal charge of seditious conspiracy.\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "Trump Should Pardon D.C.'s Good Cops Victimized By Biden's Soft-On-Crime DOJ\n\nWashington, D.C., Police Officer Terrence Sutton was sentenced to jail because a gang member died trying to escape police.\n\nOn day one, President Donald Trump's administration should issue immediate pardons to Washington, D.C., Police Officers Terence Sutton and Andrew Zabavsky.\n\nSutton, a 13-year veteran of the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD), was sentenced to jail for five years because a gang member died trying to escape police. Zabavsky was convicted of conspiracy to obstruct and obstruction of justice, receiving a four-year sentence.\n\nA pardon would send the message that changes are coming to the D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office and that the incoming Trump administration backs the blue. In turn, MPD officers will focus on fighting violent criminals without being worried that some progressive prosecutor will view them as the defendant.\n\nJoe Biden's Justice Department presided over D.C.'s deadliest year in more than two decades. According to crime data , 274 people were murdered in our nation's capital, many of whom were innocent children. Compared to other large cities, D.C. had the fifth-highest murder rate . Armed carjackings, one of the most violent crimes imaginable, nearly doubled from the previous year. The city that loudly championed defunding the police was forced to quietly pass emergency pro-law enforcement legislation in the face of a skyrocketing epidemic of violent crime.\n\nWhat has America's largest U.S. attorney's office done to respond to this violent outbreak?\n\nShort answer: not much.\n\nIn Sutton's case, after a nine-week jury trial in D.C. in December 2022, the U.S. attorney's office made the incomprehensible decision to prosecute Sutton for second-degree murder. It recommended an 18-year prison sentence.\n\nOn October 23, 2020, Sutton (\"the defendant,\" according to the DOJ) was on routine patrol on Kennedy Street, N.W. That night, a female MPD official informed Sutton that she observed Karon Hylton-Brown (\"the victim,\" according to the DOJ) in an altercation earlier that day and was concerned Hylton-Brown would return with a gun to finish the fight.\n\nMoments later, Sutton and three other members of MPD observed Hylton-Brown riding an electric moped and tried to speak with him to ensure he did not have a firearm. Hylton-Brown refused to stop and instead drove through a red light, which caused an oncoming car to have to stop to avoid hitting him. For the next three minutes, law enforcement pursued Hylton-Brown. During that time, he blew past stop signs, drove the wrong way on one-way streets, and committed other traffic offenses. Another officer observed Hylton-Brown \"blading\" his body, a tactic in which criminals turn their body to hide their firearms. Ultimately, Hylton-Brown failed to yield the right of way and was killed by an oncoming vehicle.\n\nSutton never made physical contact with Hylton-Brown. Moreover, Hylton-Brown fled police, committed numerous traffic infractions, appeared to be holding a firearm, and may have been intoxicated . Yet the D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office charged Sutton with second-degree murder .\n\nThe assistant U.S. attorneys prosecuting the case, Risa Berkower and Ahmed Muktadir Baset  - who referred to alleged gang member Hylton-Brown as \"not very dangerous\" - hysterically accused Sutton of killing Hylton-Brown \"in cold blood.\" Berkower was a member of the Fraud, Public Corruption, and Civil Rights group in the D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office. The section's purported mission is to prosecute fraud and corruption. In reality, it serves to satisfy the whims of the political left. It should be reassigned to fight violent crime.\n\nThis is the same attorney's office that used thousands of taxpayer dollars to prosecute two of President Trump's closest allies - Steven Bannon and Peter Navarro - and seek six months of federal incarceration for both. The same group that sent four prosecutors, including Berkower , the prosecutor from the Sutton case, to Jack Smith's failed special counsel team. This \"elite\" group of prosecutors has wasted millions of taxpayer dollars.\n\nEven after securing a quick conviction of Sutton, the DOJ was not satisfied. At sentencing, the same Jack Smith acolyte asked that Sutton serve 18 years in prison - a sentence higher than what convicted murderers routinely receive in D.C. courts. Ultimately, even leftist D.C. Judge Paul Friedman found the recommendation too much, deciding on five years of incarceration for Sutton, a sentence he's currently serving.\n\nYears and years of taxpayer money funded the prosecution of a police officer while the DOJ watched D.C. burn to the ground.\n\nThe city is owed better. Our nation's capital is rife with gangs, carjackings, and shootings. The criminal justice system is so backlogged that trials for murders and rapes are often delayed for years, denying justice to victims and their families while greatly reducing the likelihood of conviction.\n\nRather than focus on violent crime, corrupt prosecutors prefer to grab the low-hanging fruit of prosecuting cops for an all-too happy leftist audience.\n\nAfter all, who benefits from the conviction of Sutton? Not the people who live on Kennedy Street. Those residents - a majority are black - are subject to indescribable violence and crime on a daily basis. This pathetic prosecution incentivizes law enforcement to look the other way and not pursue criminals they know are armed and dangerous. The only people who benefit are publicity-seeking prosecutors who want fame for their roles as progressive prosecutors. They win and the residents of Washington lose.\n\nA letter written in support of Sutton at his sentencing aptly summarizes the current environment in D.C. \"The community is suffering. The drug dealers, violent offenders, and other nefarious characters feel emboldened to operate with impunity. Every day is a zero-consequence holiday for them. For the community they feed off of and terrorize, it's another day of fear and pain.\"\n\nChange is coming. Beginning on January 20, 2025, the four-year, zero-consequences nightmare is over. The violent crime terrorists and their political enablers should be on notice.\n\nThis article has been updated since publication.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Tyre Nichols' Alleged Killers Already Broke The Law, So More Laws Aren't The Answer - Accountability Is\n\nBy all accounts, what happened to Tyre Nichols last month was a crime and not a reflection of standard police policy.\n\nTyre Nichols was allegedly brutally beaten to death by several Memphis police officers, and it was all caught on tape. As a former prosecutor and state attorney general, I customarily reserve judgment even when incidents are video recorded - as proper investigations to ensure fair play do take time and patience.\n\nIn this case, however, I do not think it much of a stretch to say the video makes it clear that the police officers involved will go to jail, the city of Memphis is going to pay out millions of dollars to Nichols' family, and the Memphis Police Department is going to undergo severe and public scrutiny - reflecting its responsibility in the failed training and supervision of these rogue officers. This is accountability as it should be.\n\nYet, as has become the usual practice, Congress is now being called upon again to enact federal legislation to reform policing - ostensibly to prevent another Tyre Nichols or George Floyd or Rodney King tragedy from occurring.\n\nHad the officers who appeared to beat Nichols to death been white officers, these calls to Congress would have been accompanied by broad assertions of systemic racism and the disproportionate targeting of black victims. But in this instance, with the primary offending officers all appearing to be black, the usual specter of race as a motivator takes a backseat to what is readily apparent - these are just bad cops.\n\nThus, a proper question is: What should happen now? Do the circumstances of Nichols' death require national police reform to prevent a similarly deadly occurrence?\n\nBy all accounts, what happened to Nichols was a crime and not a reflection of standard police policy. The now-former police officers face criminal charges, including murder.\n\nWould a national ban on police chokeholds have prevented Nichols' death? That's what reformers wanted after Floyd's death - as if that would have saved him from a bad cop. Would a prohibition against specialized police units like the now-disbanded Memphis Police Department's Scorpion unit have prevented Nichols' death?\n\nNichols is dead because, by all appearances, at least five members of the Memphis Police Department violated their oath, broke the law, and beat him to death. If there is some actual demonstration that policing in the United States generally condones this type of behavior, then perhaps calls for sweeping reforms might be worthy of review.\n\nBut, as evidenced by the fact that the system is currently in the process of holding the officers involved accountable for their apparent crimes, this case does not indicate a need for wholesale reform of the entire policing system. Rather, Nichols' death demands accountability for gross deviations from proper conduct by corrupt individuals within the criminal justice system.\n\nThere is presumably not a police department in the country in which the apparent actions of the officers involved in Nichols' death would not already be violating the law. As The Washington Post acknowledged , the Memphis Police Department \"already has a policy on the books requiring officers to 'take reasonable action to intervene' if they observe a colleague 'engaged in dangerous or criminal conduct or abuse of a subject.'\"\n\nObviously, that law was not followed; to pass more laws that will not be followed by deviant officers will not prevent those officers' actions any more than gun bans stop criminals who are already willing to break the law. As Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, noted , the policing reforms that Democrats pushed for after the death of Floyd would not have kept Nichols' death from happening.\n\nNo matter what laws are passed, bad cops bent on breaking the law will not consider those laws as they are breaking them.\n\nMemphis and Tennessee officials have thus far acted appropriately by moving swiftly toward transparency and accountability in the aftermath of Nichols' beating and death. The police officers in question were fired. They have each been charged with causing or facilitating the death of Nichols. Almost certainly, they will go to prison.\n\nThere does not appear to be any sugarcoating of responsibility by the department or the city of Memphis for civil liability for causing Nichols' death - and further and necessary scrutiny will likely produce meaningful changes in the training and supervision of Memphis police officers, as it should.\n\nWe should always look for meaningful ways to improve our public safety functions. I recall years ago being a skeptical prosecutor when body cameras were first recommended for wider deployment. I was then of the opinion that a video clip of only a portion of an event might be taken out of context and skew the evidence.\n\nHowever, I have long since learned to embrace the value of the body camera and the dashboard camera as not only solid evidentiary tools for evaluating the potential criminal behavior of suspects but - just as importantly - as reliable and necessary checks on police conduct and procedures.\n\nThe job of a police officer is to protect and serve. It is one of the most dangerous jobs in existence. Police across the nation deserve our utmost respect and gratitude - just as we all deserve that they be held accountable for upholding the same laws they are sworn to enforce.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Why Banning Chokeholds Endangers The Lives of Aggressors And Police\n\nI'm not particularly squeamish, but I could not bring myself to watch the entire video of George Floyd's death. I could not endure the brutal and callous way he faced his final moments.\n\nNow, as a martial arts practitioner, I have seen plenty of people knocked out or choked out. In fact, it's happened to me. What happened to Floyd was different. Law enforcement officers and martial arts teachers I have spoken with all agree.\n\nFormer police officer Derek Chauvin applied overbearing force to the side of Floyd's neck. It was by no reasonable definition a \"chokehold.\" The pressure held for almost nine minutes was unnecessary and inexcusable. It was not a split-second decision that the officer had to make. Kneeling on someone's neck and constricting arteries and the carotid sinus while maintaining that pressure on an unconscious man is not a chokehold. It was a form of abuse and should be prosecuted.\n\nFor understandable reasons, then, the response of many to Floyd's death, along with the resulting protests, is, \"We need to do something!\" Yet that reaction is also a dangerous one. The proper course of action concerning the complex problems of race and policing in the United States is far from obvious. Doing \"something\" for the mere sake of being able to say that \"something\" was done often makes things worse.\n\nThere have been multiple calls to ban or limit chokeholds. This is not a helpful way of addressing the problems we face. It could even make already dangerous situations more perilous. Indeed, any time people with no knowledge of subject change regulations and legislation, mistakes are bound to follow. Changes to law and policy should come as a result of informed and reasoned debate.\n\nHaving studied martial arts for several decades, I forgot how scary words like \"choke\" and \"strangle\" sound. To many, those words elicit images of vicious attacks designed to kill. In reality, they are simply one of the options available to martial artists, and I have helped many students learn how to use them properly, including my children.\n\nChokes are simply tools, used both in sports like judo and violent situations. Like any tool, they can be used for good or harm. Like guns, however, they can evoke strong visceral reactions. In reality, chokeholds can be a safe, responsible, even peaceful tool to be used in a violent altercation.\n\nTo begin with, there are two fundamental types of chokes: air-chokes and blood-chokes (sometimes called \"strangles\"). They are applied differently and induce different physiological effects.\n\nAir-chokes occlude the trachea and stop a person from inhaling. The effect of an air choke is usually immediate, not because of the loss of air, but due to the pain and damage caused to the trachea. People instinctively react to pressure to the front of their throats by backing up as quickly as possible.\n\nIf they cannot, because the back of their head may be against the ground or restrained, additional pain and even damage can occur to the trachea. If applied with extreme force, this can eventually lead to asphyxiation.\n\nThe big problem with air-chokes is not the lack of air while the choke is applied, but the damage that may happen to the trachea. If the damage is severe enough, even when the choke is released, the injury may prevent the person from breathing properly, resulting in asphyxiation later. Thus, air-chokes hold a real danger, especially if applied carelessly and improperly.\n\nBlood-chokes, on the other hand, stop the flow of blood to the brain by restricting the carotid arteries on either side of the neck. When the brain stops receiving blood, the drop in glucose makes a person \"pass out,\" or what physicians call syncope .\n\nThis is actually painless, like falling asleep. When the choke is released, blood returns to the brain and the person regains consciousness. Damage to the brain from a loss of blood results only if the choke is held for minutes after syncope. Thus, a blood-choke, despite its scary name, is a fairly safe technique.\n\nJust how dangerous are these chokeholds? Given that hundreds of thousands of people practice them daily at innumerable judo and jujitsu schools, they are clearly not as dangerous as they may sound. Blood-chokes are especially safe. Unless one is applied to an unconscious individual for three minutes or more, which does not happen by accident, they are generally harmless.\n\nAn overzealous application of an air-choke, however, can certainly injure a person; an extremely vicious use could kill. Yet the firm use of this type of choke is used responsibly every day in martial arts schools throughout the world.\n\nThis brings us to the question of the police using chokeholds. Law enforcement officers follow something called the \"force continuum\" when trying to direct others' behavior. It begins simply with their presence, moves up to verbal commands, different degrees of unarmed force, non-lethal tools like Tasers, and finally lethal force with firearms.\n\nA blood-choke is a much better way to stop a person from fighting than striking a person repeatedly with a baton. There is no injury or shedding of blood.\n\nEven an air-choke has an appropriate place on the scale. Imagine a criminal has tackled a police officer to the ground and is on top of him trying to grab his pistol. Another officer arrives from behind. What should he do? In this scenario, I believe a strong air-choke to pull him off that first officer is in the best interest of everyone. There may be some pain and even possible injury to the aggressor, but far less than many of the other tactics that could be used.\n\nIf defending officers are banned from using chokeholds, they are left with three choices: use less aggressive but less effective techniques; escalate on the continuum of force to more violence; or use an effective chokehold and face prosecution. None of these are ideal in this situation.\n\nWith some jurisdictions forbidding or severely restricting the use of chokeholds, we are moving in a dangerous direction. Doing so denies a useful law enforcement tool that could be effective in many situations that require some force to address the situation at hand.\n\nProper training of police officers in the use and dangers of chokeholds would be \"doing something\" useful and I strongly support this. The responsible use of chokeholds serves the best interest of all involved. Counter-intuitive as it may sound, they are sometimes the virtuous choice.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

      "text": "Black Cop: Lies About 'Institutional Racism' Are Making America More Violent\n\nKaty Faust interviewed an African-American police officer about the recent murder conviction of former Minnesota police officer Derek Chauvin in the death of George Floyd. The officer asked to go unnamed in this article to avoid retaliation for his views. The Federalist obtained documentation of his employment as a police officer.\n\nDid you watch the Derek Chauvin trial coverage?\n\nNot really, just bits and pieces. I already had a pretty clear idea of what took place. And much of the new coverage was biased-they were just showing the parts that pushed a narrative. The news elevated my stress level and with all that's already going on, I don't need that.\n\nDo you think Chauvin got a fair trial?\n\nNo.\n\nWhy wasn't it fair?\n\nIt seemed everybody made up their mind about his guilt before the trial. In addition, the jury wasn't sequestered and so they saw the biased coverage and were likely influenced by that coverage or seeing riots and threats of riots around the country. That's going to put a lot of pressure on the jury to come to a certain decision.\n\nA jury is supposed to make its determination based on the subject matter and expert witnesses, not go home and watch the news and form their opinions that way. So no, it wasn't fair.\n\nHow would you characterize public opinion towards police today?\n\nI've been doing this for 15 years. I'm middle of the road-not an old timer, but not brand new. But even in 15 years, things have changed. There is a general narrative that demonizes law enforcement.\n\nIn my opinion, the anti-cop narrative began with the Obama administration. He made negative law enforcement comments, and in controversial cases would show up to the deceased's funerals (which were later justified as lawful shootings). The Dallas five were killed under Obama and he didn't show any respect toward them.\n\nTrevor Noah recently said of Derek Chauvin, \"We're not dealing with bad apples, we're dealing with a rotten tree.\" What do you say to that?\n\nIt's funny when the media wants to talk about a rotten tree. The irony there is amazing. Big media talking about a tree being corrupt? Give me a break.\n\nDo you think that policing in America is systemically racist?\n\nHa. Absolutely not. No.\n\nIn your experience has policing become more difficult since George Floyd's death?\n\nYes, but we've been on this slippery slope since the start of the BLM [Black Lives Matter] movement. That's where things really started to take a serious turn. We were already nose diving, and Floyd's death is just more fuel to the fire.\n\nAll these cases involve a false narrative of police racism, from Trayvon Martin to Rayshard Brooks to George Floyd, causing tension and a divide between law-enforcement and the community. People want us to solve their problems, but they don't want us to defend ourselves or the community while doing it.\n\nThey want us to be able to talk it out with everybody, but the reality is we can't always do that. If people shoot us, we're going to shoot back. That's what happened with the Breonna Taylor case. Somehow people are upset about that.\n\nAnd facts don't matter. Even though the false Michael Brown \"hands up don't shoot\" narrative was proven false, I still can't drive around the city without someone eyeballing me and putting their hands up and saying \"don't shoot\" while I drive past.\n\nHow has this false narrative about police changed your job? Do your fellow officers worry that as a result they wouldn't get a fair trial if they're in a situation that escalates?\n\nSome things have not changed. People have never wanted to be arrested. They didn't before and they don't now. So that's no different.\n\nBut what used to concern us was bringing in the suspect safely and prioritizing how we're going to defend ourselves if need be, and get home to our family. But now it's, \"I don't wanna go to jail. And if this dude has an underlying medical condition I don't know about and he decides to fight or he is on drugs or he strokes out on me, a jury might send me to jail for this.\" It changes the kinds of calls we respond to.\n\nSo we are now at a point where we have to focus only on responding to emergencies. Because most of the things people call us for are not emergencies, they are inconveniences. We used to be more than happy to respond, but the problem is a lot of times, it's criminals who are causing the inconvenience.\n\nSo if, for example, we get a complaint about people speeding down someone's street, we used to gladly go. But when we do a traffic stop, we don't know who we are pulling over; they might have a warrant, they might have committed a crime, they might not have a license, it could be a DUI. Now if he decides to escalate because he doesn't want to go to jail, our badge could be on the line just for a speeding call.\n\nOr we get calls from businesses where a guy has been passed out in their bathroom for three hours after shooting heroin. It's bad for business so they call us and say, \"Hey, we don't want to confront this guy, can you come do it for us?\"\n\nWe used to gladly take those calls, but often the addict has warrants and they don't want to go to jail. If it escalates, sometimes the business turns around and backstabs us. So now we respond if your safety is in question but otherwise, unfortunately, we can't risk our lives or our careers or jail time over someone's inconvenience.\n\nHow's morale?\n\nEach agency has its own subculture, but this region's morale is generally crappy. A lot of officers are leaving. We don't have anybody, anybody applying to be officers here, so we are lowering standards to get numbers up.\n\nThe academy has lowered their physical fitness standards and we have dropped ours completely. Now if you've got a pulse and some experience? We will take you. Because that's how bad we are hurting for bodies. Of course, the lowering of standards does not increase the odds that things are going to be done right. So it will perpetuate the problems.\n\nBut even before we had to lower standards, we were still struggling. The public thinks that we are ninjas, that we are all MMA fighters. For a while that belief was helpful because it instilled a bit of healthy fear, of not wanting to mess with us.\n\nBut the reality is that most police officers have a YMCA degree (not to knock on the YMCA) but it's like they went to one little seminar on self-defense and that's kind of it. The level of training we get is so subpar compared to the demands.\n\nNot only that, but there are important and serious limitations on our interactions with suspects. As an officer, I have a responsibility, we as a police force have a responsibility, to limit the amount of force to get someone into custody. But if they are overcoming my efforts, I can escalate my use of force, within reason, to effectuate that arrest.\n\nThe Chauvin case is, in my opinion, simply that: a typical officer struggling to control a large, uncooperative human. His death sucks, it sucks. I wish we were better trained. I wish Chauvin was better trained. Could his death have been avoided? Yeah, I think so.\n\nIn our precinct, we pitch and brainstorm ways that we can get better training. Unfortunately, \"defund the police\" is a movement, so our funding has already been slashed. There's no money for classes or overtime for us to go.\n\nSo they're basically saying, \"We wish you guys were ninjas,\" and we're saying \"OK, send us to ninja school.\" And they're like, \"No we're not going to pay for that. We're just gonna put you in jail when you don't meet our expectations even though we won't give you the training you need.\"\n\nWhat would you tell America about this moment in time and your job?\n\nI think that it's important for people to know that we still have a heart to have people's backs. There isn't a cop I know who isn't willing to lay their life on their line for someone else in a life-or-death situation. But what we're not willing to do is put ourselves or our careers or our families on the line for people's inconveniences.\n\nI'm happy to do that as a luxury as long as we have community support. But if we don't have your support, and you call us about your neighbor's loud music? No. Go talk to the neighbor yourself. Or buy some ear plugs.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

Forty-year-old John Hurley, who confronted the gunman, was also fatally shot.\n\nAccording to the department, police were notified of a disturbance near Arvada Library in Olde Town Square around 1:15 p.m. on Monday. About 15 minutes after Beesley responded to the call, the department received reports that multiple shots had been fired and an officer was hit. The gunman was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nWhile not much is known about the confirmed gunman, Strate said the shooting was fueled by disdain for police officers.\n\n\"I can tell you that Gordon was targeted because he was wearing an Arvada police uniform and a badge,\" he said.\n\n\"Communities need to understand and know what they ask of their police officers - the sacrifices they make, the cost to them to protect your safety. This was a deliberate act of violence,\" Strate said.\n\nStrate identified the second victim John Hurley as a \"good Samaritan\" who \"likely disrupted what could have been a larger loss of life.\"\n\nHurley was shopping at the Arvada Army Navy Surplus store where eyewitness Bill Troyanos works, Denver7 reported . Troyanos said when gunshots rang from outside, Hurley pulled his concealed carry-on gun from its holster and ran toward them.\n\n\"He did not hesitate; he didn't stand there and think about it. He totally heard the gunfire, went to the door, saw the shooter, and immediately ran in that direction,\" Troyanos said. \"I just want to make sure his family knows how heroic he was.\"\n\nAccording to more eyewitness reports, Hurley urged bystanders to safety. Although police have not released information on who shot Hurley or the gunman, Troyanos said he witnessed Hurley confront and shoot the gunman.\n\nAccording to Hurley's friend Brian Romero, who organized a GoFundMe for the Hurley family, Hurley is survived by his loving parents and sister.\n\n\"[John's] story is not making national news as the officer involved was a 19 year veteran and beloved community member,\" Romero wrote. \"Johnny was also a victim of senseless violence all too prevalent in today's society.\"\n\nThe APD is conducting an ongoing criminal investigation to monitor the case, but authorities said the shooting appears to be an isolated incident.\n\n\"My thoughts are with the family and friends of the officer who was tragically killed in the line of duty while swiftly and bravely responding to protect civilians in the area,\" Colorado Gov.

A local police officer climbed to the rooftop where Crooks was positioned and encountered him. Crooks pointed his rifle at the officer, who then retreated down the ladder of the building.

Another device is believed to have been found at Crooks' home as well.\n\nThe incident resulted in the death of one rally attendee and left two others critically injured. In response to the attack, Trump released a statement on Truth Social, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and thanking law enforcement for their rapid response. He also called for national unity in the face of violence.\n\n2024-07-15T08:06-0400 | Comment by: Dean\n\n'...either malice or massive incompetence.'  The SS saw the shooter, waited for the shooter to take the shot.  When he failed to take out Trump, the SS had to shoot and kill the would-be assassin.  They don't want any loose ends talking to the press.  Plausible deniability JFK style.\n\nPowered by The Post Millennial CMSTM Comments\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.

Two others were also injured during the confrontation between protesters and police. According to Fox 2 Now , Officer Travis Brown is fighting for his life at the hospital with a brain injury after being knocked to the ground be a protester, according to the police. Several protesters have been arrested with charges and two other police officers were also hurt aside from Brown. Elijah Gantt, 28, is the man accused of knocking Brown to the ground, causing the brain injury. Gantt has been charged with first-degree assault, two counts of fourth-degree assault, resisting arrest, and first-degree property damage. Ferguson Police Chief Troy Doyle said on Saturday during a press conference, \"I had to look his mother in the eye and tell her what happened to her son. I'm never gonna do that again, I promise you that.\" \"He wanted to make an impact in our community,\" the police chief commented. Doyle described Brown as \"the type of officer that we want in our community,\" adding, \"And what happens? He gets assaulted.\" According to Doyle, the police blocked off an area on Friday night to allow for the protest, but the protest turned violent during the evening. Protesters began to shake the fence at the Ferguson police station. Some of the portions of the fence were broken and stolen in the chaos. Doyle told reporters that Officer Brown was charged by a man, causing him to fall and hit his head, leading to the brain injury. Officer Travis Brown could be seen getting carried away by his colleagues in the midst of the chaos. St. Louis County Prosecutor Wesley Bell told reporters at the press conference that the man who knocked Brown to the ground is among those who has been arrested. Bell told people that they need to \"bring the temperature down.\" Doyle passionately defended the Ferguson Police Department, adding that it has become a \"punching bag\" for the community since Michael Brown's death in 2014.\n\n2024-08-11T03:17-0400 | Comment by: Dean\n\nFunny how the press shows Michael Brown's picture, not as the thug his was, but as a 'goot boy'.\n\nPowered by The Post Millennial CMSTM Comments\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.

Bradley J. Moon, 49, reportedly had the bumper sticker on the back of his police cruiser during the summer of 2023. Although seemingly innocuous, the phrase has been used to mean \"Fu*k Joe Biden .\" The police department let Moon go in May, ending his career for \"engaging in prohibited speech.\" In October 2023, Moon told his inquiring supervisors that he had no idea that the sticker could be seen as vulgar to some or was in any way political. He reportedly told them that he had only bought the sticker to support another police officer's son who had suffered health problems but was now okay. However, body camera footage showed Moon talking to other police officers about the meaning of the sticker. Rep. Bill Posey (R-FL) helped popularize the \"Let's Go Brandon\" chant when he finished a speech on the floor of the House of Representatives by shouting the phrase and pumping his fist in the air, the Mail noted. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) was seen with a \"Let's Go Brandon\" sign at the World Series and other Republican lawmakers and supporters began to pick up the slogan until it became a de rigueur form of protest. Moon was unable to explain why he put the sticker on a police car and not his own vehicle, saying \"I have no idea.\" A subsequent review of the police department's decision was apparently not favorable for Moon. The Office of the Police Ombudsman said that Moon had related how Spokane then-Mayor Nadine Woodward had praised the sticker and that none of the police officers that Moon worked with complained about the sticker being on the police car. The police department's Administrative Review Panel stated that \"regardless of policy, it is common sense that there is no justification for placing such a sticker or phrase on a city owned vehicle. The sticker was obviously inappropriate and should have been recognized by any supervisor as a violation of department policy.\"\n\nPowered by The Post Millennial CMSTM Comments\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.

      "text": "Washington state police officer injured while escorting Kamala Harris about to lose health benefits\n\n\"I am sure if somebody from the Vice President's office picked up the phone and called the city of Bellevue and said, 'Hey, don't cut this guy's benefits' ...you think that would move the needle one direction or another.\"\n\n\"I am sure if somebody from the Vice President's office picked up the phone and called the city of Bellevue and said, 'Hey, don't cut this guy's benefits' ...you think that would move the needle one direction or another.\"\n\nA Washington police officer is about to lose his health benefits while still recovering from injuries he sustained while escorting Vice President Kamala Harris' motorcade . Motorcycle officer Kevin Bereta from the Bellevue Police Department was working as the motorcade's security detail surrounding when Harris visited Seattle in August to fundraise for the Biden Victory Fund's 2024 re-election campaign and to discuss climate change to mark the one-year anniversary of President Joe Biden signing the Inflation Reduction Act. The benefits are set to expire Friday. According to his attorneys, \"Per protocol, he was not traveling the posted speed limit but was exceeding it. As he began traveling across the ramp, his motorcycle struck the side of the ramp, and he was ejected. His arms moved along the top of the old 27\" tall railing, and he tried to grab onto it without success. Current code for railings is 42\" tall.\" \"Because the railing was too short, he slid over the top and plunged 60 feet onto the highway below.\" He landed on the concrete and an oncoming vehicle was able to stop and avoid hitting him but he suffered severe injuries to his back, leg, and shoulder from the fall, and months later is still fully disabled and unable to return to work. Bereta's attorney Mo Hamoudi told The Ari Hoffman Show on Talk Radio 570 KVI , \"This is a crisis what's happening here...he's losing his benefits, and he's going to have to go on COBRA. And if anybody knows anything about COBRA, it's very expensive coverage. It's going to run him about a couple of thousand dollars a month.\" He added, \"It's also not the police department's responsibility, it's the city's responsibility. The police department has been very supportive of Kevin. It's that they (the city) are not agreeing to extend those benefits. It's a contract issue. And as we know, any contract can be modified and changed. An exception can be made.\" \"He had a couple of surgeries...he is in a wheelchair. He injured his spine. It was a burst fracture of his spine...it's the type of injury that the road to recovery is going to be quite long.\" Hamoudi noted that Bereta's wife Jenny, an ICU nurse, is now only able to work part-time so she can care for her husband and their three kids. Hamoudi added that the officer and his legal team haven't heard from anyone in Harris' office. \"We haven't heard anything from them. I mean, I am sure if somebody from the Vice President's office picked up the phone and called the city of Bellevue and said, 'Hey, don't cut this guy's benefits' ...you think that would move the needle one direction or another.\" Bellevue City officials said in a statement to KOMO News : \"When employees of the City of Bellevue are injured on the job, they are eligible for partial wage replacement and benefits coverage through the State Worker's Compensation Program. Our city-provided benefits are consistent with other cities in the region, and they are based on best practices and medical insurance carrier contracts and are ratified in agreements negotiated with the unions representing our employees. The city has a duty to administer our policies consistently, and we will continuously evaluate these policies to ensure they reflect our value of commitment to employees and responsible stewardship to the community we serve. In addition, the City of Bellevue works very closely with injured employees to explore all options and ways to prolong their city-provided benefits to the greatest extent possible, which includes offering light-duty work when appropriate as a means to retain city-provided health coverage. The city does not arbitrarily choose to end health benefits for an employee but rather operates within established policies and contracts negotiated with our unions that are intended to cover typical circumstances. Thankfully, there are important community partners the city has coordinated with to support employees, particularly police officers when standard policies do not meet their needs.\" The Bellevue Police Foundation has been collecting donations to support Bereta and his family during his recovery, and a GoFundMe has been set up to help raise funds.\n\nPowered by The Post Millennial CMSTM Comments\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.
