      "text": "'A new low': AOC slams NYC mayor Adams for blaming Jordan Neely's death on 'serious mental health issues'\n\nThe death of Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old homeless man, in a New York City subway on Monday, May 1 has set off major tensions between prominent Democrats in the United States' largest city.\n\nNeely died after being placed in a chokehold by one of the passengers: a 24-year-old U.S. marine. According to CNN , another passenger, Juan Alberto Vazquez , recorded the incident using his smartphone. Passengers, Vazquez said, became uncomfortable when Neely was yelling and said, \"I don't care if I die. I don't care if I go to jail. I don't have any food.... I'm done.\"\n\nProgressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York), on Twitter, attacked the marine as a \"murderer.\" And NYC Mayor Eric Adams , a centrist Democrat and former NYC police officer, was vehemently critical of her comments - which he described as \"irresponsible at a time when we're still investigating the situation.\"\n\nThe marine has not been arrested, and District Attorney Alvin Bragg, Jr. has not decided whether or not any charges will be pressed.\n\nAOC has not only lambasted Adams' response to Neely's death, but also, mainstream media coverage - including reports by the New York Times.\n\nIn a May 3 tweet criticizing the Times , AOC wrote, \"Jordan Neely was murdered. But bc Jordan was houseless and crying for food in a time when the city is raising rents and stripping services to militarize itself while many in power demonize the poor, the murderer gets protected w/ passive headlines + no charges. It's disgusting.\"\n\nRight-wing pundits on Fox News, including Jesse Watters and Lawrence Jones , were quick to describe the marine as a concerned citizen who rushed to the defense of passengers who felt threatened. Jones slammed AOC and Black Lives Matter protesters, saying, \"Apparently, they think that Jordan Neely should have been allowed to attack innocent passengers on the subway.\"\n\nWatters praised Adams' response; the Democratic mayor, however, was much more neutral than the Fox News hosts in his statements, saying that a full investigation of the incident should be conducted and that AOC's comments were not helping.\n\nOn May 3, AOC also posted , \"It is appalling how so many take advantage of headlines re: crime for an obsolete 'tough on crime' political, media, & budgetary gain, but when a public murder happens that reinforces existing power structures, those same forces rush to exonerate & look the other way. We shouldn't.\"\n\nIn a May 3 statement , Adams said, \"Any loss of life is tragic. However, we do know that there were serious mental health issues in play here, which is why our administration has made record investments in providing care to those who need it and getting people of the streets and the subways, and out of dangerous situations. And I need all elected officials and advocacy groups to join us in prioritizing getting people the care they need and not just allowing them to languish.\"\n\nAOC, in response, tweeted , \"This honestly feels like a new low: not being able to clearly condemn a public murder because the victim was of a social status some would deem 'too low' to care about. The last sentence is especially rich from an admin trying to cut the very services that could have helped him.\""

      "text": "'An especially heated debate': Jordan Neely's death reopens painful wounds among New Yorkers\n\nNew York City has been rocked by major political tensions and infighting among Democrats following the death of Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old homeless man, on Monday, May 1. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York) has attacked the 24-year-old marine who put Neely in a chokehold (identified by the New York Post as Daniel Penny ) as a \"murderer,\" and City Comptroller Brad Lander described the marine as a \"vigilante.\"\n\nBut centrist Democratic Mayor Eric Adams , a former New York City police officer, denounced their comments as \"irresponsible,\" saying that the case deserves a careful and thorough investigation - not inflammatory rhetoric and a rush to judgement.\n\nIn an article published by the New York Times on May 4, reporters Emma G. Fitzsimmons and Maria Cramer stress that the incident has \"become a political Rorschach test\" among New Yorkers and is \"dividing the city along long-simmering fault lines.\"\n\nPenny, according to CNN , was a passenger on NYC's F Train when he saw Neely (who suffered from mental illness) yelling and making other passengers fearful. One of the passengers, Juan Alberto Vazquez , filmed the incident using his smartphone; Neely reportedly said, \"I don't care if I die. I don't care if I go to jail. I don't have any food.... I'm done.\"\n\nFitzsimmons and Cramer describe comments from Ocasio-Cortez and Adams as an \"uncommonly tense exchange\" between the NYC Democrats, noting that Neely's death raises issues ranging from mental health, poverty and homelessness to fears over crime and safety.\n\n\"In the wake of Mr. Neely's death,\" the Times journalists report , \"the debate has become especially heated.... In a city where disturbing subway encounters are a fact of life, many (New Yorkers) wrestled with uncomfortable questions about how they might respond when faced with a person who is both frightening other riders and obviously in crisis.... Every New Yorker has a story of witnessing an outburst or a violent episode on the subway and struggling over how to respond.\"\n\nRight-wing pundits at Fox News, from Jesse Watters to Lawrence Jones , have been quick to exalt Penny as a concerned citizen who took action to protect fellow subway riders when they felt threatened. Jones, an African-American conservative, was vehemently critical of AOC and Black Lives Matter protesters, saying, \"Apparently, they think that Jordan Neely should have been allowed to attack innocent passengers on the subway.\"\n\nNeely was reportedly throwing trash at subway passengers while yelling. Many conservatives have pointed out that Neely had been arrested over 40 times in the past and been charged with assault.\n\nFitzsimmons and Cramer note that Neely's death has \"reminded many New Yorkers of\" the Bernhard Goetz case - a point that journalist Olivia B. Waxman makes in an article published by Time on May 4 .\n\nIn December 1984, Goetz shot four men on the subway who he said were trying to rob him. Goetz had been the victim of a violent mugging in 1981, and his supporters hailed him as someone who was fed up with crime and stood up.\n\nOne of Goetz's outspoken defenders was The Guardian Angels' Curtis Sliwa. Goetz was tried for attempted murder but acquitted.\n\nMany years later, some of the New Yorkers interviewed by the Times after Neely's death said that the May 1 incident underscores their worries about violent crime on the subway.\n\nRahnuma Tarannum, a 25-year-old Brooklyn resident, told the Times that she carries pepper spray for protection and commented, \"Because police are not doing their job, that's why the citizens of New York are taking the law into their hands. Somebody has to do something.\"\n\nMaria Castaño, a 64-year-old Brooklyn resident, told the Times that she views Penny as a hero and added, \"I feel sorry for the man, but he was acting threatening.\"\n\nRead the New York Times full report at this link (subscription required)."

Far from breaking up the cabinet and throwing Hezbollah's ministers to the wolves, the Lebanese nation has suddenly woken up to what it's like to be united - against the Saudis. The Lebanese government has announced that it does not accept the resignation statement which Saad Hariri was obliged to make in Riyadh, and overnight hashtags have appeared on several Beirut streets saying \"kul na Saad\" - \"We are all Saad\". Even the Sunni Muslims of Lebanon are furious at their Sunni counterparts in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe overwhelming vote for Kurdish independence in the referendum in northern Iraq is re-energising Kurdish nationalism and the demand for a separate Kurdish state.\n\nBritish people are among the most depressed people in the Western world, according to new data.\n\nA message came through from Syria on my mobile phone last week. \"General Khadour kept his promise,\" it read. I knew what it meant.\n\nNoam Chomsky has criticised the anti-fascist movement and argued its actions are wrong in principle and it is a \"major gift to the right\".\n\nDonald Trump famously doesn't drink. And almost three-quarters of Democrats would he happy to join him - if he were to be impeached .\n\nNot since Ibn Batuta, travelled the Middle East in the 14th century has anyone set out with higher ambitions that Donald Trump . Batuta, a Moroccan Muslim traveller and scholar, had a few things in common with Trump. He reached what is now Saudi Arabia. He went to Jerusalem. He even had a keen eye for nubile ladies - there were a few wives, not to mention a Greek slave girl to be groped. But there the parallels end. For Ibn Batuta was sane.\n\nDo they feel no sense of shame? What callousness. What disgrace. How outrageous that our compassion should dry up the moment we realised that this latest massacre of the innocents wasn't quite worth the same amount of tears and fury that the early massacre had produced. It fact it wasn't worth a single tear. For the 126 Syrians - almost all of them civilians - who have just been killed outside Aleppo, were Shia Muslims being evacuated from two government-held (ie Bashar-held) villages in the north of Syria. And their killer was obviously from al-Nusra (al-Qaeda) or one of the Sunni \"rebel\" groups we in the West have armed - or quite possibly from Isis itself - and thus didn't qualify for our sorrow.\n\nFunny how another nation's sectarian hatred comes seeping over the national frontier of its neighbours. Mexico is now fighting off the US President's wall mania. Justin Trudeau's Canada looks squeaky clean compared to America. You can forgive the Prime Minister's vanity - Trudeau is now posing Tom Cruise style, eyes narrowed in love towards his wife in her cringe-making Women's Day photo-op with her husband. Not long ago, the same couple blessed the cover of Vanity Fair. But he's the guy who walks talk on immigration, welcomes Syrian refugees with affection, tells them they're \"home\" and generally makes Trump look like a scumbag.\n\nHow far is Saudi Arabia complicit in the Isis takeover of much of northern Iraq, and is it stoking an escalating Sunni-Shia conflict across the Islamic world? Some time before 9/11, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, once the powerful Saudi ambassador in Washington and head of Saudi intelligence until a few months ago, had a revealing and ominous conversation with the head of the British Secret Intelligence Service, MI6, Sir Richard Dearlove. Prince Bandar told him: \"The time is not far off in the Middle East, Richard, when it will be literally 'God help the Shia'. More than a billion Sunnis have simply had enough of them.\"\n\nIt has just become more dangerous to be a foreign correspondent reporting on the civil war in Syria . This is because the jihadis holding power in east Aleppo were able to exclude Western journalists, who would be abducted and very likely killed if they went there, and replace them as news sources with highly partisan \"local activists\" who cannot escape being under jihadi control.\n\nThe Iraqi army, backed by US-led airstrikes, is trying to capture east Mosul at the same time as the Syrian army and its Shia paramilitary allies are fighting their way into east Aleppo . An estimated 300 civilians have been killed in Aleppo by government artillery and bombing in the last fortnight, and in Mosul there are reportedly some 600 civilian dead over a month.\n\nScientists have discovered just how the \"smell of the sea\" is produced by a tiny marine organism that is playing a major role in the fight against climate change.\n\nRising sea levels and erosion have caused five islands in the South Pacific to completely disappear, researchers have said.\n\nForeign leaders visiting King Salman of Saudi Arabia have noticed that there is a large flower display positioned just in front of where the 80-year-old monarch sits. On closer investigation, the visitors realised that the purpose of the flowers is to conceal a computer which acts as a teleprompter, enabling the King to appear capable of carrying on a coherent conversation about important issues.\n\nEarth Day is being commemorated on April 22. Held around the world, it's intended as a moment to reflect on and help preserve the health of the planet - but here are five things that you might not have known about the annual event.\n\nIt was suddenly announced last week that the Iraqi army was taking territory from Islamic State forces in what was presented as the first steps in an offensive to recapture the city of Mosul. It sounded as if the self-declared Caliphate was crumbling and was particularly welcome news since it coincided with the Isis suicide bombings in Brussels. The message was that Isis might be able to slaughter civilians in Europe, but was being defeated on its home turf in Iraq and Syria.\n\nAs General de Gaulle set out for the Middle East in April of 1941, he famously wrote that \"towards the complicated Orient, I flew with simple ideas\".  They all did. Napoleon was going to \"liberate\" Cairo, and Bush and Blair were going to \"liberate\" Iraq; and Obama, briefly, was going to \"liberate\" Syria.\n\nSuper Tuesday. The day when a huge chunk of votes were cast for the U.S. presidential hopefuls and delegates selected in the race to become the next President of the United States. The day the selection process goes from crazy-golf to pro-course. And this year the course belongs to Donald J. Trump. Crazy has gone pro.\n\nAllegations of sexual assault against Donald Trump have resurfaced as the Republican prepares to face a series of primaries on March 1, otherwise known as Super Tuesday.\n\nA Yelp customer service employee has spoken out after she was allegedly fired for posting an open letter about the living wage.\n\nFour billion people live under conditions of severe water shortages at least one month of the year, according to new research.\n\nMcDonald's has introduced kale salad to its US menu - but the fast food giant's health kick may not be quite as virtuous as you think it is.\n\nDonald Trump can be entirely banned from the internet using a Chrome extension.\n\nThe global human population is \"locked in\" to an inexorable rise this century and will not be easily shifted, even by apocalyptic events such as a third world war or lethal pandemic, a study has found.\n\nMcDonald's is facing a \"deep depression\" and could be in its \"final days,\" according to some US franchise owners who were surveyed about the restaurant chain's recent performance.\n\nSyrian Kurdish leaders plan to capture the last border crossing point between Syria and Turkey held by Isis, making it impossible for jihadist volunteers from Europe and elsewhere to reach Isis-held territories.\n\nPeople who live in fracking zones appear to suffer a higher rate of heart conditions and neurological illnesses, according to new research.\n\nAlthough the U.S. study was unable to determine a specific reason, it suggests there may be a link between drilling and ill health, scientists said.\n\nResidents in high-density areas of fracking made 27 per cent more hospital visits for treatment for heart conditions than those from locations where no fracking took place, according to a new study of drilling in Pennsylvania between 2007 and 2011.\n\n\"This study captured the collective response of residents to hydraulic fracturing in zip codes within counties with higher well densities,\" said Reynold Panettieri, professor of medicine at Penn University.\n\nTAKE ACTION: Tell Congress to pass the FRAC Act\n\n\"At this point, we suspect that residents are exposed to many toxicants, noise and social stressors due to hydraulic fracturing near their homes and this may add to the increased number of hospitalisations.\"\n\nThe findings revealed that cardiology and neurological in-patient prevalence rates  were significantly higher in areas closer to active wells. Hospitalizations for skin conditions, cancer and urological problems also increased with proximity to wells.\n\nProf Panettieri cautioned that the study did not prove that fracking actually caused the health problems and said more research was needed to determine exactly what effect any pollution associated with the technique may be contributing to heart conditions or neurological illnesses.\n\nBut the significant increase in hospital visits observed relatively quickly after fracking began in an area \"suggests that healthcare costs of hydraulic fracturing must be factored into the economic benefits of unconventional gas and drilling\", said the report, which is published in the journal PLOS One and also involved Columbia University in New York.\n\nThe highly controversial technique of fracking, that releases oil or gas from shale by blasting a mixture of water, chemicals and sand into rock, is yet to be employed in the U.K. on a commercial scale. It is widespread in the U.S., however, where it has frequently been linked to groundwater and air pollution.\n\nYet a series of reports in the U.K. have concluded that the problems arising from fracking in the U.S. are down to weak regulations and poor techniques. Advocates say that any fracking in the U.K. would be done safely, meaning residents will be shielded from the difficulties experienced by locals in the U.S.\n\nBut opponents of fracking - including the Scottish and Welsh Governments - argue that still far too little is known about the effects of the technique, and say more research needs to be done before it is deployed in the U.K.\n\nThis latest report will be seen as further evidence that more research needs to be conducted before fracking is allowed in the U.K. - even though it does not get to the bottom of the causes of the health problems.\n\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE\n\nFracking Linked to Increased Infant Mortality in Alarming New Study\n\nFracking Has Now Been Linked to Low Birth Weight Babies\n\n8 Dangerous Side Effects of Fracking That the Industry Doesn't Want You to Hear About\n\nBig Texas Oil and Gas Torpedo a Small City's Effort to Ban Fracking - Bye Bye Local Democracy\n\nMaryland's Republican Gov Allows Fracking Ban\n\nFracking May Release Cancer-Causing Radioactive Gas, According to Surprising New Study\n\nLet me try to get this right. The Saudis are bombing Yemen because they fear the Shia Houthis are working for the Iranians. The Saudis are also bombing Isis in Iraq and the Isis in Syria. So are the United Arab Emirates. The Syrian government is bombing its enemies in Syria and the Iraqi government is also bombing its enemies in Iraq. America, France, Britain, Denmark, Holland, Australia and - believe it or not - Canada are bombing Isis in Syria and Isis in Iraq, partly on behalf of the Iraqi government (for which read Shia militias) but absolutely not on behalf of the Syrian government.\n\nThe Jordanians and Saudis and Bahrainis are also bombing Isis in Syria and Iraq because they don't like them, but the Jordanians are bombing Isis even more than the Saudis after their pilot-prisoner was burned to death in a cage . The Egyptians are bombing parts of Libya because a group of Christian Egyptians had their heads chopped off by what might - notionally - be the same so-called Islamic State, as Isis refers to itself. The Iranians have acknowledged bombing Isis in Iraq - of which the Americans (but not the Iraqi government) take a rather dim view. And of course the Israelis have several times bombed Syrian government forces in Syria but not Isis (an interesting choice, we'd all agree). Chocks away!\n\nIt amazes me that all these warriors of the air don't regularly crash into each other as they go on bombing and bombing. And since Lebanon's Middle East Airlines is the only international carrier still flying over Syria - but not, thank heavens, over Isis's Syrian capital of Raqqa - I'm even more amazed that my flights from Beirut to the Gulf have gone untouched by the blitz boys of so many Arab and Western states as they career around the skies of Mesopotamia and the Levant.\n\nThe sectarian and theological nature of this war seems perfectly clear to all who live in the Middle East - albeit not to our American chums. The Sunni Saudis are bombing the Shia Yemenis and the Shia Iranians are bombing the Sunni Iraqis. The Sunni Egyptians are bombing Sunni Libyans, it's true, and the Jordanian Sunnis are bombing Iraqi Sunnis. But the Shia-supported Syrian government forces are bombing their Sunni Syrian enemies and the Lebanese Hezbollah - Shia to a man - are fighting the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's Sunni enemies, along with Iranian Revolutionary Guards and an ever-larger number of Afghan Shia men in Syrian uniforms.\n\nAnd if you want to taste the sectarianism of all this, just take a look at Saudi Arabia's latest request to send more Pakistani troops to protect the kingdom (and possibly help to invade Yemen), which came from the new Saudi Crown Prince and Defence Minister Mohammed bin Salman who at only 34 is not much older than his fighter pilots. But the Saudis added an outrageous second request: that the Pakistanis send only Sunni Muslim soldiers. Pakistani Shia Muslim officers and men (30 per cent of the Pakistani armed forces) would not be welcome.\n\nIt's best left to that fine Pakistani newspaper The Nation - and the writer Khalid Muhammad - to respond to this sectarian demand. \"The army and the population of Pakistan are united for the first time in many years to eliminate the scourge of terrorism,\" Muhammad writes. But \"the Saudis are now trying to not only divide the population, but divide our army as well. When a soldier puts on a uniform, he fights for the country that he calls home, not the religious beliefs that they carry individually... Do they (the Saudis) believe that a professional military like Pakistan... can't fight for a unified justified cause? If that is the case then why ask Pakistan to send its armed forces?\"\n\nIt's worth remembering that Pakistani soldiers were killed by the Iraqi army in the battle for the Saudi town of Khafji in 1991. Were they all Sunnis, I wonder?\n\nAnd then, of course, there are the really big winners in all this blood, the weapons manufacturers. Raytheon and Lockheed Martin supplied £1.3bn of missiles to the Saudis only last year. But three years ago, Der Spiegel claimed the European Union was Saudi Arabia's most important arms supplier and last week France announced the sale of 24 Rafale fighter jets to Qatar at a cost of around £5.7bn. Egypt has just bought another 24 Rafales.\n\nIt's worth remembering at this point that the Congressional Research Services in the US estimate that most of Isis's budget comes from \"private donors\" in - you guessed it - Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE and Kuwait.\n\nBut blow me down if the Yanks are back to boasting. More than a decade after \"Mission Accomplished\", General Paul Funk (in charge of reforming the Iraqi army) has told us that \"the enemy is on its knees\". Another general close to Barack Obama says that half of the senior commanders in Isis have been liquidated. Nonsense. But it's worth knowing just how General Pierre de Villiers, chief of the French defence staff, summed up his recent visits to Baghdad and Iraqi Kurdistan. Iraq, he reported back to Paris, is in a state of \"total decay\". The French word he used was \"decomposition\". I suspect that applies to most of the Middle East.\n\nForeign states that go to war in Yemen usually come to regret it. The Saudi-led military intervention so far involves only air strikes, but a ground assault may follow. The code name for the action is Operation Decisive Storm, which is probably an indication of what Saudi Arabia and its allies would like to happen in Yemen, rather than what will actually occur."

Brandon Gill (R-TX) is dedicated to carrying out President-elect Donald Trump's vision over the next four years.\n\nJared Holt - a journalist and researcher on hate and extremist movements in the U.S. - in an op-ed published by MSNBC on Tuesday submits that \"Gill's success in politics is a harbinger for the next generation of Republican politicians ready to replace current GOP members as they vacate their positions: flush with powerful backers, savvy to social media and eager to deliver on the internet-poisoned daydreams of today's conservative movement.\"\n\nAs a Trump loyalist, Holts notes that Gill's \"campaign appeared to take nearly all of its cues from Trump,\" as the MAGA news site creator \"has shared anti-immigrant talking points , derided 'diversity hires, ' echoed far-right memes , shared nonsense about immigrants eating pets and pressed for mass deportations .\"\n\nFurthermore, Holt writes:\n\nLauding Daniel Penny, who was acquitted after he killed Jordan Neely on a New York City subway train, Gill said at a New York Young Republicans Club event in December: 'I think we need a lot more Daniel Pennys in this country, because there are far too many Jordan Neelys.' On X, Gill also praised Penny's acquittal and remarked, 'It's still not illegal to be white.'\n\nAlthough last year the 118th Congress was deemed one of the most unproductive in US history, the newest Republican member of Congress, according to Holt, said last month he has \"no interest in bipartisanship\".\n\nHolt's full op-ed is available at this link ."

      "text": "How the Republicans became the party of vigilante violence\n\nLet's review.\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL), Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) called Daniel Penny a \"hero\" after the 24-year-old former Marine killed street performer Jordan Neely on a subway despite the fact New York Police Department sources said Neely had not become violent that day, May 1, nor had he threatened Penny.\n\nGov. Greg Abbott (R-TX) has vowed to pardon Daniel Perry, who in April was convicted of murdering Garrett Foster in July 2020 during a Black Lives Matter protest in Austin, Texas, after Perry texted a friend , \"I might have to kill a few people on my way to work, they are rioting outside my apartment complex,\" and drove his car threateningly into a crowd before shooting Foster.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) was among Republican officials who mocked the assault last October on the husband of then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, sharing conspiracy theories about the right-wing vigilante who fractured Paul Pelosi's skull with a hammer.\n\nIn November 2021, Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ), tweeted an altered anime video showing him killing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) with a sword to the neck, earning him a formal censure from the then-Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives ... and pats on the back from Republican colleagues.\n\nThe 2020 Republican National Convention glorified a white couple who, on the lawn of their St. Louis mansion, brandished firearms at peaceful Black Lives Matter demonstrators.\n\nRepublican support for violence is so prolific, it has become a staple of campaign ads . Vice , for one, sees this as evidence vigilantism seeps up from the base, and incendiary media such as Fox News amplify it. While demagogues such as Alex Jones and Tucker Carlson have a history of inciting violence, the godfather of modern-day vigilantism is Donald Trump .\n\nVox counts more than 40 instances , from the launch of Trump's presidential campaign in June 2015 to the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, in which he encouraged or endorsed violence. Following his election, threats against Congress members soared more than tenfold to 9,625 incidents in 2021 alone . \"Far-right terror,\" says Vox , \"is currently the most significant ideological threat in the US,\" with a proliferation of right-wing threats against elected officials across the country . Axios published a roster filled with others.\n\nIn a notorious call for vigilantism, Trump praised child soldier Kyle Rittenhouse \"as the 'poster boy' for the right to self-defense,\" according to CNN . Weeks before traveling to Kenosha, Wis., in August 2020 where he killed two people with an AR-15-style rifle at a Black Lives Matter protest, the then-17-year-old Rittenhouse fantasized about shooting looters .\n\nWhile the corporate media recognize the GOP has \" made violence part of their brand ,\" it doesn't answer the most important question: why this happened.\n\nTrump's scorched-earth racism is the pivotal factor. By winning the presidency in 2016, Trump blazed a social-media shortcut to power. His victory inspired a surge of fascist gangs such as the Proud Boys and Patriot Prayer, and obscure but even more violent outfits including Patriot Front , Resist Marxism , Rise Above Movement , Jericho March and American Guard .\n\nTrump made it possible for any dime-store bigot to jump on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, demonize entire groups - particularly leftists like anti-fascists and BLM - and threaten violence. For those with persistence and a bit of prowess, social-media demagoguery was an easy path to notoriety, money and followers. Operating under the protection of the demagogue-in-chief, and indifference if not sympathy from elements of police, formed by the history of white supremacy, these new hatemongers were able to jump from virtual violence to the real world.\n\nThe violence began with a bang the night of Trump's inauguration when a right-wing couple shot and nearly killed a left-wing protester in Seattle. Within months, far-right riots - and killings - took place in leftist bastions such as Berkeley, Calif., and Portland, Ore., culminating in the August 2017 \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Va., where a neo-Nazi rammed a crowd of counter-protesters with his car, killing Heather Heyer . The shock of the murder, and hundreds of neo-Nazis chanting \"Jews will not replace us\" during a torch-light parade, put extremists back on their heels.\n\nWhite supremacists march on Charlottesville, Va., during the August 2017 \"Unite the Right\" rally that left a woman dead. Image via Karla Cote/Creative Commons.\n\nBut far-right gangs reconstituted themselves, aided by police in Portland who allowed the Proud Boys to turn the city into their fight club with almost no consequences. The George Floyd protests supercharged vigilantism as police aligned with the far right in seeing BLM and antifa as public enemy number one.\n\nThis time the explosion was even bigger: the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nThe only reason Trump's attempted coup did not succeed is because his mob of thousands did not use guns, which convicted seditionist Stewart Rhodes regretted afterwards, against a police force who had every warning imaginable of the coming insurrection.\n\nFar from squelching the taste for violence, the failed coup whetted the appetite of Republican politicians and voters alike for lawless justice.\n\nThis raises a more fundamental question. Why do GOP voters believe it necessary to circumvent legitimate channels to enact their vision?\n\nIt wasn't always this way, and the growing desire for vigilantism is an ominous warning sign for the future of America. In short, there is a vicious cycle from media that stokes fears for profit to a middle class fed the message that those at the bottom are to blame for society's woes to politicians who claim deep-rooted social problems can be solved through policing at home or abroad: the war on crime, the war on drugs, the war on terror.\n\nA crucial similarity in criminalizing social problems is they are racialized, as well. Blacks are to blame for crime, Mexicans for illegal drugs, Muslims for terrorism. This approach begins with Nixon's Southern strategy that delivered him the White House. He used coded racial appeals such as \"law and order,\" \"war on drugs\" and \"benign neglect\" toward the Black community to indicate Black people were a threat whom he would protect the \"silent majority\" of whites from.\n\nBefore winning the 1980 presidential race, Ronald Reagan used overt dog whistles, talking of \" welfare queens ,\" \" strapping young bucks \" buying steak with food stamps, saying the Voting Rights Act was \" humiliating to the South ,\" and kicking off his general election campaign with a segregationist friendly speech endorsing states rights near Philadelphia, Miss., site of the infamous murder of three civil-rights activists in 1964.\n\nAs the right's racial rhetoric got hotter at the presidential level, with George H.W. Bush relying on the Willie Horton ad to win the 1988 contest by implying a victory by Democrat Michael Dukakis would mean \" Black rapists running amok ,\" the era of hate radio simultaneously dawned after Reagan gutted the Fairness Doctrine in 1987.\n\nSoon, Republican voters were sucking on vitriol from the likes of Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, Lou Dobbs, Sean Hannity and Mark Levin for decades. The relentless drumbeat that \"real Americans\" were under attack from feminists/Blacks/Muslims/Marxists/immigrants/Mexicans/queers - take your pick - stoked volcanic rage on the right.\n\nBut for years, Republican voters couldn't adequately vent that anger. Newt Gingrich's Republican revolution that put Congress in the hand of the bomb-throwers in 1994, eight years of the Bush-Cheney \"war on terror\", and the white backlash to Barack Obama under the banner of the Tea Party, were unable to satisfy the desire of a rabid right to not just defeat, but to smash their foes.\n\nThe torrent of right-wing hate helped inspire Timothy McVeigh to bomb a federal building in 1995 in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people, but the atrocity undercut support for far-right extremism . The attraction of racial violence soared after the 9/11 attacks and exploded into a reinvigorated militia movement and a series of racist murders after Obama was elected.\n\nOn one side was Fox News incitement of viewer rage to stay relevant, profitable and powerful, and on the other was wild fantasies of the politics of revenge that government could not fulfill.\n\nEnter Donald Trump. His 2016 campaign completed the electrical circuit triggering a bomb. Millions of Americans, saturated with racist grievances, could now take matters into their own hands. And many did. Trump promises even more unchecked violence if elected again in 2024, telling supporters a few months ago, \"for those who have wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution .\"\n\nTrump has turned the party of law and order into one of lawlessness and chaos."

      "text": "'Shame': Homeless woman who was in labor and needed care was given ticket instead\n\nA pregnant woman was given a ticket by Louisville Metro Police while she was in labor in late September 2024. (Image: Screenshot/Kentucky Public Radio)\n\n\"I've got to go to the hospital,\" a pregnant woman filmed by the Louisville Metro Police Department's body cameras in late September told officers, standing near a mattress beneath a busy overpass. \"What am I doing wrong?\"\n\nThe woman was in labor and had told the police as they approached her that she thought her water had broken, but that didn't stop the officers from giving her a ticket for violating a new Kentucky law that bans all street camping-one of dozens of laws criminalizing homelessness that were passed this year.\n\nLt. Caleb Stewart, who cited the woman in Louisville, told her that he would call an ambulance for her, but when she began moving toward the street to wait for the emergency workers, he yelled at her to stop.\n\n\"Am I being detained?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes, you're being detained,\" he replied. \"You're being detained because you're unlawfully camping.\"\n\nStewart was later heard on the body camera's audio saying he didn't believe the woman was in labor; a public defender representing her told Kentucky Public Radio that she had in fact given birth later that day and the family was living in a shelter while waiting for a January trial date regarding her citation.\n\nThe upcoming trial and the video underscore \"both the absurdity and cruelty of anti-camping laws in KY and those cropping up nationwide,\" said Jesse Rabinowitz of the National Homelessness Law Center. \"This is an extreme incident, but unfortunately, it is not an isolated one. Instead of addressing the cause of homelessness-the fact that more and more people struggle to afford rent-politicians are passing laws that kick people when they are down and make homelessness worse. The solution to homelessness is housing and help, not tickets or fines.\"\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled in July that officials can ban sleeping and camping in public places. Since then, said Rabinowitz, nearly 150 cities across the U.S. have passed anti-camping bills.\n\nThe video was also publicized days after Republican elected officials celebrated \"the person who murdered Jordan Neely , a homeless New Yorker,\" said Rabinowitz. \"And [President-elect] Donald Trump and his billionaire cronies want to round up homeless people and put them in detention camps. All of these things make homelessness worse.\"\n\nShameka Parrish-Wright, director of advocacy group VOCAL-KY, said that \"the disregard and disrespect of these two lives is the direct result of the so-called 'Safer Kentucky Act' that was enacted this year.\"\n\n\"People experiencing homelessness are fighting for their lives across the country and right here in Louisville. Investing in immediate, affordable housing and healthcare is the only way to stop this from happening again-not by handing out more tickets that won't house a single person,\" said Parrish-Wright. \"Shame on the politicians who paved the way for this tragedy.\"\n\n\"If politicians actually cared about homeless Kentuckians,\" she added, \"they would focus on getting them the housing and support they need.\"\n\n- YouTube www.youtube.com"

      "text": "Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis: Two peas in a white nationalist pod\n\nHow strange! Once upon a time , the men who wrote the Constitution were only worried about how young a president could be. They set a bottom age limit of 35 but never considered a top limit of any sort. How things have changed! When I was boy, the oldest president ever - and that was almost 200 years into the \"American Century\" - was Dwight D. Eisenhower who, on leaving office in 1961, had just turned a staggering 70. In doing so, he had outlasted Andrew Jackson, who left the presidency at age 69. Later in my life, Ronald Reagan, after his second term, was almost 78 (my age now).\n\nJoe Biden, on taking the oath of office in January 2021, was already a record-breaking 78. Were he to win again in 2024, he would take that oath at 82 (unlike the youthful Donald Trump, who would be nearly 79). How strange then that no significant younger Democrat is challenging the president even as Ron DeSantis, a mere 44, is taking \"our\" former president on a trip to the GOP version of hell - without as yet, as TomDispatch regular Clarence Lusane, author of the riveting Twenty Dollars and Change: Harriet Tubman and the Ongoing Fight for Racial Justice and Democracy , notes today, much luck. Before you consider Lusane's cogent thoughts on the mad Republican contest to turn this country into an authoritarian hell on earth, let me just fret a little about a Democratic candidate already older than creaky old me.\n\nJoe Biden clearly has no intention of not running a second time - he's already announced - and so is preparing to potentially set an oldest-yet record that may never be broken. It seems to matter little to him that a large majority of American voters, according to the latest polling , would like anything but a Biden-Trump repeat.\n\nAnd honestly, facing the increasingly authoritarian Republican right that's Lusane's focus today, it scares this old guy to imagine scenarios in which Biden's age could effectively hand this country and democracy itself over to the all-too-dangerous Donald Trump or another younger Republican intent on taking us into an authoritarian hell. Just a single Biden health crisis (especially if the U.S. economy were also to undergo one ) and we could all be heading for genuine nightmare territory. Tom\n\nHe appointed three conservative Supreme Court justices who shocked the nation with rulings that dramatically took away rights. He sided with the racists who used \"states' rights\" to push through undemocratic policies locally. And he's the only American president who lost a reelection bid but returned to office in the following election.\n\nYes, I'm thinking of former New York governor and Democrat Grover Cleveland who first won the presidency in 1884, lost his reelection bid in 1888, only to successfully regain the presidency in 1892 against then-incumbent Benjamin Harrison.\n\nIn 2024, Donald Trump hopes to repeat that history in all its ugliness by becoming the second former president to recapture the White House. And mind you, the consequences of that second Cleveland administration were devastating. Three of his Supreme Court appointees - Melville W. Fuller, Rufus W. Peckham, and Edward D. White - were part of the majority in the crucial and devastating 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson case that would sanction racial segregation across the nation and so solidify an American apartheid system that didn't end legally until the landmark 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision.\n\nIn a similar vein, it's hard to imagine how destructive a second Trump administration would be, given his first time in office. In virtually every area of public policy, the Trump administration proved a setback for women, people of color, working-class communities, LGBTQ individuals, environmental advocates, and those fighting to expand human and democratic rights. His three hyper-conservative Supreme Court appointees helped overturn Roe v. Wade , taking away abortion rights for millions without hesitation, while there have also been significant setbacks in the areas of gun safety, religious freedom, workers' rights, and more.\n\nBut in truth, it's not the policymaking that Donald Trump truly longs for. Above all, he clearly misses the corruption, cruelty, and sense of power that came with his presidency. His dream of an authoritarian state in which he can punish his enemies endlessly without accountability (while enriching himself and his family) was thwarted in 2020 when voters rejected his candidacy. The bitterness of that loss still eats at his very being and drives his current presidential bid. As he himself stated, in a second term he seeks \" retribution \" against one and all.\n\nFor those still in the Republican Party, Trump is once again the overwhelming early favorite. While 61% of Americans don't want him as president again - 89% of Democrats and 64% of independents - a whopping 76% of Republicans are Trumpian to the core, according to a March 2023 Marist poll . If impeachments, a slew of coming indictments, and a conviction for libel don't deter his GOP supporters - indeed, they seem to have had the opposite effect - then it's easy to see Trump winning the nomination in a landslide.\n\nYet, in a number of ways, as the Republican Party continues to move ever more to the right, MAGA has already evolved beyond him. Despite the media oxygen he continues to consume, the current moment is less about him than most of us believe. Just as Cleveland reflected the growing racial retrenchment of the white South in the late 1800s, Trump embodies the growing entrenchment of an ever more extremist wing of American politics.\n\nAs hyper-MAGA losing Pennsylvania senatorial candidate Kathy Barnette correctly stated , \"MAGA does not belong to President Trump.\" In referring to the ascendant far-right wing of the Republican Party last year, she claimed that \"our values never, never shifted to President Trump's values.\" Rather it was \"President Trump who shifted and aligned with our values.\" What she neglected to add was that his conversion was completely transactional: he needed their support, and they needed his.\n\nOnce committed, Trump leaned fully into the politics of white supremacy and white Christian nationalism that still animate the base of the party and its most prominent leaders at the local, state, and federal levels. Before, during, and since his presidency, he's hurled racist invective at every category of black Americans - black women, black women journalists, black athletes, black elected officials, black appointed officials, black law-enforcement officers, black election workers, black prosecutors, black youth, black countries, black historic figures, black activists, black-dominated cities, and black political leaders. In rallies and speeches, he regularly refers to any black person who holds him to account as a \" racist ,\" tapping into the prejudices of his base, a crew who nominally contend that racism no longer exists.\n\nTrump - and the most horrendous member of Congress, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene - have championed the January 6th violent insurrectionists. Only recently in a CNN town hall, he promised to pardon \"a large portion\" of them, if reelected, to the cheers of his supporters who conveniently ignore the fact that he didn't pardon them in his last two weeks as president.\n\nIt should be noted that, in his time in office, he failed to keep any of the major promises he made on the campaign trail, including building that border wall, ending Obamacare, passing an infrastructure bill, and lowering the cost of prescription drugs. His one signature piece of legislation proved to be a tax cut that transferred billions of dollars to the already super-rich. His other big achievement, of course, was to stack the Supreme Court with those three ultra-conservative justices who have taken away rights, including the 50-year-old national right to an abortion.\n\nDespite an impulse to hide the most draconian aspects of the GOP policy agenda, it can be glimpsed via Republican initiatives in Congress and those of governors and Republican-controlled state legislatures. At the moment, their far-right trek towards authoritarianism remains largely in sync with Trump's political and personal aspirations for power.\n\nThe DeSantis Dilemma\n\nThere is remarkably little difference between Trump and his main challengers for the presidential nomination when it comes to the politics and policies of the contemporary Republican Party. Take Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.\n\nFor much of the last year, the mainstream media focused its attention on a potential cage match between a resurgent Trump and the now politically deflating DeSantis. It was the undisciplined populist versus the inflexible ideologue, the former president's ability to articulate the most dangerous far-right ideas against DeSantis's proven ability to actually implement them.\n\nFor many on the left and in the progressive world, the debate has been over which of them would be worse, which would be quicker to destroy the country. Would DeSantis's less chaotic approach ultimately be worse than that of the scandal-magnet Trump? Would a growing list of potential indictments benefit or harm Trump? Who would prevail in the battle of the brands - Make America Great Again (MAGA) or Make Florida America (MFA)?\n\nIn the end, the differences between the two of them are likely to prove superficial indeed. In the areas where Americans would be most severely affected, there's hardly a fly's hair of separation between them. Beyond the fact that both are mercurial, petty, narcissistic bigots, as well as textbook definitions of toxic masculinity, it's in the realm of politics and public policy where they might take somewhat different roads that, unfortunately, would head this country toward the very same destination: an undemocratic, authoritarian state whose foundational creed would be racism and unrelenting bigotry.\n\nA dive into the policy wasteland of both reveals a distinctly unsurprising convergence. DeSantis has become infamous for the anti-woke initiatives that have roiled Florida's education system from elementary school to college. Books have been (figuratively and perhaps literally) burned, teachers fired, school boards overthrown, and - from English and history to math and social science - curriculums revamped to fit a right-wing agenda. Almost singlehandedly, the governor has pushed through \"anti-woke\" policies and signed legislation aimed at reconstructing the state's education system from top to bottom.\n\nIt should be recalled, however, that Trump was no slouch when it came to attacking wokeness. On September 4, 2020, he ordered the White House Office of Management and Budget to issue a memorandum that directed federal agencies \"to begin to identify all contracts or other agency spending related to any training on 'critical race theory,' 'white privilege,' or any other training or propaganda\" that might suggest the United States is a racist country. The goal was to cut funding and cancel contracts related to programs or training supposedly employing such concepts.\n\nIn September 2020, with only two months left in office, in a move likely meant to counter the actions of DeSantis, Trump launched a \" 1776 Commission \" whose purpose was to develop a curriculum that would promote a \"patriotic education\" about race and the nation's history. This was a pathetic effort to refute the New York Times's \"1619 Project\" that argued slavery and racism were central to the birth of the nation, a theory that has driven conservatives into a frenzied state of panic.\n\nCynically, that commission issued its \" 1776 Report \" on Martin Luther King Jr. Day - January 18, 2021 - only two days before Trump left office in humiliation. It would be soundly criticized for its host of inaccuracies, its right-wing ideological bent, and even plagiarism that whitewashed American history, its founders, and their racism. A second Trump administration would undoubtedly go all in to put DeSantis in the shade by presenting a distinctly falsified, though politically useful version of that history.\n\nSuppressing the Vote and Cheering Street Violence\n\nDeSantis's ideological opposition to abortion is in sync with Trump's transactional one. While some GOP big names are calling for a national ban, both DeSantis and Trump are trying to find a sweet spot where they can build support, especially among evangelical extremists, while still retaining some possibility of winning educated white suburban women. Unlikely as that is, in a distinctly cowardly move, DeSantis signed his extreme Florida anti-abortion law late on a Thursday night behind closed doors, while Trump continues to fume and worry (legitimately) about paying the cost for losing women voters in a general election.\n\nDeSantis loves to highlight the work of his Gestapo-like election police unit as his contribution to enforcing \"voter integrity.\" Established in 2022, the unit operates out of Florida's Office of Election Crimes and Security (OECS) and includes a statewide prosecutor. It will undoubtedly shock no one that most of those arrested in its initial months were overwhelmingly people of color. Virtually all of them were dealing with a confusing election system that had restored voting rights to some but not all ex-felons. (That system had, in fact, actually issued voter ID cards to former felons who weren't eligible.) DeSantis proudly praised the arrests, no matter that most of them were later tossed out of court. In fact, local prosecutors refused hundreds of OECS referrals.\n\nIn terms of voting rights, though, has DeSantis topped Trump's effort to throw out millions of black votes, attack black election workers, and have his Justice Department support every voter-suppression policy passed by GOP state legislatures? Not yet, he hasn't. And don't forget that Trump also created an ill-fated, disingenuous Presidential Commission on Election Integrity within months of taking office in 2017. Its real purpose was to collect state election data and weaponize it against Democratic voters. That effort, however, proved so clumsily fraudulent that even Republican-controlled states refused to submit information and the Commission was dissolved within seven months. Six years later, with the clear aim of suppressing Democratic and black voters, Trump has been calling for same-day-only in-person voting with paper ballots.\n\nAnd finally, don't forget how both Trump and DeSantis (as well as Texas Governor Greg Abbott) have brazenly celebrated the street violence perpetrated by armed white men. Trump hosted Kyle Rittenhouse at Mar-a-Lago in November 2021. Rittenhouse had shot and killed Anthony Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum, while wounding Gaige Grosskreutz, during racial-justice protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in 2020. He became a cause célèbre of the far-right media and the MAGA movement and was eventually found not guilty, leading to Trump's invitation. The former president has also loudly pledged to pardon charged or convicted violent January 6th insurrectionists.\n\nNot to be outdone, DeSantis recently praised Daniel Penny who killed Jordan Neely, a slim, young black man having a mental health crisis on a New York City subway car. Penny, a trained ex-Marine, applied a chokehold for many minutes. Neely's death was ruled a homicide and Penny has now been arrested for it. Far-right Republicans were quick to issue statements of solidarity and to support fundraising for his legal case. DeSantis referred to Penny as a \"good Samaritan\" and shared a link to his fundraising page, while somehow associating the incident with that number one billionaire scoundrel for conservatives, George Soros.\n\nBy their behavior and words, Trump and DeSantis provide a permission zone for white nationalist violence.\n\nIn the end, the two of them aren't so much highlighting their differences as competing to see who can be the most extreme, issue by issue. As Trump made clear in his recent CNN town hall - functionally, a Trump rally - he has no intention of tacking towards the middle. Quite the opposite, as he heads for Election Day 2024, his hurricane of lies will only grow more extreme, shameless, and dangerous, while the GOP base cheers him on.\n\nDeSantis has, so far, been reduced to running against Trump on the issue of \" electability .\" He claims Trump can't win in a general election - possibly true (if the economy doesn't go into recession) - and is calling on GOP voters to put aside their Trumpian passions and be more practical. Essentially, this is the same argument being made by other soon-to-be also-rans like former Trump U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, former Trump Vice President Mike Pence, and Senator Tim Scott. They all cower when it comes to really going after Trump, becoming instead the political equivalents of passive-aggressive 13-year-olds. Even former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie , who may join the race and has gone from frenemy to all-out never-Trumper, has shown little divergence from the former president's most basic policies.\n\nTrump Misses the Corruption, Cruelty, and Power\n\nWhat distinguishes DeSantis from the rest of the pack and aligns him more fully with The Donald is that they both have an urge to be cruel for no other reason than that they can be. Few political leaders have ever been quite as thin-skinned as Trump. His pettiness is legendary, while it clearly gives him pleasure to inflict pain on others. DeSantis has a similar personality. His treatment of immigrants, the way he describes LGBTQ individuals, and his press releases and speeches against any perceived opponent are filled to the brim with invective and venom.\n\nDeSantis's Make Florida America, or MFA, is a genuine threat and his own version of a MAGA move. A Trump or DeSantis administration would ensure at least four long years of brutal retaliation and murderous policies through the prism of white nationalist Great Replacement rhetoric.\n\nSadly, the problem isn't just Trump - or rather it's not only Trump - or DeSantis either. The horror of our moment is the way the base of the contemporary Republican Party has come to embrace the most extreme views and policies around.\n\nSo, here's a final question for this difficult moment: In a forest of fascism, does it matter which tree is the tallest?"

      "text": "The Heart of the Debate Over Jordan Neely's Death\n\nReaders share their views on the tragedy-and on individuals' responsibility to one another.\n\nWelcome to Up for Debate. Each week, Conor Friedersdorf rounds up timely conversations and solicits reader responses to one thought-provoking question. Later, he publishes some thoughtful replies. Sign up for the newsletter here.\n\nLast week, I asked about the killing of Jordan Neely in the New York City subway and associated debates. Reading diverse opinions can be useful for trying to figure out where justice lies. A trial will best serve that end in this case, but additionally, I believe that it's important for Americans to better understand one another's thinking, and I hope this roundup helps on this matter.\n\nRob focused on the deceased:\n\nNeely's death alone disturbs me more than anything else. While I feel righteous anger and could easily rail against a host of contributors to this outcome, my sadness is deeper than any other reaction. Neely is a person with a tragic past who ended up being too crazy to take care of himself or make use of the help he was offered. He could be scary, threatening, and, at times, violent. It's possible that his whole life was an exercise in running away from the death of his mother. Trouble is, he got lost.\n\nI don't wish to romanticize him, but to pay respects to his life, an easily forgotten cipher in the big city. However much he became troublesome to others, he did not deserve the death that found him in that subway car. My purpose here is to push all polemical chatter aside and simply say a prayer for him and ask for a moment of silence. His life stirs my sense of humanity and reminds me that there are too many people navigating this world with a broken compass, navigating their way around great sorrow, loss, and the riddle we are all faced with: the purpose, meaning, and value of our lives.\n\nHelen explains why her sympathy for Neely coexists with a belief that fearing him was reasonable:\n\nYes, there has to be a better and more ethical way to manage this all-too-common situation. But in the moment, it must be faced that Neely did present a threat. In 2021, he punched a 67-year-old woman in the street, breaking her nose and causing severe facial injuries.\n\nHe could have killed her as easily as he was killed . I'm a vigorous woman, but head trauma at my age could take away my life. Honest discussion is not possible if people say he posed no threat.\n\nNathanael believes that \"a huge amount rests on the details of whether Jordan Neely did anything to physically threaten anyone,\" and describes his own experience with subway violence:\n\nI rode the Washington, D.C., Metro for years, and I vividly remember the brutal knife murder of a 24-year-old man in 2015. Fellow passengers watched in terror as his murderer stabbed or cut him 30 to 40 times, then robbed several of them before getting off the train. I've had that story in my head every time I ride the Metro. I am determined that I will put myself in harm's way rather than letting something like that happen in front of me.\n\nA few years later, I was seated near a door when I heard a man start raising his voice. He appeared to be homeless and was vocally antagonizing people. I didn't think too much of it until I heard someone else raising his voice in response. I looked up and saw another man responding angrily and in a physically threatening way. It looked like a fight was about to start, so I yelled something like, \"Hey!\" and got up and stood between them, spreading my arms and holding on to handrails on either side. I faced the first man, but I was worried about getting clocked by the second man to whom I had turned my back.\n\nThe first man kept yelling, and I just started repeating, \"Let's just get to the next stop.\" When we finally got there, I followed the first man off the train and watched as he headed in the other direction. I remember being scared and thinking frantically about what to do the whole time, but also feeling adrenaline and being grateful that when the time had come I actually had done something, as I'd always been determined to do in my mind.\n\nI got lucky that day: Nobody got hurt. Not me, not either of the men. But I was determined to try to put my body in the way of something that could've turned out worse.\n\nDo I know that Daniel Penny did the right thing or that he's a hero? Absolutely not. If he went too far in responding to purely verbal threats and took Jordan Neely's life because of a too-great willingness to become a vigilante, the law should deal with him accordingly. But I sympathize with the instinct to be vigilant against the threat of public violence, and to be determined not to become a bystander while someone else is assaulted or killed.\n\nMatt is a native New Yorker who has trained in Brazilian jiujitsu for 22 years. He writes:\n\nI have choked and been choked in training countless times. Contrary to what is implied by TV and movies, it is difficult to kill someone with a chokehold. It may take only 10 to 20 seconds to produce unconsciousness, but a person must be choked for an even longer period to start causing brain damage and ultimately death.\n\nPenny probably genuinely believed he was acting in self-defense or in the defense of others. But that didn't give him the right to end Jordan Neely's life. There can be no self-defense against a limp, unconscious body.\n\nJaleelah reflects on self-defense classes and vigilantism:\n\nI took several self-defense classes in middle school and high school. Instructors differed slightly. But they all had one thing in common: They instructed their students to try escaping or de-escalating the situation before resorting to physical attacks.\n\nPersonally, more frequent subway service would be the easiest way to make me feel safer. I would like to be able to exit a train containing an angry incel (real event!) without worrying that I will compromise my job or my education by arriving late at my destination. I am quite heavily on the side of reallocating some amount of police funding and responsibility toward trained mental-health professionals and mediators. I also think the police should screen prospective hires (not just for crime and drug use, but for temperament, empathy, and humility) more carefully, and that they should carry fewer lethal weapons. But I also believe that the prospect of vigilantism-whether committed by shady private security forces or zealous civilians-is the strongest argument against removing police officers from all public spaces.\n\nWhen Gordon watched video of the incident, he identified with the passengers who pitched in to help Daniel Penny. He explains:\n\nI lived in New York from 2000 to 2005, took the subway almost every day (often multiple times a day), and was immensely grateful for the freedom that the subway provided. Having said that, there were at least four or five instances during those five years where someone was acting dangerously erratically or simply intentionally intimidating other people. And although I was never particularly worried for myself, I can absolutely remember being terrified as I thought about what I was going to do if the situation became truly violent and the person began to physically attack another rider, particularly a woman.\n\nI remember thinking how I would have to do something (the Kitty Genovese story made a huge impression on me as a teenager, and I vowed never to sit back and do nothing while someone was attacked like that), but also how awful it would be to die or be seriously injured because I happened to be on the train with the wrong person and got knifed or shot trying to help. I remember desperately looking around the train trying to figure out who, if anyone, would come to my aid if I intervened and how we could coordinate action.\n\nIn those moments, I wished there was someone like Daniel Penny on the train with me, especially someone who was willing to take that first-and by far the hardest-step forward to intervene. I feel badly for Jordan Neely, who obviously was the victim of tremendous misfortune. I wish that his mom had never been killed, and that our society had better systems and programs for dealing with the mentally ill. I strongly support higher taxes to make such programs possible. But I draw the line at tolerance of the potential threat of physical violence toward others, particularly in spaces like the subway. And so I'm grateful that Daniel Penny was willing to step forward in that moment, especially since I would not have the physical courage to take that first step.\n\nI'm also sure I would have been one of the people to step forward to assist Penny as he tried to keep Neely subdued by holding Neely's arms. And while I absolutely wish Neely had not died, if I'm being honest, I would not have wanted Penny to release him before we were all certain that Neely no longer seemed like a potential threat, even if it risked serious injury to Neely.\n\nChadd believes that the issues of \"homelessness, mental illness, addiction, and everything to do with extreme poverty\" require \"an amount of compassion and understanding that is fundamentally counter to what most Americans believe should be available to random strangers.\"\n\nHe writes:\n\nI say all this stuff as a former hard-drug user and a person who experienced homelessness and multiple psychotic episodes. Crystal meth, crack cocaine, and other drugs, combined with the constant fear and dread of being homeless, will do that to a person. I don't believe regular Americans have the capacity to understand what it's really like to be homeless in America because people (1) don't want to know what it's like to be homeless and (2) literally can't understand what it's like without experiencing it.\n\nBeing homeless is not an experience I'd wish on my worst enemy. But a part of me wishes that every person could somehow see themselves as Jordan Neely. I'm oddly grateful for my awful experience because it created a sense of humility, kindness, and compassion for people less fortunate that I couldn't have otherwise. I can't give that experience away. I kinda wish I could! Maybe people might start to understand that these people, without homes, are still just that: people.\n\nSome homeless people have families and friends who love and care about them. Some have literally no one. I can't even imagine what that must be like, to have no one to call. No one to cry to, to reach out to, all while sleeping outside and not knowing where you'll find your next meal or fix or whatever you have to do to make it through the day without walking in front of a bus. I can imagine being homeless because I was, but I can't imagine having no one.\n\nFear is one of the things I remember most about the street. And the fear that poor man was forced to experience during the final moments in his life is disgusting. I'm grateful that during my worst psychotic episodes I wasn't around people who freaked out and choked me to death.\n\nMax warns against making too much of this case:\n\nMore than 8 million people live in New York City, and many of them will regularly have close encounters with strangers. Some of those encounters will go seriously wrong. There's nothing new in this, and nothing unique--to these times, to NYC, to America, to Black people, to white people--about the fact that someone died in an unpleasant way we all wish hadn't happened.\n\nAmong the millions of people who mingle in New York, some will be bad, some will be mad, some will overreact, and some will avoid doing anything. That is just how life is, everywhere and at all times. There may be lessons we need to learn from what happened, but perhaps there aren't. Perhaps all we need to do is make sure the authorities punish anyone who broke the law, and to tell all those who want to turn this sad occurrence into a parable of our times and a symptom of burgeoning social chaos to pipe down.\n\nSusan wonders if there isn't something we could all do to make cases like this less likely:\n\nI'm not a New Yorker, and I've only been on the subway a handful of times. My question is, did anyone offer him any food or drink? Would an act of kindness have had any potential impact? Is there a way to offer kindness without being seen as weak and a \"mark\"?\n\nIt is scary, even to me out here in the safe suburbs, to be reading about people shooting other people for almost no reason whatsoever. I get why people don't want to wait around to see if someone acting erratically will suddenly pull out a weapon, but is kindness something that could change our current social climate, even a little?\n\nReplies have been lightly edited for length and clarity."

      "text": "Notes on the Jordan Neely Subway Tragedy\n\nPlus: Can AI make \"true art\"?\n\nWelcome to Up for Debate. Each week, Conor Friedersdorf rounds up timely conversations and solicits reader responses to one thought-provoking question. Later, he publishes some thoughtful replies. Sign up for the newsletter here.\n\nA 30-year-old man behaves erratically on an afternoon New York City subway train. In an aggressive tone, in the midst of an apparent mental-health crisis, he declares, \"I don't have food; I don't have a drink; I'm fed up. I don't mind going to jail and getting life in prison. I'm ready to die.\" A fellow passenger--a 24-year-old former Marine--grabs him and uses a chokehold to restrain him, with assistance from others. Soon after, the 30-year-old, Jordan Neely, dies. The medical examiner ruled the cause of death homicide by compression of the neck. Some witnesses to the incident have spoken to the press, whereas others have yet to do so.\n\nWhere do you land on any of the ongoing debates about Jordan Neely, the man who was killed; Daniel Penny, the man who killed him; subsequent protests in New York City; or associated issues such as homelessness, the mental-health system, whether the race of Neely (Black) and Penny (white) are relevant or not, whether Neely's history of perpetrating violence bears on the altercation, and when it is legitimate, if ever, for bystanders to intervene to preempt a perceived threat?\n\nSend your responses to conor@theatlantic.com .\n\nNational Review editorialized that \"Jordan Neely did not deserve to die after a former Marine restrained him by the neck on the F train in Manhattan,\" then blamed New York City for his death:\n\nConstrained by outdated law and updated progressive shibboleths, the city's amply funded institutions had effectively abandoned Neely to his psychosis and his addictions, leaving him on the street to be a danger to himself and others. Neely had been arrested 40 times in recent years, many for minor infractions like turnstile jumping, but more recently for assault. In 2021, he punched a 67-year-old woman in the street, breaking her nose and causing severe facial injuries. He repeatedly bounced in and out of the hands of well-funded institutions in New York: hospitals, mental-health facilities, and shelters. According to the New York Times , \"Mr. Neely was on what outreach workers refer to as the 'Top 50' list-a roster maintained by the city of the homeless people living on the street whom officials consider most urgently in need of assistance and treatment. He was taken to hospitals numerous times, both voluntarily and involuntarily.\"\n\nWhen he was facing charges for his assault, the city's judicial authorities bent over backward to induce him to take up a 15-month drug-rehab program, even promising to reduce his felony charges. Neely abandoned the facility after 13 days. A warrant was out for his arrest.\n\nWe would not be hearing sermonettes about anti-blackness and white supremacy if Jordan Neely had died of an overdose in a shelter or on the street. Or if he had been killed, as dozens of other young homeless people have been killed on the subway in recent years, by a perpetrator of his same skin color. Ocasio Cortez and Bishop Swan would have had nothing to say, because Jordan Neely only became interesting to them when his death could be used to indict whites collectively. It is an attempt to scapegoat the reactionary other for the utter failure of progressive blue-state institutions. It is a disgrace.\n\nThe writer John Ganz wants charges filed in the case so a jury can determine guilt or innocence. He writes:\n\nNeely's life did not matter because he was pleasing to others or a perfect victim. It mattered, full stop. That is why his death must be properly investigated. There can be no one so low as to be beneath the protection of the law. That is an absolute and unquestionable principle of justice. And it's a trap to try to saint him in death. It basically accepts the premise of those celebrating his killing: that these are the type of facts that could justify and excuse it. One frightening story from Neely's past will make the whole thing crumble. Neely may have been a kind man, he may have been cruel man, Neely may have been mentally ill, Neely may have been a dangerous criminal, he may have been \"socially useful\" or \"useless\", he may have been all these things at different times in his life: none of that matters. He was a man, not a rabid animal.\n\nI think the public response to Jordan Neely's killing demonstrates a deep moral rot in our city and country. It shows that sentiments that were once made shameful are now being openly expressed in public. I generally try to stay optimistic and believe people are more good than bad, or at least more docile than ferocious, but if this is where people are at, to the point where even public officials will not speak up properly, then I genuinely fear what comes next.\n\nMy colleague Elizabeth Bruenig argues that fear was inextricably linked to the tragic outcome on the subway that day:\n\nMany people feel uncomfortable when confronted with someone in an acute crisis. But certain factors can turn an uncomfortable situation into an intolerable one, such as living in a society where anybody could have a gun, where any agitation can boil over into mass murder. An irate neighbor slaying five people with an AR-15-style rifle after a noise complaint in Texas; an unstable Coast Guard veteran killing one and injuring four while attending an appointment with his mother in an Atlanta hospital. The stakes in any given episode of public agitation or distress or even psychosis aren't typically all that high; the majority of people having crises at any time represent no risk to anyone (save, perhaps, themselves), but the incessant rat-a-tat of bloody headlines makes people feel-viscerally-that the risks they do encounter are unbearably dangerous.\n\nIn common places, we meet one another with a particular disposition: We try to avoid friction, signal politeness, and keep the flow of society moving. This works well, so long as everyone participates. But we must also be disposed toward people in the world who cannot just get along-because of mental illness, acute emotional distress, or other reasons beyond or within their control-and how ought we meet them? With compassion, perhaps, or with concern, even worry, but tempered with fellow feeling. Fear, however, chases out these finer emotions, and fear is the disposition we've grown accustomed to. Presumably it's the legitimacy of this fear that persuaded law enforcement to release the 24-year-old killer with no charges so far.\n\nThis process, through which mundane uncomfortable situations are transformed into terrifying ordeals by all the incidents of random gun violence that came before, is one means by which a healthy community becomes a violent society.\n\nIn his New York Times newsletter, John McWhorter explains the reasons for his own fearfulness on the New York City subway:\n\nThe fact that Penny, as of this writing, has not been arrested pending more information seems unconscionable regardless of legal niceties. Based on what is known, it seems obvious that cutting off someone's oxygen supply for so long would risk killing him-especially following the notorious choking deaths of Eric Garner and, more recently, George Floyd. At the same time, the conversation among political leaders in the news and on social media has largely ignored the experience of legions of subway-riding New Yorkers ...\n\n... We must be able to keep in our minds two things. One is that Neely was unjustifiably killed. The other is that the episode, in all of its horror, highlights what New York City subway riders are being asked to endure daily-and that this, too, is not just ... About once every week one can expect to be in a car with a person, almost always male, who is actively menacing other passengers. I know these men can't help it. Many are without homes and not in full control of their faculties. I suspect that they are often lonely and part of what they are doing is seeking some kind of human connection-to be mentally ill can be to find even negative attention a kind of solace compared to no attention at all ...\n\nThey walk up and down the subway car yelling into individual faces. They stomp. They ball their fists. They curse. These are not just troubled supplicants who occasionally get a little pushy. They are men who make you genuinely afraid that you are about to be assaulted. And in my experience these men are most likely to be directly confrontational with women ... Men in a state of potentially violent agitation are now so common on the subway that I am wary of having my daughters, ages 8 and 11, ride with me, especially after an incident when one such man singled us out and I had to quietly instruct my girls to keep their eyes down and not move.\n\nDonald Trump's 'Unfortunate' Behavior\n\nIn The Atlantic , David Graham details why jurors may have had an easy time concluding that former President Donald Trump sexually abused and defamed the writer E. Jean Carroll :\n\nOn one side was Carroll, whose account of the incident was clear, consistent, and nauseating in its specificity. Carroll sued Trump for defamation after he brushed off the allegation by saying, \" She's not my type .\" On the other side was Trump. The former president faced a challenge in defending himself in the case. Much of Carroll's account matched a modus operandi that at least 26 women who accused Trump of sexual assault have described. Carroll interviewed five of them for a series in The Atlantic in 2020. (Trump denies the allegations.) Trump himself described his approach in the infamous leaked recording from Access Hollywood in which he boasted about sexually assaulting women. \"You know, I'm automatically attracted to beautiful-I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything,\" he said. \"Grab 'em by the pussy. You can do anything.\"\n\nTrump also didn't bother to show up for the trial, claiming that he wanted to spare New Yorkers the traffic jams his presence would cause ... by failing to show up, he sent a message to the jury that he wasn't invested in defending himself. Carroll's lawyers made Trump a presence in the courtroom anyway, playing excerpts from a deposition for the case to devastating effect. In one instance, going straight at Trump's \"not my type\" defense, Carroll's lawyer showed him a photograph of Carroll. Asked to identify her, he mistook Carroll for his ex-wife Marla Maples, whom Trump had to admit was his type.\n\nMore appalling was his discussion of the Access Hollywood tape. Trump, both in the past and in the deposition, wrote that off as \"locker room\" talk. But he couldn't bring himself to repudiate or even distance himself from the comments, even now, nearly two decades later. \"Well, historically, that's true with stars,\" he said. \"True with stars that they can grab women by the pussy?\" Carroll's attorney Roberta Kaplan asked. \"Well, that's what-if you look over the last million years, I guess that's been largely true,\" Trump said. \"Not always, but largely true. Unfortunately or fortunately.\"\n\nIn the Washington Examiner , Tim Carney writes :\n\nToday's sexual abuse and defamation verdicts in Trump's civil trial might be the first time he's paid any serious price for living his life with total disregard for morality or for other people.\n\nA reader's coda\n\nEdith felt something was missing from recent roundups of reader emails on trans issues:\n\nThere's a perspective missing from this \"debate:\" the one that unequivocally sees transness as joy and goodness. Being trans is a wonderful thing. Gender nonconformity makes us into magical creatures that can navigate on both sides and even the edge of the gender coin. It is miraculous and wonderful and needs to be celebrated.\n\nThe capacity of trans folks for wonder is immeasurable.\n\nIn Persuasion, the writer William Deresiewicz argues that although AI might put some artists out of business, \"it will not-cannot-make good art, great art: true art. Which is to say, original art.\"\n\nAs he sees it:\n\nAI operates by making high-probability choices: the most likely next word, in the case of written texts. Artists-painters and sculptors, novelists and poets, filmmakers, composers, choreographers-do the opposite. They make low-probability choices. They make choices that are unexpected, strange, that look like mistakes. Sometimes they are mistakes, recognized, in retrospect, as happy accidents. That is what originality is, by definition: a low-probability choice, a choice that has never been made.\n\nThe African masks in Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon , to take one of a million examples, were a low-probability choice. So were the footnotes in David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest . So was the 40-second chord at the end of The Beatles' \"A Day in the Life.\" So is every new metaphor. Elizabeth Hardwick, who wrote criticism at the pitch of art, was famous for her adjectives: \" the clamorous serenity of [Frost's] old age ,\" Plath's \" ambitious rage ,\" the \" aggressive simplicity \" of the old New York aristocracy. None of these were probable. There are words, in art, for that which is: derivative, stale, clichéd. Boring.\n\nLow-probability choices are leaps: lateral and unpredictable, associative and idiosyncratic. Where do they come from? Inspiration, we say, a word that explains by not explaining. Inspiration is mysterious (not the same as mystical, though some would say it's that, as well).\n\nIts nature is obscure. It is neither conscious nor unconscious but instead involves a delicate and frequently elusive interplay between the two. It is serendipitous-like standing in a thunderstorm, said Randall Jarrell, and hoping to be struck by lightning. That is why successful works cannot be replicated even by the artists who create them. Every new one is a voyage of discovery, its destination unforeseeable-the very opposite of creating, as the AIs do, to a set of specifications. \"The main thing in beginning a novel,\" wrote Virginia Woolf, \"is to feel, not that you can write it, but that it exists on the far side of a gulf, which words can't cross: that it's to be pulled through only in a breathless anguish.\" Quality in art is an emergent property: it arises in the doing, in a dialogic dance between the artist and the work. As the work takes shape, it shows the artist what it wants to be.\n\nThat's all for this week--see you next time.\n\nBy submitting an email, you agree to let us use it-in part or in full-in the newsletter and on our website.

      "text": "A Country Governed by Fear\n\nHow America became a violent society\n\nUpdated at 2:07 p.m. ET on May 4, 2023\n\nThe subway is a commons, and every kind of public behavior is visible there. On the train are, inter alia, teenagers listening to music on their phone, babies wailing, hungry people wolfing down sandwiches from fast-food containers, lovers kissing, lovers quarreling, children whirling around poles, adults trying to corral them, panhandlers asking for money, and occasionally very troubled individuals suffering some kind of crisis. Though people in acute psychological distress have always been a part of public life, and despite the fact that there has never been a time or place where people did not have periodic episodes in full view of others, we still have no real etiquette or protocol for meeting a fellow person who is struggling. For evidence of this, look not just to the killing of the Black man strangled by a fellow passenger on a New York City train on Monday, but to the valorization of his killer by cheerleaders online.\n\nThe killing, like so many acts of contemporary violence, was filmed. In the video, a 24-year-old man places 30-year-old Jordan Neely in a chokehold on the floor of the subway car. According to witness reports, Neely had been screaming that he had nothing to eat or drink and was ready to die or face life in prison, but he had not physically attacked any fellow travelers. In the chokehold, he kicks and flails and eventually goes limp. Other passengers help the 24-year-old, who has not been officially identified, restrain the man until he lies motionless. They had been afraid, one witness later said in an interview , that Neely might have been armed.\n\nFrom the May 2023 issue: American madness\n\nMany people feel uncomfortable when confronted with someone in an acute crisis. But certain factors can turn an uncomfortable situation into an intolerable one, such as living in a society where anybody could have a gun, where any agitation can boil over into mass murder. An irate neighbor slaying five people with an AR-15-style rifle after a noise complaint in Texas; an unstable Coast Guard veteran killing one and injuring four while attending an appointment with his mother in an Atlanta hospital. The stakes in any given episode of public agitation or distress or even psychosis aren't typically all that high; the majority of people having crises at any time represent no risk to anyone (save, perhaps, themselves), but the incessant rat-a-tat of bloody headlines makes people feel -viscerally-that the risks they do encounter are unbearably dangerous.\n\nIn common places, we meet one another with a particular disposition: We try to avoid friction, signal politeness, and keep the flow of society moving.

Presumably it's the legitimacy of this fear that persuaded law enforcement to release the 24-year-old killer with no charges so far.\n\nThis process, through which mundane uncomfortable situations are transformed into terrifying ordeals by all the incidents of random gun violence that came before, is one means by which a healthy community becomes a violent society. Nobody looks forward to encountering people behaving erratically on the subway, and neither does anyone want to fall victim to an act of stochastic violence, but killing a mentally ill man on a train doesn't represent much of an improvement upon either circumstance. It represents the loss of a peaceful commons, the absence of compassion, and the overwhelming fear we have come to accept in our culture of violence. This is the country we have become."

Penny was found not guilty of criminally negligent homicide. The judge dismissed a more serious manslaughter charge. Penny will not face any prison time for the killing. Neely was in the midst of a mental health crisis on May 1, 2023, when Penny attacked and held him in a chokehold for several minutes, even after Neely stopped moving. \"That trial just was ridiculous,\" says Christopher Neely, who had tried to help his nephew and bring him home amid his mental health struggles. He says the family was already resigned to Penny not serving any prison time, but still wanted some measure of accountability at trial. \"I was just hoping and praying that we would get some justice, but we didn't get no justice.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nWe look now at the tragic deaths of two Black men who died while experiencing mental health crises. Both of these stories contain graphic descriptions of violence.\n\nWe begin here in New York, where protests are continuing after a jury Monday acquitted subway vigilante Daniel Penny in the chokehold death of the street performer Jordan Neely on a Manhattan subway train last May, finding Penny not guilty of criminally negligent homicide.\n\nPROTESTERS : Justice for Jordan Neely! Justice for Jordan Neely! Whose streets? Our streets! Whose streets? Our streets!\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Neely was just 30 years old and a beloved Michael Jackson impersonator. He was unhoused. He was hungry. He was crying out for help, when Penny, a white former U.S. marine, attacked him, pinned him down on a subway train by the neck for six minutes.\n\nNeely's family has separately filed a civil lawsuit against Penny. Neely's father, Andre Zachery, was removed from the New York courtroom Monday after protesting the not-guilty verdict, along with others. Zachery spoke from outside the courthouse.\n\nANDRE ZACHERY : I miss my son. My son didn't have to go through this. I didn't have to go through this, either. It hurts, really, really hurts. What are we going to do, people? What's going to happen to us now? I had enough of this. System is rigged. Come on, people. Let's do something about this.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : For more, we're joined by Christopher Neely, uncle of Jordan Neely. He was in the courtroom during parts of the trial.\n\nThank you so much for being with us, Christopher. Our deepest condolences on the loss of your nephew.\n\nCHRISTOPHER NEELY : Thank you.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And I'm so sorry that as you were in the courtroom, you had to see over and over again what happened to your nephew.\n\nCHRISTOPHER NEELY : Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you share your reaction to the verdict?\n\nCHRISTOPHER NEELY : I was totally taken aback. I was - I was - it was very hurtful. It was so unexpected. Friday, before the judge sent the jury away for the weekend to tell them to have a good weekend and think on their verdict, we had people in the jury fighting for Jordan Neely. They were fighting for him. People believe that Jordan Neely should have been alive today. A lot of people did.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Tell us about who Jordan was. I know you brought something that is very precious to you, that -\n\nCHRISTOPHER NEELY : Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : - was precious to Jordan.\n\nCHRISTOPHER NEELY : Yes, yes, yes. Jordan, first of all, he was my sister's son. He stayed with me and my sister. We grew up in the house together. He was just a wonderful kid. He loved sports. He loved art. He loved to dance. And he loved to play chess. Like, I've been a chess player for a long time. And on my free time, I would play with him. And he really enjoyed the game. He liked to dress up. He always liked to look in the mirror and dance with the microphone, get his colors, anything shiny. Anything shiny.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You brought a Michael Jackson jacket?\n\nCHRISTOPHER NEELY : Yes, I -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you show us?\n\nCHRISTOPHER NEELY : Yes, I did. This is a remake that I got Jordan -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Wow!\n\nCHRISTOPHER NEELY : - when he was maybe 25, 24, 25. I think he wore it like two or three times maybe. My mother kept it in the house. This is off the - I got this made off the Michael Jackson soundtrack \"Leave Me Alone.\" At the end of the video, this is the jacket that he had on.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You can hold it up.\n\nCHRISTOPHER NEELY : Sure.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Wow! So, for our radio listeners, Christopher is holding up this gold, red and black - what you definitely identify with Michael Jackson - jacket.\n\nCHRISTOPHER NEELY : Yes, yes. These are the buttons. It took a while to get it done, but they did a great job, I think. This is the back of it. I loved it. It fit him perfectly. And my mother -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Many New Yorkers, when Jordan died, shared videos of Jordan performing as Michael Jackson.\n\nCHRISTOPHER NEELY : Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : He was very well recognized. You, Christopher, as Jordan's uncle, would go around the city looking for him sometimes. Is that right?\n\nCHRISTOPHER NEELY : That's correct.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Subway stops, bus stops?\n\nCHRISTOPHER NEELY : That's correct. Anywhere I can find him, the bus terminal, wherever I think he might be, like if it's cold, where he might be at, or whatever the case might be, especially when I found out that he was smoking weed. That was the first thing I found out about him. He was smoking weed. So I wanted to get on him about that and stand strong and just, like, you know, coming home.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about how the police dealt with what happened, how the police dealt with the man who killed your nephew, and what happened on that day, what you came to understand?\n\nCHRISTOPHER NEELY : It was buddy-buddy. I mean, when you look at the interview, it seems like they were buddy-buddy. They were leading him into finding out what occurred, but after they found out what occurred and they knew that he was dead, they still treated him like buddy-buddy. You know, he was a marine. The guy was a - the officer was an ex-marine, ex-military. He treated him like he was his friend, his buddy, old pal. No handcuffs, no nothing. It's just unheard of.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're talking about Daniel Penny -\n\nCHRISTOPHER NEELY : Daniel Penny.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : - the ex-marine.\n\nCHRISTOPHER NEELY : The ex-marine.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Very different than what happened just in this last week as we witnessed this nationwide manhunt -\n\nCHRISTOPHER NEELY : Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : - against the killer of Brian Thompson -\n\nCHRISTOPHER NEELY : Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : - the CEO of UnitedHealthcare.\n\nCHRISTOPHER NEELY : Oh, yeah, that didn't happen in the Jordan Neely case at all. They actually let him go. They let him go.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : They let Daniel Penny go.\n\nCHRISTOPHER NEELY : Yeah, and we had to fight for justice.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : He had put him in a chokehold, even when passengers - he said that he was defending the other passengers from your nephew.\n\nCHRISTOPHER NEELY : Correct.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Many passengers were saying, \"Let him go.\"\n\nCHRISTOPHER NEELY : Right. A lot of passengers - if you listened on the video, a lot of passengers are saying, \"If you keep holding onto him, he will die.\" You know, you had a guy that called his wife that was from the military, that was just giving him some advice on what to tell the guy that was holding his hand. And nobody listened. Nobody listened.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Has the mayor's office, has Mayor Adams, who is a former police officer himself - has he reached out to you and to your family?\n\nCHRISTOPHER NEELY : Not at all. Not - he didn't come to the funeral, the wake. He didn't - all he's been saying is, you know, that justice was served for the city, especially after the verdict. I mean, everybody heard him. I'm not even giving too much attention to Eric Adams. He's just, to me, just a straight creep.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, right now there's a lawsuit against Daniel Penny -\n\nCHRISTOPHER NEELY : Correct.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : - by his father, Andre Zachery?\n\nCHRISTOPHER NEELY : Correct.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And how else are you moving forward?\n\nCHRISTOPHER NEELY : Oh, any way possible. Like, the way it was done, like just the trial, I really appreciate the prosecutors. I really appreciate everybody that helped. But I want to move forward in a way to where, hopefully, I can get the federal government involved somehow, someway.\n\nThe trial just was ridiculous. I've never seen anything like that. You know, you got a top charge. They take the top charge off, without even letting anybody from the family know about that, and try to get him on criminal neglect homicide. And then that didn't work.\n\nAnd then, when you ask the district attorney about how much time he would get if he was to get convicted - from the beginning, when this first started, for me, I was involved deeply with the district attorney's office in trying to find out what time is he going to get if he gets convicted - they told me 19 years for manslaughter in the second degree, which is the max, and criminal neglect homicide, the maximum is five years. I said, \"Well, how much would he get on the top charge?\" They told me, \"I don't think he - he might do a year or two, or he might get probation.\" So, if that's the case, how much is he going to get for criminal neglect homicide? \"Oh, he's not going to do no time.\" So I already knew, from the beginning, that he was probably going to do no time. So, this here, I was just hoping and praying that we would get some justice, but we didn't get no justice.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And this was Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg's office.\n\nCHRISTOPHER NEELY : Correct.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, we're going to follow this case. Christopher Neely, uncle of Jordan Neely, thank you so much for joining us. Again, our condolences to your family.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Neely was well known as a dancer and Michael Jackson impersonator. He was crying out that he was hungry, when he was fatally attacked on the train by a 24-year-old former marine named Daniel Penny, who was questioned by police but released without charges. The city medical examiner has ruled Neely's death a homicide. The subway killing comes as New York is facing a growing population of unhoused people who lack the support they need, with many facing a mental health crisis. \"What we need to see is not a mobilization of violence, but a mobilization of care,\" says Jawanza Williams, director of organizing at the community group VOCAL -New York. We also speak with musician Lorenzo Laroc, who knew Neely for decades as a fellow busker in the New York subway system. \"He gave freely to the city of New York and brought nothing but joy to this town for decades,\" says Laroc, calling Neely a \"gentleman\" and a \"consummate professional.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I am Amy Goodman. This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org.\n\nHere in New York, 11 people were arrested at a protest Monday night demanding justice for Jordan Neely, 30-year-old unhoused Black man choked to death on a subway car last week by another passenger. Jordan Neely was crying out that he was hungry and thirsty, when he was fatally attacked on the train by a 24-year-old former marine named Daniel Penny. Penny was interviewed by police detectives but was released; he has not been arrested. Monday night's protest follows a similar demonstration Saturday, when police arrested 13 people at a protest where they went onto the subway tracks and demanded Penny face charges.\n\nThis is Juan Alberto Vasquez, an independent journalist who was in the subway car and filmed the fatal chokehold. He's speaking to NBC News.\n\nJUAN ALBERTO VASQUEZ : [translated] The man got on the subway car and began to say a somewhat aggressive speech, saying that he was hungry, he was thirsty, and he didn't care about anything. He didn't care about going to jail, that he didn't care that he gets a big life sentence, and it doesn't matter if he died. ... If there was fear, the people who were bluish or were there, where he separated everything, moved from their place. I stayed sitting in my place, because it was a little further away. But obviously, those moments, well, one thinks fear. One thinks he may be armed.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The law firm representing Daniel Penny released a statement Friday expressing, quote, \"condolences to those close to Mr. Neely,\" and adding, quote, \"Mr. Neely had a documented history of violent and erratic behavior, the apparent result of ongoing and untreated mental illness. When Mr. Neely began aggressively threatening Daniel Penny and the other passengers, Daniel, with the help of others, acted to protect themselves, until help arrived. Daniel never intended to harm Mr. Neely and could not have foreseen his untimely death,\" the law firm said.\n\nRepresentatives for Jordan Neely's family responded Monday, calling the statement, quote, \"not an apology nor an expression of regret. It is a character assassination.\" They continued, quote, \"The truth is he knew nothing about Jordan's history when he intentionally wrapped his arms around Jordan's neck, and squeezed and kept squeezing. He never attempted to help him at all. In short, his actions on the train, and now his words, show why he needs to be in prison,\" the family of Jordan Neely said.\n\nThe killing of Jordan Neely comes as New York is facing a growing population of unhoused people who lack support they need, with many facing mental health crises. Officials say Jordan Neely had been arrested more than 40 times, including for multiple assaults, was on a list of unhoused people identified by aid workers as having dire needs. Before he fell on hard times, Jordan was well known to New Yorkers and tourists as a talented Michael Jackson impersonator who made a living in Times Square and on New York subways.\n\nFor more, we're joined by two guests. Jawanza Williams is director of organizing at VOCAL -New York, and Lorenzo Laroc, who knew Jordan Neely for 20 years when they were both buskers in the New York City subway system. This is him playing his custom-made five-string plexiglass electric violin/viola.\n\nLORENZO LAROC : [playing violin/viola]\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We welcome you both to Democracy Now! Lorenzo, I want to begin with you. That was you playing the violin. You knew Jordan for 20 years as a fellow busker. Talk about him, as many New Yorkers and tourists knew him for years, this Michael Jackson impersonator, a member of the community of artists that we so often see in the subways.\n\nLORENZO LAROC : Well, I worked with Jordan over a period of - I played down in the subways for 30 years. I worked with Jordan for about 20. And what we did was, he would do the noon-to-3:00 shift; I'd get there around 2:00 for my 3:00-to-6:00 shift. And I could - you know, I spent years watching this man, who was definitely a professional artist. He had a mastery of how he could work a crowd. If you could stop traffic in New York City with your talents, you're doing something positive. He was the most passive, beautifully a gentleman. And, you know, this is consistently. I've never seen him aggressive. I've never seen him have a problem with the public.\n\nAnd what Jordan did, he gave freely to the city of New York and brought nothing but joy to this town for decades. And, you know, a misconception of street performers, we're out there giving it away. It's free. If you want to donate, that's fine. But, you know, we're doing our civic duty out there, keeping the peace. Just we keep the peace better than cops, in the sense that in the 20 years that I've been out there and Jordan doing his thing, there was never any problem. Music calms the savage beast. Well, it also calms down New York City commuters. You know, Jordan was - God, how can I put it? Not only the consummate professional, but he was an - he was Michael Jackson. You know, people can't see Michael in Times Square. He's an iconic figure. But Jordan embodied that persona.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Lorenzo, when you saw the video, which went viral, of Daniel [Penny] choking him to death, there were also two other passengers who were holding him down. And when people tried to help, they pushed them away. Your response?\n\nLORENZO LAROC : I was witnessing a murder. That's what I said. It was painful and crushing. You know, here was a great artist being murdered in front of my eyes. And the fact that this gentleman is just walking the streets, it's a tragedy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Jawanza Williams, there have been many people arrested in the last few days demanding the arrest of Penny, the ex-marine who put him in a chokehold until he died. He hasn't been arrested; many others have. Can you respond to the video, what you understand happened, and what you're calling for now?\n\nJAWANZA WILLIAMS : Yeah. Thanks again for having me, Amy. I deeply appreciate it.\n\nAnd as Lorenzo was saying, you know, I'm thinking a lot about the humanity of Black people and what we're experiencing across these racist, violent United States. And I think that what happened is a catastrophe. And I think that we should honor the demands of the Neely family and have this person arrested. But really I want to talk about, you know, one, for Black people to avoid continue watching the kinds of videos that create psychic harm for all of us, because these things affect our bodies and our mentalities. So I've avoided watching that video, because I don't need to see another Black person lynched again in this country. And so I avoided that video, and I don't want to watch that, so I can't speak to it specifically.\n\nBut what I can say is that what has happened to Jordan Neely is very - reminds us that it's not, unfortunately, that his story is that unique. The fact is that over the - since 2022, over 815 people experiencing homelessness in New York have died in public spaces. This is a structural phenomenon. And I have to say that we have to hold also not just the murderer accountable; we have to hold Mayor Eric Adams and Governor Kathy Hochul for their continued right-wing, hyperconservative, fearmongering politics and politicking about our lives, like the fact that they flooded our subways with police to respond to people experiencing homelessness in the subway, and yet these same police officers were nowhere to be found when it was time to protect Jordan Neely from the violence of a white man, former marine, strangling him to death. So, what we need to see is not a mobilization of violence, but a mobilization of care in our subways. And our Homelessness Union at VOCAL -New York has calling for that for multiple years.\n\nAnd so, for me, I think that the state needs to do what it needs to do, what it always does, and, you know, use its carceral system to bring some kind of justice to this family. But I don't believe in the carceral system, so I have to say we want to build a loving and caring infrastructure in our city, so that means that Mayor Eric Adams, right now in the middle of his budget negotiation, needs to put our billions of dollars where they need to be, in support of housing, in wraparound services, safe haven beds. We need to see people rapidly rehoused out of shelters into secure housing, and sometimes that means housing vouchers, etc. And there are so many different things that need to happen.\n\nAnd I think that, you know, Governor Hochul just passed a state budget that didn't pass Daniel's Law, that would have automatically created mental health teams throughout the state so that they could actually respond to people who are actually in mental health crisis. And I'm not saying that Jordan Neely was, because everyone has deputized themselves to be like police in public, but they have also deputized themselves as psychologists. They are not psychologists. They are other commuters, and they do not have the right to diagnose anybody in the subway. Leave that to the professionals. And those professionals are not police officers.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to thank you both for being with us and ask you to stay with us, because we're going to do a post-show interview, and we're going to post it online at democracynow.org.

Before Jordan Neely fell on hard times, he was well known to New Yorkers and tourists as a talented Michael Jackson impersonator who made a living in Times Square and on New York subways.\n\nFor more, we're joined by two guests. Jawanza Williams is the director of organizing at VOCAL -New York, and Lorenzo Laroc, who knew Jordan nearly for decades when they were both buskers in the New York City system.\n\nWe welcome you both to Democracy Now! Thank you for staying with us. Jawanza, if you can talk about the situation for the growing unhoused population in the city, how they're dealt with, and if you can talk about the response by the city to the demands by protesters that Daniel Penny, the ex-marine who put Jordan Neely in a chokehold - and we have to add that he was held down by two other passengers, as well, and when others went to try to help, they were pushed away. Respond.\n\nJAWANZA WILLIAMS : First of all, I think what we're seeing with the police response to, you know, amendment-protected democratic rights of free assembly and public protest, we're seeing more of the same. Like, every time that anything happens in the city where progressive people, conscientious people, people with a heart, stand up and demand justice, the state responds with violence, with the mobilization of violence through the NYPD . So I'm not shocked or surprised at all by that crackdown.\n\nBut it does remind us of the contradictions that Democratic leadership, like Kathy Hochul, Governor Kathy Hochul, and Mayor Eric Adams, have been espousing for the last couple of years in the city of New York, especially as it relates to people experiencing homelessness and people who have mental health complexities. So, I would say, number one, people need to understand that the homelessness and housing crisis in the city of New York is affecting scores and scores of people, including children. In the last seven years in a row in the city of New York, according to the Department of Education, 100,000 students go to school from a shelter at some point throughout the year. Yet you will never actually hear that being the focus of conversation when it comes to the state budget, which was just negotiated and was over a month late. And the measures that were most important to people like Jordan Neely in New York City and other people experiencing homelessness, like Daniel's Law, like the housing access voucher program, like the retention of, you know, cashless bail, all of these things are missing. You know, the governor was able to roll back bail by using the same kind of narrative and framework that the GOP has been using across the country, this fearmongering, this, you know, \"no one's safe\" sort of narrative, especially about people experiencing homelessness in the subways in New York City. And they've been able to win, you know, these kinds of arguments.\n\nAnd I think that the fact is, we need to refocus about what are the structural phenomena that's taking place that leads a person to be experiencing homelessness, chronic homelessness. And also, the criminalization of homelessness, this is about that, as well. It's about the, you know, delegitimate mobilization of police, because the police did not generate and maintain safety in the subways, not for Jordan Neely, who was strangled to death. So, I think that what we need to see happen is the city to respond in its budget negotiations in such a way that responds to - you know, in an antiracist way, in a class-conscious way, in a gender-expansive way. So what that really looks like and what it really means is the kinds of policy platforms that progressive organizations and progressive communities have been calling for, like the People's Plan New York, like the Housing Justice for All Campaign, like VOCAL -New York's Homelessness Union. We've been trying to offer to the city of New York and to the City Council, you know, the kinds of roadmaps that we need. That means safe haven beds, rapid rehousing. We need people to make sure that they're able to, you know, avoid source-of-income discrimination, which plagues the city. And the Commission on Human Rights and its Source of Income Discrimination Unit needs to be fully funded and fully staffed. It needs not two, three, four attorneys; it needs 10, 20, 30 attorneys to be able to prosecute landlords that are engaging in discriminatory practices that continues to keep people homeless and expand the number of people experiencing homelessness.\n\nAnd finally, I'll say, Amy, the Rent Guidelines Board voting - or, planning to vote to expand on the cost of rent in New York City is entirely out of step with the reality that I'm naming, where tens of thousands of people are at risk of homelessness imminently, and 100,000-plus people across the state of New York and 100,000 people really in the city of New York are experiencing homelessness, and they need secure and stable housing. And at the core, that means affordable rent.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to ask Lorenzo Laroc about the effect of the pandemic on performers, on artists, and if you can talk about whether you think this impacted Jordan himself, and the fact that he was clearly suffering from a mental health crisis. I mean, the independent journalist who took out his cellphone and was filming what happened said that he didn't pose a violent threat to anyone, and he was right there in the car, who filmed him.\n\nLORENZO LAROC : Well, like I said earlier, I've known Jordan for 20 years, and we worked together down in the subway system. And never once in those 20 years have I seen him aggressive, have a problem with anyone. He was a consummate professional artist.\n\nThe pandemic was devastating to the artistic community, especially with people who made a living daily in the trench. Jordan made an honest living, giving love and his art to this city. And, you know, unfortunately, artists fell by the wayside during the pandemic. I mean, we were just - you know, I do weddings and bar mitzvahs also for a living. That stopped completely. The subways were shut down. I mean, you know, if you're living - if you're dancing or playing violin for your dinner, you know, and then the world just shuts down - it was the first time in my 40-year career I had been unemployed for two years straight. And I have two teenage daughters. You know, Jordan was in a crisis, like many - I know many musicians and artists here in the city. After the pandemic, they left New York. They just couldn't survive here, couldn't afford it. And a lot of people were homeless. I mean, I had to move. You know, it was just - it was devastating.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to read a quote from Jordan's family. He had been going through so much. Donte Mills, an attorney for Jordan's family, said Neely had demons as a result of - well, his mother was murdered back in, what, 2008, 2007, 2009. His family was trying to get him help. He said, \"We all know people who are on the brink of going through something major, a catastrophe where they just can't seem to get everything back together, and that's where he was. But he had a life that he was living and was reaching for.\"\n\nJawanza, you mentioned in Part 1 of our conversation, Daniel's Law, that didn't get passed, and your group, VOCAL -New York, was pushing for that, the law named for Daniel Prude, the Black man killed by Rochester police in March of 2020 when he was having a mental health crisis. I believe his brother called for help. Daniel Prude died from asphyxiation after the Rochester police officers handcuffed him while he was naked, put a hood over his head, pushed his face into the freezing cold ground for two minutes while kneeling on his back. And last year a grand jury decided not to file charges against the officers involved in his death. Can you talk about what happened to this legislation?\n\nJAWANZA WILLIAMS : So, the thing is, the governor has been playing this conservative tune ever since she was, you know, appointed governor and then elected governor. And basically, every time the right-wing conservative media and neoliberal media talks about anything to do with bail reform or anything to do with, you know, reducing the carceral state, there's this fearmongering that's kicked up. So, this bill was, essentially, I believe, dead on arrival.\n\nI can't speak to the details of the campaign. You'd have to talk to folks like Keli Young, who's our civil rights campaigns coordinator, who really understands the intricate, you know, facts that happened in that fight in Rochester. But what I can say is that we cannot win progressive public policy if we're up against frameworks of reality that are rooted in a disreality, in anti-Black racism, in classism. We can't really begin to have a conversation about mental health complexities, if everybody wants to deputize themselves a psychologist or as someone who's able to render those kinds of services, and, therefore, write that kind of public policy. But the fact is, most people are not. And there are organizations, there are people, there are healthcare professionals, who know how to handle people with mental healthcare complexities. And the fact is, these are evidence-based responses and practices. And they don't exist because the political will is not there. And we don't have the political or economic resources to be able to build that infrastructure. And every time we try to do that, like through Daniel's Law, we have to fight against politics of austerity, politics of racism and fear.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And, Lorenzo Laroc, you're born and bred in Harlem. You're a street performer and subway performer for decades. On Friday, you spoke at a protest calling for the Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg to prosecute Daniel Penny for killing Jordan Neely. Talk about what you think has to happen more.\n\nLORENZO LAROC : Well, you know, as an artist and as a New Yorker, you know, Jordan, to me, was what - was the best parts of this city. You know, he gave freely to this, to my city, you know, his talents and his joy. What I witnessed was basically - I felt like all artists were being murdered right there, because he - especially what was ironic is, those trains were where he made a living. It's like getting killed at your jobsite.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : \"Like getting killed at your jobsite.\" Lorenzo Laroc, I want to thank you so much for being with us. You knew Jordan Neely for 20 years, when they were both buskers, street performers, in the New York City subway system. Lorenzo, classically trained electric violinist and composer who plays a custom-made five-string plexiglass electric violin and viola, born, raised, educated and lives in Harlem. Jawanza Williams, director of organizing at VOCAL -New York. And as the protests continue, we continue to cover this story. To see Part 1 of our discussion, go to democracynow.org. I'm Amy Goodman.

Rev. Al Sharpton delivered the eulogy.\n\nRev. Al Sharpton : \"Jordan's mother was killed, and her funeral was right here. And Jordan sat right there and watched his mother funeralized, who had been chopped up, and he'd never been the same. Jordan was not annoying someone on the train; Jordan was screaming for help.\"\n\nNeely's friends and family were joined by a number of prominent New York leaders, including Congressmember Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Mayor Eric Adams was not in attendance. Adams has been called out for demonizing unhoused and mentally ill New Yorkers, and for his tepid response to Neely's unprovoked chokehold killing by a fellow subway rider, a white ex-marine who has since been charged with manslaughter. Outside the funeral, protesters continued to demand justice for Jordan Neely.\n\nProtester : \"Are we going to let him die in vain?\"\n\nProtesters : \"No!\"\n\nProtester : \"All right. We are going to stand together, and we're going to let Eric Adams know that this is unacceptable and a chokehold is not going to happen anymore.\""

      "text": "Judge Sets Trial For Marine Who Fatally Choked Jordan Neely On NYC Subway\n\nReporter\n\nA judge announced Wednesday that the former Marine who put a Black homeless man in a fatal chokehold on a New York City subway last year will be put to trial in October.\n\nOn May 1, Daniel Penny, 24, held Jordan Neely, 30, in a chokehold on the floor of a subway until his body went limp. Two others also helped restrain Neely, who was pronounced dead on scene.\n\nThe encounter was captured in a three-minute video by witness and journalist Juan Alberto Vazquez, who said that Neely had been yelling about not having food or water just prior to Penny placing him in a chokehold for close to 15 minutes.\n\n\"The man got on the subway car and began to say a somewhat aggressive speech, saying he was hungry, he was thirsty, that he didn't care about anything, he didn't care about going to jail, he didn't care that he gets a big life sentence,\" Vazquez told NBC New York . \"That 'It doesn't even matter if I died.'\"\n\nNeely was well known by locals for his Michael Jackson impersonation and dancing, which he would perform on subways, The New York Times reported . The incident sparked outrage from the public, with many linking his death to a reflection of larger issues involving race, homelessness, crime and mental illness.\n\nThe New York Office of Chief Medical Examiner ruled that Neely's death was a homicide caused by \"compression of neck (chokehold).\"\n\nProtests erupted in a subway station and on the streets of New York shortly after Neely's killing, with people demanding justice and accountability .\n\nIn a statement last year, Penny's lawyers claimed that Neely had been \"aggressively threatening\" Penny and others on the subway, and that Penny acted in self-defense. Vazquez said that Neely was being \"aggressive,\" but not specifically threatening and did not appear to want to attack anyone.\n\n\"When Mr. Neely began aggressively threatening Daniel Penny and the other passengers, Daniel, with the help of others, acted to protect themselves, until help arrived. Daniel never intended to harm Mr. Neely and could not have foreseen his untimely death,\" the attorneys said.\n\nPenny was later charged with manslaughter in the second degree, and pleaded not guilty. His trial will begin on Oct. 8 and will go on for four to six weeks, Judge Max Wiley said, according to ABC News .\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "How The Media Made A Villain Out Of Jordan Neely\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost National Desk\n\nAfter Daniel Penny killed Jordan Neely with a chokehold on May 1, several local media outlets reported that Neely had thrown trash at subway passengers, aggressively threatened them and got into an argument with Penny before Penny tackled him to the ground.\n\nBut within a few days, as reporting relied less on anonymous law enforcement sources, journalists began poking holes in each of these details, and outright contradicted some of them.\n\nBy that time, though, the two men involved in the incident had been painted with broad brushes. Penny, a 24-year-old white man, was written not as someone who'd used a deadly martial arts position for several minutes straight, but rather as a Marine veteran looking for work as a bartender in New York. Neely, on the other hand, was a Black, homeless, mentally ill former Michael Jackson impersonator ― an \"unhinged\" \"vagrant,\" as the New York Post described him ― whose killing recalled an era \"when residents felt besieged by crime,\" as The Associated Press put it .\n\nEven after the city's medical examiner found that Neely, 30, died of a fatal chokehold, some outlets used passive, soft language and invited debate. A since-deleted tweet from the AP read: \"The choking death of a man with apparent mental illness in the New York subway set off powerful reactions, with some calling the chokehold a homicide and others defending the passenger's action as a defense against disorder.\"\n\nFor several days, media reports withheld Penny's name while printing Neely's police record.\n\nThat record included dozens of arrests, some for assault and many for lesser charges like fare evasion. And police sources appeared to immediately leak Neely's rap sheet to news outlets after his death, despite Neely having just been killed in public. The practice of leaking criminal records to reporters after a public incident is a habit for the NYPD, deployed after the arrests of countless defendants ― but not usually for homicide victims. A spokesperson for the department didn't respond to HuffPost's requests for comment.\n\nAs Penny surrendered to authorities Friday on a manslaughter charge, pleading not guilty, the city's media apparatus faced an urgent question: How had the victim of a killing so quickly been made into the villain?\n\nNeely's final minutes began with a scene many New Yorkers have encountered: a man in mental distress, hungry and tired, shouting for help on the subway.\n\nAccording to Juan Alberto Vázquez, a freelance journalist who took the only published video of Penny putting Neely in a chokehold, Neely was \"aggressive\" but not specifically threatening or getting physical with anyone on the train.\n\nVázquez, who did not respond to HuffPost's requests for comment, posted a video of Neely's final moments on his Facebook page, along with a quote purportedly from Neely written in Spanish : \"I don't have food, I don't have anything to drink, I'm fed up....I don't care if I go to jail and they give me life in prison.\" Neely didn't seem to want to attack anyone, Vázquez wrote.\n\n\"He started screaming all these things, took off his jacket, a black jacket that he had, and threw it on the ground,\" Vázquez told the New York Post for a story published May 2, the day after Neely's death. He also told The New York Times that day that Neely had said, \"I'm ready to die.\"\n\nThree days later, Vázquez told a nearly identical story to New York magazine: \"He started yelling that he didn't have food, that he didn't have water. From what I understood, he was yelling that he was tired, that he didn't care about going to jail.\" Then Vázquez went further, emphasizing the relative lack of risk Neely posed at the moment Penny attacked him: \"You ask how many people out of 100 would have dared to do something like that, and I think that 98 will say: 'No, I would wait to see one more sign that indicates aggression.'\"\n\nBut Neely's purported words grew more aggressive with the use of anonymous police sources. The New York Post , the Daily News , ABC7 and Fox News , all citing law enforcement, said Neely had threatened subway riders.\n\nOn television, NBC New York's Checkey Beckford cited anonymous law enforcement sources who claimed, \"according to a witness,\" that Neely shouted \"I'm not taking no for an answer\" and \"I'll hurt anyone on this train\" ― quotes that have not been widely matched by other outlets. (Fox News' Jesse Watters used the same quotes during his May 4 broadcast , without citing his source, and The New Yorker, also unsourced, included the quote \"I'm not taking no for an answer!\" in a May 10 story .) Two early articles on NBC New York's digital platform, published on May 3 and May 4 , paraphrased the dialogue: \"Police sources told NBC New York that Neely told riders on the train that he wanted food, that he wasn't taking no for an answer, and that he would hurt anyone on the train.\" Two subsequent articles added a crucial word, reporting on what Neely \"purportedly\" told riders, according to police sources.\n\nA spokesperson for WNBC told HuffPost, \"We stand by our story and our reporting.\"\n\nOver the past few years, and especially since the peak of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020, the media has grown more circumspect about basing stories on law enforcement sources alone. But change has been slow.\n\n\"Journalism supposedly is based on skepticism,\" said Linn Washington Jr., a journalism professor at Temple University with decades of experience reporting on police. \"You take everything with a grain of salt, and you do your balanced reporting in as accurate and as fair a way as is possible to both sides. Has this been a sea change? No. But there has been some changes. And the changes are substantial. But then, you get these circumstances where the initial reportage can overshadow some of the underlying facts.\"\n\nEven as some outlets cited anonymous law enforcement officers to report Neely supposedly threatening straphangers, others reported nearly the opposite.\n\nOn May 4, an unidentified witness, speaking to CBS News , said that while Neely had been panhandling and shouting, \"It did not appear that this man, who seemed to be suffering from some kind of mental disturbance, was seeking to assault anyone.\"\n\nOne witness told Hell Gate , a worker-owned New York City outlet, that he hadn't seen the beginning of the incident, but he described what he heard secondhand as a demand for help from Neely, not necessarily a threat. \"[Bystanders] said [Neely] had gotten on the train and was belligerent about getting his food,\" James Kings told the outlet. \"He was using the wrong method, he was using aggressive panhandling, he was screaming and hollering about how he needed food.\" (Hell Gate also published the account of an anonymous witness who said they'd heard secondhand from other riders that Neely had been threatening people.)\n\nPenny's attorneys have said he merely protected himself and others after Neely \"began aggressively threatening Daniel Penny and the other passengers.\" But few of Penny's fellow passengers have come forward saying the same.\n\nOn Friday ― more than 10 days after the incident - the Post published the account of an unidentified 66-year-old who claimed Neely had said, \"I would kill a motherf***er. I don't care. I'll take a bullet. I'll go to jail.\" The woman said Penny had asked her and another rider to give their accounts to authorities. Penny, the source said, \"did not engage with the gentleman. He said not a word. It was all Mr. Neely that was... threatening the passengers.\"\n\nNow, the case is in prosecutors' hands. The Manhattan district attorney's office is fielding criticism from all sides ― on the right, for bringing a case at all against a supposed \" Good Samaritan \" acting in self-defense, and from Neely's family , for not pursuing a murder charge.\n\nAssistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass said Friday in court that \"several witnesses observed Mr. Neely making threats and scaring passengers\" before Penny put him in a fatal chokehold. The DA's office didn't answer HuffPost's questions about those witness accounts.\n\nSpeaking in court on Friday, Steinglass focused on Penny's actions once his minutes-long chokehold began.\n\n\"At some point Mr. Neely stopped moving,\" Steinglass said. \"The defendant continued to hold Mr. Neely for a period and then released him.\"\n\nAccounts of an alleged argument before Penny took Neely's life are similarly shaky.\n\nNo witnesses have described any interaction between the two men before Penny choked Neely, and there's no video footage of the moments leading up to the chokehold.\n\nVázquez told New York magazine that Penny \"came up behind [Neely] and grabbed him by the neck.\" CNN similarly reported that, according to Vázquez, \"Neely did not interact with the passenger at all before the attack.\" Vázquez told The New York Times that he didn't directly see Penny grab Neely, but that he heard a thump and saw both men on the floor. Lawyers for Neely's family similarly claimed to the Times that they'd been told by witnesses that Penny grabbed Neely from behind. The Post, citing both Vázquez and police, reported that Neely \"approached the homeless man from behind and took him to the ground with a chokehold.\"\n\nMultiple reports citing both witnesses and police ― from The Associated Press and The New York Times to CNN and NBC New York ― have said there's no evidence that Neely got physical with anyone before Penny began his chokehold.\n\nStill, some outlets described the incident in a way that implied a two-sided struggle.\n\nIn a May 2 story , the Daily News wrote: \"A disturbed man threatening strangers on a Manhattan subway train died after getting into a brawl with the wrong passenger - a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who put him in a chokehold, cops said Tuesday.\" According to that report, Neely threw garbage at commuters, prompting an \"argument\" with Penny ― a \"quarrel\" that \"turned into a brawl as the train entered the station.\"\n\nHere, too, police sources may have shaped the narrative. In a May 3 story , NBC News quoted a phone call with a police spokesperson who said officers came to the subway station to respond to a call about a physical fight.\n\n\"Further investigation revealed the 30-year-old was involved in a verbal dispute with the 24-year-old male and it escalated into a physical altercation,\" the spokesperson said, according to the story. \"During the physical struggle between the two males, the 30-year-old male lost consciousness.\"\n\nFox News ' Watters went even further on May 4, saying, without explaining the source of his information, that Penny confronted Neely \"gently at first\" and that Penny \"tried to deescalate\" ― two claims that haven't appeared in any other outlet.\n\n\"FOX News Channel stands by our coverage and does not disclose sources,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nThe criminal complaint against Penny cites an unnamed person who \"observed the defendant come up from behind an individual, later identified as Jordan Neely, pull him down to the ground, and further observed the defendant hold his arm around Mr. Neely's neck for several minutes.\"\n\nThe claims about Neely throwing garbage at passengers ― rather than simply throwing his jacket on the ground ― have similarly not been established, outside of reports within a couple days of Neely's death from the Daily News, the Post , and CBS New York , the last of which cited unnamed witnesses.\n\nAnd one detail seems to have disappeared from the story: Screenshots indicate that an ABC7 article originally included the text, \"Importantly, detectives so far have no information suggesting that the veteran who administered the hold had been warned by onlookers that Neely was dying or suffering serious physical damage while being restrained.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Prosecutor Says Veteran's Subway Chokehold 'Went Too Far,' Defense Praises His 'Courage.'\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Prosecutors and defense lawyers agree on this about Marine veteran Daniel Penny's encounter last year with a distressed, angry man making ominous remarks on a New York subway: Penny didn't mean to kill him.\n\nBut a prosecutor told jurors Friday that Penny \"went way too far\" in trying to neutralize someone he saw as a threat and not as a person, while a defense attorney said Penny showed \"courage\" and put others' welfare ahead of his own when he placed Jordan Neely in a chokehold that ended with Neely limp on the floor.\n\nBoth sides gave opening statements Friday in the manslaughter trial surrounding Neely's death. The case has rattled fault lines surrounding race, homelessness, perceptions of public safety and bystanders' responsibility.\n\nPenny's critics see him as a white vigilante killer of a Black man who was behaving erratically and making dire statements but wasn't armed and hadn't assaulted or even touched anyone in the subway car. Supporters credit the 25-year-old Penny with taking action to protect frightened riders - action that he has said was meant to defuse, not kill.\n\nProsecutor Dafna Yoran told jurors the case isn't \"a referendum on our society's failure to deal with mental illness and homelessness on the subway,\" nor on police response, on whether Penny had a right to intervene before officers arrived or even on whether his initial decision to use a chokehold was appropriate.\n\nRather, she said, \"He used far too much force for far too long. He went way too far.\"\n\nShe said he showed \"indifference\" toward Neely and \"didn't recognize his humanity.\"\n\nNot so, said defense lawyer Thomas Kenniff. He told jurors that Penny applied only as much force as needed to contain a \"seething, psychotic\" man who had lunged toward a woman with a small child and declared, \"I will kill.\"\n\n\"In that moment, Danny could look away and pray, or he could summon the courage to put the safety of his neighbors above that of himself, to protect those who could not protect themselves,\" and he did the latter, Kenniff said.\n\n\"It doesn't make him a hero. But it doesn't make him a killer.\"\n\nJurors, who were quizzed earlier about their subway experiences , later saw police body camera video of officers trying to revive Neely on the subway floor and Penny calmly explaining he had \"put him out.\"\n\nThe case has been absorbed into the United States' fractious politics, with Republican officials speaking up for Penny and Democratic ones attending Neely's funeral . Both supporters and critics of Penny have held demonstrations; Penny arrived at the courthouse Friday to critical chants from a small group of protesters.\n\nOnce in court, Penny sat straight up in his seat at the defense table, mostly looking directly ahead. A member of Neely's family who was in the audience sometimes sniffled with tears.\n\n\"We know who the victim is in this case, and we know who the villain is,\" family lawyer Donte Mills said outside court.\n\nNeely's life was tattered by mental illness and drug use after his mother was murdered and stuffed in a suitcase when he was a teen, his family has said. By 30, he sometimes entertained subway riders as a Michael Jackson impersonator, but he also had a criminal record that included assaulting a woman at a subway station.\n\nPenny, an architecture student who served four years in the Marines, was going from a college class to a gym when he encountered Neely on a subway May 1, 2023.\n\nNeely was begging for money, shouting about being willing to die or go to jail, and making sudden movements, according to witnesses. Yoran said Neely talked about hurting people.\n\nPenny put his arm around the man's neck, took him to the floor and held Neely there, with Penny's legs around him.\n\nWith a bystander recording some of the encounter on video, Penny held Neely for about six minutes, Yoran said. The hold continued as the train stopped at a station, all but two fellow riders got off, those two helped restrain Neely, and another warned Penny, \"If you don't let him go now, you're going to kill him,\" according to her statement and court papers.\n\nKenniff said Penny was pleading with fellow passengers to call police and that he kept holding Neely because the man periodically flailed or tried to get up.\n\nPenny ultimately released Neely nearly a minute after his body went limp, prosecutors said. He waited for police, but Yoran noted that although Penny was trained in first aid, he didn't check Neely's breathing or pulse or try to revive him.\n\nPenny later told police that he had simply wanted to \"de-escalate\" the edgy situation and wasn't trying to injure Neely but rather \"to keep him from hurting anyone else.\"\n\nCity medical examiners determined that Neely died from compression of the neck. Penny's lawyers question that finding.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Joseph Frederick and David R.

      "text": "Jordan Neely's Killer Surrenders On Manslaughter Charge, Freed Pending Trial\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - A U.S. Marine veteran who used a fatal chokehold on an agitated New York City subway passenger was freed from custody Friday hours after surrendering to face a manslaughter charge filed nearly two weeks after the encounter.\n\nDaniel Penny, 24, appeared in court after turning himself in at a police station to answer criminal charges in the May 1 death of Jordan Neely. He did not enter a plea. Neely's death sparked protests, while others embraced Penny as a vigilante hero.\n\nA judge authorized Penny's release on bond and ordered him to surrender his passport and not to leave New York without approval. Prosecutors said they are seeking a grand jury indictment. Penny is due back in court on July 17.\n\nPenny didn't speak to reporters as he arrived at a Manhattan police station with his lawyers Friday morning, nor did he respond to questions shouted by reporters as he was led from the police precinct house in handcuffs several hours later.\n\nInside the courtroom, Penny faced straight ahead, his hands still cuffed. He spoke softly, offering one-word answers to Judge Kevin McGrath as his lawyer, Steve Raiser, placed an arm around his shoulder.\n\nPenny's lawyers have said he was acting in self-defense when he pinned Neely to the floor of the subway car with the help of two other passengers and held him in a chokehold for several minutes.\n\nA freelance journalist who recorded Neely struggling to free himself, then lapsing into unconsciousness, said he had been shouting at passengers and begging for money aboard the train but had not gotten physical with anyone. Penny's lawyers have said he was \"threatening\" passengers but haven't elaborated.\n\nNeely's death has raised an uproar over many issues, including how those with mental illness are treated by the transit system and the city, as well as crime, race and vigilantism. Penny, who is white, was questioned by police in the aftermath but was released without charges. Neely was Black.\n\nThomas Kenniff, one of Penny's attorneys, said the veteran didn't mean to harm Neely and \"is dealing with the situation, like I said, with the sort of integrity and honor that is characteristic of who he is and characteristic of his honorable service in the United States Marine Corps.\"\n\nDonte Mills, a lawyer for Neely's family, said Neely wasn't harming anyone.\n\n\"There was no attack,\" Mills said at a news conference Friday. \"Mr. Neely did not attack anyone. He did not touch anyone. He did not hit anyone. But he was choked to death.\" Penny, he said, \"acted with indifference. He didn't care about Jordan, he cared about himself. And we can't let that stand.\"\n\nNeely's father, Andre, wept as another family lawyer, Lennon Edwards, recounted the last moments before Penny tackled Neely to the ground and put him in a chokehold.\n\n\"What did he think would happen?\" Mills asked.\n\nFriends of Neely said the former subway performer, remembered by some commuters for his Michael Jackson impersonations, had been dealing with homelessness and mental illness in recent years. Neely had been arrested multiple times and had recently pleaded guilty for assaulting a 67-year-old woman leaving a subway station in 2021.\n\nMills said Neely's outlook changed after his mother was killed by her boyfriend in 2007. Through his struggles, Mills said, Neely found joy in singing, dancing and bringing a smile to other people's faces.\n\n\"No one on that train asked Jordan: 'What's wrong, how can I help you?'\" Mills said, urging New Yorkers in a similar situation: \"Don't attack. Don't choke. Don't kill. Don't take someone's life. Don't take someone's loved one from them because they're in a bad place.\"\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney's office had investigated the case for several days before deciding to file charges, in part to try to learn what happened aboard the train in the moments before Penny moved to restrain Neely. Prosecutors did not immediately explain why they decided criminal charges were warranted.\n\nNeely's death prompted protests in the city. On Wednesday, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who had earlier said the investigation needed time to play out, gave an address in which he said Neely's death shouldn't have happened.\n\nA second-degree manslaughter charge in New York will require the jury to find that a person has engaged in reckless conduct that creates an unjustifiable risk of death, and then consciously disregards that risk.\n\nThe law also requires that conduct to be a gross deviation from how a reasonable person would act in a similar situation.\n\nThe charges could carry a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment, though any jail term could also be far shorter.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Bobby Caina Calvan and Karen Matthews contributed to this report.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Jordan Neely's Family, Attorneys Say Daniel Penny Should Face Murder Charges\n\nReporter\n\nJordan Neely's family and their attorneys recently suggested that Daniel Penny, the 24-year-old Marine veteran who put Neely in a fatal chokehold, should face more severe charges.\n\nNeely, a 30-year-old Black homeless man, was riding the F train in New York on May 1 when Penny, with the help of other subway riders, placed him in a chokehold. Witnesses said Neely had been \"yelling\" about not having food and water prior to Penny's intervention.\n\nOn Thursday, Penny was charged with second-degree manslaughter nearly two weeks after Neely's death, which had been ruled a homicide by a medical examiner. If found guilty of manslaughter, Penny could face a five to 25-year prison sentence.\n\nBut the Neely family attorneys believe the current charges are insufficient.\n\n\"Is that enough for someone who choked somebody out on a train and took their life?\" Lennon Edwards, one of the Neely family attorneys, said at the news conference on Friday.\n\n\"Justice looks like a conviction for murder,\" Edwards stated.\n\n\"We need a full cup of justice here, and we're asking for us to continue to press forward until that happens,\" Edwards added.\n\nFollowing the incident, Penny was questioned by the police but was then released, prompting days of protests demanding accountability and justice.\n\nEdwards said he and Neely's family spoke with the district attorney prior to Penny's arraignment, who told them there was \"no timeline for an arrest\" because the evidence was still being gathered. However, an arraignment could occur \"maybe in June,\" according to Edwards.\n\n\"We told them that there is enough evidence already for an arrest. There is enough information already for the process of justice to begin,\" Edwards said during the news conference.\n\nWitnesses told the police that before Penny's involvement, Neely behaved erratically and screamed about hunger and tiredness.\n\n\"The man got on the subway car and began to say a somewhat aggressive speech, saying he was hungry, he was thirsty, that he didn't care about anything, he didn't care about going to jail, he didn't care that he gets a big life sentence,\" Juan Alberto Vazquez, who captured the incident on video, told NBC New York . \"That 'It doesn't even matter if I died.'\"\n\nOn May 6, Penny and his attorneys released a statement claiming Neely had a \"documented history of violent and erratic behavior\" and Penny, along with other passengers, had \"acted to protect themselves\" after Neely began \"aggressively threatening\" them.\n\n\"Daniel never intended to harm Mr. Neely and could not have foreseen his untimely death,\" the attorneys said in the statement.\n\nBut witnesses told prosecutors that Neely did not attack anyone, CBS News reports .\n\n\"No one on that train asked Jordan, 'What's wrong? How can I help you?' He was choked to death instead,\" Donte Mills, another Neely family attorney, said at the news conference.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Daniel Penny Disputes Key Claims In Jordan Neely's Killing On NYC Subway Train\n\nReporter\n\nMarine veteran Daniel Penny on Sunday argued against key claims made against him in the killing last month of Jordan Neely on a subway in New York City, disputing a witness's claim that he held Neely down for 15 minutes and denying that he put a chokehold on him.\n\nPenny, 24, has made several public remarks about his fatal interaction with 30-year-old Neely, a street performer who had mental health issues - including in an interview with the New York Post and a public statement on video that was released through his attorneys on Sunday - apparently attempting to paint himself as a \"good Samaritan\" seeking to protect people on the train against a confrontational man, including Neely himself.\n\nPenny was captured on a bystander video putting Neely in a chokehold on a New York City subway train on May 1. Journalist Juan Alberto Vazquez, who recorded part of the encounter, estimated that Penny held Neely in a chokehold for 15 minutes.\n\nIn an interview with the court reporting news site Law & Crime, Penny denied that claim and instead offered his own estimation that he restrained Neely for \"less than five minutes.\"\n\nPenny also denied that he had Neely in a chokehold, despite video of Neely's death. Two days after the fatal encounter, the New York City medical examiner's office announced that Neely had died from \"compression to his neck as a result of the chokehold\" and ruled his death a homicide.\n\nNeely's killing led to protests calling for Penny's arrest and heightened discourse about race, homelessness and mental health. Penny was charged with manslaughter in the second degree 10 days after Neely's death, following days of protest and outcry.\n\nIn his Sunday remarks, Penny argued that Neely appeared to be on drugs, that Neely was threatening others on the train and that he held Neely in a chokehold for roughly only five minutes. Penny also insisted that he didn't mean to choke Neely to death but instead meant to restrain him until police arrived.\n\n\"I acted in a way that protect the other passengers, protect myself and protect Mr. Neely,\" Penny said.\n\n\"I was trying to keep him on the ground until the police came. I was praying that the police would come and take this situation over,\" Penny said.\n\nNeely, a Black man, was known for his Michael Jackson impersonation. Penny, who is white and who continually labeled Neely a threat, has been accused of acting with anti-Black bias.\n\n\"I didn't see a Black man threatening passengers. I saw a man threatening passengers. A lot of whom were people of color,\" Penny said Sunday, echoing statements he made in May .\n\nStill, Penny's characterization of Neely echoes comments that anonymous police sources have made to news organizations in the days after the killing, which attempt to demonize Neely while hailing Penny as a hero.\n\nAs HuffPost's Matt Schuman pointed out , journalists later uncovered details of the killing that appear to contradict claims from unnamed sources that Neely was threatening.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Neely's death sparked several protests as well as conversations on race , mental health and the treatment of people who are homeless .\n\n\"This had nothing to do with race,\" said Penny, who was released on bail.\n\nHe also told the Post: \"I judge a person based on their character. I'm not a white supremacist.\"\n\nPenny added that his travels over the years exposed him to other perspectives and declared that he loves \"all cultures.\"\n\nHe went on to say that he's \"deeply saddened by the loss of life.\"\n\n\"It's tragic what happened to him. Hopefully, we can change the system that's so desperately failed us,\" Penny said.\n\nPenny's comments come weeks after Neely's May 1 death.

      "text": "Social Media Has Polarized Reaction To Daniel Penny Verdict\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nA Manhattan jury's decision to acquit Daniel Penny of criminally negligent homicide in the 2023 death of Jordan Neely on Monday caused quite a reaction on social media.\n\nThat's not surprising, considering the case became, as The Associated Press put it, \"a flashpoint in the nation's debate over racial injustice and crime.\"\n\nPenny, who is white, physically restrained Neely , a Black man, on a subway train in May 2023, leading to Neely's death. Medical examiners ruled the death a homicide .\n\nFlorida governor Ron DeSantis (R) took to X, formerly Twitter, to declare the acquittal \"clearly the just and correct verdict,\" while adding that he \"was skeptical that a jury in New York City would reach a unanimous not guilty verdict.\"\n\nThe acquittal of Daniel Penny is clearly the just and correct verdict. I must admit I was skeptical that a jury in New York City would reach a unanimous not guilty verdict, and the jury deserves credit for doing the right thing. Meanwhile, is there a worse prosecutor in America... https://t.co/fVJJQTQQqV\n\nHowever, others, such as broadcaster Medhi Hasan, pointed out how the race of the two men might play a factor how people are reacting.\n\nImagine, just imagine, if Jordan Neely had been white and Daniel Penny was black Imagine what some of the folks defending Penny today would be saying. Just imagine.\n\nOthers on X were also supportive of the verdict, while there appeared to be more skepticism on BlueSky and Threads.\n\nJustice was done finally. Danny Penny not guilty on all counts.\n\nDaniel Penny needs to leave NYC and never return. Come down here to Tennessee.

But defenses of the recent killing of Jordan Neely suggest that the film's reactionary, Wild West-style vigilante violence still holds the imagination of many.\n\nPaul Kersey (Charles Bronson) pointing a gun in the 1974 film Death Wish . (High-Def Digest / YouTube)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe New York City subway killing of Jordan Neely by ex-Marine Daniel Penny has stirred up heated commentary across the political spectrum. One common denominator in the discourse has been a frequent tendency to reach for a comparison to the notorious 1974 film Death Wish , a neo-noir film starring Charles Bronson as an affluent New York City dweller whose family is attacked in a violent home invasion. In the aftermath, he becomes a vengeful vigilante prowling the streets at night hoping to attract muggers - so he can shoot them. The subway scene in which he shoots two would-be robbers who approach him threateningly, and is acclaimed by the public for it, achieved added notoriety when the scenario was eerily carried out in real life.\n\nIn 1984, Bernhard Goetz shot four black teenagers on the subway whom he claimed tried to rob him. Goetz was dubbed \"the Subway Vigilante\" by the New York press and ultimately tried on multiple charges, including attempted murder. But he was convicted of only the most minor charge of carrying an unlicensed firearm.\n\nThe shooting and trial ignited a volatile public debate between those claiming Goetz as an urban hero fighting the forces of darkness in an increasingly crime-ridden New York, and those appalled by how self-appointed vigilantes, especially when they're white and attempting to execute people of color, are applauded by the public and let off lightly by the criminal justice system. It's nauseating reading the accounts of the Goetz case, because there are such marked similarities to the Daniel Penny case - especially in the public commentary afterward.\n\nThe New York Post op-ed by Rich Lowry, titled \"Daniel Penny is NOT a Vigilante, But the Left Can't Stop Pretending,\" typifies much of such commentary. He begins with Death Wish :\n\nPretty much everything you need to know about the Daniel Penny case you can learn from the \"Death Wish\" movies.\n\nOr so you might conclude if you took seriously the left's analysis of the tragic incident in a New York City subway car this month that has led to Penny, a former Marine , getting charged with second-degree manslaughter .\n\nThe upshot of this commentary is that conservatives favor \"vigilantism\" and support it, of course, because it's a bulwark of white supremacy.\n\n\"The Republican Embrace of Vigilantism Is No Accident,\" according to New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie .\n\nLowry goes on to cite a series of op-eds and think pieces making supposedly left-wing accusations of right-wing tendencies to support vigilantism. He then argues that Penny can't be a vigilante, relying on a dictionary definition of the word, as if he were a desperate undergraduate the night before a paper is due: \"Merriam-Webster defines a vigilante as 'a member of a volunteer committee organized to suppress and punish crime summarily (as when the processes of law are viewed as inadequate).'\"\n\nLowry promptly invalidates the point by conceding that there can be \"loner vigilantes\" too. But in his view, the term still applies only in a Death Wish scenario, when someone like the Charles Bronson character is deliberately stalking local malefactors, trying to get himself almost-mugged so he can shoot someone. Lowry then makes his main claim:\n\nBy contrast, conservatives are, as a general matter, viewing Penny as a defender of himself and, most importantly, those around him - not an avenging angel administering the justice that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg refuses to.\n\nIndications are that Penny (and his fellow passengers) sincerely believed Jordan Neely, suffering from untreated mental illness, was a threat to people on the train.\n\nThere's still much we need to know about the particulars of the case, but the impulse to protect others is deeply admirable and rare.\n\nAnyone who's watched Westerns or action films could tell Lowry about vigilantism, which involves a self-appointed guardian or guardians of the public welfare acting like judge, jury, and executioner in meting out sloppy individual notions of justice - generally very rough, often fatal types of \"frontier justice\" - without due process under the law as defined by the Fourteenth Amendment .\n\nIn short, little Richie Lowry really needs to put some more thought into defining his terms and rebutting implied counterarguments when writing essays. Grade: D-.\n\nAll of which makes it interesting to go back and watch Death Wish , which remains so disturbingly pertinent. If you've seen it, you may not remember it as well as you think you do, as the cultural memory of the film is skewed by its notorious context. It touched a cultural nerve and was embraced by the kind of angry \"silent majority\" that's never actually silent in the United States, and its popularity led to four hit sequels.\n\nThe first Death Wish is an odd film, one of a number of films that reflected the United States' rough political transition from a period of gains on the political left starting in the post-WWII era, culminating in the radical demands for change and countercultural turmoil of the 1960s and early 1970s, through the political malaise and stagnation of the mid-to-late 1970s, to the right-wing Reagan Revolution of the 1980s. In certain scenes, Death Wish actually signals a surprising awareness of how readily smug left-liberalism, entrenched in its societal gains and cultural mores but cut off from any socialist principles or serious critique of the political status quo, swings rightward under pressure toward fascism, expressed as violent, generally racist fantasies of \"cleansing\" a corrupt population by force.\n\nThere's good reason not to remember the film's more compelling ambiguities, since its other lurid elements - such as manifest hatred of the poor and racist dog whistles - draw all the attention.\n\nIt's the story of how mild-mannered architect Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) goes from being a \"bleeding-heart liberal\" to a crazy-eyed vigilante after his family is brutalized by thugs. His wife Joanna (Hope Lange) dies as a result of the attack, and his daughter Carol (Kathleen Tolan) is gang-raped and so traumatized she has to be institutionalized. Soon afterward, Kersey is using the nighttime urban scene in New York City as a hunting ground, tracking malefactors, mainly unwary muggers, whom he shoots to kill.\n\nSeveral of the would-be robbers Kersey shoots are black. But regardless of race, they all approach him in states of excessive, sneering villainy and unambiguous threat, generally pulling out knives and waving them in his face. There's no indication, through editing or cinematography, that this is the subjective vision of Kersey, deranged by the horror of his family's experience. It's clear that these are essentially bad people acting out of evil impulses because they enjoy it, not because they might desperately need the money they always demand with demeaning curses.\n\nThe three men who commit the home invasion are white (startlingly, one of them is portrayed by the very young and still unknown Jeff Goldblum), but they're the most cartoonishly villainous of all, exuding a kind of giggling depravity and love of violent chaos that ignites the protagonist's determination that such people be put down like rabid dogs for the good of society.\n\nWhich is the attitude expressed earlier by Kersey's business partner (William Redfield), a fat cat in a business suit who makes a Taxi Driver - style argument that approximates the wish for a cleansing rain - or perhaps a hail of bullets - to wash all the scum off the streets. New York City is being made unpleasant for the rich and respectable, because they share the streets with the increasingly poor and desperate, which means the poor and desperate must be erased: \"I say, stick them in concentration camps.\"\n\nThis is unusually bold, forthright fascism. Usually, in real-life public commentary, such statements vaguely indicate that people like Jordan Neely, who are homeless and mentally ill and shout about their misery and appear threatening to people, need to be removed from public life somehow. How often have we heard this line of talk in real life? Tech employees in the Bay Area, for example, made the news regularly for a while, demanding that the homeless be \"somehow\" removed from their sight while they commuted to and from work at Apple or Google or Yahoo.\n\nIn response to his colleague's insane rant, Kersey makes a vague, rote, half-hearted mention of his sympathy for the \"underprivileged.\" We're clearly supposed to recognize the troubling weakness of his response. The early scenes of the film all indicate that Kersey, happy and successful as he is, is straining at the confinement of \"civilization\" and wants to break out in some way. We first meet him on vacation in Hawaii with his wife. When he proposes sex on the deserted beach instead of waiting to go back to the hotel room, she objects mildly: \"We're too civilized.\"\n\n\"We're too civilized\" is meant to resonate thematically throughout the film as a critique of American society, referring to the idea that the solid bourgeoisie allows itself to be terrorized by the raging criminal underclass out of brainwashed liberal guilt. But is it just Kersey's fast conversion to this idea that we're watching, or the film's overarching argument?\n\nThere's plausible deniability built into the film at certain points - the final image, especially, which shows Kersey arriving at Chicago's O'Hare Airport, having left behind \"that toilet,\" which is how his Arizonan colleague describes New York. He watches a couple of teenage boys harassing a girl and points his finger in the shape of a gun, making the \"pow, pow\" sign at their backs as they run off. The film freezes on that image, capturing the insane look in Kersey's eyes and showing that he's going to continue his lone vigilante killing spree.\n\nBrian Garfield, the author of the original 1972 novel Death Wish , hated the adaptation :\n\nThe point of the novel Death Wish is that vigilantism is an attractive fantasy but it only makes things worse in reality. By the end of the novel, the character (Paul) is gunning down unarmed teenagers because he doesn't like their looks. The story is about an ordinary guy who descends into madness.\n\nAccording to Garfield, the admired actor Jack Lemmon was initially slated to play the lead role, with Sidney Lumet directing rather than Michael Winner, which gives some idea of how differently the adaptation might have turned out. Once Charles Bronson was set to star, the shift from thoughtful drama toward brutal neo-noir action film was set.\n\nGarfield so disapproved of the eventual film, he did \"penance\" by writing a 1975 sequel underscoring his own critique of vigilantism called Death Sentence . Meanwhile, the four increasingly violent and successful sequels to Death Wish, all vehicles for Bronson, rocked on.\n\nMaking Kersey look like a menace to society at the end of the film is interesting, especially in terms of the ignoble way he's shooting at retreating backs, something we've seen him do several times when using a real gun to finish off wounded robbers running away. It's something no classic Western hero would ever do, because \"honor\" supposedly defined all his actions. The film contains a thoroughly developed Western theme, evoking a genre known for celebrating vigilantism and \"frontier justice.\"\n\nOn a business trip to Tucson, Arizona, Kersey is brought to a fake-Western town, maintained for tourists and occasional Hollywood filmmaking, and gets strangely caught up in watching the actor playing the heroic sheriff gun down bank robbers who are shooting up the town. His colleague and host during the business trip is a gun enthusiast who celebrates how freely people like them move around in the world, carrying guns that supposedly guarantee their safety from outlaws and evildoers. And it's revealed that Kersey was raised with guns, attaining almost sharpshooter abilities growing up, before his father was killed in a hunting accident and his mother banned all guns from the house. Kersey also mentions that he was a conscientious objector in the Korean War and served as a medic. His colleague's response: \"You're probably one of them knee-jerk liberals, thinks us gun boys shoot our guns because it's an extension of our penises.\"\n\nReturning to the world of guns seems to revive his father's frontier-style legacy, which had been interrupted by his mother's presumably weak, \"too civilized\" fears. It also places Kersey back within Hollywood Western mythologizing, where it seems he longs to be.\n\nThis mythologizing was accepted by many Americans as close enough to the nation's actual history, which Hollywood studios encouraged. The harsh revisionist Westerns of the 1960s and early '70s, aiming at greater authenticity about the inglorious vigilante violence, robber baron capitalism, cynical land grabs, racism, misogyny, and drug use that were widespread in the actual Old West, came as a rude shock to fans and all but killed off the genre.\n\nThat Kersey develops an idea of himself as the Western hero is clear when he challenges the last mugger he encounters, who's succeeded in wounding him, to \"draw,\" as if he were starring in Shane . It's another of the film's ambiguous scenes emphasizing Kersey's mental collapse, and in this case also satirizing his inability to live up to his own heroic image of himself, especially when he faints from loss of blood.\n\nIn the end, Kersey the anonymous vigilante has gotten so popular with the public, the police don't dare arrest him, though they know he's the killer. They're trying to avoid making public Kersey's success in reducing the number of street crimes, which might unleash an epidemic of vigilantism. Kersey's given the option to avoid arrest by relocating, and he's told by the police officer heading up the case to get out of town. Kersey echoes a phrase used by lawmen in Westerns, asking, \"You mean get out before sundown?\"\n\nThe persistence of the inflammatory discourse around vigilante violence in the United States, whether it revolves around actual events in the world or fictionalized representations, indicates strongly that many Americans, like the Paul Kersey character, are still enamored of the vigilante justice celebrated in old Westerns. The belief is widespread that we live in an ever-degenerating society, a \"jungle,\" beset by vicious \"animals\" and mobs of rampaging savages that can only be quelled by a lone \"hero\" ever prepared to shoot and claim self-defense and defense of others, no matter what the actual circumstances. Outraged and outrageous commentary cheering on Paul Kersey and Bernhard Goetz and Daniel Penny all blurs together, making it terrifying to contemplate who's going to be the next Jordan Neely, whose publicly distraught state should have brought him offers of help but got him murdered instead.\n\nEileen Jones is a film critic at Jacobin and author of Filmsuck, USA .

These attacks helped pave the way for the killing of Jordan Neely.\n\nProtesters march to demand justice for Jordan Neely on May 6 in New York.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nEven during his first months as mayor, Eric Adams was intent on dehumanizing the homeless. On February 17, 2022, the mayor declared that he gave New York Police Department (NYPD) officers a clear mandate to enforce Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) rules on the subway against drug use, littering, lying down on seats, and \"using the subway for any purpose other than transportation\" - measures designed to harass homeless people and force them out of the subway. Shockingly, Adams then said about homeless people: \"You can't put a Band-Aid on a cancerous sore. That's not how you solve the problem. You must remove the cancer to start the healing process.\"\n\nBy comparing the homeless to a cancerous tumor, Adams was publicly dehumanizing the homeless - and questioning their right to exist.\n\nAdams's words that day should be kept in mind when considering the heinous murder of Jordan Neely on May 1 on the F train at the Broadway-Lafayette stop by Daniel Penny, a twenty-four-year-old former marine. That murder is not an isolated incident; it comes in the context of an escalation in the criminalization of the homeless that has been a hallmark of Adams's tenure. Just in September, when large numbers of migrants in need of humanitarian aid arrived in the city, many of whom were bused here by Republican governors in other states, Adams tried to \" reassess \" the city's right-to-shelter law, which guarantees a bed to anyone who needs it. This week, he weakened the law in anticipation of more migrants. Adams has been willing to relocate and devalue the homeless of this city, treating them as an annoyance that he wishes would just go away.\n\nTo Adams and the defenders of this brutal killing, Jordan Neely was less than human. Never mind that Neely was agitated because he had no home, had no occupation, and had not eaten in days, a condition that could make anyone nervous. That he was highly emotional and erratic in public - behavior you can witness in any number of the city's bars - doesn't mean that he did not ultimately deserve protection and empathy from his fellow citizens and the City of New York.\n\nIn New York, homelessness tragically isn't strange. Seventy thousand people are homeless in the city. Despite the fact that we live in the wealthiest country in history, many people have been conditioned to view ending homelessness as unattainable and hopelessly idealistic. So homelessness has become mundane. No one who lives in New York City is surprised to find themselves engaging with homeless people in public spaces. Money will be asked for; some will be given out of empathy and charity. Some homeless people will get closer to you than you'd like; others you may find charming. This is what happens in a city that has chosen to live with homelessness rather than end it.\n\nOn May 3, two days after Neely was left lifeless by a fellow citizen, Mayor Adams issued a statement of ambiguity toward the murder: \"We cannot just blanketly say what a passenger should or should not do in a situation like that.\" A human being was murdered, and Adams effectively said we can't know if the murder was justified.\n\nDespite later statements arguing that Penny should not have killed Neely, this quote is troublesome. The initial reaction of New York City's top executive expressed callous indifference to the murder of a human being. That indifference is reflected in his policymaking.\n\nFor all of Mayor Adams's posturing about how much he loves this city, he is in fact cutting desperately needed social services and public institutions such as libraries and schools while increasing the police budget, at the same time he pops up at the swanky club Zero Bond and mentors shady businessmen . He doesn't love working-class New York. By cutting social services that could keep people like Jordan Neely safe, Adams is hanging the homeless out for deadly chokeholds.\n\nIn the days after Neely's murder, numerous publications ran articles about who Jordan Neely was. People deserve to know that Neely was a Michael Jackson impersonator who made people smile and laugh while doing the infamous crotch grab and moonwalk, and that he tragically started having mental health issues after his mother was murdered by her partner in 2007.\n\nBut that tragic backstory doesn't justify what happened on that subway car. Neely's life mattered. He was a human being, like any of us. When he declared that he was ready to die, it was a testament to his dire situation. A fifteen-minute lethal chokehold should not have been his fate. New York's power brokers have decided that, just because they sleep on our city streets or trains, people like Neely are less than human.\n\nThose who take the subway every day know how the conditions can cause annoyance and discomfort. But if we deserve to be safe, so do the homeless. Neely's mental health issues exacerbated his dozen or so run-ins with police; his aunt, Carolyn Neely, says that \"the system just failed him. He fell through the cracks of the system.\" This was someone who needed help, not a death sentence. Just last April, the mayor carried out sweeps of encampments . The message was clear: the homeless were under attack by the city.\n\nEarlier this week, the mayor changed his tune. \"One of our own is dead, a black man, black like me, a man named Jordan, a name I gave my son,\" Adams said. \"One thing we know for sure, Jordan Neely did not deserve to die.\" The mayor also said people who struggle with mental illness are \"caught up in a cycle of violence, sometimes as the perpetrator, but more often as the victim.\"\n\nThis statement is way too late. The mayor's trite swagger, amid his closure of libraries and cuts to public goods like schools and social services, is paving the way for more Jordan Neely's to become victims, jailed, or, worse, killed like Neely was that afternoon - in a city that claims to love him while viewing him as a cancer.\n\nJayson Buford is a music critic from New York.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Yet the widespread demonization of the homeless would lead you to believe the exact opposite.\n\nA homeless man in San Francisco, California on May 16, 2023. (Tayfun Coskun / Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nOn the first of May, Jordan Neely - a homeless New Yorker chronically struggling with mental illness and addiction - had the breath wrung out of him by a several-minute-long choke hold administered by ex-Marine Daniel Penny, who was alarmed by Neely's behavior on the subway. What exactly prompted Penny's action differs between accounts: some witnesses said Neely was explicitly threatening other passengers, others that he was just particularly belligerent about demanding food. Whatever the case, by the time police got to the scene, Neely was dead and officers let Penny walk free, turning the incident into a national flashpoint.\n\nTo any normal human being, the whole incident was a sad and wretched microcosm of everything that's gone wrong in modern American life: from the callous failures of political leadership and the rippling tragedies of endemic poverty, to the deep-seated need among lost young American men to find meaning in violent heroics. But that wasn't enough for some, who soon worked to turn Neely's killing into something that wasn't just a regrettable outcome of the long-standing depravities of the unequal US economy, but an act that was necessary and correct , in part to combat a scourge of violent vagrants threatening innocent Americans up and down the country.\n\n\"Why are regular people just being asked to be heroes in the subway?\" asked cultural critic Thomas Chatterton-Williams, adding that people shouldn't be asked to \"tolerate abuse or the possibility of assault.\"\n\n\"Not a week goes by that a mentally ill person doesn't get on and terrorize the entire car,\" said Newsweek deputy opinion editor Batya Ungar-Sargon. \"It's working class New Yorkers who have to face down this violence.\"\n\n\"What if Penny had done nothing? Would everyone - including Neely - have emerged from that subway car unscathed?\" wondered David French. \"We can't know for certain, and that lack of certainty creates the conditions for violence.\"\n\n\"It seems like this was justified,\" talk-radio host Jason Rantz told Fox News , who said it was \"fair to say\" that Neely, as a \"mentally ill homeless man with supposedly forty-plus charges who continues to harass people,\" was a \"threat.\"\n\nIn short order, one of the United States' two dominant political factions has not only used the sad and avoidable death of a desperately poor man to give an enthusiastic thumbs-up to vigilantism - it's somehow turned the tragic episode into an elaborate justification of more attacks on the homeless.\n\nNeely's death is just the latest high-profile case of lethal violence being visited on the homeless in the United States. Take a look through local news reporting this year alone, and you'll find story after story of strangers, some of them wearing law enforcement badges, killing homeless Americans - vivid examples of the regularly repeated maxim that those who live on the streets are far more likely to be the victims of violence than the ones carrying it out.\n\nJust days before Neely was killed on the New York subway, a very similar murder caused a firestorm in San Francisco, where Banko Brown, a homeless transgender black man, was killed by a Walgreens security guard. The guard ultimately faced no charges, with authorities saying he had felt he was in \" mortal danger \" and acting in self-defense, after the unarmed Brown threatened to stab him and raised his arm toward him. But just-released (and highly upsetting) security camera footage of the incident shows that, after the two scuffled, the guard shot Brown as he was walking away and out the door with his back turned.\n\nBut even these two high-profile cases aren't really reflective of the kind of dangers faced by the homeless, who don't need to engage in minor lawbreaking or even seem dangerous to be targeted with violence.\n\nThis month saw a fifty-four-year-old Redwood City, California homeless man killed in a hit-and-run and a twenty-nine-year-old homeless man shot to death in the Las Vegas drainage canal tunnel in which he lived. (Lest those justifying Neely's death feel a pang of compassion for the latter, rest assured that his girlfriend admitted that he was \"damn near a felon,\" giving plenty of potential ammunition for tortured justifications of that murder).\n\nIn a number of cases, the victims were cherished members of their communities. One homeless man, David Breaux, described as a \"beloved presence\" in the city of Davis, was one of three stabbing victims in the California city in one week, found dead on the park bench where he regularly slept. Greensboro man Lance Ross Williams, remembered as someone who would share what he had with those in need despite having nothing to give, and called \"the kindest human I've ever met\" by one local, was shot one morning in March and died from his injuries.\n\nSometimes all that is needed to trigger a murder is the crime of looking for shelter. One man was shot to death in Columbus, Ohio in April after a homeowner found him sleeping in his detached garage without his permission, something a local faith leader called \"tragic and completely avoidable,\" insisting that the man was \"a gentle person\" who would have left if asked. A Houston man was killed a month earlier, shot in the stomach while sleeping in a vacant building.\n\nSome of these murders are truly stomach-churning: the Harrisburg man smashed in the head and face with a claw hammer and dumped in a stairwell; the man found dead from blunt force trauma to the head and neck under a bridge in Spartanburg, South Carolina; the Grand Rapids, Michigan man whose death was so grisly, police would only say that he'd suffered a \"brutal homicide\"; the Bridgeport, Connecticut man picked up and slammed headfirst into the pavement by someone who mistook his plea for assistance for a sexual pass.\n\nSometimes, they're staggering in the casualness of their cruelty. One recent high-profile St Louis murder saw a man nonchalantly load a gun and shoot a homeless man he'd gotten into an argument with in the head as he sat on the pavement. Naturally, the same Fox News that declared Neely's murder \"justified\" - call ing Neely \"a career criminal who was threatening subway passengers\" and claim ing that the charges brought against Penny for killing him shows \"the lives of criminals are valued over law-abiding citizens\" in liberal New York - conversely used the murder of this homeless person in St Louis to argue that crime is out of control because of woke prosecutors.\n\nAnd some of the murders were carried out by the very law enforcement authorities who are meant to protect the most vulnerable, as two recently settled lawsuits illustrate, reminding us of the dangers of using armed police as catchall first responders in every type of crisis. One man suffering from schizoaffective disorder was stopped by Orange County sheriff's deputies in 2020 while jaywalking, which quickly turned into a scuffle and his shooting death . The following year, Portland police officers escalated an encounter with an unarmed homeless man in the middle of a mental health crisis, immediately pulling out their guns and shooting him within five minutes of the encounter, then waiting seven minutes before getting him medical help while eating a pizza next to his dead body.\n\nAside from the two cases above, all of these incidents are from just this year. If you care to, you can go back and find many, similarly perverse acts of violence before this year, like the Nashville woman who got a year of probation for shooting a homeless man who asked her to move her Porsche, after she pulled up to where he was sleeping with her music blaring.\n\nThese cases are just vivid, human illustrations of what we can plainly see from the data available to us: that being homeless in America is incredibly dangerous and deadly, and is only getting deadlier.\n\nAccording to Homeless Deaths Count - a project run by Matthew Fowle, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania's Housing Initiative at Penn - homeless deaths steadily rose from 6,345 in 2018 to 7,877 in 2020, the last year that was counted in the project. That included 346 deaths that year in New York City alone, where Neely was killed. Homeless deaths had shot up by 77 percent over the five years to 2020, according to a separate Guardian survey of local data from twenty US urban areas.\n\nA research paper from the University of Chicago's Becker Friedman Institute, which followed 140,000 homeless people counted in the 2010 Census for twelve years, found that non-elderly homeless have a risk of death three-and-a-half times higher than people who are housed, and a 60 percent greater risk than those who are simply living in poverty. Some of that rise is due to the onset of the pandemic in 2020, and drug overdoses remain the leading cause of death for homeless people under forty-five.\n\nBut, the paper notes , several studies also identify traumatic injuries from external forces, like car accidents, and homicide specifically as the second-most common causes. A separate 2022 study published in the JAMA Network Open medical journal found the same result after examining years of data on homeless deaths in San Francisco: While the proportion of overdose deaths has surged from 34 percent in 2016 to 82 percent in 2020, traumatic injuries, which include homicides, were the second leading cause of death in each of those years.\n\nYet even this outsize role of drug overdoses can't be totally separated from the heightened risk of violence the homeless face. Multnomah County health officer Jenniffer Vines had told the Guardian that her office had anecdotal evidence that those living on the streets use meth to stay alert at night and protect themselves and their belongings, a claim backed up by this 2013 study of thirty meth users in Fort Collins, Colorado.\n\n\"One of the most fundamental perceived benefits of the alertness resulting from meth use for the participants in this study was the ability to cope with a multiplicity of vulnerabilities directly tied to homelessness or housing insecurity,\" the study states. \"Being out here living in the forest, to me, I'm vulnerable,\" one of those interviewed told the study's author. \"If I go to sleep . . . I don't hear nothing. That means somebody can slip up on me, you know.\"\n\nCouple that with the explosion in the prevalence of fentanyl in recent years, and it's not surprising that deaths - particularly drug-related deaths - have soared among the homeless, especially in the parts of the country where it's hardest to afford shelter.\n\nIn Los Angeles County, with the worst homelessness rate in the nation and where a family needs to earn six figures to afford average rent without living in hardship, the homeless mortality rate rose 55 percent from 2019 to 2021, with a startling 2,201 people dying in the latter year and fentanyl-related overdoses nearly tripling. In Orange County, the least affordable county in one of the least affordable parts of the country, fentanyl overdoses were the leading cause of the quadrupling of homeless deaths over a ten-year span.\n\nAdding to this vicious cycle is the fact that even when meth isn't laced with fentanyl, it can cause paranoia, psychosis, and various kinds of erratic behavior by those using it - making the kind of scenes that led to Neely's murder much more likely.\n\nNeedless to say, none of this means that homeless people never perpetrate violence themselves. That would be an absurd argument to make. But the way those justifying Neely's killing are carrying on, you'd think that homeless Americans are intrinsically, universally violent, or even the ones responsible for the post-pandemic spike in violent crime - and not, as they actually are, the overwhelming victims of that violence, often at the hands of those who aren't suffering from the same deprivations they're struggling with.\n\nThis ugly narrative is part of a wider demonization and persecution of the homeless that's on the rise across the country, whether in the form of the homeless encampment sweeps that have now become routine in cities, or the policy-based scapegoating and attacks by unscrupulous hacks like New York mayor Eric Adams , who has cut services to the homeless, banned them from sheltering in the subway, and is forcibly hospitalizing them. If policy makers are upset by the growing spread of homeless populations around the country but refuse to change anything about the status quo to try to fix it, it's always easier to just force this human reminder of our political failures out of sight and out of mind.\n\nThe distressing scene that ended in Jordan Neely's death should not be a regular occurrence in a wealthy country, as it is in so many cities across the United States today. The obvious solution is fixing the broken political economy that's feeding the rise in homelessness , which government financial assistance and public investment have shown some success in doing. Encouraging vigilante heroics and law enforcement crackdowns is shameful and depraved.\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .

But it largely leaves out a key piece of King's legacy: his commitment to labor.\n\nDr Martin Luther King Jr photographed on May 26, 1966.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nReview of King: A Life by Jonathan Eig (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, May 2023).\n\nOn May Day 2023, a young black man named Jordan Neely in the midst of a mental health crisis cried out that he was hungry and thirsty on a New York City subway. A white male former Marine named Daniel Penny threw him on the floor and choked him to death. Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis praised the man and compared him to the biblical Good Samaritan, saying, \"Let's show this Marine America's got his back.\"\n\nLate at night on April 3, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee, Martin Luther King Jr, interpreted the parable of the Good Samaritan quite differently, describing him as the member of a scorned caste who had risked his life to save a person of the dominant race who had been beaten and robbed and left to perish on the dangerous road from Jerusalem to Jericho. King told this story at Mason Temple to people who had risked a dreadful storm to support 1,300 black sanitation workers, part of the city's working poor, who were engaged in a desperate months-long strike against the City of Memphis.\n\nThe workers and King himself were at a breaking point. A few days earlier at a demonstration, nonstrikers had broken windows, setting off a riot by vengeful white police who sent hundreds of demonstrators to the hospital and killed sixteen-year-old, unarmed Larry Payne. King's nonviolent leadership and the strike's success now hung in the balance.\n\nKing had been under unendurable stress for months. He encouraged his audience to have hope, but he also told strike supporters of his own terrors going down the Jericho Road, as people had stabbed, jailed, beaten, and repeatedly tried to kill him. At the end of his talk, he declared, \"I really don't know what will happen to me now\" and virtually predicted his own death. But instead of fearfully standing aside, he told his audience to rally with him to the side of the sanitation workers, no matter the consequences to themselves.\n\nThe question was not what will happen to us if we take the dangerous path of extending our empathy to others, he said, but what will happen to the weak and vulnerable if we do not. \"Let us develop a kind of dangerous unselfishness,\" King declared.\n\nThe next day on April 4, 1968, an assassin murdered him.\n\nMore than fifty years later, Republicans have turned King's Good Samaritan story upside down. Some praise Penny and Kyle Rittenhouse, a white teenager referred to as \"a nice young man\" by Donald Trump who, armed with an assault rifle, shot three Black Lives Matter protesters in Kenosha, Wisconsin, killing two of them. (He was exonerated of any crime.) Like the South's segregationist White Citizens Councils, \"the Klan in business suits,\" Republicans today urge hatred and violence committed by others to achieve their own political ends. In a posthumous article titled \"Showdown for Nonviolence\" in Look magazine, King warned that white politicians such as these could use racism to stir up \"a kind of right-wing takeover . . . a Fascist development, which will be terribly injurious to the whole nation.\"\n\nJonathan Eig's new biography sounds a warning about the times we are in, taking us into the heart and soul of King as he goes down the dangerous and terrifying Jericho Road from his birth on January 15, 1929, to his death in Memphis. I wondered what more could be written after the tremendous accounts we already have of King, but it turns out there remains much more to say. Eig has used his sharp journalistic eye to spin a powerful story of King and the movements in which he participated, from the yearlong Montgomery bus boycott in 1955-56 to brutal episodes in Mississippi; St Augustine, Florida; Birmingham and Selma, Alabama; Chicago; and Memphis during the 1960s.\n\nWhen King became an antiwar leader, right-wing paramilitary activists as well as segregationists put him in their crosshairs. Constantly confronting chaos and death chiseled him into a leader who felt frightened, often unsure of himself, and yet called on by the people and his devotion to what he felt was God's command to speak out and organize for a better world.\n\nAs the spokesperson for a mass movement, King went seemingly everywhere and found himself in jail at least twenty-seven times in local movements. There he looked up from the bottom of a dark well to find allies, comrades, and ordinary people who kept pushing. The great black activist Ella Baker said King didn't make the movement, the movement made King; this account helps us to understand that what she said is true. Sleeping four hours a night, constantly on the road speaking or reading or writing or organizing, King relentlessly moved forward. Starting with what he called \"phase one\" of the freedom movement, for civil and voting rights, he moved on to making greater demands and launch increasingly all-encompassing struggles for racial equality, peace, and economic justice, not only in the South but in the nation and the world.\n\nEig shows us how \"the radical King,\" in Cornel West's terminology, came to be. Eig also draws on interviews he conducted over six years with some two hundred people who knew King and tells us even more than David Garrow told us decades ago in his King biography about the relentless, illegal FBI campaign of surveillance and sabotage intended to take King out as a leader or induce King to retreat from public life or to commit suicide .\n\nIn his warped, racist view, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover ludicrously seemed to consider one of America's most famous Baptist ministers a communist or a dupe of communists. Eig documents the unrelenting emotional pressures the FBI and violent white supremacists placed on King. Eig captures recently released transcripts and FBI agent summaries of wiretaps as well as tapes of presidents Lyndon Johnson and John F. Kennedy to show how Hoover tainted their views with his constant salacious and anti-communist propaganda. Hoover leaked wiretap reports to legislators, the media, the military, and anyone who would listen.\n\nBefore any reader expresses shock that King - a charismatic celebrity, on the road for often three hundred days of the year - had relationships with numerous women outside of his marriage to Coretta Scott King, we should be clear: the government had no business taping him. If it hadn't, we would not have these details of his sex life. Hoover is now reaching back from the grave to scandalize King. Eig is shocked by some of what he discovered in newly opened FBI documents but writes that the bigger scandal is that the media did not bring Hoover's campaign to a stop by exposing the FBI's disgraceful and illegal campaign.\n\nOften at his wit's end, King had huge emotional needs; he exercised his male prerogatives in a patriarchal culture that he grew up with in the black church and seems to have searched recklessly for affection and intimacy with women despite the knowledge that the FBI was breathing down his neck. He also saw women as partners in the freedom movement - especially Coretta Scott King. She was at least as radical and at least as dedicated as her husband, stood with him bravely through bombings and death threats, and shored him up through every crisis. By her refusal to comment on King's infidelities, she declared that their private love lives were not anyone else's business. Eig documents Coretta King as not only a faithful wife and partner but as a courageous, principled force who made King's leadership possible and pushed the movement to fight for peace as well as justice. Eig also acknowledges the importance of King's longtime coworker and confidant Dorothy Cotton who stood by him in many campaigns.\n\nEig's fast-paced and moving narrative of King's life journey and the growing opposition against him impresses on the reader the extent to which the right-wing and racist crusades against King and other social democratic advocates distorted the politics of that era, as they do in our own times. Perhaps only a God-centric person such as King, who believed he had been called on to follow in the path of Jesus come what may, could have withstood the systemic and emotional forces in American life of racism, violence, war, and death.\n\nEig explains King's roots in the black social gospel, as the son and grandson of poor and formerly enslaved ancestors who preached the gospel, and King's deep belief in a personal God who guarantees ultimate justice. Step by step, as a young man growing up in the Great Depression, as a college and doctoral student incorporating the nonviolent teachings of Jesus and Mahatma Gandhi and the critique of capitalism by Karl Marx and social gospel theologians, King early on (not just at the end of his life) became committed to radical reconstruction of American society and the world. He wove the principles of democracy and freedom supposedly guaranteed by the American experience into a radical critique and a demand to resist the \"three evils\" of racism, militarism, and extreme materialism.\n\nIt's a marvelous story. Eig's account stirs a whirlwind of exhilarating feelings as well as visceral pain at remembering the violence and stress that King and his allies in the freedom movement endured. Eig's account underlines that people should understand King not as a \"civil rights leader\" but as a radical who challenged all that remains wrong in American life.\n\nIn his last organizing effort, the Poor People's Campaign, King sought to build a mass movement and left-of-center political coalition to demand that every person have full and equal access to the basic necessities of life that one of the richest nations in the world should be able to offer. He called for reparations and an Economic Bill of Rights leveraged by voting and demonstrations and a mass \"live-in\" civil disobedience action at the nation's capital.\n\nKing demanded the country take a drastic turn in a social democratic direction, such as he saw in Norway when he had received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. He repeatedly warned that a country that continues to spend more on the military than human needs is \"approaching spiritual death\" and called on the nation to radically alter its priorities.\n\nRather than leading us to the Promised Land, King was murdered in Memphis, followed by the assassination of presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, who might have turned the country away from the path of criminal wars subsequently waged by President Richard Nixon and his advisor Henry Kissinger. What Rev. James Lawson calls \"the politics of assassination\" turned King's dream into a nightmare.\n\nEveryone needs to know the story of the only individual African American for which we have a national holiday, and this book is essential. The book does have a blind spot, however, largely ignoring an element in King's evolution that remains especially important today: his connection to workers and unions and their significance in bringing about social justice.\n\nEig does describe how King learned about working-class issues from his father's church, from growing up during the Great Depression, and from college experiences working on a tobacco farm. He also notes that Hoover started tracking King when he discovered that his advisor Stanley Levison wrote speeches that King delivered to unions, both to raise funds for the civil rights movement and as part of a strategy to build a broad coalition of interests to change American society.\n\nAs Hoover knew, the Communist Party and the nearly half a dozen leftist civil rights unions that had been expelled in 1949 from the mainstream labor movement followed that united front strategy. So did A. Philip Randolph , Bayard Rustin , and just about every social democratic activist, all of whom understood that formula of a labor-civil rights coalition that naturally emerged from social movements of workers and people of color from the New Deal of the 1930s to the freedom movements of the 1960s.\n\nThe Packinghouse and Pullman Porters unions, with large black memberships, supported King's campaign in Montgomery, and 1199: The National Health Care Workers' Union and others joined in throughout King's time of leadership. Walter Reuther, who is mentioned but not identified as president of the powerful United Auto Workers union, provided much of the bail funds in Birmingham, and joined King to lead a mass march in Detroit as well as in the March on Washington, to which his and other unions sent thousands of people on buses, trains, and planes. That \"March for Jobs and Freedom\" began as a labor event and ended as one of the most important mass marches of the twentieth century.\n\nKing addressed many if not most of the major unions and became an honorary member of some of them. In 1961, he spoke to the AFL-CIO federation criticizing union racism and warning that a \"crisis confronts us both\" in the form of a menacing military, segregationist, and right-wing coalition that threatens \"everything that is decent and fair in American life\" and could \"drive labor into impotency.\" Stanley Levison wrote most of this and King's other labor speeches, but King gave those speeches life. He did not just follow a script written by someone else. He felt labor struggles.\n\nA few days after receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in Olso, Norway, where he called for a universal campaign for peace and economic justice, he came back to Atlanta to go on the picket line. On behalf of eight hundred black women who worked in his church's neighborhood, he joined their effort and stayed with it until they won their strike against the Scripto manufacturing company. Working with labor advisors and union allies, King thoroughly imbibed the idea of labor solidarity. What civil rights leader besides King would have stepped into the Memphis sanitation strike, as part of his Poor People's Campaign, unprepared but quickly assessing the crisis at hand, to call for a general strike of black teachers, students, and working people?\n\nHad things turned out differently, such an event in Memphis would have signaled a major turning point for the movements of the 1960s. His \"All Labor has Dignity\" stump speech to Memphis workers on March 18 speaks to both his familiarity with unions and his passion for the black working poor.\n\n\"You are reminding not only Memphis, but you are reminding the nation that it is a crime for people to live in this rich nation and receive starvation wages,\" he said. \"We can all get more together than we can apart; we can get more organized together than we can apart. And this is the way we gain power.\" King understood solidarity.\n\nLike other biographers of King, Eig's account of King's last campaign in Memphis remains spare, telling us not enough about the movement and its consequences for how we remember King. As in Montgomery in 1955, in 1968 King infused a local struggle with larger, universal demands for solidarity.\n\n\"He gave his life for the poor of the world, the garbage workers of Memphis, and the peasants of Vietnam,\" said Coretta Scott King.\n\nOn April 8, while white supremacists reveled in his death and continued to call King a communist and authorities feared another riot, she and three of her children led tens of thousands of Memphians along with strikers, Reuther, and other unionists in a disciplined, silent march in Memphis. She called on them to renew their dedication to King's nonviolent vision to \"make all people truly free and to make every person feel that he is a human being.\" Weeks later, the sanitation workers won their strike and gained recognition for Local 1733 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME). Labor and civil rights alliances helped to make public employees the fastest-growing segment of unions in the country.\n\nOn April 4, 2018, fifty years after King's death, tens of thousands of us gathered in Memphis to rededicate ourselves to King's labor, civil rights, and human rights coalition and to defy the corrupt, racist, and anti-union agenda of the Trump regime. Unions honor King today as a labor as well as freedom movement leader. Workers in Memphis and other places still use the \"I Am a Man\" slogan as part of their protests today.\n\nAlthough Eig does not fully bring to the fore King's vision of union and worker solidarity, he excels in highlighting King as a person and dramatizing his many struggles. In reading this book, I felt an upsurge of hope that we may be able to alter what looks like an increasingly dismal future. It's a beautiful book that requires every reader to grapple with both the contradictions and the glory of one of our leading historical protagonists for peace, freedom, economic justice, and equality.\n\nWhat more can readers read to understand King's prophetic voice and vision? Turn additionally to stories written by labor and civil rights historians on King's project to abolish poverty and demand that \"all labor has dignity,\" as he said in Memphis. \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,\" King wrote in his \"Letter from Birmingham Jail.\" We still need to fully embrace King's framework of global solidarity in the struggle to end racism, poverty, and war. This new biography tells a story that helps to keep hope alive that we may someday attain King's beloved community of social and economic justice.\n\nMichael K.

      "text": "The New York subway death is a symptom of a bigger problem\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nUPDATE (05/05/2023 4:20 p.m. E.T.): The New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner on Wednesday ruled Jordan Neely died of \"compression of neck (chokehold)\" and that the manner was homicide. No charges have been issued.\n\nA passenger on the New York City subway reportedly put a homeless man exhibiting mental distress in a chokehold for 15 minutes on Monday, after which the man died. The tragic incident is a reminder of how we need to temper reactionary rhetoric vilifying homeless people in cities across the country.\n\nJordan Neely, a 30-year-old man who reportedly was homeless and had a history of mental health issues, started shouting at passengers while traveling on the F train in Manhattan. \"'I don't have food, I don't have a drink, I'm fed up,'\" the man yelled, a witness told The New York Times. \"'I don't mind going to jail and getting life in prison. I'm ready to die.'\" He also apparently used threatening language - a law enforcement source with knowledge of the case told NBC News that an eyewitness said Neely said, \"I'll hurt anyone on this train.\" Then, according to the New York Post, a 24-year-old Marine veteran came up behind Neely, took him to the ground and put him in a chokehold.\n\nThe chokehold was notable for a few reasons. No reporting indicates that Neely attempted to harm someone before he was placed in it. The person who placed Neely in a chokehold approached him from behind. The chokehold - a potentially lethal restraining position which aims to restrict blood flow or air flow -lasted 15 minutes, according to a witness. And news reports and video footage indicate that the chokehold was held well after the train had stopped and authorities were alerted, with multiple men helping restraining Neely after most passengers had left the subway car. In footage of the incident, a bystander can be heard expressing concern about the risk of Neely dying, in part because of the perceived intensity of the chokehold.\n\nNeely lost consciousness and paramedics were unable to revive him.  The veteran was taken into custody but released without charges. (That may change after autopsy results, according to the Post.)\n\nBased on the known facts, it appears that the fearful subway passenger acted aggressively in response to a situation where it was unclear how Neely, who was experiencing acute mental distress, was going to behave. With limited information, it is difficult to issue judgment on how defensible use of force was. It is an extremely common occurrence for people to yell aggressively on the New York City subway, which serves as a de facto shelter and panhandling space for people experiencing mental health problems, and the majority of the time nothing happens. That it's commonplace doesn't make it any less stressful or frightening for passengers, and the reality is it's difficult to assess when such incidents seem to be ignorable and when they could foreshadow actual violence.\n\nWhat's easier to question is the use of a chokehold, and the use of it for so long . Why did this person feel entitled to use such a dangerous mode of restraint, especially when he had the assistance of other subway riders, and when other passengers had left the train? A more measured response and Neely could very well be alive today.\n\n\"I saw Jordan Neely perform his Michael Jackson routine many times on the A train. He always made people smile,\" Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine tweeted on Wednesday. \"Our broken mental health system failed him. He deserved help, not to die in a chokehold on the floor of the subway.\"\n\nIt can't be forgotten that Neely's death took place as a broader policy regime and culture of stigmatizing people without housing makes incidents like this more likely. New York Mayor Eric Adams, a former police officer, has pushed for aggressive encampment sweeps and involuntarily hospitalizing mentally ill people while simultaneously pushing for cuts to homeless services . One point of focus for him has been removing homeless people from the subway system. Coupled with his fearmongering about crime and emphasis on aggressive policing, Adams and his allies have contributed to an atmosphere of paranoia about some of the most marginalized people in the city. But what's needed is far more investment in social services and supportive housing - and a culture of compassion for people who are suffering.\n\nThe media plays a huge role in fearmongering as well. Fox News pundits obsess over homelessness - but view the people suffering from it with spite and disgust . It's not hard to see the connections between disdain for people without housing and the news that a former city official in San Francisco has used bear spray to attack multiple homeless people. When the New York Post ran an article on the recent New York incident, it described the veteran as a passenger \"taking matters into his own hands\" while labeling Neely as \"unhinged.\" That's not approval of Neely's death, but it's uncomfortably close. In reality, what happened to Neely is a symptom of societal failure. It should prompt reflection, not celebration.\n\nZeeshan Aleem is a writer and editor for MSNBC Daily.

Daniel Penny said he was protecting himself and others when he choked Mr. Neely.\n\nBy Michael Wilson and Andy Newman\n\nIt was a Monday afternoon and a 30-year-old man was ranting on an F train headed through Manhattan. He was a regular on the subway, once a gifted Michael Jackson impersonator, but he was also troubled. City workers had tried to help him for years.\n\nInside the same car was a 24-year-old Marine veteran. After the military, he had dropped out of college, posting online about feeling \"completely unfulfilled,\" and now he was looking for a bartending job in the city.\n\nThe man behaving erratically, Jordan Neely, was homeless. He shouted to others on the train that he was hungry, that he didn't care about returning to jail, that he was ready to die, witnesses said.\n\nWhat exactly happened over the next several minutes is unclear, but eventually the veteran, Daniel J. Penny, placed Mr. Neely in a chokehold - one similar to what he would have been taught in basic training, but with a crucial difference - and took him to the floor in a minutes-long struggle that ended Mr. Neely's life and stirred outrage throughout the city.\n\nTheir encounter, captured on video by another passenger, has once again revealed the deep fault lines in the ways New Yorkers, and Americans beyond, view race, homelessness, crime and how some people seem to be treated differently by the police. The veteran, Mr. Penny, who is white, was questioned by the police, but has not been charged with a crime for killing Mr. Neely, who was Black.\n\nWas this a citizen trying to stop someone from hurting others?

Mr. Neely's killing, they said, was an unnecessary tragedy that underscored the city's inadequate policies toward its most vulnerable and marginalized residents.\n\nSome New Yorkers have also said that Mr. Penny's actions reflect the frustration and fear many riders have about the transit system; while crime on the subway has fallen lately, crime rates are higher than they were before the pandemic.\n\nWitnesses told the police that Mr. Neely had been shouting at passengers, but there has been no indication that he physically attacked anyone.\n\nLawyers for Mr. Penny, from the firm Raiser and Kenniff, said in an earlier statement that he \"never intended to harm Mr. Neely and could not have foreseen his untimely death.\"\n\nLennon Edwards, a lawyer for the family of Mr. Neely, said in an interview that Mr. Neely's killing was unacceptable. \"He was robbed of his life in a brutal way by someone who decided that they were judge, jury and executioner on the spot,\" he said. \"We can't have vigilantes, and we can't have people taking the law into their own hands.\"\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Whether Mr. Neely knew that he had the trait is unclear. But since his death, it has become a point of contention for lawyers.\n\nProsecutors have said that Daniel Penny, who is on trial for manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide because he put Mr. Neely in a chokehold, restrained Mr. Neely for about six minutes, cutting off his airway. When Mr. Neely tried to break free, the pressure of Mr. Penny's chokehold increased, prosecutors said.\n\nBut Mr. Penny's lawyers have centered their case on convincing the jurors that Mr. Neely's death was not caused by the chokehold and that it is impossible to know how much pressure Mr. Penny was exerting. Before they rested their case on Friday, the defense argued that Mr. Neely's schizophrenia, synthetic marijuana use and misshapen blood cells led to his death. People with the sickle cell trait typically do not have many, if any, sickle-shaped cells or experience symptoms, but blood slides from Mr. Neely's autopsy shared at the trial showed misshapen cells at the time of his death.\n\nNow that both the defense and the prosecution have made their cases, each side will present closing arguments to the 12 jurors and four alternates. The judge presiding over the case, Maxwell Wiley, has decided that closing arguments will not happen until after Thanksgiving.\n\nHere is what to know about the defense's case for Mr. Penny.\n\nThe medical examiner, Dr. Cynthia Harris, determined that Mr. Neely died from \"compression of the neck,\" and held firm to her findings through three days of testimony. However, an expert Mr. Penny's legal team called to testify, Dr. Satish Chundru, rebutted that.\n\nDr. Chundru, a forensic pathologist, said Mr. Neely died from \"combined effects.\"\n\n\"Sickle cell crisis, the schizophrenia, the struggle and restraint and the synthetic marijuana,\" he listed for jurors. He argued that Mr. Penny had struggled with Mr. Neely but had not choked him to death.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "Who Is a Danger in the Subway?\n\nLast week, Manhattan prosecutors announced manslaughter charges against Daniel Penny, the 24-year-old Long Island man who strangled Jordan Neely to death on a New York subway train last month. The trial is sure to be a seismic event that encapsulates the struggles of the unequal, unstable, post-pandemic city.\n\nThe obvious comparison is to Bernie Goetz, the so-called \"subway vigilante\" who shot four Black teenagers on a train in 1984, paralyzing one of them, after, he said, they tried to rob him. Goetz was charged with attempted murder but convicted only of illegally carrying a gun. In surveys, more than half of New Yorkers expressed support for Goetz, fed up with a city they perceived as out of control. (That case will be the subject of former Slow Burn host Leon Neyfakh's Fiasco podcast this summer.)\n\nIt's too soon to say how many New Yorkers feel similarly charitable toward Penny, but they may share that generation's view of the subway as a zone of mayhem. Indeed, that has been the incessant refrain of Mayor Eric Adams, who regularly decries the city's crime problem, particularly in the subway.\n\nBut the differences between Goetz's case and Penny's might be more important than their similarities. The archetypal subway fear is no longer the thief whose predatory self-interest shreds the social contract. Instead, as demonstrated by a series of high-profile subway crimes in recent years, today's subway boogeyman is characterized by opaque motivations and unpredictable actions. Jordan Neely, a talented Michael Jackson impersonator whose mental health struggles had made him familiar to city social services workers, was in the latter category: \"I'm ready to die,\" he reportedly told passengers before Penny subdued him. Witnesses say he was hostile and erratic but had not explicitly threatened anyone.\n\nThis shifting avatar of subway danger, from opportunistic criminal to mentally ill homeless man, is important to understanding both the shortsighted policies of Adams-who has bolstered the police force at the expense of other city services-and the unsympathetic case of Penny, whose prolonged use of force turned what might have been perceived as a helpful intervention into a tragedy for which he'll stand trial. It's hard to view the video of the final minutes of Penny's chokehold, as another passenger encourages him to loosen up, as anything short of vicious.\n\nThe blame falls more widely than that, of course: on the bystanders who did not intervene, on the city that failed to get Neely the help he needed, on an American system that has abandoned so many of our neighbors to the streets, where they are at increased risk of addiction, illness, crime, and death.\n\nYet in other ways the Neely case confounds many priors about the challenges of mentally ill homeless people who take shelter in the subway. For one thing, Neely was not a man forgotten by his city: He was well-known to both law enforcement and homeless services teams, who considered him among the city's residents most in need of help and most reluctant to accept it. A judge had even placed him in a residential drug treatment program, following an assault charge for punching a 67-year-old woman in the face, but he walked out after two weeks.\n\nThe fact that all those interactions never added up to a substantive change in Neely's trajectory may be typical of a city health system for the mentally ill that the New Yorker recently called a \" revolving door .\" It will also reignite the debate about conservatorship , the controversial procedure by which people can be held and medicated against their will. That, says Adams, is what should have happened to Neely. Civil liberties groups say the process is cruel and unconstitutional.\n\nBut the progressive policies to address the distress of the mentally ill homeless-robust homeless services, plentiful supportive housing, a mental health and drug treatment infrastructure that catches people before they fall-are not just dependent on political priorities. They'll take time. Jay Caspian Kang describes the contrast between this rehabilitative vision and the visceral distress of many homeless individuals as a \" mismatch of timelines ,\" one that has found resolution in knee-jerk pro-police policies. Many big-city Democrats, in particular Hispanic and Asian American progressives, are drifting rightward. They may share a prior generation's complaint about Democrats, perceived to have \"rewarded the articulation of moral purpose more than the achievement of practical good,\" in Daniel Patrick Moynihan's words.\n\nOn the other hand, Neely's death has once again demonstrated the bankrupt moral character of many conservatives, whose 50-year project to whittle down public services from education to drug treatment to housing aid has created the conditions for today's crisis (even in big, blue New York-consider, for example, the federal government's abandonment of the NYCHA projects, a rundown but vital social institution). More damning still is the right-wing worship of vigilante killers, in whose defense they have co-opted the term \"good Samaritan.\" As Jamelle Bouie writes , the term comes from the Gospel of Luke, and denotes one who shows mercy. Most of the Fox News-favored vigilante set-Daniel Perry in Austin, Kyle Rittenhouse in Kenosha-behaved in ways much less comprehensible than Daniel Penny. Certainly they did not show mercy. Penny has raised millions for his defense; Ron DeSantis shared a link to the fundraiser.\n\nIf New York politicians prevaricated over whether to condemn Penny's actions, it's surely in part because they see themselves as more likely to be a Penny-a strong person who deserves the benefit of the doubt-than a Neely, a man starving, thirsty, with no place to sleep and no one to rely on, whose behavior falls well outside the bounds of polite society.\n\nPerhaps it is also because they believe in the idea that New Yorkers are good, and if a dozen people watched a man's life expire in a chokehold, then there must have been a reason they let that happen. This idea, that social norms-and, everyone agrees, it was little more than norms that Neely was breaking that day on the F train, regardless of his past arrests-can be enforced by the watchful eyes of a crowd is not just a right-wing idea.\n\nIt's a version of what Jane Jacobs called \"eyes on the street\"-the idea that regular people, not police, create safety and sometimes even enforce the rules. But the story Jacobs tells to explain the theory is a weird one: A man downstairs from her apartment is in a \"suppressed struggle\" to get a young girl to walk with him, but she won't move. Neighbors start to watch. \"The man did not know it, but he was surrounded,\" Jacobs writes. \"Nobody was going to allow a little girl to be dragged off, even if nobody knew who she was.\"\n\nI've found myself thinking of this story from time to time , because what comes next, in Jacobs' telling, is legitimately shocking. \"I am sorry-purely sorry for dramatic purposes-to have to report that the little girl turned out to be the man's daughter.\" Suddenly, the story changes: This is a story of nosy neighbors gone wrong. It's a dark story, one that should make us question-not reinforce-our desire to take the law into our own hands.\n\nI thought again of Jacobs' example after Neely's death, and of the hopeful idea that there might be recourse to citizens' own instincts in our moment of great distrust of the police. It's not so. Not only are bystanders ill-equipped to interject with people in the throes of our threefold epidemics of mental illness, drug addiction, and gun violence. Not only is the entire concept tainted by racism and prejudice, which determine who counts as a threat and who as an eccentric. But also, now that everything's on camera, we have to ask how many stories that we told ourselves about a well-meaning intervention weren't such good stories after all. Without a video of the final moments of their struggle, I'm sure, subway riders would have remembered the interaction between Penny and Neely differently. We're not good Samaritans now, and maybe we never were.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "I Was in the Military. The Marine Who Killed Jordan Neely Sure Ignored His Training.\n\nOn Monday, Jordan Neely, an unarmed 30-year-old homeless man with a long history of mental illness, yelled at subway riders on the northbound F train in New York City. A 24-year-old United States Marine Corps veteran intervened, placing Neely in a chokehold for several minutes. By the time the train pulled into the Broadway-Lafayette station beneath Manhattan's hip NoHo neighborhood, Neely was unconscious. He was transported to Lenox Hill Hospital where he was pronounced dead. The incident was ruled a homicide .\n\nThe details are still coming out, and it is impossible to comment substantively on what happened, though that isn't stopping hordes of pundits from trying. The story has dominated headlines this week, animating arguments from those horrified by the callous killing of an unarmed man, those who see racial motivations at play (Neely was Black, the veteran who choked him is white), and those who see a justified attempt to respond to a city in the midst of a perceived crisis brought on by soaring crime (though the city's actual crime picture is more complicated ), homelessness, and mental illness in the wake of the pandemic.\n\nBut what troubles me is that the veteran status of the assailant who choked Neely is front and center in some of the most disturbing commentary from those on the political right, ranging from professional provocateur Mike Cernovich to less colorful yet relatively popular conservative pundits like writer Scott Greer , the Daily Wire's Megan Basham , and podcaster/Federalist writer Inez Stepman . The man who fought Neely could be identified as \"a man,\" \"a bystander,\" or, charitably, \"a concerned citizen.\" He is not.\n\nIn many tweets and news headlines , he is identified as \"the Marine\" who \"recognized this guy as a dangerous menace\" or \" A former Marine\" who \"intervened vs a subway psycho\" or \" a brave Marine who acted in his & others' defense. \"\n\nIt is this man's \"Marineness,\" his status as a military veteran, that is being singled out for relevance, as if he could have acted no other way, and as if it is the training and culture of service members to choke unarmed men into unconsciousness.\n\nThis is not true.\n\nIn fact, the use of force possibly out of proportion to a threat, creating a media firestorm that casts discredit on the person applying that force, is the polar opposite of how I was trained and antithetical to the culture in which I served as a military member, as a private military contractor, and as an armed intelligence officer serving with the Defense Intelligence Agency in Iraq.\n\nI can't speak to why this man intervened and choked Neely. But I do know this: Neither the military nor any of the vast network of PMC firms or paramilitary federal agencies that conduct operations side-by-side with it taught this man to choke an unarmed civilian into unconsciousness, unless the military I served in has radically transformed since my discharge in 2020.\n\nThe Rules of Engagement I was taught and was made to memorize rigidly emphasized the importance of due care when using force, even in a war zone . I was endlessly reminded that my actions had to be \"proportional to the provocation\" and \"designed to limit the scope and intensity of the conflict.\" Both at private training at \" the Crucible \" and on government military bases, when I qualified to use any small arms, we repeated the same exercise: Paper targets were run out before us, bladed sideways. Suddenly, they would pivot, showing images of either combatants or civilians. \"Look at their hands,\" our instructors warned us again and again; \"don't look at their faces.\" Because it was their hands that would be holding a gun or a detonator ... or a camera, a newspaper, or a bottle of water-not a threat, even when the image showed that the civilian was cocking an arm to throw it at us.\n\nWe had just seconds to a make a decision to pull the trigger or hold fire, and if we put a single bullet through the chest or head of a journalist with a microphone that at a glance certainly looked like a weapon, we failed the course and were sent home. Ditto for the Firearms Training Simulator, a video-based system that had us firing air-pressure-loaded cartridges at video screens, where even a single hit on a civilian would be the end of the line.\n\nJust after my first spin in Iraq, Gen. David Petraeus co-authored the new manual for the counterinsurgency age, wherein military members would routinely find themselves in situations much like that on the F train on Monday afternoon. In this new world, someone trained to use professional violence would find themselves having to make a split-second decision when encountering a civilian in obvious crisis. The COIN manual is widely criticized, but it set the tone for proportionality in the post-War on Terror period, and it is unambiguous in its instruction:\n\nThe principle of proportionality requires that the anticipated loss of life and damage to property incidental to attacks must not be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage expected to be gained. Proportionality and discrimination require combatants not only to minimize the harm to noncombatants but also to make positive commitments to\n\n·    Preserve noncombatant lives by limiting the damage they do.\n\n·    Assume additional risk to minimize potential harm.\n\nThe abuses of American military personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan are well documented. And indeed, manuals and formal doctrine do not always match institutional culture. But I can tell you from my personal experience that these horrible incidents are exceptions. When it comes to proportionality and the strict forbidding of excessive force against civilians, the vast majority of people in the military follow the rules.\n\nPerhaps the best example of this was the outpouring of testimony by fellow U.S. Navy SEALs of Alpha Platoon, SEAL Team 7, against their rogue colleague, Special Operations Chief Eddie Gallagher, who was convicted of posing for a photograph with a corpse in 2019. But despite the details of that conviction, Gallagher's brother SEALs at times tearfully described him shooting civilians and stabbing a captive to death. The bond between special operators cannot be overstated; to bear witness against one of your own speaks volumes about the immensity of Gallagher's violation of military cultural norms. When Trump pardoned Gallagher, the Navy made an effort to remove him from the SEALs anyway (though the effort was eventually abandoned ), further underscoring the seriousness of what Gallagher had done from a military cultural perspective.\n\nCarl von Clausewitz, the 19 th -century strategist whose thinking underpins much of American and global military culture, famously wrote that \"war is a continuation of politics by other means.\" It is in part a nod to the military's pivotal noncombat role, and indicates that warfighters are often unintended diplomats and ambassadors for their nation's policy. At DIA (where American military attachés are trained), we were constantly reminded that every time we put on a uniform or spoke of our veteran status, we represented the country, whether we liked it or not. The saying went, \"We are all attachés.\"\n\nIn all my training, I was never taught to use a chokehold on an unarmed opponent. But the military is vast and combative training varies between services and even units. It is possible that the man who killed Jordan Neely used skills he acquired in the military.\n\nBut where he acquired the capacity doesn't matter. The way he acted is not the way armed service members are trained to act, and anyone claiming that his status as a Marine indicates a kind of professionalism either doesn't know what they're talking about or is deliberately obfuscating what it means to have military training in interacting with civilians under duress. The public discourse implying that his actions were in any way in accord with the doctrine and culture of the military-and the legion of institutions, public and private, whose armed members support its mission at home and around the world-is absolutely false.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Jordan Neely's Hometown Failed Him\n\nIf Americans were hoping that two of the country's most prominent politicians would make strong, thoughtful, empathetic statements and actions in response to Jordan Neely's horrific killing in New York City on Wednesday afternoon, they were ultimately left disappointed-and more than a bit furious .\n\nShortly after Neely was suffocated to death on the subway, cellphone footage of the encounter went viral, publicizing how a white passenger, identified in many news outlets as a Marine, placed the unhoused Black subway performer in a fatal chokehold, with the assistance of riders who restrained Neely's arms. The cameraman told the New York Times that Neely had boarded the train yelling that he lacked food and was \"fed up\": \"I don't mind going to jail and getting life in prison. I'm ready to die.\" The cellphone holder further noted that Neely \"had not assaulted anyone\"; police sources told the New York Daily News that he had thrown bits of garbage at some passengers, which provoked an argument with the Marine.\n\nWhatever one makes of these reports, it shouldn't be difficult to say that the 30-year-old Neely obviously did not deserve to die , and that a nearly 15-minute-long chokehold involving multiple assailants was an alarming overreaction to his cries of distress. But New York's most powerful officials couldn't even clear that bar.\n\nMayor Eric Adams , who has been touted as the future of the national Democratic Party, simply proclaimed that \"any loss of life is tragic\" and that, while he'd \"refrain from commenting further,\" he understood that \"there were serious mental health issues at play here\" and boasted that his \"administration has made record investments in providing care to those who need it.\" Later, when CNN Primetime 's Abby D. Phillip asked him whether such acts of \"vigilantism\" are permissible, Adams further demurred: \"We cannot just blanketly say what a passenger should or should not do on a situation like that.\" He was more aggressive in responding to city Comptroller Brad Lander's statement that \"we must not become a city where a mentally ill human being can be choked to death by a vigilante without consequence\"-claiming the tweet was an \"irresponsible\" means of \"interfering\" with the Manhattan district attorney's ongoing investigation.\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul hardly did better in her initial declaration that \"there are consequences for behavior.\" It wasn't until Thursday afternoon that Hochul clarified she meant that the killer should face consequences, although she hesitated to deem the Marine a \" vigilante .\" Neither Adams nor Hochul mentioned the fact that the city's medical examiner determined Neely's death to be a homicide on Wednesday itself. And they both seemed happy to talk up large investments toward \"mental health,\" while neglecting to explain just what kinds of services they were funding, or what those would do to prevent another homicide of this nature.\n\nPerhaps that's because they have both proposed sweeping cuts to New York social services.\n\nBoth Hochul and Adams finalized their budget proposals only recently, following lengthy delays and controversies , so actually, the public can see for itself whether they're serious about mental health investments. When Eric Adams presented his desired budget back in January, local outlet Hell Gate reported at the time that the proposed municipal workforce cuts for his already-understaffed administration would mean that \"agencies like the Department of Transportation are far less capable of creating safer streets, and the Human Resources Administration is less able to process food stamps quickly or find more permanent housing to get families out of the City's shelter system.\"\n\nNot that any cuts applied to the amply funded police corps, of course-in fact, by April, Adams had reached a deal with NYC's biggest police union to grant annual raises locked in for eight years (and retroactive to 2017) that would total over $5 billion, adding even more to the cop coffers. These are the same police forces who've proved time and again to be ineffectual at best (and trigger-happy at worst) when it comes to addressing New Yorkers' mental health. After all, New York's finest weren't there to help Neely, but their own history of mishandling mental health emergencies provides no confidence they could've de-escalated the situation and saved Neely's life. (Should you point this out, Adams might be cool with putting you on a police-response blacklist .)\n\nThe mayor did back down on his early demands to cut funding to libraries and city-backed cultural services, while also maintaining current levels of public school funding (although he'd already slashed education spending in last year's budget). Yet, Adams demanded across-the-board agency funding cuts, including for the Homeless Services and Youth and Community Development departments. And while he touted the continued funding of a pilot program that dispatches licensed professionals instead of cops to respond to 911 calls for mental health crises, he offered no solution to the fact that the large majority of these calls are still routed directly to the NYPD . Throughout the past year, Adams proved more than willing to dispatch law enforcement squads against unhoused and mentally ill New Yorkers, whether to forcefully clear out makeshift encampments or involuntarily detain \"those who are suffering from mental illness.\" That punitive logic underlies his budget: While there are a few million-dollar disbursements delegated for \"Deepening Resources for New Yorkers Facing Mental Health Challenges,\" including telehealth services and peer-support clubhouses, there's far more money offered to the places that could lock them up, to the tune of $11 billion.\n\nAs for Gov. Kathy Hochul, her $229 billion state budget carries some welcome provisions-boosts to health care and public transit-but falls far short of what New Yorkers need in terms of housing , caregiving services , minimum wage boosts, assistance for migrants , and protections for tenants facing surging rents, housing and shelter shortages, and impatient landlords. There's an additional emphasis on law enforcement as an all-around solution: increasing police presence on the subways , sending the National Guard to oversee homeless shelters , empowering judges to detain residents accused of crimes without hope for bail. The $1 billion mental-health package does address some urgent issues by increasing psychiatric treatment capacity and supportive housing. What remains to be seen is just how Hochul will implement her proffered solutions. Her past efforts with Eric Adams to tackle subway safety took a harsh approach when it came to monitoring unhoused subway passengers, forcing them into underresourced facilities , expanding outpatient services , and stuffing even more cops onto the trains. All that as they've made NYC's public spaces more hostile to unhoused New Yorkers by taking away seating and adding spikes to ledges . Same as it ever was: The armed public servants get more than what they need, the rest don't get nearly enough, and it doesn't end well for anybody, especially those unable to access affordable long-term housing, food supplies, or adequate health care.\n\nJordan Neely's hometown failed him-it couldn't even provide him a stable home and life. The reportedly autistic young entertainer , whose spot-on Michael Jackson impressions often went viral and brought joy to countless New Yorkers for over a decade, was denied a stable life by employers who didn't understand his condition and cops who arrested him dozens of times instead of pointing him to the help he could have used. When New York's elected officials continue to embrace aggression against the unhoused , brutal stances on criminal justice , and public-service austerity, other New Yorkers follow by choosing cruelty over compassion. And when they waffle on why a houseless person shouldn't be killed for complaining about his circumstances, they only pave the way for more deaths to come. Adams and Hochul may say they're doing what they can for New Yorkers' mental health. Their actions clearly don't back that up.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Who is Jordan Neely, the man killed in NYC subway chokehold death?\n\nDaniel Penny is heading to trial for Neely's death.\n\nThe contentious debate surrounding New York City's struggle to address homelessness and mental illness has clouded the memory of who Jordan Neely was.\n\nAs the trial for his alleged killer, Daniel Penny gets underway Monday with jury selection, those who knew Neely remembered him for breaking out into dance and singing along with the hits on the radio as a joyous child.\n\nHe's remembered as a teen who struggled to cope with the loss of his best friend -- his mother -- who was violently murdered.\n\nHe's remembered for entertaining commuters, tourists, and locals alike with moonwalks and side glides that rivaled Michael Jackson on the NYC subways.\n\nNeely's family had imagined a great future ahead for him: \"I said, 'Jordan, one day you might be famous,\" Neely's great aunt Mildred Mahazu told ABC News. \"And he said, 'Really, Aunt Mildred?'\"\n\nBut by the age of 30, Neely was homeless and appeared to be experiencing a mental illness crisis when he was killed after a subway passenger named Daniel Penny held him in a six-minute-long chokehold, officials said.\n\nPenny, a former Marine, was charged with second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide in Neely's death. He pleaded not guilty , arguing that Neely had been threatening to passengers on the train. Other witnesses reportedly told police that Neely had been yelling and harassing passengers.\n\nNeely's death sparked citywide protests, demanding answers about city resources after reports showed dozens of interactions between Neely and both police and homeless services in the years leading up to his death.\n\nTwo of Neely's loved ones reflected on the life and death in interviews with ABC News ahead of Penny's trial.\n\nNeely's childhood was rocky, according to Mahazu. He and his mother, Christie Neely, were housing insecure -- sometimes living in homeless shelters -- and his mother's tumultuous relationship with her boyfriend filled some days with arguments. But amid the instability, Neely's relationship with his mother blossomed.\n\nThe two were inseparable. Everywhere Christie went, Neely followed: \"You see one, you see the other,\" Mahazu said.\n\nBefore heading off to school each morning, Neely would knock at his mother's door, wake her up and tell her goodbye.\n\nOn April 3, 2007, then-14-year-old Neely tried to go about his routine and say goodbye to his mother before school, but her boyfriend, Shawn Southerland, had blocked him from entering their bedroom, according to local news outlet NJ.com .\n\nIt was later discovered that Christie had been violently murdered at the hands of now-convicted-murderer Southerland and he dumped her body in a suitcase on a Bronx parkway, according to local reports.\n\nMahazu believes the tragedy changed the trajectory of Neely's life. He was a teen, heartbroken and unable to grasp the loss.\n\nMahazu said she would catch Neely sitting with a far-off look in his eye, sometimes rocking side to side. She'd ask him what was wrong and recalled him once saying, \"I miss my mama. I want my mama.\"\n\n\"They loved each other dearly. They were crazy about each other,\" Mahazu said. \"From there on, he started going down, down, down, because he and his mother were extremely close, very close,\" Mahazu said.\n\nIn the years after her death, Neely found solace in his love of dancing and made the NYC MTA subway system his stage, busking for money as a Michael Jackson impersonator.\n\nNew Yorker Moses Harper first remembers meeting Neely in August 2009, when she followed the sound of Michael Jackson's greatest hits in the halls of the Times Square subway station.\n\nHarper, a Michael Jackson tribute artist herself, remembers finding Neely mid-performance, surrounded by a crowd of tourists clapping to the rhythm and following Neely's encouragement to dance alongside him.\n\nNeely spotted and called on Harper, who was watching from the back of the crowd: \"Show me something. Come on. Don't be scared,\" Harper recalls that he yelled out to her. Armed with a single glove in her back pocket on her way home from her dance studio, she surprised Neely with Jackson moves of her own.\n\n\"When it was all over, I gave him his hat back and he hugged me. He's like, 'You got to teach me, you got to show me.' And I did,\" said Harper.\n\nIt was the beginning of a friendship that would last years: \"We wouldn't just talk about Michael Jackson and dancing. We talked about other things, you know, and I missed that. I missed that. That was my little brother.\"\n\nShe remembers when Neely first told her about his mother: \"What was the one person in the world that really got him. And I had never seen him that sad.\"\n\nDuring those years, it was hard for Mahazu to keep track of him riding through the subway system. But he'd come and visit her often, and she'd fix up a big country dinner, and they'd sit and talk over their meal.\n\nOne day, when Harper was riding the D train into the Bronx, she spotted Neely walking through the train cars. She recalled him looking noticeably homeless and asking for food or money.\n\nShe said his face lit up when he saw her, but he kept walking past, which Harper speculates was because of embarrassment. Harper said she stopped him, escorted him off the train, hugged him and asked him what was going on.\n\nShe bought him Chinese food, and something to drink, gave him cash and one of the shirts she had layered on.\n\n\"I said, 'Listen to me: When you're ready to get clean, this is where I am. Come and see me. I want you to come see me,'\" she said. \"It wasn't what he needed at the time. And it just wasn't. It just wasn't enough. I don't know. I don't know.\"\n\nA community of Michael Jackson fans and tribute artists in NYC continued to search for Neely over the years after he stopped arriving at events and meetups. But local health officials and law enforcement said they knew him well.\n\nAccording to police sources, Neely had a documented mental health history and had been previously arrested for several incidents, including assault, disorderly conduct and fare evasion.\n\nThe New York Times reported that Neely was on a list of the top 50 sheltered or homeless \"high need individuals\" to be reached by NYC outreach workers at the time of his death. According to New York Magazine , he bounced around shelters that have been criticized for their poor conditions and had also been hospitalized several times.\n\nThe Department of Social Services, the New York City Department of Health & Mental Hygiene and the NYPD declined to comment further on Neely's case and why the efforts to contact or address Neely's needs did not work.\n\nThose who knew Neely have demanded answers.\n\n\"If you had had the background that Jordan nearly had, how would you fare in life? Where would you be? Where would your mental state be if you had the same kind of struggles that he had?\" Harper said. \"How would you be doing right now? Do you think that you would deserve the same? The same treatment that he received on the last day of his life? \"\n\nThe Adams administration criticized \"the system\" Jordan went through: \"That was a real textbook case of how if you ignore the problem over and over and over again, it could turn out to be a tragic outcome.\"\n\nAdams condemned Neely's killing in the days following the death: \"Jordan Neely did not deserve to die,\" Adams said in prepared remarks amid growing calls for Penny's arrest. He was not immediately arrested following Neely's death.\n\n\"Jordan Neely's life mattered. He was suffering from severe mental illness, but that was not the cause of his death. His death is a tragedy that never should have happened,\" the mayor said, referring to Neely as \"a Black man like me.\"\n\nIn recent years, homelessness in New York City has reached the highest levels since the Great Depression, according to city officials .\n\nNeely's death took place following an announcement from New York City Mayor Eric Adams that individuals who appear \"to be mentally ill\" and \"a danger to themselves\" may be taken into custody involuntarily for psychiatric evaluations if they may be of harm, even if they are not considered to be an imminent threat to the public. The city has yet to release data about the outcomes of these programs and their effectiveness.\n\nHowever, in a recent Department of Homeless Services announcement, city officials say 7,800 New Yorkers have been connected to shelter and 640 of them have been connected to permanent affordable housing since the city began an intensified approach to homelessness.\n\n\"They failed Jordan, they fail so many of the vulnerable members of a vulnerable population,\" said Harper, calling for systemic reforms to fix the criminal justice and health care systems.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Defense attempts to paint Daniel Penny as a savior in closing arguments of his trial\n\nJordan Neely was homeless at the time of his death.\n\nClosing arguments began Monday in the trial of Daniel Penny over the May 2023 subway chokehold death of Jordan Neely.\n\nPenny, a 25-year-old former Marine, put Neely, a 30-year-old homeless man, in a six-minute-long chokehold after Neely boarded a subway car acting erratically, according to police. Neely entered a subway car on an uptown F train at the Second Avenue stop, and was described by witnesses as yelling and moving erratically when Penny put Neely in a chokehold, officials said.\n\nPenny is charged with manslaughter and negligent homicide in Neely's death. He pleaded not guilty.\n\nHe faces up to 15 years in prison if he's convicted of manslaughter. There is no minimum sentence.\n\nThe proceedings began late so the defense could fix two audio exhibits. The prosecutors alleged the defense had \"willy nilly edited\" the audio and \"taken out what they don't like.\" Assistant District Attorney Dafna Yoran said it would be misleading for the jury to hear an edited excerpt.\n\nThe judge agreed, and the defense recut the exhibits, so jurors were clear they were hearing edited portions.\n\nThe delay means the jury will likely not begin deliberations until Tuesday. The People's closing will continue on Tuesday before the judge's hour-long instructions and deliberations.\n\nTo convict Penny of manslaughter the jury must be convinced Penny acted recklessly and grossly deviated from how a reasonable person would behave knowing the risk his conduct posed.\n\n\"No one had to die on May 1, 2023,\" a prosecutor said Monday during her closing argument in the Daniel Penny trial.\n\nThe prosecutor, Dafna Yoran, conceded Jordan Neely entered the subway car in an \"extremely threatening manner\" but she argued \"so much less than deadly physical force would have done the job of protecting the passengers from Mr. Neely.\"\n\nYoran has said Penny's initial intentions were \"laudable,\" but he held on too long: \"Daniel Penny, the defendant, could have easily restrained Jordan Neely without choking him to death,\" Yoran said in her closing argument.\n\nYoran called Neely's death \"so tragically unnecessary,\" and, in her closing argument, she challenged the defense assertion that Jordan Neely posed a lingering threat to passengers even after he had been subdued on the subway floor for several minutes.\n\n\"Everyone the defendant wanted to protect had already left the train,\" Yoran said. \"There is no justification for deadly physical force at this point.\"\n\nDefense attorney Steve Raiser said during his summation that Penny had no choice but to keep hold of Neely because Neely was struggling to get free. Yoran said it did not justify Penny's action.\n\n\"We know why Mr. Neely is struggling. He's struggling to breathe,\" Yoran said. \"Is a chokehold the only way the defendant could have held onto Mr. Neely at this point?\"\n\nIf Penny intended to render Neely unconscious using a blood choke he learned in the Marine Corps, Yoran said Neely should have passed out after 15 seconds. When Neely did not pass out in that time, Penny should have known he was doing the maneuver incorrectly and continuing it could be fatal, she said.\n\n\"There's no accident here,\" Yoran said. \"The defendant was all too aware of what the consequences could be.\"\n\nShe also questioned Penny's actions after he released the chokehold, pointing to a video that showed him walking away from Neely to retrieve his hat from beneath a subway bench.\n\n\"The defendant clearly knows Mr. Neely is not waking up any time soon,\" Yoran said. \"He knows that he has eliminated the threat.\"\n\nWhen an officer asked Penny what happened, Penny responded \"I put him out,\" the video shows. \"He shows no surprise or dismay,\" Yoran argued.\n\nThree bystanders told Penny to stop applying a chokehold on Neely but Penny did not listen, a prosecutor said during summations.\n\n\"The defendant was warned three times, at least, and he ignored those warnings,\" prosecutor Dafna Yoran said. \"He's consciously disregarding the risk.\"\n\nWhile a bystander shook Neely, checked for a pulse and tried to put him into a recovery position, Yoran pointed out that Penny stood there doing nothing, as depicted on video.\n\n\"He just didn't recognize that Jordan Neely too was a person,\" Yoran said. \"He simply saw him as a threat to be eliminated.\"\n\nDuring the trial, Penny's mother and sister testified to his character but Yoran said Penny \"seems to have a real blind spot\" when it came to showing compassion for Neely, who he described on a police interrogation video as \"doing what crackheads do.\"\n\nThe prosecutor said Penny showed no remorse, no regret and no self-reflection: \"We have all spoken dismissively at some point about people like Jordan Neely,\" Yoran said. \"When the defendant is talking like this about Mr. Neely he knows he very likely killed him.\"\n\nThe defense attorney, Steven Raiser, asked jurors in closing arguments to imagine they were on the train that day, conjuring the scene with sound effects of closing doors, a train pulling out of a station and police body camera footage of passengers saying Neely \"scared the living daylights out of everybody.\"\n\nA \"violent and desperate\" Jordan Neely entered the uptown F train on May 1, 2023, \"filled with rage and not afraid of any consequences,\" causing passengers to be \"frozen with fear\" before Daniel Penny \"acted to save those people,\" a defense attorney said Monday during closing arguments at Penny's manslaughter and negligent homicide trial.\n\nIn its summation, the defense challenged the prosecution's assertion that Penny held Neely in a chokehold for \"way too long,\" and did not let go for almost six minutes. Raiser said Penny did not intend to kill Neely but did not let go because Neely was fighting back.\n\n\"Of course, he didn't. He had to remain in place out of fear that Neely would break free,\" Raiser said.\n\nThe city's medical examiner concluded Penny's chokehold killed Neely. The defense argued Neely died from a genetic condition and the synthetic marijuana found in his system.\n\nDefense attorney Steve Raiser argued that Penny \"was not applying a textbook Marine blood choke because his purpose was not to render Mr. Neely unconscious,\" Raiser said. Raiser said Penny applied a chokehold \"in a less aggressive manner,\" reflecting his character.\n\n\"He could have squeezed Mr. Neely to unconsciousness,\" Raiser said. \"Instead, he laid with him on the dirty subway floor while the smell of uncleanliness...and feces enveloped him.\"\n\nThe defense summation included an image of the two men on the subway floor: \"It's basic human instinct to grab at the arm choking you. You don't see that here because Danny's not choking him,\" Raiser said.\n\nRaiser argued Penny was not applying pressure on Neely's neck in the hold's final 51 seconds and the whole case represented a rush to judgment: \"This was not a chokehold death,\" Raiser said. \"They failed to prove their case, period.\"\n\nDuring the trial, prosecutors argued that Penny went \"way too far,\" holding Neely around the neck for nearly six minutes, past the point when he posed a threat. About 30 seconds after Penny put Neely in the chokehold, the train arrived at the next station and many passengers left the train car, according to court filings.\n\nFootage of the interaction between Penny and Neely, which began about 2 minutes after the incident started, captures Penny holding Neely for about 4 minutes and 57 seconds on a relatively empty train with a couple of passengers nearby.\n\nProsecutors argue that Penny should have known that his minutes-long chokehold was turning fatal.\n\nWitness accounts of Neely's behavior that day differ.\n\nIn court filings, some passengers described their fear. One passenger said they \"have encountered many things, but nothing that put fear into me like that.\" Another said Neely was making \"half-lunge movements\" and coming within a \"half a foot of people,\" according to court filings.\n\nOther passengers on the train that day said they didn't feel threatened -- one \"wasn't really worried about what was going on\" and another called it \"like another day typically in New York. That's what I'm used to seeing. I wasn't really looking at it if I was going to be threatened or anything to that nature, but it was a little different because, you know, you don't really hear anybody saying anything like that.\"\n\nRead the key takeaways presented to the jury during the weekslong trial here .\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

If I just would have let go...\"\n\nWhen asked why he felt vulnerable, Penny explained, \"If I just let him go, I'm on my back. Now he can just turn around and start doing what he said to me.\"\n\n\"I'll take a million court appearances and people calling me names and people hating me, just to keep one of those people from getting hurt or killed,\" Penny said in a preview clip that aired Tuesday.\n\nPenny, a 26-year-old former Marine, put Neely, a 30-year-old homeless man, in a minuteslong chokehold after Neely boarded a subway car acting erratically in May 2023, according to officials. Neely entered a subway car on an uptown F train at the Second Avenue stop, and was described by witnesses as yelling and moving erratically when Penny put Neely in a chokehold, officials said.\n\nThe case captured national attention, putting a spotlight on homelessness, severe mental illness, safety, and race.\n\nThe jury deliberated for more than 24 hours across five days before reaching the verdict.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg thanked the jury and vowed to respect their verdict: \"The jury carefully deliberated for four days.

Simply put, this is unacceptable, and everyone, no matter your opinion on this case, should condemn it,\" he said.\n\nThe courtroom broke out in a mix of cheers and jeers as soon as the verdict was read early Monday.\n\nNeely's father Andre Zachery, cursed in anger shortly after the verdict and was forcibly removed from the courtroom by a court officer. Others in the gallery shouted, and one woman broke down in tears.\n\nPenny, walking out of the courtroom, flashed a brief smile before returning to his stone-faced demeanor. His lawyers embraced one another while seated at counsel table.\n\nZachery criticized the jury's verdict and mourned his son outside the courthouse in a press conference following the announcement.\n\n\"I just want to say I miss my son. My son didn't have to go through this. I didn't have to go through this either. It hurts. It really, really hurts,\" he said, standing alongside supporters and activists. \"I had enough of this, the system is rigged.\"\n\nAs he spoke, protestors chanted \"Say his name - Jordan Neely\" and \"No justice, no peace.\"\n\nPolice broke up the crowd of protestors as the press conference continued.\n\nZachery's attorney expressed optimism that Neely's family will still get justice through a civil lawsuit against Daniel Penny.\n\n\"I promised this family justice - we are still going to do that,\" said Donte Mills. \"The district attorney did a good job, but the jury in this case let us down.\"\n\nEric Garner's mother Gwen Carr - whose son was killed by a NYPD officer who placed him in a chokehold - criticized Neely's death as a history repeating itself.\n\n\"No one deserves to be choked,\" she said. \"You know, we're in that courtroom, and people are cheering for the verdict.\"\n\nThe jury in the Penny trial continued deliberations Monday over whether he committed criminally negligent homicide when he placed Neely in a chokehold on a subway car last year, after the jury was deadlocked on the more serious charge of manslaughter last week.\n\nAt the request of prosecutors on Friday, Judge Maxwell Wiley dismissed the second-degree manslaughter charge - which carried a maximum 15-year sentence - and directed the jury to turn to the lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide, which has a four-year maximum sentence. Neither crime has a minimum sentence. Penny pleaded not guilty to both charges.\n\n\"What that means is you are now free to consider count two. Whether that makes any difference or not, I have no idea,\" Wiley said before sending the jury home for the weekend.\n\nProsecutors allege that Penny killed Neely, a homeless man who had previously been a Michael Jackson impersonator, when he placed him in a six-minute-long chokehold on a subway car, holding Neely for at least 51 seconds after his body went limp. Assistant district attorney Dafna Yoran argued Penny knew his actions could kill Neely but continued to hold him in a chokehold for \"way too long\" and \"didn't recognize his humanity.\"\n\nThe city's medical examiner concluded Penny's chokehold killed Neely. The defense argued Neely died from a genetic condition and the synthetic marijuana found in his system.\n\nDefense attorney Steven Raiser told jurors that Penny \"acted to save\" subway passengers from a \"violent and desperate\" Neely, who was acting erratically and \"scared the living daylights out of everybody.\" Raiser argued that Neely was fighting back, and Penny continued to hold on because he feared he would break free, though he didn't intend to kill Neely.\n\nWiley denied a new motion for a mistrial made Monday morning by Penny's defense lawyers, who argued that the dismissal of the manslaughter charge would influence the jury's verdict.\n\n\"There is no way to cure the legal error that we believe very strongly happened on Friday, and we are renewing our motion for a mistrial on the remaining count two,\" said Thomas Kenniff, who said the dismissal could result in a \"coercive verdict.\"\n\nWiley disagreed, promptly denying the motion like he did on Friday when the defense unsuccessfully argued twice for a mistrial.\n\nTo prevent the possibility of influencing the jury, Wiley proposed issuing a new instruction to the jury explicitly stating that the court is \"not directing you to any particular verdict.\"\n\nWiley also offered to give the jury an instruction to ignore chants from protesters outside the courthouse - including \"Justice for Jordan Neely,\" \"Daniel Penny subway stranger\" and \"If we don't get no justice, they don't get no peace\" - which the defense team declined because it might bring more attention to the chants.\n\nFor now, the chants have quieted down, and they are no longer audible in court. If they resume, Judge Wiley said he would consider delivering an instruction or moving the jury to another deliberation room.\n\nLast week, the jury spent more than 23 hours across four days deliberating whether Penny, a 26-year-old former Marine and architecture student, committed second degree manslaughter before repeatedly signaling that they could not reach a unanimous verdict.\n\nWiley ultimately granted prosecutors' request to dismiss the first count while Penny's defense attorneys unsuccessfully pushed for a mistrial, arguing that continued deliberations could lead to a \"coercive or a compromised verdict\" by \"elbowing\" jurors to convict on the lesser charge.\n\nManslaughter would have required proving that Penny acted recklessly and grossly deviated from how a reasonable person would behave, while proving criminally negligent homicide requires the jury to be convinced that Penny engaged in \"blameworthy conduct\" that he did not consider would lead to the risk of death.\n\nOutside court, protesters and counter protesters have assembled, with \"say his name\" chants slightly audible in the 13th floor courtroom. As Penny entered the courthouse this morning, he was met with competing chants of \"murderer\" and \"not guilty.\"\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated to reflect Penny's correct age.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Witnesses described Neely yelling and moving erratically, with Penny's attorneys calling Neely \"insanely threatening\" when Penny put Neely in a chokehold.\n\nThe city's medical examiner concluded Penny's chokehold killed Neely.\n\nHe was initially charged with both manslaughter and negligent homicide charges. He pleaded not guilty to both.\n\nSince getting the case on Tuesday, the jury has been deliberating for over 23 hours. On Friday, the jury sent two notes repeating that they could not come to a unanimous conclusion on the second-degree manslaughter count.\n\nWiley gave the jury an Allen charge, which refers to the jury instructions given to a hung jury that encourages them to continue deliberating despite the deadlock. He is giving the lawyers time to consider the next steps.\n\n\"Jury deliberations are not intended to be easy,\" Judge Wiley told the jury, instructing them that a future jury would be in no better position to reach a verdict than they would.\n\nPenny's lawyer, Kenniff, unsuccessfully asked for mistrial twice, arguing that the Allen Charge would be \"coercive.\"\n\n\"It would be a crazy result to have a hung jury just because they can't move on to the second count?\" prosecutor Dafna Yoran said. She also told Wiley that a new trial would \"ultimately [be] the case if they hang the case.\"\n\nThe jury on Friday also sent back a note requesting more information about the term \"reasonable person\" in their instructions.\n\n\"Ultimately, what a reasonable person is up to you to decide,\" Wiley told the jury in response to their note, referring them to a two-part test in jury instruction.\n\nTo convict Penny of manslaughter, the jury needed to be convinced Penny acted recklessly and grossly deviated from how a reasonable person would behave knowing the risk his conduct posed.\n\n\"Would a reasonable person have had the same honestly held belief as the defendant given the circumstances and what the defendant knew at that time?\" Wiley asked, referring to the second part of the test.\n\nBefore the jury entered the courtroom on Friday, Wiley noted how the \"reasonableness\" standard was established in People v. Goetz - another high-profile New York trial after Bernhard Goetz shot four teenagers on a New York subway in 1984 after they allegedly tried to rob him. A New York jury convicted Goetz for one count of carrying an unlicensed firearm but acquitted on the more severe charges, and the trial sparked a nationwide debate about race and crime that has echoed forty years later in Penny's case.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Daniel Penny's subway chokehold trial: The key takeaways\n\nClosing arguments are expected to begin Dec. 2.\n\nThe prosecution and defense are preparing for Monday's closing arguments in the Daniel Penny trial as it comes to a close after a break for the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nPenny put Jordan Neely, 30, a homeless man, in a fatal 6 minute-long chokehold after Neely boarded a subway car acting erratically.\n\nPenny, 25, is charged with manslaughter and negligent homicide in the May 2023 choking death of Neely on the New York City subway. He pleaded not guilty.\n\nHere are the key takeaways from the trial so far:\n\nProsecutors argue that Penny, a former Marine trained in martial arts, should have known that his chokehold maneuver was turning fatal, arguing that Penny held onto Neely \"for far too long\" -- more than 5 minutes after the train pulled into the station and passengers were able to exit.\n\nNeely entered a moderately crowded subway car on an uptown F train at the Second Avenue stop and began yelling and moving erratically, when Penny put Neely in a chokehold. Thirty seconds later, the train arrived at the next station and essentially all the passengers left the train car.\n\nFootage of the interaction between Penny and Neely, which began about 2 minutes after the incident started, captures Penny holding Neely for about 4 minutes and 57 seconds on a relatively empty train with a couple of passengers nearby.\n\n\"He was aware of the risk his actions would kill Mr. Neely and did it anyway,\" Assistant District Attorney Dafna Yoran said in her opening statements. \"Jordan Neely took his last breaths on the dirty floor of an uptown F train.\"\n\nProsecutors further argued that while Penny may be an \"honorable veteran\" and \"nice young man,\" he used too much force for too long and was reckless with Neely's life because \"he didn't recognize his humanity.\"\n\nShe later continued, \"Under the law, deadly physical force such as a chokehold is permitted only when it is absolutely necessary and for only as long as is absolutely necessary. And here, the defendant went way too far.\"\n\nThe second-degree manslaughter charge only requires prosecutors to prove Penny acted recklessly, not intentionally, according to prosecutors.\n\nDefense attorney Thomas Kenniff countered that Penny sought to protect passengers, claiming he was responding to Neely's \"unhinged rage.\"\n\n\"This is a case about a young man who did for others what we would want someone to do for us,\" Kenniff said. \"It doesn't make him a hero, but it doesn't make him a killer.\"\n\nPenny claims to have heard Neely say \"I will kill,\" said Kenniff, who has said there was no opportunity for his client to de-escalate or stop Neely from the harm he was threatening.\n\nBorrowing from \"a bit\" of martial arts training he received in the Marine Corps, Penny put Neely into a chokehold without intending to kill him, the defense said, but to hold him until police arrived.\n\n\"His conduct was consistent with someone who values human life and that's why he was trying to protect it so fiercely,\" the defense attorney said.\n\nKenniff insisted his client \"does not want to use any more force than is necessary,\" but Neely \"aggressively resisted\" while in Penny's grip. He said Penny thought Neely, who police say was unarmed, might have a weapon as he waited for police.\n\nJurors saw body camera video that had not yet been publicly released of Penny's initial encounter with police, more than 4 minutes after he let go of Neely.\n\nOn the first day of the trial, the jury saw the officer's body-worn camera footage that captured the attempts to save Neely and showed his lifeless body on the subway floor.\n\nWhen searched for weapons, the only thing officers found in Neely's pockets was a muffin. Nothing else was found in the jacket, Officer Teodoro Tejada confirmed.\n\nPenny is heard saying, \"I put him out,\" when the officer asked what happened . To prosecutors, the footage -- which had not been seen publicly until the trial -- is evidence Penny disregarded Neely's basic humanity.\n\nThe defense used Tejada's testimony to suggest to the jury Penny did not behave like a criminal by fleeing the scene.\n\n\"Did he appear cooperative?\" the lawyer asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" the officer replied.\n\n\"It didn't appear that he had anything to hide?\" Kenniff asked.\n\n\"No,\" Tejada said.\n\nIn a video taken by then-17-year-old high school student bystander Ivette Rosario, a witness can be heard calling out to Penny, \"He's dying...you need to let him go.\" Others are heard yelling on the clip to \"get the cops!\"\n\nRosario testified that she did not hear anyone say that Neely is \"dying\" at the time and it's not clear whether Penny heard it either.\n\nA Bronx man who helped Penny restrain Neely \"jumped in and tried to help\" so Penny could release his chokehold , according to the man's testimony.\n\nEric Gonzalez, who is seen in video footage holding Neely by the wrist, boarded the subway and noticed Penny holding down Neely \"with his legs around his waist and his arm around his neck.\" Gonzalez testified he did not know why Penny was restraining Neely but he heard people yelling to call for the police.\n\nGonzalez said he waved his hands in front of Penny's face to get his attention.\n\n\"I said, 'I will grab his hands so you can let go,'\" Gonzalez told the jury. \"Just giving him a different option to hold his arm -- well, to restrain him until the police came.\"\n\nProsecutors asked Gonzalez to clarify: \"If I held his arm down, he could let go of his neck,\" he said.\n\nGonzalez said he watched Neely's body go limp and let go of him before Penny did the same.\n\n\"I tried to shake Jordan Neely to get a response out of him, feel for a pulse, and then I walked away,\" Gonzalez said.\n\nDr. Cynthia Harris of the city's Chief Medical Examiner's Office conducted Neely's autopsy in 2023 and ruled Neely's death a homicide, with the cause of death as \"Compression of neck (chokehold).\"\n\nShe testified at the trial that \"the consensus was unanimous\" in the medical examiner's office that Neely had died from the chokehold, according to Associated Press reporting : \"There are no alternative reasonable explanations,\" she said.\n\nForensic pathologist Satish Chundru disputed that determination in his testimony in defense of Penny, according to the AP, arguing that Neely died from \"combined effects\" of his schizophrenia, synthetic marijuana, a blood condition and his efforts to struggle against Penny.\n\n\"In your opinion, did Mr. Penny choke Mr. Neely to death?\" defense lawyer Steven Raiser asked, according to AP.\n\n\"No,\" replied Chundru.\n\nProsecutors argued that Chundru's testimony departed from medical literature and his own opinion in similar cases, but Chundru testified that the cases were not comparable to this one, according to the AP.\n\nAccording to the AP , Joseph Caballer, the combat instructor who trained Penny, said that Penny was taught how to knock a person unconscious -- but that the technique could kill someone if held too long. He argued that someone performing the technique is supposed to let go when the person is rendered unconscious, and testified that Penny used the chokehold in an \"improper\" manner when asked by prosecutors.\n\nHowever, the defense claims Penny did not use a strong enough hold to kill Penny, the AP reports.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Daniel Penny set to stand trial in death of Jordan Neely\n\nPenny has pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nThe trial of Daniel Penny, the Marine veteran charged in the May 2023 choking death of a homeless man in a New York City subway car, is set to begin Monday with jury selection.\n\nThe trial is expected to last between four and six weeks, according to Judge Max Wiley.\n\nPenny, 25, has pleaded not guilty to the charges of second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide in connection with Jordan Neely's death.\n\nWiley denied Penny's bid to dismiss his involuntary manslaughter case in January.\n\nPenny put Neely, 30, in a fatal chokehold \"that lasted approximately 6 minutes and continued well past the point at which Mr. Neely had stopped purposeful movement,\" prosecutors with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office have said.\n\nPenny's attorneys have said that they were \"saddened at the loss of human life\" but that Penny saw \"a genuine threat and took action to protect the lives of others,\" arguing that Neely was \"insanely threatening\" to passengers aboard the F train in Manhattan.\n\nWitness accounts differ on Neely's behavior in the train, prosecutors say.\n\nThey note that many witnesses relayed that Neely expressed that he was homeless, hungry and thirsty, and most of the witnesses recount that Neely indicated a willingness to go to jail or prison.\n\nSome witnesses report that Neely threatened to hurt people on the train, while others did not report hearing those threats.\n\nSome witnesses told police that Neely was yelling and harassing passengers on the train; however, others have said though Neely had exhibited erratic behavior, he had not been threatening anyone in particular and had not become violent.\n\nSome passengers on the train that day said they didn't feel threatened -- one \"wasn't really worried about what was going on\" and another called it \"like another day typically in New York. That's what I'm used to seeing. I wasn't really looking at it if I was going to be threatened or anything to that nature, but it was a little different because, you know, you don't really hear anybody saying anything like that,\" according to court filings by the prosecution.\n\nOther passengers described their fear in court filings. One passenger said they \"have encountered many things, but nothing that put fear into me like that.\" Another said Neely was making \"half-lunge movements\" and coming within a \"half a foot of people.\"\n\nNeely, who was homeless at the time of his death, had a documented mental health history and a history of arrests, including alleged instances of disorderly conduct, fare evasion and assault, according to police sources.\n\nLess than 30 seconds after Penny allegedly put Neely into a chokehold, the train arrived at the Broadway-Lafayette Station: \"Passengers who had felt fearful on account of being trapped on the train were now free to exit the train. The defendant continued holding Mr. Neely around the neck,\" said prosecutor Joshua Steinglass in a court filing against Penny's dismissal request. Wiley denied all motions to suppress evidence on Oct. 4.\n\nIn a statement to ABC News, an attorney representing Neely's family said, \"This case is simple. Someone got on a train and was screaming so someone else choked them to death. Those two things do not and will never balance. There is no justification.\"\n\n\"Jordan had the right to take up his own space. He was allowed to be on that train and even to scream. He did not touch anyone. He was not a visitor on that train, in New York, or in this country,\" attorney Donte Mills said.\n\nFootage of the interaction, which began about 2 minutes after the incident started, captures Penny holding Neely for about 4 minutes and 57 seconds on a relatively empty train with a couple of male passengers nearby.\n\nProsecutors said that about 3 minutes and 10 seconds into the video, Neely ceases all purposeful movement.\n\n\"After that moment, Mr. Neely's movements are best described as 'twitching and the kind of agonal movement that you see around death,'\" the prosecutor said.\n\nThe defense argued Penny had no intent to kill, but Steinglass noted that the second-degree manslaughter charge only requires prosecutors to prove Penny acted recklessly, not intentionally.\n\n\"We are confident that a jury, aware of Danny's actions in putting aside his own safety to protect the lives of his fellow riders, will deliver a just verdict,\" said Penny's lawyers, Steven Raiser and Thomas Kenniff, after Penny's request to dismiss the charge was denied.\n\n\"Danny is grateful for the continued prayers and support through this difficult process.\"\n\nPenny has raised more than $3 million for his legal defense fund ahead of the trial.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Jordan Neely's dad says he's 'very hurt' by Daniel Penny's not guilty verdict\n\nHe spoke to ABC News' Linsey Davis following the verdict.\n\nThe jury in the trial of Daniel Penny found him not guilty of criminally negligent homicide in the May 2023 subway chokehold death of Jordan Neely on Monday.\n\nJury members deliberated for more than 24 hours across five days before reaching the verdict. Judge Maxwell Wiley on Dec. 6 dismissed a more serious second-degree manslaughter charge at the request of prosecutors after jurors said they were deadlocked.\n\nNeely's father, Andre Zachery, was present in the courtroom when the verdict came in, and he was forcibly removed by a court officer after cursing in anger.\n\nHe also filed a civil lawsuit against Penny last week, requesting damages \"in such sum as a jury may find reasonable, fair, and just.\"\n\nZachery and his lawyer, Donte Mills, spoke to ABC News' Linsey Davis after Monday's verdict was issued.\n\nABC NEWS: Let's bring in Jordan Neely's father, Andre Zachery, and his attorney, Donte Mills. Thank you both so much for joining us on what we know is a very difficult day.\n\nMr. Zachery, let's start with you. Obviously, you were visibly angry in court today. Just what went through your mind? What were you feeling when you heard that not guilty verdict?\n\nZACHERY: It hurt me. Very hurt. I just didn't know what to say at the time. But it hurt me to my core, you know, to hear something like that.\n\nABC NEWS: Was there any time that you thought this might be the outcome?\n\nZACHERY: I mean, it should be no surprise. Here we are.\n\nABC NEWS: You said the system is rigged. What? What did you mean by that? And how would...\n\nZACHERY: I mean, it's been like that for a long time. And that the system could be rigged the way it is.\n\nABC NEWS: And what do you mean by that? Racially?\n\nZACHERY: It can be in many ways, different ways. But I'm not going to say racially right now, but it could be in a lot of ways.\n\nMILLS: And we don't want to make this -- this isn't a Black or white issue. This is about everybody mattering. There's some people who look at this and say, Jordan was houseless. He had mental issues, almost as if he deserved this to happen to him. And there's no qualms. We all have problems.\n\nAnd even with Andre, there were times where he could have been there more for Jordan. That's understandable. But that doesn't mean that Jordan deserved what happened to him, or that you can simply choke someone to death and not be held responsible for it. That's what we want people to understand.\n\nThis isn't a white or Black thing. This is all of us. We all have that right to voice when we're feeling something to be heard and for someone to be held accountable if they harm us when they shouldn't.\n\nABC NEWS: You said it earlier today that you sought out and told the family you were going to get justice. Now you're going to go seek it through civil court. But you just started last week, the civil suit. Give us a sense of, of the timing on that and if you think you might find justice there.\n\nMILLS: We will. I'm telling you we will. The timing is, we started the lawsuit. Not right away. We wanted to see what the evidence was, what the defense was going to be. And when we heard in court [all of the evidence], that's when we began the civil process and filed that lawsuit.\n\nIt's going to take some time. It could be a year or two, but we're not going to stop until we do have justice, because that's what our system calls for. We're not in rebellion right now. We're following the rules of our legal system. If you think somebody killed someone and they should not have, we have the right to file a wrongful death suit. That's what we did.\n\nABC NEWS: From a legal standpoint. What aspect of this do you feel that the jury didn't take into account?\n\nMILLS: That Jordan was a person? That's the only way that you can see this situation and say that he did not deserve the justice that we were seeking on the criminal side. If you don't think he was valuable enough to do it, he the only way you can say that is Jordan was scary. He came on. He scared some people on the train. That could be true.\n\nBut at some point, you have to be a human and have humanity and say Daniel Penny could have let go before Jordan died. He continued to choke him 50 seconds after he was lifeless. He continued to choke. And there's no, there's no reason for that. And there's no reason for a jury to say that that's not criminal behavior. It is.\n\nABC NEWS: Mr. Zachery, tell us about your son. What you miss most about him?\n\nZACHERY: Well, I miss his voice. I miss being around him. Miss him dancing.\n\nABC NEWS: If you could talk to Daniel Penny directly, what would you say?\n\nZACHERY: Why you didn't say you was sorry, man? Come on, man. Why you didn't say nothing?\n\nABC NEWS: Would that have mattered?\n\nZACHERY: It sure would have.\n\nABC NEWS: Mr. Zachery, I'm sure it's not the same, but we do want to say we're sorry for the loss of your son. And we thank you both so much for taking the time to come on and talk with us today.\n\nMILLS: Thank you.\n\nZACHERY: Thank you.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Video of Jordan Neely's subway chokehold death shown to jury in Daniel Penny manslaughter trial\n\nThe bystander video was recorded by a high school student.\n\nJurors saw video on Monday of Marine veteran Daniel Penny putting Jordan Neely in a deadly chokehold on the floor of a subway train in New York City, as Penny's manslaughter trial resumed.\n\nIn the bystander video, which was recorded by a then-17-year-old high school student, a witness can be heard calling out to Penny, \"He's dying...you need to let him go.\" Others are heard yelling on the clip to \"get the cops!\"\n\nThe video was played at the trial of Penny, who is charged with manslaughter and negligent homicide in the May 1, 2023, death of Neely, a 30-year-old homeless Black man who some witnesses say was acting erratically on a subway car. Penny has pleaded not guilty.\n\nIvette Rosario, a student who was present during the incident, testified on Monday that she did not hear the witness call out that Neely is \"dying\" at the time and it's not clear whether Penny heard it either.\n\nProsecutors used the bystander video on Monday to bolster their contention that Penny, a former Marine trained in martial arts, should have known that his chokehold maneuver was turning fatal. Prosecutors also argued that Penny held onto Neely \"for far too long\" -- more than 5 minutes after the train pulled into the station and passengers were able to get off.\n\nMeanwhile, the defense has argued that Penny's chokehold was justified because Neely was an \"unhinged\" threat to others.\n\nAssistant District Attorney Dafna Yoran said during opening statements on Friday that Penny took it upon himself to \"neutralize\" Neely after the homeless man entered a moderately crowded subway car at the Second Avenue stop and began making threats about hurting people, which appeared to scare many of the passengers.\n\n\"He was aware of the risk his actions would kill Mr. Neely and did it anyway,\" Yoran said on Friday.\n\n\"Jordan Neely took his last breaths on the dirty floor of an uptown F train,\" she added.\n\nProsecutors further argued that while Penny may be an \"honorable veteran\" and \"nice young man,\" he used too much force for too long and was reckless with Neely's life because \"he didn't recognize his humanity.\"\n\nThe defense, meanwhile, argued in opening statements on Friday that the former Marine stood up to \"protect thy neighbor.\"\n\nDefense attorney Thomas Kenniff countered that Penny sought to protect passengers as Neely's threats echoed through the closed confines of a subway car and he spoke with \"unhinged rage.\"\n\nPenny heard Neely say \"I will kill,\" Kenniff claimed, and said there was no opportunity for his client to de-escalate or stop Neely from the harm he was threatening.\n\n\"What Danny does do is leap into action,\" Kenniff said.\n\n\"This is a case about a young man who did for others what we would want someone to do for us,\" Kenniff said on Friday.  \"It doesn't make him a hero, but it doesn't make him a killer.\"\n\nJurors also saw on Friday body camera video that had not yet been publicly released of Penny's initial encounter with police, four and a half minutes after letting go of Neely.\n\nIn the video, Penny is heard saying, \"I put him out,\" when the officer asked what happened.\n\nMembers of Neely's family were seated with the spectators for opening statements Friday.\n\n\"I loved Jordan. And I want justice for Jordan Neely. I want it today. I want justice for everybody and I want justice for Jordan Neely,\" his uncle, Christopher Neely, said before entering court.\n\nNeely family attorney Donte Mills told ABC News in a past statement that there is \"no justification\" for Penny's actions.\n\n\"This case is simple. Someone got on a train and was screaming so someone else choked them to death,\" Mills said.\n\n\"Jordan had the right to take up his own space. He was allowed to be on that train and even to scream. He did not touch anyone. He was not a visitor on that train, in New York, or in this country,\" he added.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Daniel Penny explains in his own words why he restrained Jordan Neely on the subway for so long\n\nFollow:\n\nSpeaking publicly for the first time since his acquittal, Daniel Penny said he restrained Jordan Neely on a subway car last May for more than five minutes because Neely was \"extraordinarily strong\" and Penny was worried he would get up and attack him or someone else.\n\n\"Part of my worry was if I let him go and an incoming train comes, as he's running away, pushes somebody onto the tracks,\" Penny said in an interview with Fox News host Jeanine Pirro. \"It's part of the reason why I did what I did in the way that I did it.\"\n\nPenny did not testify during his criminal trial. The Fox Nation interview is the first time Penny has spoken publicly in detail about the event, and the venue represented friendly terrain as Pirro thanked Penny for his actions.\n\nThe Marine veteran said in the interview he was also concerned about his own safety.\n\n\"I'm on the ground with him, I'm on my back in a very vulnerable position,\" he said. \"If I would have just let him go, I'm on my back now, he can just turn around and start doing what he said to me.\"\n\n\"Killing,\" Pirro said.\n\n\"Killing, hurting,\" Penny responded.\n\nRelated article Daniel Penny acquitted of criminally negligent homicide after more serious manslaughter charge was dismissed\n\nDuring the trial, several witnesses testified they heard Neely say he was willing to go to jail for life but did not testify they heard him say he would kill.\n\nThe interview came after Penny was acquitted by a jury on a criminally negligent homicide charge in a case that raised questions about the safety of the New York City subways and what constitutes self-defense.\n\nPenny also faced a more serious second-degree manslaughter charge, but Judge Maxwell Wiley dismissed it at the request of prosecutors after jurors twice told the court they could not come to a verdict on the count. He could have faced up to 15 years in prison if convicted of manslaughter.\n\nThe case stemmed from the death of Neely , a 30-year-old street artist who struggled with homelessness, mental illness and drugs, on a subway car on May 1, 2023.\n\nProsecutors argued Penny went too far in putting Neely in a chokehold for so long, including after Neely stopped moving, while his defense said he was acting to protect others from a threat and challenged the medical examiner's determination Neely died from the chokehold.\n\nHe defended his actions in the Fox Nation interview and said he would do the same thing again.\n\n\"The guilt I would have felt if someone did get hurt, if he did do what he was threatening to do, I would never be able to live with myself,\" Penny said. \"I'll take a million court appearances and people calling me names and people hating me just to keep one of those people from getting hurt or killed.\"\n\nIn the interview, Penny said he was on his way from college classes at the New York City College of Technology, also known as City Tech, to the gym when Neely \"barreled\" onto the train, threw down his jacket, yelled demands for food and drink and said he was willing to go to jail for life or hurt and kill people if he didn't get them.\n\n\"This was unlike anything I've ever experienced,\" Penny said. \"I believed what he was saying.\"\n\nHe said he was nervous and scared, and over about 15 seconds, he considered what to do.\n\n\"Should I just wait? Should I go to a different car? Should I move away?\" he said. \"But I saw the looks on the mother, on the school kids, on the other passengers - women, children. I felt like the threats were imminent and something had to be done.\"\n\nPenny then grabbed Neely from behind in a chokehold and took him to the ground. He said he hoped that the train would get to the station and police would arrive and take over, but police took several minutes to get there.\n\nHe said Neely was \"thrashing\" and using the subway pole to try to escape the restraint. He described Neely as \"extraordinarily strong\" and so believed he was on drugs.\n\nSeveral other people helped restrain Neely, including one man who grabbed his arms. \"He said, 'You can let him go once I grab him,' (and) I said, 'He's gonna break out of that,' knowing how strong he is.\"\n\nOther subway riders thanked him for stepping in to help, he said.\n\nAsked whether he feels the Neely family's loss, he responded, \"Of course.\"\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of his acquittal Monday, Penny and his legal team went to a bar in lower Manhattan, a bar employee told CNN by phone. There, Penny held a drink in one hand while giving a thumbs-up with the other in a posed picture with his attorneys Thomas Kenniff and Steven Raiser, according to a photo from Kenniff .\n\nThe post-verdict celebration underscores a basic fact about Penny's future: The 26-year-old is now a free man .\n\nHis exact plans remain unclear. His attorneys have not responded to a CNN request for comment on his future.\n\nWhile the criminal case against him is over, Penny still faces a civil lawsuit from Neely's father, Andre Zachery, accusing Penny of assault, battery and causing Neely's death. Zachery, who is listed as the administrator of Neely's estate, accused Penny of having caused the death due to \"negligence, carelessness and recklessness.\" The suit does not specify the amount of money the family is seeking.\n\nRelated article Jordan Neely, the man killed in chokehold on NYC subway, is remembered as an entertainer shattered by his mother's murder\n\nKenniff, Penny's defense attorney, did not respond to a request for comment on the suit.\n\nAs for Penny's life and career, he took college classes in engineering and architecture at City Tech. He also served four years in the Marines as a sergeant, from 2017 to 2021, with his last duty assignment at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, according to military records.\n\nAfter restraining Neely last May, Penny spoke with police and made small talk with a detective about his Marine service and career plans.\n\n\"I'm in school. I'm using that GI Bill,\" Penny said, referring to the federal program that offers benefits to veterans for higher education. \"But we'll see. I miss the Marine Corps. I miss the camaraderie.\"\n\nFurther, the trial and debate over his actions on the subway have made him a recognizable public figure and a political talking point - for better or worse.\n\n\"Certainly you'll find people in society who look down upon what he did and his actions, but equally I think you'll see people who are really favorably inclined to embrace him because of his actions,\" CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson said.\n\nPenny's controversial actions in restraining Neely made him a target of protests outside court throughout the trial. The not-guilty verdict further sparked emotions Monday: Neely's father was escorted out of the courtroom after the verdict was read following an audible outburst with expletives, and Hawk Newsome, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter of Greater New York, yelled \"Small world, buddy,\" at Penny while being led out.\n\n\"I now have to kind of look over my shoulder. There's a lot of crazy people out there,\" Penny said in the Fox Nation interview. \"I have to worry about my family, and I have to worry about my future, which is harder to even comprehend.\"\n\nOn the other hand, right-wing political figures have praised his actions and elevated him as a hero. President-elect Donald Trump previously commented on the case, telling Fox News, \"It's an awfully tough case, I think.\" Vice President-elect JD Vance expressed his support for Penny on Monday, saying on X, \"thank God justice was done in this case.\"\n\nRep. Eli Crane, a Republican from Arizona, introduced a resolution in Congress on Monday to grant Penny a Congressional Gold Medal for his \"heroism,\" he said in a post on X.\n\nPenny told Fox Nation he's not a \"confrontational person\" and said he was uncomfortable with the public attention.\n\n\"I still feel completely normal,\" Penny said. \"I don't feel exceptional in any way, and I don't want to feel that. I don't want praise, I don't want attention, I don't want limelight. It just makes me very uncomfortable. I'd like to just go back to normal, but we'll see.\"\n\nCNN's Lauren del Valle, Gloria Pazmino, Celina Tebor and Emma Tucker contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

      "text": "Daniel Penny's defense centers on disputing Jordan Neely's cause of death on NYC subway\n\nFollow:\n\nThe defense has rested its case in the trial of Daniel Penny, the former Marine who held Jordan Neely in a fatal chokehold on the New York City subway last year, after four days of witness testimony.\n\nNeely's cause of death became the focal point of the defense's case in Penny's manslaughter trial , with a forensic pathologist challenging the prosecution's argument that Neely died from the former Marine's chokehold.\n\nThe homeless New Yorker died in May 2023 after an encounter with 26-year-old Penny on the New York City subway. The case has polarized city residents, while raising the broader question of when it's appropriate for a citizen to kill another citizen.\n\nRelated article Jury sees video of subway chokehold that led to veteran Daniel Penny's manslaughter trial\n\nPenny placed 30-year-old Neely in a chokehold after he began shouting at train passengers that he was hungry and thirsty and didn't care whether he died. Penny, who is White, forced Neely, who is Black, to the train floor and restrained him in what prosecutors say became a deadly chokehold. A medical examiner ruled Neely's death a homicide.\n\nProsecutors are not trying to prove that Penny intentionally tried to kill Neely. Instead, they allege he went \"way too far\" by holding Neely's neck for about six minutes, violating \"law and human decency.\"\n\nPenny told NYPD detectives he put a man in a chokehold to try to restrain him until police arrived and did not mean to hurt or kill him, according to a video played in court.\n\nDuring the first days of defense proceedings, Penny's attorneys brought character witnesses to the stand who testified to his reputation. In the following days, the defense turned toward Neely's medical history and pointedly disputed the medical examiner's determination of the cause of death.\n\nFollowing closing arguments on December 2, a jury of 12 Manhattanites will decide Penny's fate. He faces one count each of second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide.\n\nPenny's attorneys introduced six character witnesses during the first two days of their presentation, including family members and men he served with in the US Marines.\n\nPenny served four years in the Marines. He was a green belt in the Marine Corps martial arts program, learning several blood chokes designed to cut off blood flow to the brain and render someone unconscious, his martial arts instructor Joseph Caballer had testified for the prosecution.\n\nRelated article Shaken subway riders, military chokeholds, a death certificate: How prosecutors built their case against Daniel Penny\n\nA childhood friend said Penny was known for being \"kind, too kind.\" A man who served with him in the same battalion said he had a reputation for being \"above reproach,\" and that as Marines they were \"taught to value life.\"\n\nThe defense then turned to Neely and his mental health history. A medical expert for the defense, forensic psychiatrist Dr. Alexander Sasha Bardey, testified Neely was likely experiencing schizophrenic psychosis when he boarded the subway car last year. Bardey did not meet or examine Neely.\n\nA 50-page extraction of Neely's medical history, going back six years, showed the homeless man's multiple interactions with the city's health system throughout more than a dozen hospitalizations.\n\nIn some instances, Neely requested medicine for his psychosis. In others, he described being hungry and cold. Medical professionals also reported Neely, sometimes disheveled and unclean, reported hearing voices and had delusions of grandeur. He also reported being afraid that people wanted to attack him because they were jealous of him.\n\nThe records showed that during some hospital stays, Neely described sadness due to a lack of support and family. Hospital staff wrote in their reports that Neely said he was depressed about being homeless. His hospitalizations were sometimes due to his abuse of K2, the records showed.\n\nIn a marked counter to the official medical examiner's ruling, a forensic pathologist for the defense testified Penny's chokehold did not cause Neely's death.\n\n\"This is not a chokehold death,\" Dr. Satish Chundru told the jury.\n\nNeely's death was not consistent with a chokehold because he never lost consciousness before dying, he testified, saying instead Neely died of a combination of factors including his sickle cell trait, schizophrenia, the struggle and restraint by Penny and K2 intoxication.\n\nDr. Cynthia Harris, a New York City medical examiner who performed Neely's autopsy, sat in the gallery as Chundru frequently knocked her methods and conclusions that she testified to last week. Harris testified for the prosecution that she had no doubt Neely died from neck compression.\n\nRelated video A suspect has been charged with second-degree manslaughter in the chokehold death of Jordan Neely\n\nWhile toxicology found the presence of K2 in Neely's system, Harris testified she did not think the stimulant drug contributed to his death. A death related to the synthetic cannabinoid is typically linked to a cardiac event Neely did not experience in his final moments, Harris testified.\n\nShe acknowledged she made the determination before toxicology results were in, but said she did not feel it was necessary to wait - it would not have changed her mind if he had \"enough fentanyl in his system to put down an elephant,\" Harris said.\n\nIn a lengthy cross-examination, the prosecution spent hours aiming to discredit Chundru's conclusion that Neely's sickling crisis was largely to blame for his death.\n\nChundru said Neely was likely in a sickling crisis before Penny put him in a chokehold. He testified the city medical examiner missed signs of previous sickling in Neely's spleen revealed in the autopsy he said further supports his finding.\n\nAssistant District Attorney Dafna Yoran challenged Chundru saying someone in a sickling crisis would likely appear lethargic and short of breath, unlike Neely's loud and aggressive behavior testified to by subway witnesses.\n\nThe jury heard that a medical examiner ruled Neely's death a homicide, but siding with the defense, Judge Maxwell Wiley instructed the jury that homicide as it is defined by a medical examiner \"is not a conclusion that a crime was committed - you make that conclusion or it is made in a courtroom.\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "What we know about Jordan Neely's chokehold death on the New York subway\n\nA video of a man experiencing homelessness who later died after being held in a chokehold on the New York City subway has drawn national attention.\n\nJordan Neely, 30, shouted at passengers that he was hungry, thirsty and tired of having nothing before he was grabbed from behind in a chokehold by a Marine veteran. Neely, a well-known Michael Jackson impersonator in Times Square and on the subway, was pronounced dead at a hospital.\n\nHere's what we know about his death - which has divided a city struggling with mounting homelessness and growing numbers of people with mental illness on the streets and subways:\n\nNeely was killed Monday afternoon, after being held in a chokehold when he got on a train and shouted at passengers.\n\nA witness told CNN Neely did not harm anyone nor did they see him armed with any weapon. Neely was experiencing homelessness, according to a source familiar with his case.\n\nIn the minutes before the deadly chokehold, Neely had been \"acting erratically,\" but he did not attack anyone, according to Juan Alberto Vazquez, who recorded the altercation on video.\n\nNeely yelled about being \"fed up and hungry\" and \"tired of having nothing,\" Vazquez told CNN.\n\nNeely also said, \"I don't care if I die. I don't care if I go to jail. I don't have any food ... I'm done,\" according to Vazquez.\n\nAt some point, Neely threw his jacket on the train's floor, repeating he was ready to go to jail and get a life sentence, Vazquez said.\n\nSome subway riders moved to other parts of the train car.\n\nThen a rider came up behind Neely and put him in a chokehold, with the two falling to the floor, said Vazquez, who added Neely did not interact with the passenger at all before the attack.\n\nIn the video recorded by Vazquez, Neely and the other man are on the floor of a subway car with the man's arm wrapped around Neely's neck.\n\nThe two men were on the floor for about seven minutes, said Vazquez, adding he started recording about three or four minutes after the chokehold began.\n\nAt some point, two other passengers approached Neely as he was being held in a chokehold. One appeared to be mediating the situation while the other seemed to help the man restrain Neely, according to Vazquez.\n\nRelated article Jordan Neely, the man killed in chokehold on NYC subway, is remembered as an entertainer shattered by his mother's murder\n\nAfter a while, Vazquez noticed Neely stopped moving.\n\nWhen police arrived at the subway station in Lower Manhattan before 2:30 p.m. Monday, they administered first aid to an unconscious Neely. He was pronounced dead later.\n\nCNN has not been able to independently confirm what happened leading up to the incident or how long Neely was restrained.\n\nThe man who put Neely in the chokehold has been identified as Daniel Penny, a 24-year-old Marine veteran from Queens, New York, his attorneys said in a statement Friday night.\n\nHe was interviewed by detectives and released, a law enforcement source said, noting the man does not have a criminal record.\n\nPenny is a veteran who served in the US Marines, according to law enforcement and military records. He was a sergeant and served from 2017 to 2021, and his last duty assignment was at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, military records show.\n\n\"Daniel never intended to harm Mr. Neely and could not have foreseen his untimely death,\" his attorneys said in a statement. \"We hope that out of this awful tragedy will come a new commitment by our elected officials to address the mental health crisis on our streets and subways.\"\n\nPenny has hired a former Republican Manhattan District Attorney candidate to represent him, the attorney's law firm confirmed on Friday.\n\nAttorney Thomas Kenniff, who ran against now Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg in 2021, declined to comment. Kenniff is an Iraq War veteran and major in the Army National Guard whose bid for DA focused on reducing crime and opposing criminal justice reform.\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney's Office is investigating Neely's death, which has triggered protests in New York City demanding justice in the case.\n\nNo charges have been filed.\n\nManhattan prosecutors were conducting a \"rigorous ongoing investigation\" into the death, according to Bragg's office.\n\nThe death was ruled a homicide, but that classification does not mean there was intent or culpability, which is a matter for the criminal justice system to consider, a spokesperson for the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner said.\n\n\"This is a solemn and serious matter that ended in the tragic loss of Jordan Neely's life,\" Manhattan District Attorney's Office spokesperson Doug Cohen said in a statement.\n\n\"As part of our rigorous ongoing investigation, we will review the Medical Examiner's report, assess all available video and photo footage, identify and interview as many witnesses as possible, and obtain additional medical records.\"\n\nThe lack of criminal charges in the case has fueled demands by officials and the community for legal action, as well as protests.\n\nNeely's death comes more than a year after New York City Mayor Eric Adams launched an initiative to combat crime and homelessness in the city's subway system, including a plan to add more behavioral health emergency assistance teams.\n\nWhen asked about Neely's case and the issue of vigilantism during an interview on CNN Primetime Wednesday, Adams said, \"Each situation is different. ... We have so many cases where passengers assist other riders. We don't know exactly what happened here until the investigation is through.\"\n\nAdams said officers were on the scene in six minutes. He referenced his time as a transit officer in New York and said he responded to many calls where passengers assisted others.\n\n\"We cannot just blanketedly say what a passenger should or should not do in a situation like that,\" Adams said.\n\nRelated article Man dies after being put in a chokehold by another rider on New York City subway, officials say. The DA is investigating\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul on Thursday said Neely's family \"deserves justice.\"\n\n\"I do want to acknowledge how horrific it was to view a video of Jordan Neely being killed for being a passenger on the subway trains,\" Hochul said at a news conference.\n\nHochul called the response of the passengers who held down Neely \"very extreme\" and said the video \"was very disturbing to witness.\" Neely was held down \"until the last breath was snuffed out of him,\" she said.\n\nJumaane Williams, New York City's public advocate, also called for justice, demanding charges be filed \"immediately\" against the Marine. The public advocate office helps with complaints involving government-related services and regulations.\n\nOn Friday, Williams told CNN charges have not been filed because the victim was homeless and the mayor and other elected officials have not condemned what Williams described as an act of vigilantism.\n\n\"I'm concerned that our executives are creating an environment where these things can continue,\" he said.\n\n\"I do want to make clear that you can say vigilantism shouldn't be happening while saying you're not sure what happened,\" Williams added. \"Both of those things can happen at the same time. And we need to hear that.\"\n\nWilliams added, \"What if it was the Black homeless man who had choked to death a white Marine because he was scared? We'd probably be having this conversation with him with charges sitting on Rikers Island.\"\n\nNeely's family has retained the law firm Mills & Edwards LLP to represent them. In a statement Friday, the family's attorney said they are committed to holding accountable the Metropolitan Transportation Authority as well as the person responsible for Neely's death.\n\n\"Passengers are not supposed to die on the floor of our subways,\" attorney Lennon Edwards said in a statement, noting Neely had to wait \"too long to go without help, intervention and without air.\"\n\nAttorney Donte Mills added, \"We have people being killed for ringing the wrong doorbell, pulling in the wrong driveway and screaming out in desperation on the subway. We cannot let that stand.\"\n\nAfter his mother was murdered in 2007, Neely eked out a living as a Michael Jackson impersonator in Times Square and on New York's subways.\n\nBut he fell on hard times in recent years, according to a friend and a relative, finding himself living on the street and struggling with the trauma of losing his mother as a teenager.\n\n\"He told me about how much his mother's passing impacted him. He disclosed that she was murdered, and her body was put in a suitcase,\" Moses Harper, an artist who knew Neely, told CNN.\n\nHarper and Neely became friends after meeting in 2009. Neely eventually opened up to her about the loss of his mother.\n\n\"It traumatized him. He was not expecting that, the brutal way she was taken. That had a big impact on him. The brutality behind that,\" Harper told CNN. \"This kid has cried in front of me. That hurt him in his heart.\"\n\nIn 2012, a New Jersey man was sentenced to 30 years in prison for the 2007 murder of Christie Neely in their home and \"dumping her body in a suitcase in the Bronx,\" according to the Jersey Journal.\n\nHarper said she last saw Neely in 2016. She ran into him on the subway and could tell he was living on the street. He was asking passengers for money and food.\n\n\"I had never seen him like that before,\" she said.\n\nNeely's face lit up when he looked at her that day but he kept walking, apparently ashamed to be seen in such a dire state. She got up and pulled him off the train at the next station.\n\n\"I hugged him and wrapped him up like he was my little brother. And I told him, 'Don't ever be ashamed,'\" Harper recalled.\n\nNeely walked with Harper to her building but refused to come up, she said. He told her about \"his struggles and challenges\" and she gave him her number.\n\nRelated article As crime increases in New York City's transit system, mayor announces criminal justice task forces\n\nIt was cold that day, Harper said, and she gave him one of her shirts. They exchanged \"another big hug,\" she recalled, and she \"never saw him again.\"\n\nHarper, who described Neely as a kind and sweet soul, said people from around the world have been reaching out to her about his death.\n\nIn the years after losing his mother, Neely began experiencing \"some hard times\" before high school ended, said Melyssa Votta, a high school friend.\n\n\"He was jumping from house to house,\" she told CNN.\n\nNeely had a series of run-ins with New York police, a law enforcement source told CNN - including 42 arrests on charges ranging from petty larceny, jumping subway turnstiles, theft, and three unprovoked assaults on women in the subway between 2019 and 2021.\n\nThrough it all, Votta said, Neely was \"always a dancer\" and \"a really good kid.\"\n\n\"He's very well known on the Internet,\" said Votta, noting she, too, has been contacted by people around the world since Neely's death.\n\nCarolyn Neely set up a GoFundMe page for her nephew, describing him as \"a very talented Black man who loves to dance.\"\n\n\"Performance was his thing,\" she wrote.\n\nCNN's Artemis Moshtaghian, Kristina Sgueglia, Sharif Paget, Aya Elamroussi, John Miller, Jason Carroll, Brynn Gingras, Laura Ly, Maria Santana, Omar Jimenez, Nicole Grether, Elizabeth Hartfield, Haley Britzky, Paul P.

      "text": "Jordan Neely, street artist who died from chokehold on a New York City subway, mourned at funeral in Harlem\n\nJordan Neely, the homeless street artist who was the victim of a fatal chokehold on a New York City subway, was remembered at his funeral Friday as a \"well known and loved\" performer.\n\nNeely, 30, known for his Michael Jackson impersonations, was restrained in a chokehold May 1 on a Manhattan subway by another rider, Daniel Penny, after Neely began shouting that he was hungry, thirsty and had little to live for. Penny, a 24-year-old US Marine veteran, surrendered to police last Friday to face a second-degree manslaughter charge.\n\n\"He performed in front of thousands of people in the streets of New York City, and on the subways where he was well known and loved,\" Neely's great aunt Mildred Mahazu said at his funeral service at the Mount Neboh Baptist Church in Harlem.\n\n\"One of Jordan's biggest passions was to dance and entertain. He was greatly influenced by pop star Michael Jackson, who he started idolizing from the age of seven. Over time, he began to perfect MJ's dance moves by the time he turned 18,\" Mahazu said.\n\nRelated article 'Jordan Neely did not deserve to die,' New York mayor says as he calls for revamped mental health services -- and sidesteps talk of homicide investigation\n\nNeely's death ignited protests and calls for Penny's arrest while refocusing attention on struggles with homelessness and mental illness across America.\n\nPenny was released on a bail package last week, which included a $100,000 cash insurance company bond. He has not been indicted and has not yet been required to enter a plea.\n\nNeely had experienced mental health issues since 2007, when he was 14 and his mother was murdered, said Neely family attorney, Donte Mills. He had been traumatized after his mother's brutal killing was followed by the discovery of her body in a suitcase, his friend Moses Harper told CNN.\n\nAfter Neely lost his mother, with whom he shared \"an unbreakable bond,\" he moved in with his father, Mahazu said, adding that in high school he was a star basketball and soccer player.\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton, who delivered a eulogy at Neely's funeral, said the street artist \"wasn't trying to be something negative,\" but wanted to \"be like Michael\" and \"made the world smile and get on one beat.\"\n\nSharpton did not directly address Penny on Friday but said the city should hold him accountable.\n\n\"You didn't have the right to snatch the life out of this young man,\" Sharpton said.\n\nSharpton promised that in Neely's name he would work to change the circumstances of those experiencing homelessness and those battling with mental health issues by providing city services.\n\nBefore his death, Neely had been on a NYC Department of Homeless Services list of the city's homeless with acute needs - sometimes referred to internally as the \"Top 50\" list - because individuals on the list tend to disappear, a source told CNN.\n\n\"In the name of Jordan, we're going to turn this city around to serve the homeless,\" said Sharpton.\n\n\"We can't live in a city where you can choke me to death with no provocation, no weapon, no threat, and you go home and sleep in your bed while my family got to put me in a cemetery. It must be equal justice under the law.\"\n\nPenny's attorneys said in a statement last week that Neely had been \"aggressively threatening\" passengers and Penny and others had \"acted to protect themselves.\"\n\n\"Daniel never intended to harm Mr. Neely,\" they said.\n\nPenny's attorneys said they are confident he will be \"fully absolved of any wrongdoing.\"\n\nNeely's death was ruled a homicide, though the designation doesn't mean there was intent or culpability, a spokesperson for the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner said earlier this week, noting at the time it was a matter for the criminal justice system to determine.\n\nCNN's Emma Tucker contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Daniel Penny acquitted of criminally negligent homicide after more serious manslaughter charge was dismissed\n\nFollow:\n\nA Manhattan jury found Daniel Penny not guilty of criminally negligent homicide Monday in the death of Jordan Neely on a New York City subway last year.\n\nPenny also previously faced a more serious second-degree manslaughter charge, but Judge Maxwell Wiley dismissed it Friday at the request of prosecutors after jurors twice told the court they could not come to a verdict on the count.\n\nPenny, a 26-year-old former Marine, would have faced up to four years in prison for a criminally negligent homicide conviction and up to 15 years for a manslaughter conviction.\n\nThere was applause in the courtroom as the not-guilty verdict was read aloud. Penny locked eyes with members of the jury that acquitted him, nodding in thanks. A smile was visible on his face.\n\n\"For over 18 months our client has lived under the weight of a criminal indictment, all the while guilty of nothing more than trying to protect his fellow New Yorkers from a psychotic madman with a history of violence,\" Penny's attorney Tom Kenniff said in a statement Monday. \"Today the Manhattan Jury has spoken, and the misguided prosecution of Daniel Penny will go down as a sad chapter in the history of New York criminal justice.\"\n\nNeely's father, who was present in the courtroom for the verdict, was escorted out of the courtroom after an audible outburst with expletives.\n\nThe jury deliberated for just over an hour Monday on the criminally negligent homicide charge. On the second-degree manslaughter charge, they deliberated for 16 hours last week before telling the judge they were deadlocked, and another three hours Friday before saying they were deadlocked again.\n\nThe case stems from the death of Neely , a 30-year-old street artist who struggled with homelessness, mental illness and drugs, on a subway car on May 1, 2023.\n\nNeely entered the subway car and began acting erratically, as he threw down his jacket and yelled at passengers that he was hungry and thirsty and didn't care whether he died, witnesses said. Penny, a passenger, grabbed Neely from behind in a chokehold, forced him to the train floor and restrained him there for several minutes. When Penny let go of the hold, Neely was nonresponsive. He was later declared dead.\n\nSeveral minutes of the chokehold were captured on bystander video that spread widely and has been played repeatedly in court during the trial.\n\nThe case has polarized city residents, many of whom have personal experiences with disorder on the subways, and raised broader questions about mental health, race relations and the line between protector and vigilante. Black Lives Matter protesters have added Neely's name to its roll call of victims - including just outside the courthouse - while others have praised Penny for trying to protect others.\n\nProsecutors said Penny acted recklessly and negligently by restraining Neely in a chokehold for so long, even after Neely stopped moving. \"We are here today because the defendant used way too much force for way too long in way too reckless of a manner,\" prosecutor Dafna Yoran said in closing arguments.\n\nHis defense has said he was acting to protect others from a threat.\n\n\"I wasn't trying to injure him,\" Penny said in an interview with NYPD investigators shortly after the incident. \"I'm just trying to keep him from hurting anybody else. He was threatening.\"\n\nPenny's defense attorneys also challenged the medical examiner's determination Neely died from the chokehold and suggested the charges were brought because of \"a rush to judgment based on something other than medical science.\"\n\nOutside court, Neely's father and a family attorney expressed their disappointment with the jury's verdict and the broader criminal justice system.\n\n\"I miss my son. My son didn't have to go through this. I didn't have to go through this either,\" Andre Zachary said. \"It hurts, it really, really hurts. What are we going to do, people? What's going to happen to us now? I've had enough of this. The system is rigged.\"\n\nDonte Mills, the family attorney, said they were \"devastated, upset, angry, hurt\" over the verdict.\n\n\"Last week the jury couldn't decide on the top charge, and they come back this week and they give up on us,\" he said. \"The district attorney did a good job, but the jury in this case let us down.\"\n\nRelated article How prosecutors built their case against Daniel Penny\n\nPenny and his team went to a bar in Lower Manhattan following his acquittal, according to an employee of the bar who spoke with CNN on the phone.\n\nKenniff, the defense attorney, also posted a photo on Instagram of Penny, attorney Steven Raiser and himself holding drinks at the bar. \"Thank you!!!\" Kenniff wrote in the caption.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg issued a statement saying the office \"followed the facts and the evidence from beginning to end\" and noted the jury's careful deliberation of the case.\n\n\"Their lengthy deliberation - and the totality of the facts and the evidence - underscored why this case was put in front of a jury of Mr. Penny's peers,\" he said in the statement. \"The jury has now spoken. At the Manhattan D.A.'s Office we deeply respect the jury process and we respect their verdict.\"\n\nNew York Mayor Eric Adams connected Neely's death to his broader criticisms of the \"broken\" mental health system.\n\n\"Jordan should not have had to die,\" he said. \"And I strongly believe, as I've been stating, probably from day one, we have a mental health system that is broken. When you have someone repeatedly going through that system, that's a signature of failure, and we need help in Albany and in the city council. We can't sit back and mourn the loss of someone that is caught up in the system when we're not taking action every day.\n\n\"But a jury of his peers heard the case, saw all the facts, and all the evidence, and made a decision. And I join DA Bragg in stating that I respect the process,\" he said.\n\nThe trial began with jury selection in late October and featured testimony, video and 911 calls from subway riders, responding police officers and martial arts and medical experts.\n\nThe prosecution called more than 30 witnesses to the stand, including one man who helped restrain Neely's arms during the struggle and testified he advised Penny to loosen his grip. \"I'm going to grab his hands so you can let go,\" Eric Gonzalez told Penny, according to his testimony.\n\nHowever, Gonzalez could be heard in video footage of the incident saying Penny wasn't \"squeezing\" Neely's neck in the 51 seconds before he released the chokehold. Gonzalez also testified he initially lied to investigators about what he saw and did on the subway out of fear he would be \"pinned\" for the killing. Prosecutors promised not to charge him in the case, he testified.\n\nRelated article Daniel Penny's lawyers argue he protected others, prosecutors say he 'went too far' as NYC subway manslaughter trial begins\n\nIn addition, the Marine Corps martial arts expert who trained Penny in chokeholds testified Penny was aware the holds could be lethal.\n\nSeveral subway riders testified they were terrified Neely was going to attack and they were relieved when Penny put him in a chokehold and kept him there.\n\n\"Restraining him for the moment was a relief, but if he would have gotten up, he would have done what he would have done,\" subway rider Caedryn Schrunk said.\n\nThe defense's case focused on emphasizing Neely's threatening behavior, character witnesses from Penny's time in the US Marines and challenges to the medical cause of Neely's death.\n\nPenny served four years in the Marines as a sergeant, from 2017 to 2021, with his last duty assignment at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, according to military records.\n\nThe city medical examiner who performed Neely's autopsy, testifying for the prosecution, ruled the cause of his death was \"compression of neck (chokehold).\" She made the determination after performing an autopsy and watching the cell phone video on the subway but did not wait for the toxicology report, she testified.\n\nThe defense presented its own medical expert who said Neely died of a combination of factors, including a sickling crisis linked to his sickle cell trait, a schizophrenic episode, the struggle and restraint by Penny and K2 intoxication.\n\nSeparately, Neely's father filed a lawsuit in New York Supreme Court on Wednesday accusing Penny of assault, battery and causing Neely's death. Andre Zachery, who is listed as the administrator of Neely's estate, accused Penny of having caused the death \"by the reason of the negligence, carelessness and recklessness.\" The suit does not specify the amount of money the family is seeking.\n\nKenniff, Penny's defense attorney, did not respond to a request for comment on the suit.\n\nCNN's Sabrina Souza and Emma Tucker contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

It is a character assassination, and a clear example of why he believed he was entitled to take Jordan's life,\" family attorneys Donte Mills and Lennon Edwards said.\n\n\"In the first paragraph he talks about how 'good' he is and the next paragraph he talks about how 'bad' Jordan was in an effort to convince us Jordan's life was 'worthless,'\" the attorneys said. \"The truth is, he knew nothing about Jordan's history when he intentionally wrapped his arms around Jordan's neck, and squeezed and kept squeezing.\n\n\"In the last paragraph, Daniel Penny suggests that the general public has shown 'indifference' for people like Jordan, but that term is more appropriately used to describe himself. It is clear he is the one who acted with indifference, both at the time he killed Jordan and now in his first public message. He never attempted to help him at all. In short, his actions on the train, and now his words, show why he needs to be in prison,\" they said.\n\nRelated article What we know about Jordan Neely's chokehold death on the New York subway\n\nThe statement was released amid growing pressure from protesters to bring criminal charges in Neely's death . Attorneys for Penny, the 24-year-old US Marine veteran who put Neely in the fatal chokehold, have said he acted to protect himself and other riders.\n\nThe killing came as New York has tried to grapple with a growing population of unhoused people and a mental health crisis. Last year, New York City unveiled a plan to combat crime and address homelessness in the subway system, an issue that Gov. Kathy Hochul referred to as a \"very real humanitarian crisis unfolding before our eyes for far too long.\"\n\nProsecutors in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office conferred over the weekend, and meetings will be conducted with the New York City medical examiner's office as well as detectives working the case this week as they continue to determine a pathway forward, a law enforcement source told CNN.\n\nPenny was interviewed by detectives and released, the source said. The medical examiner's office ruled the death a homicide, but prosecutors have not brought criminal charges.\n\nIn a statement last week, Penny's attorneys expressed condolences to Neely's family and defended his actions.\n\n\"When Mr. Neely began aggressively threatening Daniel Penny and the other passengers, Daniel, with the help of others, acted to protect themselves, until help arrived,\" the attorneys said. \"Daniel never intended to harm Mr. Neely and could not have foreseen his untimely death.\n\n\"For too long, those suffering from mental illness have been treated with indifference. We hope that out of this awful tragedy will come a new commitment by our elected officials to address the mental health crisis on our streets and subways.\"\n\nThose who knew Neely said he was a talented dancer who eked out a living as a Michael Jackson impersonator in Times Square and on New York's subways. But he fell on hard times in recent years, according to a friend and a relative , and was living on the street and struggling with his mental health.\n\nLast Monday, Neely began shouting at passengers that he was hungry, thirsty, and had little to live aboard a subway train in downtown Manhattan.\n\n\"I don't care if I die. I don't care if I go to jail. I don't have any food ... I'm done,\" Neely said, according to a witness.\n\nPenny came up behind Neely and put him in a chokehold, forcing him to the floor and keeping him restrained for several minutes until he stopped breathing. Police eventually arrived to the station and administered first aid to an unconscious Neely, and he was pronounced dead later.\n\nNeely did not interact with the passenger at all before the attack, according to Juan Alberto Vazquez, who recorded the altercation on video.\n\nA man who was aboard the same subway train told CNN that Neely was \"staring off\" and \"limp\" after he was released from the chokehold.\n\nRelated article Jordan Neely, the man killed in chokehold on NYC subway, is remembered as an entertainer shattered by his mother's murder\n\n\"I saw that his eyes were staring off and that he was limp,\" said Johnny Grima, who was watching the incident from another train car. \"So I went in through another door and I said to them, 'Put him on his side so he doesn't choke on his own spit or something,' and they flipped him over.\"\n\nGrima said he tried to pour water on Neely's head, but Penny came up to him and told him to stop.\n\n\"He got over him and said, 'Stop,'\" Grima told CNN. \"I should have been more on it, man, and not walked away, but I did. And they were telling people that he still had a pulse and he was breathing, alright? So like, that's why I think people really weren't trying.\"\n\nGrima said Penny was \"commanding\" and stood over Neely \"until basically the police came.\"\n\nCNN has reached out to an attorney for Penny for comment on Grima's description of the incident but has not heard back.\n\nGrima said he took photos of Neely because he thought he was still alive and posted them to his Instagram account. He talked with a detective on Friday and provided the photos, he told CNN.\n\n\"It's horrific what homeless people have to go through - they're treated like something bad,\" said Grima, who is formerly homeless himself.\n\n\"It's dangerous, you know?\" he added. \"This is showing that people can kill homeless people when they're having a mental health episode and it's okay just because you felt fear.\"\n\nCNN's John Miller contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Manslaughter charge against Daniel Penny dismissed, jury to continue deliberating lesser charge Monday\n\nFollow:\n\nA judge granted a motion from Manhattan prosecutors to dismiss the more serious charge of second-degree manslaughter against Daniel Penny on Friday in his trial over the chokehold death of Jordan Neel y on a New York City subway last year.\n\nThe ruling clears the way for the jury to consider a remaining lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide. It came after a Manhattan jury said they were deadlocked twice on the manslaughter charge and Penny's defense attorneys renewed their motion for a mistrial.\n\nOver defense objections, Judge Maxwell Wiley agreed with prosecutors, who argued that dismissing the first count of second-degree manslaughter eliminates the defense's concern about a compromise verdict.\n\nPenny, 26, a former Marine, now faces a single charge of criminally negligent homicide in Neely's death, which carries a maximum penalty of four years in prison, significantly less than a potential maximum sentence of 15 years tied to the more serious charge. The judge could also choose to sentence Penny to no prison time if he is convicted.\n\nPenny could not have been convicted of both charges, according to the judge's instructions to the jury.\n\nWiley told the jury the second-degree manslaughter charge has been dismissed, functionally allowing them to now consider the remaining charge of criminally negligent homicide.\n\n\"What that means is you are now free to consider Count 2. Whether that makes any difference or not, I have no idea,\" the judge told the jury after updating them.\n\nJudge Wiley had instructed the jurors to keep deliberating after they were deadlocked on the charge earlier in the day. Penny's defense attorneys objected and moved for a mistrial over the deadlocked panel of 12 Manhattanites.\n\nAfter informing them of the manslaughter charge dismissal, Judge Wiley sent the jury home earlier than usual, telling the panel to \"think about something else\" over the weekend. The jury will return Monday morning to continue deliberations on the remaining charge.\n\n\"It's not time for a mistrial,\" Wiley told the attorneys outside the presence of the jury, after the jury first reported being deadlocked.\n\nShortly before the judge's ruling, lead prosecutor Dafna Yoran had indicated her office would drop the second-degree manslaughter charge if the jury could move on to consider the lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide.\n\nDefense attorney Thomas Kenniff objected to the motion, telling the judge he was unaware of any legal precedent for the prosecution's proposal and called it \"novel.\"\n\nGranting the proposal, Kenniff argued, would \"encourage prosecutors' offices to overcharge in the grand jury.\"\n\nPenny's defense attorney made clear they would appeal Wiley's decision if the jury ultimately convicts Penny on the criminally negligent homicide charge.\n\nWiley acknowledged there may not be an explicit precedent for his ruling, telling the attorneys, \"I'll take a chance and grant the prosecution's application.\"\n\nExplaining his rationale, the judge said it is a unique case because typically in an indictment including a lesser charge, there is a \"very clear\" difference between the counts, but in this case, he said, there is not.\n\n\"We are obviously very pleased with the Court's decision to withdraw the top count of this indictment,\" Keniff said in a statement Friday evening. \"However, we have always maintained that Danny acted reasonably in restraining Jordan Neely, and justice will not be served until he is acquitted of criminally negligent homicide as well. We are hopeful that will happen when the jury returns on Monday.\"\n\nRelated article Shaken subway riders, military chokeholds, a death certificate: How prosecutors built their case against Daniel Penny\n\nNeely, a 30-year-old street artist who struggled with homelessness, mental illness and drugs, had entered a New York City subway car on May 1, 2023, and began acting erratically. He threw down his jacket and yelled at passengers that he was hungry and thirsty and didn't care whether he died, witnesses said. Penny, a subway passenger, grabbed Neely from behind in a chokehold, forced him to the train floor and restrained him there for several minutes. When police arrived and Penny let go of the hold, Neely was nonresponsive.\n\nSeveral minutes of the chokehold were captured on bystander video that quickly went viral. That video, as well as Penny's interview with NYPD investigators explaining his actions and autopsy findings, were central pieces of evidence in the trial.\n\n\"I wasn't trying to injure him,\" Penny told police. \"I'm just trying to keep him from hurting anybody else. He was threatening.\"\n\nProsecutors have said Penny acted recklessly by restraining Neely in a chokehold for so long, even after Neely stopped moving, while his defense has said he was acting to protect others from a threat.\n\nThe case has polarized NYC residents, many of whom have personal experiences with disorder on the subways, and raised broader questions about mental health, race relations and the line between protector and vigilante. Black Lives Matter protesters have added Neely's name to its roll call of victims - including just outside the courthouse - while others have praised Penny's efforts to try to protect others.\n\nIn closing arguments Monday , the defense argued Penny \"was justified in the actions he took to protect the other riders.\"\n\nNeely \"was on a collision course with himself\" and Penny \"acted when others could not,\" defense attorney Steven Raiser said during his two-hour closing argument.\n\nThe defense also has challenged the medical examiner's determination Neely died from the chokehold and suggested the charges were brought because of \"a rush to judgment based on something other than medical science.\"\n\nProsecutor Dafna Yoran, in her closing arguments, said Penny intended to protect fellow passengers but \"he just didn't recognize that Jordan Neely's life too needed to be preserved.\"\n\n\"We are here today because the defendant used way too much force for way too long in way too reckless of a manner,\" she said.\n\nThe trial began with jury selection in late October and has featured testimony, video and 911 calls from subway riders, responding police officers and martial arts and medical experts.\n\nThe prosecution called more than 30 witnesses to the stand, including one man who helped restrain Neely's arms during the struggle and testified he advised Penny to loosen his grip. \"I'm going to grab his hands so you can let go,\" Eric Gonzalez told Penny, according to his testimony.\n\nFurther, Gonzalez could be heard in video footage of the incident saying that Penny wasn't \"squeezing\" Neely's neck in the 51 seconds before he released the chokehold. Gonzalez also testified he initially lied to investigators about what he saw and did on the subway out of fear he would be \"pinned\" for the killing. Prosecutors promised not to charge him in the case, he testified.\n\nIn addition, the Marine Corps martial arts expert who trained Penny in chokeholds testified that Penny was aware the holds could be lethal.\n\nRelated article Daniel Penny's lawyers argue he protected others, prosecutors say he 'went too far' as NYC subway manslaughter trial begins\n\nSeveral subway riders testified they were terrified Neely was going to attack and that they were relieved when Penny put him in a chokehold and kept him there.\n\n\"Restraining him for the moment was a relief, but if he would have gotten up, he would have done what he would have done,\" subway rider Caedryn Schrunk said.\n\nThe defense's case focused on emphasizing Neely's threatening behavior, character witnesses from Penny's time in the US Marines and challenges to the medical cause of Neely's death.\n\nPenny served four years in the Marines as a sergeant, from 2017 to 2021, with his last duty assignment at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, according to military records.\n\nThe city medical examiner who performed Neely's autopsy, testifying for the prosecution, ruled the cause of his death was \"compression of neck (chokehold).\" She made that determination after performing an autopsy and watching the cell phone video on the subway but did not wait for the toxicology report, she testified.\n\nThe defense presented its own medical expert who said Neely died of a combination of factors, including a sickling crisis linked to his sickle cell trait, a schizophrenic episode, the struggle and restraint by Penny and K2 intoxication.\n\nThe jury began deliberating on Tuesday afternoon. Over the first two days of deliberations, jurors sent several notes to the court requesting to review video evidence and rehear parts of the jury instructions and testimony during the trial.\n\nSeparately, Neely's father filed a lawsuit in New York Supreme Court on Wednesday accusing Penny of assault, battery and causing Neely's death. Andre Zachery, who is listed as the administrator of Neely's estate, accused Penny of having caused the death \"by the reason of the negligence, carelessness and recklessness.\" The suit does not specify the amount of money the family is seeking.\n\nPenny's defense attorney Kenniff did not respond to a request for comment on the suit.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

Charges have not been filed in the case, which is under investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nBefore his death, Neely had been on a NYC Department of Homeless Services list of the city's homeless with acute needs - sometimes referred to internally as the \"Top 50\" list - because individuals on the list tend to disappear, a source told CNN.\n\nThe list is generally not made public but is compiled in hopes that outreach organizations will be on the lookout for those individuals and alert the city's homeless services department to intervene, the source said.\n\nThe agency places additional focus on trying to find those on the list and give them the help they need, the source explained.\n\nCNN has reached out to NYC DHS for comment.\n\nRelated article The man who held Jordan Neely in a fatal chokehold 'never intended to harm' him, his attorneys say\n\nThose who knew Neely say he was a talented dancer who eked out a living as a Michael Jackson impersonator in Times Square and on New York's subways. But he fell on hard times in recent years, according to a friend and a relative, finding himself living on the street and struggling with his mental health after the trauma of losing his mother as a teenager.\n\nPrior to his killing, Neely had a lengthy arrest record with New York police, a law enforcement source told CNN's John Miller, including 42 arrests on charges including petty larceny, jumping subway turnstiles, theft, and three unprovoked assaults on women in the subway between 2019 and 2021.\n\nA witness told CNN although Neely was acting erratically on the subway, he did not harm anyone nor did they see him armed with a weapon.\n\n\"Passengers are not supposed to die on the floor of our subways,\" Neely family attorney Lennon Edwards said.\n\nHis death comes at a moment when New York City continues to grapple with the fundamental issues of a growing population of unhoused people and a mental health crisis - despite government efforts to alleviate the challenges.\n\nThe passenger who held Neely down, Daniel Penny, is a 24-year-old US Marine veteran and his attorneys have called the incident an \"awful tragedy.\"\n\nPenny's attorneys have said Neely had been \"aggressively threatening\" passengers and that Penny and others had \"acted to protect themselves.\"\n\n\"Daniel never intended to harm Mr. Neely and could not have foreseen his untimely death,\" the law firm of Raiser and Kenniff, P.C. said in a statement Friday. \"We hope that out of this awful tragedy will come a new commitment by our elected officials to address the mental health crisis on our streets and subways.\"\n\nRelated article What we know about Jordan Neely's chokehold death on the New York subway\n\nAs days pass since Neely's death, protesters continue to call for charges in the case.

      "text": "Daniel Penny found not guilty in chokehold death of Jordan Neely\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nDaniel Penny was acquitted Monday of criminally negligent homicide in the chokehold death of Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old homeless man with a history of mental illness whose final moments on a New York City subway train were captured on bystander video that set off weeks of protests and drew national attention.\n\nThe decision, on the fifth day of deliberations, came after the jury deadlocked Friday on the more serious charge of manslaughter , leading the judge to dismiss it. Penny faced up to four years in prison.\n\nAs the jury foreperson read the \"not guilty\" verdict, some observers in the courtroom applauded. Others began to audibly sob and yell, including Neely's father, Andre Zachery, who was escorted out.\n\n\"This is America. That is the sound of Black pain,\" one person said outside of the courtroom in Lower Manhattan to the reaction.\n\nChants of \"no justice, no peace,\" could be heard echoing from outside.\n\nThe case divided people in New York - and beyond - in some cases along political and racial lines. Neely was Black. Penny is white. Some people viewed Penny as callous and his actions as criminal on the day he encountered Neely, who had been shouting and acting erratically when he boarded a subway train in Manhattan on May 1, 2023. Others contend Penny was selfless in his attempt to protect fellow passengers.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said he respected the jury's verdict. The jury deliberated for about an hour on the criminally negligent homicide charge after about four days spent considering the manslaughter charge.\n\n\"Their lengthy deliberation - and the totality of the facts and the evidence - underscored why this case was put in front of a jury of Mr. Penny's peers,\" Bragg said in a statement.\n\nThe anonymous jury, made up of seven women and five men, were told before they began deliberating that they had to come to a unanimous decision on the top charge of manslaughter in the second degree before moving on to consider criminally negligent homicide. But Judge Maxwell Wiley changed that order Friday after jurors twice sent a note saying they could not reach an agreement.\n\nThe judge had also instructed jurors to decide whether Penny's actions caused Neely's death and, if so, whether he had acted recklessly and in an unjustified manner.\n\nBefore he encountered Penny, Neely, a former Michael Jackson impersonator, ranted about being hungry and thirsty and said that he wanted to return to jail and didn't care if he lived or died, witnesses testified. Penny, 26, a former Marine and Long Island native, placed Neely in a chokehold that prosecutors said lasted almost six minutes.\n\nA New York City medical examiner ruled that Neely died from compression to his neck as a result of the chokehold.\n\nNeely's uncle, Christopher Neely, said he was \"taken aback\" as the verdict was announced because he thought the jury would at least convict him on the lesser charge.\n\n\"At least give him a charge because it should be some type of penalty that should have been been handed down to Danny Penny period. They gave him no penalty, and I feel like the jury gave up on us,\" Neely said.\n\nDonte Mills, a lawyer representing Neely's family, said at a news conference that he was disheartened by the verdict Monday, as supporters held up a picture of Neely dressed as Jackson. Mills asked that Neely's death have meaning, and urged that others, instead of becoming physical with someone who may be hungry, offer them food.\n\n\"He had a muffin in his pocket,\" Mills said of what police later discovered in Neely's jacket. \"Jordan just wanted someone to acknowledge him on the train, but instead, he was choked to death.\"\n\nLawyers for Penny could not immediately be reached for comment about the verdict, but had earlier expressed concern Monday to the judge that the jury could be influenced by the demonstrators' chanting coming from outside the courthouse.\n\nDuring the trial, Penny's attorneys told jurors that he stepped in because he believed Neely might attack other passengers and he intended only to restrain him until police arrived, which Penny also told police. They also argued that Neely was not killed by the chokehold and that it was impossible to measure how much pressure Penny had applied.\n\nA forensic pathologist hired by the defense testified that Neely died from a combination of his schizophrenia, synthetic marijuana, sickle cell trait and the struggle from being in Penny's restraint. But the medical examiner who performed the autopsy on Neely, Dr. Cynthia Harris, told jurors it was her medical opinion \"that there are no alternative reasonable explanations\" for his death and that those proposed by the defense were \"so improbable - that it stands shoulder to shoulder with impossibility.\"\n\nDuring cross-examination, one of Penny's attorneys, Steven Raiser sought to cast doubt on Harris' testimony about how she and her colleagues had come to a unanimous decision as to Neely's cause of death. Raiser suggested that they had failed to consider all the facts before making that determination.\n\nHe revisited that claim in his closing argument last week.\n\n\"I submit to you there was a rush to judgment, based on something other than medical science,\" he told jurors.\n\nThe case also spurred debates about safety within the city's subway system and failures in addressing homelessness and mental illness, both of which Neely had struggled with. Jumaane Williams, a Black Democrat who is New York City's public advocate, was among those who questioned why police let Penny go after questioning him at a precinct hours after Neely's killing. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, also a Democrat, said Neely had been \"murdered.\" Prominent Republicans like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Matt Gaetz praised Penny and promoted a fundraiser for his legal fund, which has raised more than $3 million. His defense team includes Thomas Kenniff, a Republican who ran unsuccessfully for Manhattan District Attorney in 2021.\n\nVice President-elect JD Vance said on X in response to the verdict that \"justice was done in this case. It was a scandal Penny was ever prosecuted in the first place.\"\n\nProsecutors did not dispute that Neely's actions on the train scared many of the passengers or that he was on synthetic cannabinoids, which were found in his system. In her opening statement, Dafna Yoran, an assistant prosecutor with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, said that Neely had \"demanded to be seen\" and that despite his not having touched anyone and not having displayed a weapon or threatened to use one, many people in the subway car were frightened of what he might do.\n\nShe has said Penny's \"initial intent was even laudable,\" but that he was reckless when he continued to choke Neely even after he posed no threat, including after the train doors had opened at the next station and passengers could exit. For some of that time, she said and video showed, two other men helped restrain Neely. One of those men testified that he believed Penny had held the chokehold for too long. At times, Yoran said, he even ignored the pleas of bystanders to let Neely go. In her closing argument, Yoran said that \"no one had to die\" and that Penny was not justified in his use of physical deadly force.\n\n\"You obviously cannot kill someone because they are crazy and ranting and looking menacing,\" Yoran told jurors in her closing argument. \"No matter what it is that they are saying.\"\n\nShe also said that Penny \"could have easily restrained\" Neely \"without choking him to death.\"\n\nIn his closing argument, Raiser prompted jurors to imagine that they were on the train the day Neely boarded \"filled with rage and not afraid of any consequences.\"\n\n\"With you sitting much as you are now in this tightly confined space, looking up at Mr. Neely,\" he said. \"You have very little room to move and nowhere to run.\"\n\n\"Danny,\" as the defense attorneys referred to Penny throughout the trial, \"put his life on the line\" and stepped up in the absence of police, Raiser said.\n\nBut Yoran challenged the portrayal of Penny as a self-sacrificing and benevolent subway rider. In her opening statement she said that Penny failed to acknowledge Neely's humanity. She continued that thread in her closing argument, playing video of Penny twice referring to Neely as a \"crackhead\" in an interview with police and telling jurors that he never asked about Neely's condition.\n\n\"There is something else that is glaringly missing from his statement. Any regret. Any remorse. Any self reflection,\" she said. She added: \"He never expresses any sorrow about the man's death.\"\n\nDuring deliberations, jurors asked to rewatch bystander videos of Penny restraining Neely, responding officers' body camera videos and video of Penny's subsequent interview with two police detectives at a precinct. They also asked to rehear the medical examiner's testimony about issuing a death certificate before Neely's full toxicology reports were completed. They also asked for the judge to read back the definitions of recklessness and criminal negligence and to have the definitions in writing.\n\nPenny chose not to testify. During the trial, jurors heard from more than 40 witnesses - subway passengers who witnessed Penny restrain Neely, police officers who responded to the scene, a Marine Corps instructor who taught Penny various chokeholds , the two pathologists, a psychiatric expert and six character witnesses , who included two Marines, Penny's mother and one of his sisters.\n\nOn Wednesday, Neely's father sued Penny accusing him of negligent contact, assault and battery that caused Neely's death. The civil suit was filed in New York state's Supreme Court, a trial-level court in New York state.\n\nJanelle Griffith is a national reporter for NBC News focusing on issues of race and policing.\n\nErik Ortiz is a senior reporter for NBC News Digital focusing on racial injustice and social inequality.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Daniel Penny's chokehold was sole cause of Jordan Neely's death, medical examiner testifies\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nJordan Neeley's death was a direct result of the chokehold Daniel Penny held him in, a medical examiner testified Friday, rebutting assertions from the defense team that the former Marine did not apply enough pressure to kill the subway rider and that his death could have had some other cause.\n\n\"It's my medical opinion that there are no alternative reasonable explanations for Mr. Neely's death,\" the medical examiner, Dr. Cynthia Harris, told jurors.\n\nHarris ruled Neely died from \"compression of neck (chokehold)\" days after his killing. More than a month later, a grand jury indicted Penny on a manslaughter charge.\n\nAttorneys for Penny, who is also charged with criminally negligent homicide, have refuted the medical examiner's findings . In his opening statement, one of the attorneys, Thomas Kenniff, said Penny had restrained Neely with a \"variation of a nonlethal chokehold\" borrowed from martial arts training he had been taught in the Marine Corp.\n\nThe trial is in its fourth week and is expected to last through Thanksgiving.\n\nPenny, 26, who was studying architecture before his arrest, had just left class and was on his way to the gym when he encountered Neely on an uptown F train on the afternoon of May 1, 2023, his attorneys have said.\n\nWhen Neely, who had a history of mental illness and homelessness, boarded the train, he shouted at passengers, threw his jacket to the ground, talked about being hungry and thirsty and made statements about hurting people and wanting to go back to jail for life, witnesses have testified. He had synthetic cannabinoids in his system when he died.\n\nPenny told two detectives in an interview at a precinct hours after Neely's killing that he had acted to protect other passengers, that he did not put pressure on Neely's neck and that he did not intend to kill him, according to a video of the interview that was shown in court Thursday. One of those detectives testified under cross examination that neither he nor the other detective had told Penny that Neely was dead when they interviewed him.\n\nProsecutors have sought to convince jurors that while Penny's initial intent may have been \"laudable,\" his actions became \"unnecessarily reckless\" when he refused to let go of Neely, even after he had gone limp, the train had arrived at the next station and passengers were able to exit the subway car.\n\nThe prosecutors, the defense team and witnesses have said that some passengers feared Neely. But prosecutors have also said that no witnesses testified to seeing him display a weapon, threaten the use of a weapon or touch anyone before Penny wrapped his arms around him from behind and took him to the floor. A muffin was found in Neely's jacket after he was killed.\n\nThe case has raised questions about safety within the city's subway system, as well as about whether race played a role in Penny's actions - Neely was Black and Penny is white.\n\nNeely made his last voluntary movement before Penny let go of his neck, Harris testified, citing a video recording of those moments played in court. She explained frame by frame the precise moment Neely stopped breathing and went limp.\n\nHarris directed jurors to moments in the video when she said Neely was struggling to breathe, making a hand gesture as a signal for help and when she observed his face had turned \"uniformly purple\" and he began twitching.\n\n\"I believe that at this point he has lost consciousness,\" she said. \"And that what we will see in the form of these twitchings represent brain injury.\"\n\nAssistant District Attorney Dafna Yoran questioned Harris about witnesses testifying that they did not hear Neely gag, gasp or say that he could not breathe. Harris said that did not surprise her.\n\nHarris said that it was also unsurprising that some witnesses, including responding officers, testified that Neely had a pulse minutes after Penny released him from the chokehold.\n\n\"That makes perfect sense,\" Harris said. \"Because this is an asphyxial death. So in asphyxial death, for lack of a better way of putting it, the brain dies first.\"\n\nA pulse can be maintained for about 10 minutes in those cases, she said.\n\nIt \"indicates that he had a normal functioning heart in a dying body,\" Harris testified.\n\nDuring his cross examination, defense attorney Steven Raiser sought to cast doubt on Harris' findings by suggesting that she had been influenced by the video of Penny choking Neely.\n\n﻿He also questioned her about why she issued her ruling as to the cause of death before toxicology reports had been completed.\n\n\"No toxicological result imaginable was going to change my opinion,\" Harris said.\n\nBystander video recorded by a freelance journalist that was widely shared online showed Penny holding Neely in a chokehold as he tried unsuccessfully to break free. Prosecutors have said Penny held Neely for almost six minutes. Two other men also helped to restrain Neely for some of that time. One of those men testified Tuesday that he had tried to convince Penny to loosen his grip on Neely.\n\nOn Thursday, a former Marine who trained Penny in various types of holds when they served together said he may have applied a chokehold improperly. The trainer, Joseph Caballer, told jurors that video appeared to show Penny trying to use a blood choke, which, if deployed properly, could cut off oxygen to a person's brain in eight seconds.\n\nCaballer said that as Penny and Neely struggled on the floor of the subway car, it is possible the hold could have turned into an air choke, which takes longer to render a person unconscious. He said the air choke is not taught by the Marine Corps.\n\n\"Once the individual is rendered unconscious, that's when you are supposed to let go,\" Caballer said.\n\nMore than two dozen other witnesses have testified, including police officers, passengers and members of the transit authority.\n\nOn Tuesday, Eric Gonzalez, a subway rider who helped Penny restrain Neely, testified that when he had came upon the two men, Penny had his legs around Neely's waist and his arm around his neck.\n\nHe said he \"jumped in and tried to help\" without knowing why Penny was restraining Neely. Gonzalez said that after he held Neely's wrist, he told Penny: \"You can let him go. I am holding on to him,\" but Penny continued to choke Neely while Gonzalez held on to his arms and wrist. Gonzalez testified that he and Penny let go of Neely after he went limp.\n\nCORRECTION (Nov. 16, 2024, 11:53 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article mischaracterized a medical examiner's finding. Chokehold was found to be Jordan Neely's cause of death, not the manner of death.\n\nJanelle Griffith is a national reporter for NBC News focusing on issues of race and policing.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

The situation escalated and he was held in a chokehold for about 15 minutes by a 24-year-old subway rider, according to an eyewitness. Neely was found unconscious by responding officers and was pronounced dead at the hospital.\n\nThe incident has raised questions over the city's social safety net and mental health resources for the homeless community and cast scrutiny on city leadership as no charges have been filed in connection with his death.\n\nPolice were called to reports of a physical fight inside the Broadway-Lafayette station in Manhattan around 2:30 p.m. Monday.\n\nThe investigation found that Neely was \"engaged in a verbal dispute with a 24-year-old male\" that escalated into a physical altercation, police said. During the \"physical struggle,\" Neely lost consciousness.\n\nCellphone video taken by passenger Juan Alberto Vazquez showed the 24-year-old man on the ground with his arm around Neely's neck. Two other subway riders appear to help restrain Neely, who was Black.\n\nVazquez told NBC New York that Neely got on the train and \"began to say a somewhat aggressive speech, saying he was hungry, he was thirsty, that he didn't care about anything, he didn't care about going to jail, he didn't care that he gets a big life sentence.\"\n\nVazquez said Neely was held in the chokehold position for about 15 minutes.\n\nNeely was unconscious when police arrived, and he was pronounced dead at a hospital.\n\nHe died of \"compression of neck (chokehold)\" and the manner of death was ruled a homicide by the city's chief medical examiner's office said.\n\nImmediately after the incident, the 24-year-old man was taken into custody for questioning and released.\n\nA police spokesperson said that after the autopsy report revealed the cause of Neely's death as homicide, the district attorney's office is investigating the matter and will decide on whether or not to charge the 24-year-old.\n\nNeely was a familiar face to many New Yorkers - a busker who often performed dance routines in a Michael Jackson costume on the subways and in Times Square.\n\nManhattan Borough President Mark Levine remembered Neely affectionately in the wake of his death, saying he saw Neely perform his Michael Jackson routine many times on the A train.\n\n\"He always made people smile,\" Levine said. \"Our broken mental health system failed him. He deserved help, not to die in a chokehold on the floor of the subway.\"\n\nNeely suffered from mental illness \"which began at age 14 when he experienced the brutal murder of his mother,\" a law firm hired by his family, Mills & Edwards LLP, said in a statement Thursday.\n\nAccording to a 2012 NJ.com report, Neely's mother, Christie Neely  was strangled to death in a home in New Jersey that she shared with Shawn Southerland in April 2007. Her body was found stuffed in a suitcase that was dumped on a roadway, the report said.\n\nNeely was 18 when he testified in the trial against Southerland in 2012.\n\nNeely had a lengthy criminal history, with charges including assault and disorderly conduct, law enforcement sources with knowledge of the case said, NBC New York reported.\n\nThe Neely family has since retained Mills & Edwards LLP to represent them, saying they are \"committed to holding accountable the MTA and Neely's killer.\"\n\nAttorney Lennon Edwards said: \"I took this case because 15 minutes is too long to go without help, intervention and without air. Passengers are not supposed to die on the floor of our subways.\"\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney's Office is reviewing the case of Neely's death, saying: \"This is a solemn and serious matter that ended in the tragic loss of Jordan Neely's life.\"\n\nIn the probe, the district attorney's office will review the medical examiner's report, medical records, all available video and photo evidence, and interview as many witnesses as possible, a spokesperson for the office said.\n\nThere's no timeline for when the district attorney's office will return a decision on charges.\n\nAttorney Donte Mills, who is representing the Neely family, said he would be surprised if charges were not filed in the case in an interview that aired Friday morning on the \"TODAY\" show.\n\n\"It would be incredible to me if the outcome of this was no charge, because how can you say that it's okay for someone to strangle someone,\" he said.\n\nSince then, there have been calls for action in releasing the 24-year-old subway rider's name and charging him in connection with Neely's death.\n\nOn Friday, protesters were seen outside the Manhattan District Attorney's office with signs that said \"Jordan Neely Deserved Better From New York,\" \"Justice for Jordan\" and \"Indict the Coward.\"\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul told reporters that the video of the subway altercation was \"horrific\" and that the subway riders' response to Neely was \"very extreme.\" She appeared in favor of charging the 24-year-old, saying \"there have to be consequences and so we'll see how this unfolds but his family deserves justice.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Mayor Eric Adams said he will let the district attorney's investigation play out.\n\n\"There are many layers to this. I'm gonna let the process follow its course, and so I won't get engaged with comparisons on where we are, where we aren't. I'm not going to do that. I'm going to let the investigation run its course,\" he said.\n\nCity Council Speaker Adrienne Adams said Neely \"was a New Yorker, a son, and a performer, and he should still be alive,\" in a statement Wednesday - and pointed to racism as a role in the lack of charges against Neely's assailant.\n\n\"Racism that continues to permeate throughout our society allows for a level of dehumanization that denies Black people from being recognized as victims when subjected to acts of violence,\" Adams added.\n\nState Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal, a Democrat, also called out the use of the chokehold, saying even police are banned from using it.\n\n\"There's no excuse for a civilian to use such a deadly maneuver, especially on someone experiencing a mental health crisis,\" he said.\n\nCORRECTION (May 8, 2023, 11:55 a.m. ET): A headline in a previous version of this article misstated who said Neely was held in a chokehold for 15 minutes. It was one witness, not witnesses and the police.\n\nMarlene Lenthang is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

He said the defense retained him a little over two weeks after Neely's killing.\n\nNeely, 30, who had a history of mental illness, shouted, threw his jacket to the ground and made distressing comments about being hungry and thirsty and wanting to return to jail when he boarded an uptown F train on May 1, 2023. Penny, 26, who was a passenger on the train, put Neely in a chokehold and took him to the ground. His attorneys have said that he did not intend to kill Neely and that he acted to protect the people around him.\n\nProsecutors have said Penny held Neely in the chokehold for six minutes, letting him go only after he had become unconscious and gone limp. Two other people helped him restrain Neely for some of that time. A bystander video of Penny choking Neely on the floor of the subway car, which was widely shared online, divided people in New York and beyond. Some viewed his actions as praiseworthy, while others condemned them and labeled him a vigilante.\n\nChundru's testimony contradicted that of Dr. Cynthia Harris, the medical examiner who performed the autopsy on Neely and ruled that he died of the chokehold . Chundru said he did not believe that Neely died of a chokehold or that Penny had applied consistent and sufficient pressure to render him unconscious.\n\nChundru said he believed Neely died from \"the combined effects of sickle cell crisis, the schizophrenia, the struggle and restraint and the synthetic marijuana\" that was in his system. He said he had reviewed Neely's autopsy report, two toxicology reports, genetic studies, photographs from the autopsy, \"a couple of videos of the incident,\" psychiatric records, witness statements and transcripts of police body camera video, among other things.\n\nNeely's father, Andre Zachery, hung his head as parts of the bystander video were shown Thursday, and he left the courtroom multiple times during Chundru's testimony, including after he said Neely had not died of a chokehold.\n\nChundru criticized Harris, who told jurors Neely suffered \"an asphyxial death,\" for issuing a ruling about his cause of death before toxicology and other tests were complete.\n\nHarris, a prosecution witness, testified over three days and said she based her decision on the autopsy findings coupled with the video and the investigative information about it, as well as with knowledge of Neely's use of synthetic cannabinoids. She was in the courtroom Thursday during Chundru's testimony.\n\nOne of Penny's attorneys, Steven Raiser, spent hours trying to poke holes in her findings and testimony. He questioned how she came to her conclusion without full toxicology results.\n\n\"No toxicological result imaginable was going to change my opinion,\" she said.\n\nHarris walked jurors through Penny's final moments, explaining down to the minute when he made his last purposeful movement. She also testified that within the medical examiner's office, the \"consensus was unanimous\" about Neely's cause of death.\n\nCross-examining Chundru, Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Dafna Yoran appeared to raise questions about the quality of his work, suggesting through a series of questions that he performed more autopsies a year than is recommended by the National Association of Medical Examiners, of which he is a member. Yoran will continue her cross-examination Friday.\n\nThe defense this week called six people to testify as character witnesses, including Penny's sister and mother. His sister, Jacqueline Penny, 27, an accountant, testified about their suburban upbringing in West Islip on Long Island, a small town that she described as neighborly and beachy.\n\nShe said Penny had always been \"patriotic,\" so she was not too surprised when he enlisted in the Marines after he graduated from high school because other men in their family had also served in the military.\n\nTheir mother, Gina Flaim-Penny, a teacher's assistant who lives in Queens, testified that she taught Penny to \"treat others equally as you would like to be treated\" and that she believed he did so. She said that when she and Penny's father divorced, it was difficult on all four of her children but that they stayed close and leaned on one another. She said that they went to family counseling and that her children also went to a counselor. She testified that she knew her son to be an empathetic, compassionate and peaceful person.\n\nAlong with Penny's sister and mother, four other character witnesses were called by the defense to testify to Penny's empathy, honesty and integrity. Their testimony followed evidence submitted by prosecutors that suggested Penny had lied during an interview with police.\n\nHours after Neely was killed, according to a video shown to jurors, Penny told two detectives in an interview at a precinct that he did not put pressure on Neely's neck and that he had released his chokehold as soon as he received confirmation from the two men who helped him restrain Neely that they were holding Neely. But last week, one of those men, Eric Gonzalez, testified that Penny continued his chokehold after Gonzalez told him, \"I will grab his hands so you can let go.\"\n\nJanelle Griffith is a national reporter for NBC News focusing on issues of race and policing.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Neely was unconscious when officers arrived and pronounced dead at a hospital. No charges have been filed against Penny.\n\nAt the time of his death, Neely was homeless and had mental illness, his family has said.\n\nDonte Mills, an attorney for Neely's family, told Al Sharpton on MSNBC's  \"PoliticsNation\" that Neely \"had demons\" as a result of his mother's murder. Family members had been trying to get him help, he said.\n\n\"We all know people who are on the brink of going through something major, a catastrophe where they just can't seem to get everything back together and that's where he was,\" he said. \"But he had a life that he was living and was reaching for.\"\n\nNeely was 14 when his mother, Christine Neely, was killed at their home. NJ.com reported that her body had been stuffed inside a suitcase and left on the Henry Hudson Parkway in New York.\n\nHer boyfriend, Shawn Southerland, was convicted at a trial that Neely, then 18, testified in. He told the court that he tried to say goodbye to his mother before school on April 4, 2007, but Southerland refused to let him enter the bedroom, NJ.com reported.\n\nMills said Neely learned his mother had been killed the night before and Southerland had dumped her body while he was at school. Southerland was sentenced to 30 years in prison for the crime.\n\n\"He had to live with the fact that he left his mother dead in their home. So, that's a lot to live with and he had troubles with that. But throughout his life, he was determined to make other people happy and that's what he did,\" Mills said.\n\n\"A part of that was entertaining. He really enjoyed Michael Jackson, he emulated him and his style,\" he continued.\n\nSeveral friends have spoken out about Neely's love for performing on subways and around the city . His personification of Jackson was loved so much in his neighborhood that his neighbor, Kizzy Gonzalez, had Neely perform at her son's birthday party.\n\nThe bash was more than 20 years ago, but she remembered it clearly. \"To see Jordan perform as Michael Jackson, my son really thought that was the real Michael Jackson,\" she said in a phone call Saturday.\n\n\"That's how great he was. He was always known as a great Michael Jackson performer, he took on the whole persona,\" she continued. \"He would spend his little change to buy the outfits to match what Michael Jackson wore in certain songs and certain videos.\"\n\nGonzalez's cousin, Lance Clarke, of Brooklyn, knew Neely from the neighborhood and recalled seeing him in costume on numerous occasions.\n\n\"He used to have a full, pristine Michael Jackson outfit and he would perform in that outfit,\" he said in a phone call.\n\nNeely seemed to take a \"downward spiral\" over the years, Clarke said, and his beloved costumes would look tattered and torn. Eventually, Neely stopped dancing and would just \"sit down on the train, not perform, not ask for money.\"\n\nOn several occasions, Clarke said he would tell Neely to get off the train and wait outside his apartment building while he gave him food and clothing.\n\n\"He just looked shattered. He looked just tired ... just a look of desperation and lack of hope,\" he said.\n\nGonzalez said the Neely she knew was always \"soft-spoken\" but \"troubled.\" The last time she saw him was about a year ago. She said he seemed to be \"in distress, and like he was going through hard times.\n\n\"Jordan was a troubled young man,\" she said. \"I just know him to have suffered a very traumatic life and a very traumatic childhood.\"\n\nSome witnesses told NBC New York that Neely was acting aggressively toward riders and threatened to harm them when he boarded the train Monday. Lawyers for Penny described a similar scene.\n\n\"When Mr. Neely began aggressively threatening Daniel Penny and the other passengers, Daniel, with the help of others, acted to protect themselves, until help arrived,\" the lawyers for Penny said in a statement Friday evening. \"Daniel never intended to harm Mr. Neely and could not have foreseen his untimely death.\"\n\nCellphone video captured by one witness showed Penny on the ground with his arm locked around Neely's neck. The witness, Juan Alberto Vazquez, told NBC New York that Neely was held in the chokehold position for about 15 minutes .\n\nThe city chief medical examiner's office said he \"died from \"compression of neck (chokehold)\" and the manner was homicide.\n\nPenny was taken into custody Monday, questioned by police and released. He has not been charged.\n\nThe incident sparked a national debate, with people denouncing vigilantism and some politicians demanding officials do more to address homelessness , mental health and violence on subways.\n\nAttorney Lennon Edwards told Sharpton that what happened to Neely is \"an open and shut case.\n\n\"There's no need to extend an investigation, so to speak, to determine that this man committed a killing and should have been arrested on the spot,\" he said.\n\nNeither Gonzalez nor her cousin has fully processed Neely's death. Clarke said he has not viewed the video because he isn't \"watching that boy get killed.\"\n\n\"Yes, someone on the train yelling is an uncomfortable feeling. But just because it makes you uncomfortable doesn't mean it's a dangerous situation,\" he said. \"Just because it makes you uncomfortable, it doesn't mean it gives you the right to take a person's life.\"\n\nGonzalez said she wants to see Penny arrested and charged. \"The justice system should do what they're supposed to do,\" she said. \"There are repercussions.\"\n\nMinyvonne Burke is a senior breaking news reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

A 24-year-old man from Queens, whose identity has not yet been verified, came up from behind him and put him in a chokehold for several minutes until Neely died.\n\nFor Donald Grant, a clinical psychologist in Los Angeles, the deadly act represents a white vigilantism that has become an ever-present threat to Black Americans, manifested in the killings of many men and women whose names have made up headlines and hashtags over decades.\n\n\"It reignites the terror in the souls of Black folks when we witness these killings of our people without trial, without jury, without adjudication,\" said Grant, author of the book \"White on White Crime: Old Lies in Contemporary Times.\"\n\n\"This vigilante activity is really a reminder of the dangerous conditions that Black Americans exist in now,\" he added.\n\nIt's not enough that Black people are killed, Grant said. It's that each killing requires \"public outrage for our humanity to be recognized in a way that doesn't allow us to be murdered like animals in public spaces.\"\n\nNeely died Monday because of \"compression of neck,\" a spokesperson for the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner said.\n\nThe outrage that Neely, who had a history of mental illness and was homeless , according to lawyers, could be strangled to death in front of passengers on a New York subway conjured concerns of vigilantes taking action against Black people, said Tyrone Irby, a native New Yorker who now lives in Durham, North Carolina. Irby said the incident reminded him of people like George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch captain who shot teenager Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida, in 2012; or Gregory and Travis McMichael, a father and son who gunned down Black jogger Ahmaud Arbery three years ago with their friend William Bryan. After Arbery's killing, Irby created Together We Stand, an organization that supports meaningful conversation among people of different races to bring about change.\n\n\"It's really disturbing,\" he said. \"If you're in New York and ride the subway, you will see homeless people and people having mental health episodes. They're angry. They're upset, but a high percentage of the time they're not threatening. You ignore them or move to another car. You don't attack them.\"\n\nJuan Alberto Vazquez, who was on the train and recorded the incident, told NBC New York that Neely boarded the subway car and began a \"somewhat aggressive speech, saying he was hungry, he was thirsty, that he didn't care about anything, he didn't care about going to jail, he didn't care that he gets a big life sentence, that 'It doesn't even matter if I died.'\" Vazquez said that while he and others in the subway car were scared, the 24-year-old approached Neely and put him in a chokehold for several minutes as two other men helped restrain him.\n\nNeely's death was declared a homicide by the medical examiner and no arrest had been made as of Friday morning. Grant said he fears \"nothing will happen to\" the man who put Neely in a chokehold.\n\nMario Williams, a civil rights attorney, said he passes a row of homeless people each morning en route to his office in downtown Atlanta. Sometimes they make comments, sometimes they act out. \"But no one goes up and chokes them,\" Williams said.\n\nTerence Lester, founder of Love Beyond Walls, an organization that advocates for the homeless, said he cried thinking of the similar issues faced by the population he works with, as he watched the video of Neely dying.\n\n\"This violent act toward this young man who struggled with mental health challenges has been fueled by criminalizing policies, and a racialized past,\" Lester said. \"Punishment towards a vulnerable population can be fueled by hate itself. I wept because time and time again, I have had to write public apologies about the mistreatment that the unhoused community faces while also trying to wrestle through the most challenging moments of their life.\"\n\nGrant said he thinks the deaths of Neely - and Martin, Arbery and many others - stem from racism and the feeling of power that comes with taking matters into their own hands.\n\nThe pervasiveness of white superiority, Grant said, means that members of that group can often express that superiority in fatal ways.\n\n\"And so white superiority ideology is a combination of all those things: historical context, white supremacy, racism, classism and a system that has been supported through literature, through film, through journalism. And those messages are consistent. We can't continue to excuse vigilantism.\"\n\nCurtis Bunn is a reporter for NBC BLK.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

The May 1 interaction was partly captured on cellphone video , and Penny was seen on the ground holding Neely, 30, in a chokehold on a northbound F Train in New York City.\n\nNeely, who was homeless, was a known subway busker who often performed as Michael Jackson.\n\nNeely was unconscious when officers arrived at the Broadway and East Houston Street subway station, and he was pronounced dead at a hospital, New York police said. The city's medical examiner said he died from \"compression of neck (chokehold)\" and declared the manner as a homicide.\n\nIn his statements Sunday, Penny reiterated that he did not intend to choke Neely and that he was trying to restrain him. He also disputed the account of Juan Alberto Vazquez, who recorded the video and has said Penny held Neely in a chokehold position for about 15 minutes.\n\n\"Some people say that I was holding onto Mr. Neely for 15 minutes. This is not true,\" Penny said. \"Between stops, it was only a couple of minutes, so the whole interaction, less than five minutes.\"\n\nVazquez's video does not show what happened before Neely was restrained. Vazquez told NBC New York that Neely entered the train and began to give a \"somewhat aggressive speech.\"\n\nNeely told passengers that \"he was hungry, he was thirsty, that he didn't care about anything, he didn't care about going to jail, he didn't care that he gets a big life sentence,\" Vasquez said.\n\nPenny accused Neely of uttering violent threats. He said he was fearful of Neely and \"couldn't sit still\" as he saw women and children being threatened.\n\n\"I was listening to music at the time, and he was yelling, so I took my headphones out to hear what he was yelling,\" Penny said in his video statement. \"And the three main threats that he repeated over and over was 'I'm going to kill you,' 'I'm prepared to go to jail for life,' and 'I'm willing to die.'\"\n\nIn the video statements, Penny also defended how he restrained Neely. He said that he adjusted his grip on Neely \"based on the force that he's exerting\" and that Neely was breathing in the video.\n\n\"I was praying that the police would come and take this situation over,\" he said. \"I didn't want to be put in that situation, but I couldn't just sit still and let him carry out these threats.\"\n\nA lawyer for Neely's family did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Neely's family has rejected accusations that he threatened physical violence .\n\n\"It is a character assassination and a clear example of why he believed he was entitled to take Jordan's life,\" the attorneys, Donte Mills and Lennon Edwards, said in a statement last month.\n\nPenny also said the accusations that he, a white man, was motivated by race to harm Neely were ridiculous. He denied accusations that his decision to restrain Neely, a Black man, was racially motivated when he told the New York Post that he was \"not a white supremacist.\"\n\n\"I didn't see a Black man threatening passengers. I saw a man threatening passengers,\" Penny said Sunday.\n\nMills said at the time in a statement about Penny's New York Post interview: \"This is an advertisement to soften the public's view of Daniel Penny who choked Jordan Neely to death. We never called him a white supremacist, we called him a killer.\"\n\nPenny was arrested last month and charged with second-degree manslaughter. Neely's family has said they believe the charge is too lenient and \"should be for murder.\"\n\nNeely's family has said he began struggling with mental illness at age 14 after the murder of his mother.\n\nChristine Neely was killed in 2007, stuffed inside a suitcase and left on the Henry Hudson Parkway in New York, NJ.com reported .\n\nNeely testified at the trial of his mother's boyfriend, Shawn Southerland, that he tried to say goodbye to his mother before school April 4, 2007. But Southerland refused to let him enter the bedroom, packed up and left, he said, according to NJ.com.\n\nSoutherland was sentenced to 30 years in prison.\n\nDoha Madani is a senior breaking news reporter for NBC News.

They said Penny's actions turned criminal when he kept choking Neely, even after he no longer posed a threat.\n\nBystander video of the two men that was widely shared online placed a spotlight on race relations, public safety within the city's subway system and on how the city addresses mental health and homelessness. Penny is white. Neely was Black. Neely had a history of psychiatric and drug problems, and, on the day he was killed, he had synthetic cannabinoids in his system.\n\nPenny's attorneys say the former Marine acted to protect himself and fellow passengers. They said he did not intend to kill Neely and did not apply enough pressure to do so.\n\nDefense witness Dr. Satish Chundru, a forensic pathologist and consultant, testified Thursday that he did not believe Neely had died of a chokehold . Chundru said Neely died from \"the combined effects of sickle cell crisis, the schizophrenia, the struggle and restraint and the synthetic marijuana\" that was in his system. He was one of the defense's two experts witnesses. Penny's attorneys also called six character witnesses, including his mother and sister.\n\nChundru's testimony was intended to refute the findings of New York City medical examiner Dr. Cynthia Harris, who performed Neely's autopsy and ruled that Penny's chokehold had killed him. She was a prosecution witness and testified over three days.\n\n\"It's my medical opinion that there are no alternative reasonable explanations for Mr. Neely's death,\" Harris told jurors a week ago.\n\nShe also testified that \"the consensus was unanimous\" within the medical examiner's office as to Neely's cause of death.\n\nHarris, who was in court Thursday and Friday during Chundru's testimony, was one of more than 30 witnesses called by prosecutors during the trial, including other passengers on the train the day Neely was killed.\n\nMuch of the final day of witness testimony Friday was dedicated to Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Dafna Yoran's cross-examination of Chundru. Yoran called attention to instances where, she said, Chundru's testimony contrasted with the findings of other medical professionals, including the American Society of Hematologists, and of his opinions in other cases.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, prosecutors also called New York City Police Officer Stephon Joefield as a rebuttal witness, to refute earlier testimony from Chundru that two people at the scene reported Neely was breathing after Penny let him go.\n\nJurors were shown a police body-camera video of Neely laying on the ground when Joefield responded to the subway. Joefield could be heard saying Neely was breathing. Joefield testified that Neely was unconscious and unresponsive when he arrived. He said he checked Neely's pulse and that he had one, but that neither he nor his partner had checked whether Neely was breathing.\n\n\"I assumed that because he had a pulse that he was breathing,\" Joefield testified.\n\nHarris, the medical examiner, previously testified that a pulse can be maintained for about 10 minutes after the brain dies in cases of asphyxial death.\n\nJanelle Griffith is a national reporter for NBC News focusing on issues of race and policing.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Neely had screamed threats, including about wanting to go back to jail for life, and talked about being hungry and thirsty when he boarded an uptown F train that day. Some witnesses testified that they were afraid of him. Penny put him in a chokehold that lasted about six minutes, prosecutors have said and evidence presented at trial has shown.\n\nPenny's attorneys have said he acted to protect himself and other subway riders from \"a seething, psychotic\" Neely. Prosecutors argue that Penny acted recklessly by releasing Neely only after he was already unconscious and had gone limp and that he failed to see his humanity.\n\nThe case put a spotlight on issues of race relations and public safety within the city's subway system. Penny, 26, is white. Neely, who was 30 when he died, was Black. Many, including elected Republican officials, have labeled Penny a hero and helped raise more than $3 million for his legal fund. But others have compared his actions to those of a vigilante.\n\nMonday began with testimony from Dr. Cynthia Harris, the medical examiner who performed the autopsy on Neely and ruled that he died from compression to his neck as a result of the chokehold . She took the stand Thursday afternoon and testified all day Friday and most of the day Monday.\n\nDuring hours of cross-examination, Steven Raiser, one of Penny's attorneys, sought to cast doubt on her finding, asking her whether it was possible Penny could have died from other causes, such as the synthetic cannabinoids that were in his system. She told jurors that of the 10,000 overdose deaths her office had reviewed in the last four years, only seven were caused by the drug Neely had consumed. And unlike Neely, she said, all seven of those people had abnormal hearts.\n\nRaiser also questioned her credentials, whether she and the city's medical examiner's office had been influenced by outside forces and whether she had provided evidence that Penny applied pressure for a length of time sufficient to cause Neely's death.\n\nAgain and again, Harris answered that she believed the chokehold was the most probable cause of Neely's death. Raiser also told her that she could not definitively say how much pressure Penny was applying to Neely's neck based solely on the bystander video she reviewed, which helped the case gain national attention. Harris testified Friday that she based her ruling on her autopsy findings, coupled with the video and the investigative information about it.\n\nIn response to a question from prosecutors under redirect, Harris testified that it was \"highly improbable\" that Neely could have died from another cause, including synthetic cannabinoids.\n\n\"There's a saying at our office, at OCME, that when something very improbable is being proposed, and it's that - what's being proposed is so improbable - that it stands shoulder to shoulder with impossibility,\" Harris said.\n\nPenny's older sister, Jacqueline Penny, was the first defense witness. She described their suburban upbringing in West Islip on Long Island, a community she said is very safe, beachy and neighborly. She said that they came from a close-knit family and that after their parents separated, when her brother was in high school, their grandparents were a source of support. She said that though she now lives in Miami, she and Penny remain close and that she was only a little surprised he enlisted in the Marines after he finished high school.\n\n\"He was always patriotic,\" she said, adding that other men in their family had served in the military, \"so it wasn't completely surprising.\"\n\nShe was followed by Alexandra Fay, a childhood friend of Penny's who said they grew up on the same block. She said their friendship has endured into adulthood, and, like his sister, she testified that she knew him to be honest and a person with integrity.\n\nOver the last four weeks, jurors also heard from responding officers , the man who recorded the video that helped the case gain national attention and other subway passengers.\n\nThe trial is expected to last through Thanksgiving.\n\nJanelle Griffith is a national reporter for NBC News focusing on issues of race and policing.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Two killings of Black homeless men highlight Democratsâ post-2020 divide\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nThe young Marine veteran who killed Jordan Neely will be charged with second-degree manslaughter today, nearly two weeks after putting the homeless subway performer who was reportedly shouting on a train in a deadly chokehold.\n\nA few days earlier, San Francisco supervisors urged the cityâs district attorney to release video evidence in the killing of Banko Brown, a homeless man shot by a security guard while allegedly shoplifting from a Walgreens.\n\nIn this article:\n\nThe response to both killings, from Democrats leading overwhelmingly Democratic cities, was conflicted â and a study in how the party changed in the three years since the murder of George Floyd inspired a massive protest movement for criminal justice reform.\n\nâTwo things can be true,â said California state Sen. Scott Wiener, who represents San Francisco. âPeople are definitely frustrated with property crime and some of the conditions on our streets. And people donât want to see other people get shot.â\n\nNew York Mayor Eric Adams, whose initial reaction to Neelyâs killing infuriated progressive activists by not condemning his killer, used a speech on Thursday to repeat that mentally ill people who posed a danger to themselves should be involuntarily confined, a position opposed by the New York Civil Liberties Union.\n\nâIf physiciansâ¦ find that the person has a mental illness, and is dangerous to themselves or others, they have the authority to admit that person and retain them for treatment, even if the person does not agree to it,â Adams said from city hall.\n\nThat response, said the NYCLU, âonly fuels stigma against homeless New Yorkers and those living with mental illness.â\n\nIn San Francisco, activists and left-leaning Democrats have condemned DA Brooke Jenkins for her handling of the Brown case â the killing of a Black trans man who had tried and failed to get supportive housing.\n\nJenkins, appointed by Mayor London Breed after voters recalled reform DA Chesa Boudin, initially said that the security guard who shot Brown âbelieved he was in mortal danger and acted in self-defense.â Brownâs advocates say those words could matter even if a case is eventually brought against the guard, possibly prejudicing a jury.\n\nâYou can be a defense attorney with one brain cell, and you can blow up that statement from the district attorney,â supervisor Dean Preston said at the boardâs public meeting this week, before the vote to urge the videoâs release.\n\nAdams and Jenkins were put in office by Democratic voters frustrated about crime and worried that liberal reformers were making it worse â Adams in a crowded mayoral primary, Jenkins after the Boudin recall. (She won re-election in her own right last November.) Adams defeated a more left-leaning field while talking about a return to police tactics that civil libertarians had sued over; Jenkins won after saying that her city was tired of being âmade fun of in the news across the country, because of the crime situation.â\n\nConservatives drove that backlash, too, and right wing media has been all over the Neely story, with many commentators noting the dozens of times he had been arrested. Some have portrayed his attacker, Daniel Penny, as a hero âÂ much like the vigilante Bernard Goetz , who became a polarizing household name after he shot four Black teenagers on a subway in 1984.\n\nBut theyâve also been a little slow to see that the movement that filled the streets in 2020 and that Republicans still criticize daily has lost ground and numbers, as elected Democrats got more nervous about rising crime rates and collapsing ridership on public transit. The protests over Neelyâs killing and Brownâs killing have been small, relative to what cities saw after prior high-profile deaths of Black men and women at the hands of police or civilians.\n\nReform advocates noticed the conflicted response by Democrats who embraced them three years ago. The Young Womenâs Freedom Center, where Brown worked to help at-risk women and trans people, called for âthe defunding of the police and juvenile carceral systemâ after he was killed, along with an end to âcontracting of armed securityâ and the âfalse narrativeâ that was justifying the cityâs police spending.\n\nIn an interview, the groupâs co-executive director Julia Arroyo said that young people were being victimized by media-driven panic about shoplifting: âEverythingâs behind glass, youâre constantly followed.â And at a rally, Arroyo said that the city was âkidnapping us and they are locking us up in jails and institutions.â\n\nWhile much of the political conversation around Neely has focused on why he had not been either jailed or reached by social services earlier, the picture of what went wrong is murkier. He had been listed as a priority by city agencies, referred to a psychiatric hospital in the past, and even been forced into a treatment facility as part of an assault charge â there was a warrant out for his arrest after he fled the institution.\n\nSteve Berg, the chief policy officer at the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said that enforcement or treatment approaches would fall short without a path to transitional housing âÂ something that cities have often struggled to do, in part because of local opposition to new facilities or programs.\n\nâThe solution is largely to get people housed, so theyâre not homeless, and to make treatment available on an immediate basis for anyone who wants it,â said Berg. âMost people do want it. But mental health treatment is not going to be effective for people who are living on the streets instead of permanent housing. Thatâs just the reality. Thereâs lots of research to back that up.â\n\nHe added that some elected officials were creating a âvery dangerous situation,â when they suggested that the killing of some homeless people might be justified.\n\nHomelessness has been an issue in the 2024 Republican primary, where candidates have cited it as proof of Democratic policy failures. Donald Trump has proposed banning âurban camping,â arresting violators, and giving them the option of treatment or prison. âThe homeless have no right to turn every park and sidewalk into a place for them to squat and do drugs,â he said in a video last month. âAmericans should not have to step over piles of needles and waste.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "Democrats, once vocal, all but silent on New York subway verdict\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nDemocrats who represent New York City in the House and Senate had muted, mixed reactions to Mondayâs acquittal of Daniel Penny â a break from progressive and racial justice activists back home, and a sign of how far the party has shifted away from its social justice posture of just a few years earlier.\n\nâItâs a New York jury. I canât say it was a gerrymandered jury,â said Rep. Greg Meeks, the chairman of the Queens Democratic Party. âIâm not sitting there, hearing all the evidence. The jury made a decision.â\n\nRepublicans hailed the verdict. Moments after Penny was found not guilty for the death of Jordan Neely, a homeless man he had held in a fatal chokehold after threatening subway passengers, House Speaker Mike Johnson called the defendant a âhero who saved lives.â Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who had condemned Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg over his prosecution of Donald Trump, credited the jury âfor doing the right thing,â and incoming Vice President JD Vance called it âa scandal Penny was ever prosecuted.â\n\nBy contrast, the partyâs New York-heavy leadership, including House Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Senate Leader Chuck Schumer, and incoming Congressional Black Congress chair Yvette Clarke, said nothing about the verdict on Tuesday.\n\nJust one New York Democrat criticized it. Rep. Jamaal Bowman, who represents a sliver of the Bronx and lost his 2024 primary after heavy spending by pro-Israel groups, published a 12-post X thread addressed âto white people,â linking Neelyâs death to the killings of George Floyd, Philando Castile, Trayvon Martin, and Breonna Taylor.\n\nâHe was sick. He was not a threat. He was subdued. Still not a threat,â wrote Bowman of Neely. âDaniel Penny choked him for 6 minutes. And killed him. We all watched it on camera, and he was still acquitted.â\n\nNo other congressional Democrat from New York fully echoed Bowman on Tuesday; conservative X accounts recirculated a May 2023 TikTok interview with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, criticizing Penny for not expressing âremorse,â but she did not react to the verdict. Manhattan Rep. Jerry Nadler, who said he âwould have decided the case the other way,â added that he understood why Penny was acquitted.\n\nâI think itâs a sign of how scared people are of the conditions in the subways, even though, objectively, crime rates are down,â Nadler told Semafor.\n\nIn this article:\n\nSome of the most prominent progressive groups in New York, and America, lambasted the verdict and fretted that it would put more Black people at risk.\n\nThe national NAACP said on Monday that the verdict had âgiven license for vigilante justice to be waged on the Black community without consequence.â The state Working Families Party, which has given its ballot line to most of the New York Democratic delegation, said that âEric Adams and his administration failed to call Neelyâs death what it was: a modern-day lynching.â And Jumaane Williams, the city Public Advocate elected with WFP support, said âthe system was okay with violence against marginalized peopleâ like Neely, and that the tragedy would not have happened had the two menâs races been reversed.\n\nWhile Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett shared the sentiments of activists, calling the verdict a âmiscarriage of justice,â most New York Democrats who talked to Semafor on Tuesday took another view.\n\nâI think everyone who does not sit in a courtroom for an entire trial should be careful about reaching judgments or conclusions about any given case,â said Brooklyn Rep. Dan Goldman, who had previously called Neelyâs death a âheartbreakingâ tragedy. âWhat something may look like on a video may ultimately be significantly changed by the law or the evidence.â\n\nQueens Rep. Grace Meng called the Penny case âsad,â and âobviously, one that shouldnât have happened.â Neely had bounced in and out of the cityâs criminal justice and mental health systems before the confrontation with Penny, and âin New York and around the country, we need to invest more in mental health resources. The victim should never have been in that situation.â\n\nBut Meng disagreed with the âlynchingâ characterization from New York WFP. âThat would not be my take,â she said. Rep. Tom Suozzi, whose district covers a small part of Queens and a larger part of Long Island, said he supported the juryâs decision.\n\nâI think itâs good practice for Democrats and Republicans to follow the jury system weâve set up in our country,â he said. âThatâs worked pretty well for over 200 years.â\n\nNew York Rep. Mike Lawler, who both parties see as a potential candidate for governor next year, told Semafor that the verdict was an embarrassment to DA Bragg and to Democrats who had defended his conduct in the job â including the Trump prosecution.âThese are the same people who fundamentally believe that violent criminals should be released back out onto the streets, but have no problem prosecuting law-abiding citizens,â Lawler told Semafor. âIâm not surprised that my colleagues had no comment on what was a just verdict.â\n\nThe Democratsâ hard thinking about what went wrong for them this year is happening in public and in private, in what they say and what they choose not to.\n\nItâs significant that just one New York Democrat, who is already heading for the exits, put the Penny verdict in the larger context of racial justice movements and police abuse.\n\nIn 2020, Democrats often walked in step â and, just once, in kente cloth â with the Black Lives Matter movement. They didnât do so this week, and that says something about how they are thinking about their image after 2024 election losses. New York City and its suburbs led the way on that.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

Plus: Both parties get ready for a proxy abortion war in Ohio, Liz Cheney goes on the air in New Hampshire, and Kentuckyâs Republican Secretary of State faces a primary battle against the âkooks.â\n\nTHE NEWS\n\nThe young Marine veteran who killed Jordan Neely will be charged with second-degree manslaughter today, nearly two weeks after putting the homeless subway performer who was reportedly shouting on a train in a deadly chokehold.\n\nA few days earlier, San Francisco supervisors urged the cityâs district attorney to release video evidence in the killing of Banko Brown, a homeless man shot by a security guard while allegedly shoplifting from a Walgreens.\n\nDAVIDâS VIEW\n\nThe response to both killings, from Democrats leading overwhelmingly Democratic cities, was conflicted â and a study in how the party changed in the three years since the murder of George Floyd inspired a massive protest movement for criminal justice reform.\n\nâTwo things can be true,â said California state Sen.

(She won re-election in her own right last November.) Adams defeated a more left-leaning field while talking about a return to police tactics that civil libertarians had sued over; Jenkins won after saying that her city was tired of being âmade fun of in the news across the country, because of the crime situation.â\n\nConservatives drove that backlash, too, and right wing media has been all over the Neely story, with many commentators noting the dozens of times he had been arrested. Some have portrayed his attacker, Daniel Penny, as a hero â much like the vigilante Bernard Goetz , who became a polarizing household name after he shot four Black teenagers on a subway in 1984.\n\nBut theyâve also been a little slow to see that the movement that filled the streets in 2020 and that Republicans still criticize daily has lost ground and numbers, as elected Democrats got more nervous about rising crime rates and collapsing ridership on public transit. The protests over Neelyâs killing and Brownâs killing have been small, relative to what cities saw after prior high-profile deaths of Black men and women at the hands of police or civilians.\n\nReform advocates noticed the conflicted response by Democrats who embraced them three years ago. The Young Womenâs Freedom Center, where Brown worked to help at-risk women and trans people, called for âthe defunding of the police and juvenile carceral systemâ after he was killed, along with an end to âcontracting of armed securityâ and the âfalse narrativeâ that was justifying the cityâs police spending.\n\nIn an interview, the groupâs co-executive director Julia Arroyo said that young people were being victimized by media-driven panic about shoplifting: âEverythingâs behind glass, youâre constantly followed.â And at a rally, Arroyo said that the city was âkidnapping us and they are locking us up in jails and institutions.â\n\nROOM FOR DISAGREEMENT\n\nWhile much of the political conversation around Neely has focused on why he had not been either jailed or reached by social services earlier, the picture of what went wrong is murkier. He had been listed as a priority by city agencies, referred to a psychiatric hospital in the past, and even been forced into a treatment facility as part of an assault charge â there was a warrant out for his arrest after he fled the institution.\n\nSteve Berg, the chief policy officer at the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said that enforcement or treatment approaches would fall short without a path to transitional housing â something that cities have often struggled to do, in part because of local opposition to new facilities or programs.\n\nâThe solution is largely to get people housed, so theyâre not homeless, and to make treatment available on an immediate basis for anyone who wants it,â said Berg. âMost people do want it. But mental health treatment is not going to be effective for people who are living on the streets instead of permanent housing. Thatâs just the reality. Thereâs lots of research to back that up.â\n\nHe added that some elected officials were creating a âvery dangerous situation,â when they suggested that the killing of some homeless people might be justified.\n\nTHE VIEW FROM DONALD TRUMP\n\nHomelessness has been an issue in the 2024 Republican primary, where candidates have cited it as proof of Democratic policy failures. Donald Trump has proposed banning âurban camping,â arresting violators, and giving them the option of treatment or prison. âThe homeless have no right to turn every park and sidewalk into a place for them to squat and do drugs,â he said in a video last month. âAmericans should not have to step over piles of needles and waste.â\n\nNOTABLE\n\nOHIO\n\nRepublicans in Columbus scheduled an August special election to make amending the state constitution more difficult, raising the threshold for passage from a simple majority to 60% of the vote. âHow stupid do you think the people of Ohio are?â House Democratic leader Allison Russo asked during a floor debate, where her party warned that the change was being proposed to make it harder for abortion rights advocates to win a referendum.\n\nThe Great Task, âRisk.â Ex-Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney launched a PAC not long after Trump-backed Republican Harriet Hageman defeated her in a primary for her seat. Running in New Hampshire, this is Cheneyâs first 2024 ad, 60 seconds of footage from the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021 and a voiceover about how Trumpâs âproven he is unfit for office.â\n\nRyan Quarles for Governor, âMud Slingin.ââ Kentuckyâs primary ends on Tuesday, and two candidates â Attorney Gen. Daniel Cameron and former U.N. Ambassador Kelly Craft â have spent most of the money in the race for governor. Quarles, the stateâs agricultural commissioner, is trying to run up the middle as the candidate who wonât go negative.\n\nWayne Williams for Colorado, âVote for Williams.â Colorado Springs started holding direct mayoral elections in 1979. No Democrat has won the (technically nonpartisan) office. Yemi Mobolade, who got the most votes in round one, doesnât belong to a party, but heâs supported by Democrats, and more liberal than Williams. The GOP candidateâs response: Mobolade could wreck Colorado Springs because he was âcaught supporting socialist policies like engineering âequitable outcomesâ with taxpayer money.\n\nNo Trumps here: The Harrisburg-based GOP pollster only tested what Pennsylvanians think of the president, his strongest-polling Democratic challenger, and the Florida governor who isnât running yet. Itâs a twist, and it finds the president holding onto more Democrats than Kennedy in the state where he was born; nearly one in three Democrats are conflicted if Kennedy gets the nomination. He runs stronger than the president with Republicans, getting 12% of them to Bidenâs 7%, but it doesnât make up for the drift in his base.\n\nPaid for by American Greatness, a pro-Trump website that celebrates the ex-presidentâs movement, this finds most Florida Republicans struggling to decide between him and DeSantis. No other candidate interests them right now, and Trump runs around the field largely because of voter confidence in how heâd handle the economy â a 26-point advantage over DeSantis. Florida Republicans who view both of them favorably break for Trump by 19 points. DeSantis, like most of the GOP field, has barely criticized Trump, and defended him from damaging investigations, but it hasnât made many MAGA converts.\n\nWHITE HOUSE\n\nDonald Trump returned to CNN for a prime time town hall that pleased his supporters and, Democrats say, gave them fresh material to throw at him next year.\n\nAmong the opposition researcher highlights: A proud endorsement of overturning Roe v. Wade, a lengthy defense of the infamous Access Hollywood tape, a perhaps legally risky reference to his handling of classified documents that he brought from the White House to Mar-a-Lago, and more claims that E. Jean Carroll, fresh off her court victory, was lying about him: âI swear on my children, which I never do, I have no idea who this woman [is].â (The media criticism of the town hall focused, mostly, on the decision to fill the audiences with Republicans and discourage it from booing.)\n\nWith two exceptions â ex-Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and ex-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie â Trumpâs GOP opponents blew off the Carroll verdict. âI think the focus has to be not to be distracted,â Nikki Haley told Hugh Hewitt on Wednesday. âThatâs why weâve got to leave the baggage and the negativity behind.â\n\nHaley campaigns in Iowa next week; Ron DeSantis arrives on Saturday, joining Rep. Randy Feenstra for his âfamily picnicâ event in deep red northwest Iowa. En route, he picked up endorsements from state Senate President Amy Sinclair and House Majority Leader Matt Windschitl.\n\nKentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams managed one of the first primaries during the COVID pandemic , cut bipartisan ballot access deals with the stateâs Democratic governor, and presided over a surge in GOP registrations. Heâs got two challengers in the May 16 Republican primary anyway â one supported by MyPillow founder Mike Lindell, both suggesting that Kentuckyâs elections can be rigged on the order of George Soros. And candidates like that have had some appeal in similar races.\n\nâIâve never polled this race,â Adams said in an interview. âI probably should haveâ¦ the people who hate my guts are really motivated.â He talked with Americana about his record and his âkookâ critics, and this is an edited transcript of the conversation.\n\nAmericana: Your campaign has said that electing you would mean âclosing the door on the clown show.â Can you unpack that a little? How would you close down the clown show?\n\nMichael Adams: Itâs not just me and my opponents on the ballot. Misinformation is on the ballot â whether weâre going to be a fact- and rationality-based government, when it comes to elections, or whether weâre gonna let conspiracy theorists run the show. Itâs important that we have free and fair elections in a legitimate system. Itâs also important for the image of our state and for our business environment that weâre not seen as a bunch of nut jobs, putting some kook into this very critical office.\n\nAmericana: How do you campaign against them? Do they confront you at events? I know that they were unhappy that they didnât get into a TV debate.\n\nMichael Adams: I donât really interact with them at Republican events. I just go up and make my case. Iâve talked about how I implemented photo ID to vote, how I cleaned up the voter rolls, how I transitioned the state to paper ballots so we can audit. Iâve banned ballot harvesting, by working with the legislature to pass a law. Iâve got a positive record of basically a conservative wish list, all the things that we on our side of the aisle wanted. So I donât interact with those guys. I do take shots on social media, but Iâm not gonna get into a mud-wrestling match.\n\nAmericana: One claim theyâve made is that there are still more registered voters than county residents in most of Kentucky, and the number keeps going up.\n\nMichael Adams: Itâs just made up. They never offer a basis for it other than their own math. Weâve put out a map from our office showing that 82 of our 120 counties actually have fewer voters on the rolls than they did before. Youâre talking about 320,000 voters in a state with 3.5 million registered voters. Thatâs a huge number. Itâs taken three years of painstaking work to do that. But my opponents, when they say this stuff,  the number changes, the number of counties changes, the number of registration changes, and itâs just wrong.\n\nAmericana: Youâve kept Kentucky in the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC) as some red states got out of it , over this worry that itâs funded by George Soros (it isnât). Why should a state stay in it?\n\nMichael Adams: I can tell you how itâs been beneficial to us. Number one, we had to use it because the rolls were so dirty that before I took office, a federal judge in Frankfort ordered my predecessor to join ERIC. Since then, weâve used it very successfully. We had a month where we took 10,000 dead voters off the rolls. None of them lived in Kentucky. They were all people that had lived in Kentucky previously, and then relocated, largely, to Florida. We never would have found that without ERIC. The state that quits it loses the benefit of being able to use that information efficiently.\n\nAmericana: Dozens of election workers and clerks have quit since 2020 after harassment from people who think that race was stolen. If you win again, what can you do to reverse that trend?\n\nMichael Adams: Iâll be honest, my power is limited. What I have done is trying to get their back. Iâve gone out of my way, on television, at events, and everywhere else explaining why the things that these folks are saying are false. We have an FAQ, an election rumor control page on our website. Weâre very proactive in confronting these things. And every time we debunk one of these conspiracy theories, that disappears, and then some new variant pops up six months later, just like COVID.\n\nIn 2020, they were saying, oh, weâre going to have all this mass fraud because youâre allowing people to not vote in person and mail in a vote. And then Donald Trump had the biggest victory heâd ever had in Kentucky, and Republicans won everything. We debunked the notion that we were gonna have all this mass fraud and Democrats were going to cheat. Things calmed down for a while, then in 2022, we had fringe candidates who lost by large margins, then sued us and demanded that there be recounts. Every time we debunk one of these theories, they donât accept any shame or responsibility. They just disappear into their burrows, and then they come back out with a new theory, like nothing ever happened.\n\nIf youâre enjoying Semafor Americana and finding it useful, please share with your family, friends and colleagues.\n\nTo assure this email doesnât go to your junk folder, add americana@semafor.com to your contacts.

      "text": "Principals\n\nPDB: McConnellâs fall\n\nHouse considers NDAA â¦ CNN : How suspected UnitedHealth CEO killer was caught â¦ Bloomberg : Russia encouraged Assad to leave Syria\n\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan arrives in Israel today, seeking common ground on Syria and making a final push to achieve a Gaza ceasefire before President Biden leaves office. Sullivanâs trip follows hundreds of Israeli airstrikes in Syria that sought to decimate the countryâs weapons arsenal; the White Houseâs John Kirby noted the Israelis have indicated the strikes will not be part of a long-term campaign, adding that the US doesnât want to see any actor make âit harder for the Syrian government to get at legitimate governance.â Meanwhile, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the US would support a new Syrian government that arises from an â inclusive and transparent process .â Such a move would potentially be a boon for a new Syrian government, if it paves the way for sanctions relief.\n\nDonald Trumpâs pick to lead the Federal Trade Commission, Andrew Ferguson, has something in common with outgoing chair Lina Khan: They both want to crack down on big tech companies . However, Ferguson, who is one of two existing GOP commissioners on the FTC and will not need to be confirmed by the Senate, comes at the issue from a different direction and will likely look to crack down on tech companies that conservatives accuse of stifling political speech. âThe Commission must use the full extent of its authority to protect the free speech of all Americans,â he wrote in a statement earlier this month. In addition to elevating Ferguson, a former chief counsel for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Trump also selected Mark Meador, a former aide to Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, to be confirmed as the third Republican on the FTC.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken will face a hostile panel of House lawmakers later today when he finally sits down before the Foreign Affairs Committee to testify on the US withdrawal from Afghanistan . Blinken will discuss the withdrawal âin the context of a two-decades-long war that took the lives of 2,500 Americans and cost more than $2 trillion,â a source familiar with his testimony said, noting that he will criticize the Trump-era Doha agreement for leaving the Taliban in a stronger position than it had been since 2001. Blinken will also commend officials who have worked to resettle thousands of Afghan allies in the US. House Republicans on the committee, who accused the administration of misleading the public about the withdrawal in a September report, recommended the top US diplomat be held in contempt of Congress for failing to appear following a subpoena.\n\nâ Morgan Chalfant\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar chairs her last Rules Committee hearing today before handing the gavel to incoming chair Sen. Mitch McConnell â with a very important guest. The Minnesota Democratâs panel will host US Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger, and she expects Manger will say heâs implemented all of the Senateâs 103 bipartisan recommendations to shore up the Capitol after the security lapses on Jan. 6. âItâs a culmination of a lot of hard work,â Klobuchar told Semafor. âIt was an all-out reform of some of these systems.â Among the big changes: Hiring hundreds more police officers (including Manger, who came out of retirement), installing a new architect of the Capitol, and boosting police morale. The changes âhave put us in a better place, not just for January 6s, but for any large-scale event,â Klobuchar said.\n\nâ Burgess Everett\n\nLegislation that would limit US investment in China still might hitch a ride on a short-term government funding bill this month . Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries objected to including the language in a defense bill out of opposition to that billâs restrictions on transgender health care, baffling backers of the bipartisan China measure. Jeffriesâ office told Semafor that âeveryone remains at the tableâ but added that ânothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to.â House Speaker Mike Johnson sounded more optimistic: âI think we have an agreement on outbound,â he said. Proponents are keeping up the pressure: Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, spoke with Jeffriesâ office over the weekend to push for the measureâs inclusion in the funding bill when it was clear it would fall out of the defense bill, a person familiar with the conversation said.\n\nâ Morgan Chalfant and Kadia Goba\n\nWall Street has its eye trained on key inflation data that the federal government will release today ahead of the Fed decision on rates next week . The Labor Department will release the consumer price index for November this morning, which is expected to show headline inflation rising slightly to 2.7%. âMarkets want to see a number that wonât be too disruptive to the Fed next week,â the head of investment strategy at Edward Jones told Reuters . The producer price index, another inflation gauge, is due on Thursday. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates by another quarter point on Dec. 18.\n\nPunchbowl News: House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers , R-Ala., took issue with House Speaker Mike Johnson âs inclusion of a provision restricting transgender health care for children of military families in the defense bill. Donald Trump âis going to stop all these social, cultural issues from being embedded as policies. So my point is, I donât know why this is going to be in the bill when on Jan. 20, itâs a moot point,â he said.\n\nPlaybook: Sen. Tom Cotton , R-Ark., edged out Sen.

      "text": "New York City wrongly imprisoned Yusef Salaam. Then it elected him.\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nThirty-three summers ago, Yusef Salaam was convicted of crimes that he didnât commit. He did not rape a jogger in Central Park. He reached adulthood in prison, like the rest of the âCentral Park Five,â all of whom had their convictions vacated after another man confessed to the crime. And on Tuesday, Salaam won the Democratic primary for a seat on New Yorkâs city council.\n\nâIâve been able to use my pain and turn it into purpose,â Salaam said in an interview this week, after defeating a longtime council member endorsed by Mayor Eric Adams. âWhat pushed everything over was people knowing I was so close to the pain â that I was, in fact, one of them. Iâm one of the people who had been left behind.â\n\nSalaam, whoâd left New York after leaving prison in 1997, returned to Harlem and was approached to run for something. He had 10 children, decades of criminal justice advocacy , and some priorities, like getting the Manhattan District Attorneyâs office to review more closed cases. And he was worried about Harlem, seeing âpeople who need to be repairedâ injecting themselves with drugs and sleeping outside of expensive apartment buildings.\n\nHe launched his campaign in February, laying out a progressive agenda : more affordable housing, âbaby bondsâ to build generational wealth, and protecting criminal justice reform from the current backlash. His first political conflict â the full-page ads that Donald Trump bought, in 1989 calling for him and four other boys wrongfully accused of rape to âbe executed for their crimes.â\n\nIn 2016, Salaam called Trump the âfirestarterâ of a public smear campaign. Given multiple chances to apologize, during that campaign and his presidency , Trump never did. In fact, he continued to suggest they were guilty and that the city was wrong to settle a civil rights lawsuit over their treatment. (The Trump campaign didnât respond to a question about Salaamâs win.)\n\nYet Trump would become an unwilling ally of Salaamâs campaign. On March 30, when Trump was indicted by Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg, Salaam responded with a tweet: âKarma.â The candidate got a surge of media coverage and endorsements.\n\nOn June 8, with early voting underway in New York, Trump was indicted again, and Salaam got more coverage, contrasting the way the justice system treated him with how it was handling a former president. Over the course of the race, the Salaam campaign clocked nearly 4,500 articles that mentioned their candidate. Just 90 mentioned Inez Dickens, the 73-year old state legislator and former council member Adams and other high-profile Black Democrats endorsed over Salaam.\n\nâWhen all of the stars line up, you canât control that,â Salaam said. âThere is a statement in Islam: Thereâs no movement except by the permission of God.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nStories like Salaamâs had powered the movement for police and criminal justice reform. Momentum for that cause ebbed in 2021, with Adamsâ victory, and receded again in 2022, when Republicans made gains across New York while relentlessly blaming bail reform and other changes, like the end of stop-and-frisk, for rising crime.\n\nBut on Tuesday, Salaam triumphed over a better-connected Democrat whoâd raised more money, and over skepticism that someone whoâd spent years outside the city could represent the district now.\n\nâItâs not what you do when you tweet, itâs what you do on the streets,â Adams had said at a rally for Dickens.\n\nWell-known progressive groups, like the Working Families Party, stayed out of the race, but Salaamâs story â honed by decades of public speaking and writing â was indelible. Reporters who walked precincts with him saw him get recognized, constantly. Dickens tried to outflank him on tricky issues, echoing Adams on how red states were creating an âadversarial situation between the asylum seekers and the Blacksâ by shipping migrants up to the city.\n\nâThat narrative was very false and unjust for migrants,â Salaam said. âThe language I heard from the other side was, like, âWe donât know their criminal history.â These were families that were traveling with their children. They were fleeing oppression, they were fleeing murder. They were fleeing because of the conditions of the countries that they were in. And they walked tremendous distances to get to the borders of America, to be arrested, and to be put in prison as they waited for their paperwork.â\n\nThe city showed it could âsolve forâ a migrant influx, he said, by converting a prison in the district into temporary housing. Its next question should be how to âsolve forâ homelessness. Salaam was concerned by the reaction to the killing of Jordan Neely, a mentally disturbed subway performer, and the rush by some Republicans to call the U.S. Marine who had put him in a chokehold a âgood Samaritan.â\n\nâWe can go right to the good book, and we can read about what a good Samaritan is,â Salaam said. âA good Samaritan wouldnât relieve a person of their life.â\n\nSome of the work ahead, said Salaam, was already knowable. Rikers Island was scheduled to close. Bail reform, which Republicans had campaigned to repeal, was still in effect. He would be advocating to keep reforms in place.\n\nâWe might find another Kalief Browder right now on Rikers Island, someone who needs to be released from prison because they were there unjustly,â said Salaam , referring to a Black teenager whose imprisonment, and subsequent suicide, led to a series of prison reforms. âWe might find people who are in prison, in jail right now, who have the ability to be released because they were charged with petty crime, they just couldnât afford their bail. Theyâre in prison, their families are being broken apart, theyâre in jeopardy of losing their jobs.â\n\nAnd then there was Trump, whoâd be on trial as Salaam took office. âDonald Trump gets the opportunity to stay out of jail and defend himself because of the color of his skin, right?â he said. âHe has the complexion for acceptance; therefore, he should be afforded every right under the law, the right to due process. We didnât get that same treatment. My response has been to put up a mirror, not just to Donald Trump, but to America.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "Principals\n\nPDB: Biden prioritizes judges, student debt relief, ceasefire talks in final days\n\nSupreme Court hears major environmental case â¦ Netanyahu testifies in corruption trial â¦ WaPo : Hegseth prospects rise?\n\nRepublicans have plenty of questions about Tulsi Gabbardâs views on Syria and how they relate to her nomination as Trumpâs director of national intelligence. But theyâre not immediately deeming her past meeting with ousted leader Bashar al-Assad as disqualifying. She has explaining to do, a half-dozen Republican senators told Semaforâs Burgess Everett on Monday evening . âTo a lot of people, and I would put myself in that position, sheâs too undefined to really form an opinion [on], so she needs to get outâ and meet with more senators, said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., a member of party leadership. Trump allies say all the fuss about Gabbardâs views on Syria and Vladimir Putinâs Russia are much ado about nothing â and Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., spoke for others by saying Trump, and no one else, will set the new administrationâs foreign policy.\n\nKari Lake is a leading contender for the nomination as Donald Trumpâs ambassador to Mexico, Semaforâs Shelby Talcott reports . Lakeâs potential opportunity in an incoming Trump administration comes after two unsuccessful bids for statewide office in Arizona: A former news anchor, Lake lost her 2022 race for Arizona governor, and lost her Arizona Senate bid last month. Sheâs a staunch Trump ally who has backed his unproven claims that the 2020 election was stolen and supported his immigration stances. If officially tapped for ambassador to Mexico, Lake would be responsible for engaging with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaumâs government on a host of contentious issues, including migration, counternarcotics, and Trumpâs pledge to enact new tariffs on imports.\n\nPresident Biden will seize one of his last remaining opportunities to champion and defend his economic agenda . Todayâs speech at the Brookings Institution will emphasize his playbook for âgrowing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up,â the White House said, and comes as a majority of voters continue to disapprove of the outgoing presidentâs leadership. Look for Biden â who has been relatively quiet as of late â to emphasize his legislative achievements and signs of the overall strength of the US economy . âI hope the president talks about just how awful things were economically when he took over and all he and congressional Democrats did to ensure we have the strongest recovery in the world from the pandemic,â Rep. Brendan Boyle, D-Pa., who will attend the speech, told Semafor. âI am confident President Biden will be remembered well by historians.â\n\nâ Morgan Chalfant\n\nJeanne Shaheen is set to make history next year as the highest-ranking woman ever on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. And she brings a unique approach to the job, she tells Burgess Everett . The New Hampshire Democrat is pragmatic, but you donât want to end up on her bad side. She recounted throwing a âfitâ when the panel nearly ignored her pleas to condemn the bombing of a girlsâ school in Afghanistan. âReally tough,â is how incoming Chair Jim Risch described her. Shaheen brings a new perspective to a committee plagued by oscillating Democratic leadership due to Bob Menendezâs scandals â and sheâs got strong views on everything from Ukraine to Israel. âWe know that Israel is holding up humanitarian aid in northern Gaza. There are [thousands of] people that are on the verge of starvation,â Shaheen said. âItâs not acceptable.â\n\nAnger at inflation and Biden-era immigration drove Texas Latinos to the right this year, according to post-election polling. The data collected by Lake Research Partners for the nonpartisan Texas Public Opinion Research showed Latino voters split 47-47 between supporting Donald Trump and Kamala Harris while they broke for Democratic Senate nominee Colin Allred over GOP Sen. Ted Cruz by 8 points, a shift toward Cruz since his last race. Forty-six percent of Latinos called âthe cost of livingâ a top issue, while 45% named immigration. âThey donât like deportation, but they do want to see security at the border,â said pollster Celinda Lake. âWeâve seen that Mexican American Latinos are very resentful of some of the changes in the immigration system during the Biden administration â specifically, the Venezuelans being given preference over people whoâve been here, been working here, and been paying taxes for a long time.â\n\nâ David Weigel\n\nNew Yorkâs Democratic members of Congress had no reactions to the verdict in the high-profile Daniel Penny case, breaking with local progressive politicians and activists who condemned it â and Republicans around the country who celebrated it. By the end of Monday, none of New Yorkâs Democratic delegation had commented on the acquittal of Daniel Penny, after a Manhattan jury did not find Penny liable for the chokehold death of Jordan Neely. Rev. Al Sharpton accused the court of legalizing âcivilian vigilantism,â New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams said that if the âroles were reversed,â a Black man would have been convicted, and the Working Families Party accused Penny of a âmodern-day lynching.â Their representatives in DC stayed quiet, a shift after they frequently weighed in on high-profile cases involving Black victims.\n\nâ David Weigel and Kadia Goba\n\nSomaliland, a self-governing region within Somalia, will be much closer to being recognized by the US as the worldâs newest country when Trump returns to the White House , Semaforâs Yinka Adegoke reports .

Recognizing Somaliland could enable US intelligence to set up long-term operations to monitor the movement of weapons in a volatile region, as well as keep an eye on Chinese activity. China already has a permanent military base in neighboring Djibouti. It should allow the US to better monitor Houthi activity in Yemen.

      "text": "Americana\n\nAlso: The latest polling on the Trump transition\n\nThe biggest stories in Washington right now are about Donald Trumpâs second transition, and his partyâs agenda â none of which Democrats can control. They have made peace with that. They are not jumping on every revelation or accusation about Trumpâs cabinet nominees, and they reacted with a deep sigh to the planned resignation of FBI Director Chris Wray. That short-circuited an early 2025 fight about whether Trump would blow up the norm of the independent FBI, and the traditional 10-year term given to its director. But talking about norms didnât get them very far this year, anyway.\n\nThis week, they talked more about murder. A tough question for some of the most high-profile progressive Democrats was: What did they think of the organic, rarely kind reaction to the killing of a UnitedHealth executive in New York? What did they make of the fandom that had been built around the suspect, a privileged 26-year-old from Maryland named Luigi Mangione?\n\nâViolence is never the answer, but people can only be pushed so far,â said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who added that the âvisceral responseâ to the murder from people upset with their own care was a âwarning to everyone in the health care system.â She was the least cautious of several progressives who had an âI condemn it, butâ¦â reaction to the story, egged on by activists and social media users who saw the executive, not the gunman, as a villain. Warren later followed up with a statement clarifying that she âshould have been much clearer that there is never a justification for murder.â\n\nWhat does it say that some Democrats had a rawer reaction to that story than anything Trump did this week? They were enervated after the election, and still donât know how the party should oppose a president they believed had discredited himself. Theyâre unclear on how a billionaire, surrounded by billionaires, has capitalized on populist anger. He did that with a lot of bets that Democrats wouldnât have made, taking risky positions that got him condemned by all the people who knew better. To get attention, some are taking more risks themselves, some of which they may end up regretting.\n\nBEVERLY HILLS, Ca. â The anti-Trump resistance was not at the Beverly Hilton this week. At the post-election meeting of the Democratic Governors Association, held in a state where Democrats had just held a special legislative session to âTrump-proofâ their constituents, the party was in a wait-and-see mood.\n\nâHe is a master of saying something creating a great deal of noise â and then the reality may be different,â said North Carolina Attorney Gen. Josh Stein, whose landslide victory in the race for governor was one of the partyâs few November highlights.\n\nAs Trump prepares to take office, with a far more loyal set of advisers and staffers than he enjoyed eight years ago, the Democratic response is measured â and strategic. Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders has highlighted Trumpâs most populist campaign trail promises, saying heâs willing to get them done, and implying that Democrats will have something to run on if Republicans balk. Other Democrats are looking straightforwardly at things they could achieve in the minority, just a month and a week after their party warned that a Trump victory could threaten democracy as Americans knew it.\n\nâThe fact that we work across the aisle really matters to people,â said Arizona Rep. Ruben Gallego, who defied a Republican trend to win his stateâs open US Senate seat last month, after a campaign where he said he could work with anyone to fund more border security. âIf weâre always just raising the alarms and fighting, weâre going to be seen as not being even-handed players.â\n\nRead on for Steve Bannonâs take on the Democratic plan. â\n\nRead on for Steve Bannonâs take on the Democratic plan. â\n\nCongress is winding down its work for the year with fights over President Bidenâs final nominees , over what funding should be passed before he leaves office, and Democratic battles over who should lead their minorities on House committees.\n\nJoined by a minority of Democrats, House Republicans passed the National Defense Authorization Act with riders that would prevent military health care from providing gender medicine to minors, a provision that many Democrats ran against. In the Senate, two retiring independents â West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin and Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema â joined together to block a final Biden nominee to the National Labor Relations Board, giving Trump the chance to shift the boardâs majority next year.\n\nâThe only thing they could do is catch me when Iâm not there,â Manchin told Semafor, explaining his determination to sink the nominee.\n\nHouse Democrats were more focused on who would be ranking members on narrowly divided committees next year, with multiple incumbents facing or losing challenges to younger candidates. New York Rep. Jerry Nadler conceded the top role on the House Judiciary committee to Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, telling reporters this week that he was ânot-so-voluntarilyâ moved out. Georgia Rep. David Scott, who has struggled with health issues, has not been endorsed by the Congressional Black Caucus for another term as the top Democrat on the Agriculture committee; he also skipped forums with members who want the job. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is challenging Virginia Rep. Gerry Connolly, who is 74 and was diagnosed with cancer this year, on the House Oversight committee â though Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi supports Connolly, who previously stepped aside for Raskin.\n\nâHaving multi-generational leadership in the party sends a strong message that we can really rely on the leadership of seasoned senior leaders, and that we are also a party that cultivates a new generation,â Ocasio-Cortez told reporters this week.\n\nRead Burgess Everettâs full exit interview with Joe Manchin. â\n\nRead Burgess Everettâs full exit interview with Joe Manchin. â\n\nNorth Carolina Republicans are taking power away from the party that defeated them in the final weeks before new Democratic officials are sworn in.\n\nIn Raleigh, after Democrats easily won top statewide races and broke the GOPâs gerrymandered legislative supermajority, Republicans used a hurricane relief bill to weaken the incoming attorney general and take control of state election processes. Protecting Republican majorities in state courts will require the governor to replace judges only with nominees picked by legislators. Jeff Jackson, the attorney general-elect who kept up his partyâs century-plus streak in that office, will no longer be able to take positions that diverge from the legislature.\n\nBoth parties expect this month to finish off the GOPâs supermajority, which it won only after a frustrated Democrat switched parties last year. But Republicans have not conceded a close race for a decisive House seat, or a race for state Supreme Court where the Democratic candidate prevailed by fewer than 1000 votes; the defeated Republican candidate sued to disqualify more than 60,000 ballots, refusing to give up after two recounts and an unfavorable ruling from the current election board.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, who faces a potential GOP primary next year, spoke up for the changes after pressure from conservative activists. House Speaker Tim Moore, who will be in the next Congress after drawing himself a safe seat, told Steve Bannon this week that the changes are âcritical to making sure North Carolina continues to be able to do what it can to deliver victories for Republicans up and down the ticket.â Democrats are not pursuing the same tactics in states they control: In Michigan, where they lost their narrow majority last month, the party has passed gun safety measures but left some of its ambitious 2022 agenda undone.\n\nRepublicans celebrated a Manhattan juryâs decision to acquit Daniel Penny this week, calling the Marine veteran who held a homeless man in a chokehold after he threatened subway passengers a âhero.â Democrats were much more cautious, with just a handful criticizing the verdict, and fewer raising racism as a factor in Jordan Neelyâs death.\n\nâThat was a tragedy, and it should not have happened,â House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters on Wednesday, two days after the verdict. âWeâve got to do a better job of making sure that we have a more compassionate, enlightened response to dealing with the mental health challenges that so many Americans are experiencing.â\n\nDemocratic caution marked a significant departure from how the party spoke about other recent, high-profile, criminal cases with white defendants and Black victims. They largely ignored reactions from Rev. Al Sharpton and the remnants of New Yorkâs Black Lives Matter organizations, while Republicans from House Speaker Mike Johnson to Vice President-elect JD Vance said that Penny had acted correctly. On Friday, Vance announced that Penny would be his guest to the Army-Navy football game this weekend.\n\nRead on for the full story on why Democrats showed mixed reactions to Pennyâs acquittal. â\n\nRead on for the full story on why Democrats showed mixed reactions to Pennyâs acquittal. â\n\nIf Senate Republicans had their way, Chris Sununu would be spending a lot of time in DC. The governor of New Hampshire, who is retiring this year, rejected their pleas to run against Sen. Maggie Hassan or Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, leaving Democrats with total control of the swing stateâs delegation in Washington.\n\nOn a brief trip to the city this week, Sununu had another goal: Building support for massive spending cuts, including entitlement reform, through the Department of Government Efficiency. He was thrilled by the pop-up non-agency Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy were running, with a mandate to shrink the government and no hard plans yet. And he talked with Americana about what it should be doing, and why Washington should embrace it.\n\nâIâve heard the criticism of Elon,â says Chris Sununu. âOh, heâs just this outside billionaire. Well, I donât care how successful someone is. Would you be happier if he were poor?â\n\nRead on for the full interview, and why Sununu is a true believer in Elon Muskâs cost-cutting effort. â\n\nRead on for the full interview, and why Sununu is a true believer in Elon Muskâs cost-cutting effort. â\n\nThe public is more optimistic about a second Trump presidency than it was about the first one. It views this transition more warmly than the one that unfolded after the 2016 election. But Americans are grading on a curve. In previous CNN and Gallup polling, Trumpâs first presidential transition was historically unpopular, with a majority of voters disapproving of how he handled it â twice as many as disapproved of George W. Bushâs first transition, when many Americans doubted that heâd been elected fairly. Confidence in Trumpâs second transition is held down by Democrats and independents â just 54% of all voters expect him to do a âveryâ or âfairly goodâ job, compared to 61% who expected that from Joe Biden four years ago.\n\nThe biggest story in political media for the past month has been the Trump cabinet. The coverage, with a few exceptions, has been skeptical and negative. Only some of that has gotten through to Americans, who are paying less attention to political news right now, and have strong views of only a few nominees. Kennedy, whose favorable ratings crashed with Democrats during his 2024 campaigns, has the most overall support thanks to his name recognition from Republicans and independents. Hegseth, who faced the most outspoken skepticism from some GOP senators of any post-Matt Gaetz nominee, has the softest GOP support â just 60% of Republican voters want to confirm him, 20 points behind Kennedy.\n\nItâs been eight years and three months since Salena Zito came up with a phrase to describe why so few Trump voters paid attention to outraged coverage of his rhetoric: âThe press takes him literally, but not seriously; his supporters take him seriously, but not literally.â While Trump and his campaign surrogates got loud applause when they talked about taking revenge on his political opponents, or unfriendly prosecutors, just 21% of Republicans say that he will actually do that. Seventy-seven percent of Democrats say that he will, and independents split on the question, 48-48. That goes some way toward explaining why one of Democratsâ messages throughout the campaign, that Trump was a threat to democratic norms, didnât move many votes.\n\nThere are 10,000 stories to write about the Democratsâ agonizing re-think, but the biggest one â how the party lost Latino voters to President Mass Deportation â seemed too big to handle. But not for RogÃ© Karma: his reporting for The Atlantic on the Latino shift right explains why Democrats kept âconflating the views of the highly educated, progressive Latinos who run and staff these organizations, and who care passionately about immigration-policy reform, with the views of Latino voters, who overwhelmingly do not.â On the record, those highly educated, progressive Latinos dig in deeper: âMost of these other pollsters havenât published 83 academic articles on polling methodology and donât have Ph.D.s,â says Matt Barreto, one of the pollsters who convinced the party to embrace less popular, expansionist immigration policies.\n\nEvery four years, fewer and fewer communities are served by reliable, non-partisan local news outlets. Those communities include the counties where Donald Trump ran strongest last month â and some of the counties where he saw the biggest gains from 2016 and 2020. Thatâs the key finding of Paul Farhi and John Volkâs work for Medillâs State of Local News Project, worth reading in full, alongside analysis from Ryan Cooper at the American Prospect. That, he argues, is a major problem for Democrats: âAs local news is steadily strangled to death by the Facebook/Google advertising duopoly, the resulting gap is being filled with right-wing propaganda and reactionary voices on social media.â\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Semaforâs Reed Albergotti, Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai said heâs ready to work on a âManhattan Projectâ for AI when Donald Trump moves into the White House next year.\n\nâI think there is a chance for us to work as a country together,â he said. âThese big, physical infrastructure projects to accelerate progress is something we would be very excited by.â\n\nFor more exclusives and smart analysis from the tech industry, subscribe to Semaforâs Tech newsletter. â\n\nFor more exclusives and smart analysis from the tech industry, subscribe to Semaforâs Tech newsletter. â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "Jordan Neely needed help - not a death sentence. We're failing people like him. | Opinion\n\nAbout twice a week, I commute to USA TODAY's office in New York City - tap my card to pay the $2.90 subway fare, walk through the turnstile, wait on the platform and ride from my corner of Brooklyn into Manhattan. They're the same steps that more than half of New York City workers took on their commute in 2019 - an anomaly for the United States, even among other large cities.\n\nRecently, I've spent my time on the train thinking about Jordan Neely .\n\nNeely, a 30-year-old former Michael Jackson impersonator, was killed on the floor of an uptown F train in May 2023 after fellow passenger Daniel Penny put him in a choke hold for six minutes. On Monday, Penny was acquitted of criminally negligent homicide by a jury, days after Judge Maxwell Wiley dismissed a charge of second-degree manslaughter. Penny will walk free.\n\nPeople on the right have celebrated Penny, saying he acted to protect the people on the subway. His supporters donated more than $3 million for his legal expenses on a Christian fundraising platform. It completely disregards the fact that Neely was unarmed and in mental distress.\n\n\"I miss my son,\" Andre Zachary, Neely's father, told reporters outside of the courthouse. \" My son didn't have to go through this . I didn't have to go through this, either. It hurts.\"\n\nThis case is about more than public safety - it's about racial justice, homelessness and mental health care. It's about how our systems fail vulnerable members of our society. It's about the human being who lost his life, and the ways he was failed while alive.\n\nOn May 1, 2023, Neely stuck his hand through the door of a subway train at the Broadway-Lafayette station in lower Manhattan. He threw his jacket down, began yelling and pacing in the subway car .\n\n\"I don't have food, I don't have a drink, I'm fed up,\" he said, according to a freelance journalist who filmed the events. Penny's lawyers say the former Marine, who was 24 years old at the time, heard Neely threaten to kill, although the mother he supposedly said it to did not. Neely was unarmed; all he had in the pocket of his hoodie was a muffin .\n\nWithin moments, Penny wrestled Neely to the ground, putting him in a choke hold. Penny held onto Neely for nearly six minutes, even after he stopped struggling. In one video, a male passenger can be heard telling Penny to let go after Neely defecated on himself.\n\nWhen the police questioned Penny, he described Neely as a \" crackhead .\"\n\n\"These guys are pushing people in front of trains and stuff,\" Penny told detectives.\n\nThe coroner ruled Neely's death a homicide. Defense attorneys say it was also the result of cardiac arrest and a blood flow issue due to sickle cell disease.\n\nEither way, a man is dead because another subway passenger chose to put him in a headlock.\n\nNeely suffered from mental illness starting at age 14, when his mother was murdered by her boyfriend. He entered the foster care system. In 2013, he began having run-ins with law enforcement . He experienced homelessness intermittently during his life.\n\nNeely's life mattered. It should not have mattered that he was experiencing homelessness and was in the midst of a mental health crisis.\n\nI understand that people do not want to feel uncomfortable on public transportation. I also think Penny, or anyone else on the subway, could have acted in ways to de-escalate the situation that did not involve a choke hold.\n\n\"If the city just wants this to be a playground for the rich, that is the most dangerous outcome for all of us,\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told The Cut in a 2023 interview on Neely's death. \"We are all subject to violence if the value of our life is measured by our income, or measured by our mental health, or measured by our race.\"\n\nNeely's death also demonstrates a failure by police to act in a way that could have saved his life. It calls into question whether law enforcement, as opposed to first responders or health care professionals, are the best people to be answering mental health calls.\n\nDespite finding Neely not breathing when they arrived, police officers did not give him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and took minutes to begin chest compressions. In testimony, Sgt. Carl Johnson said he didn't tell his officers to give Neely mouth-to-mouth, fearing they would contract AIDS (which is not transmissible by saliva ) or another disease.\n\nInstead of being treated like a person experiencing a mental health crisis, Neely was treated as a perpetrator. It's hard not to think about how these moments could have played out differently had a health care professional been the one to answer the call.\n\nIn some New York City precincts, that's where B-HEARD comes in. B-HEARD, the Behavioral Health Emergency Assistance Response Division, is a pilot program that dispatches health care workers to 911 mental health calls. Since spring 2021, it has expanded to 31 precincts in every borough but Staten Island .\n\nThis isn't the only city to have done so: There are more than 100 response units like B-HEARD across the United States.\n\nIn the 2023 fiscal year, B-HEARD responded to almost 15,000 calls . Despite this, police still respond to 70% of mental health calls in the city.\n\nIn part, this is due to the size of the program. B-HEARD only operates in 31 of the city's 77 police precincts. The area in which Neely's death occurred is not serviced by the program. New York City officials need to address that and continue expanding the program until it is in every precinct in the city.\n\nFollow USA TODAY elections columnist Sara Pequeño on X, formerly Twitter: @sara__pequeno"

      "text": "Who was Jordan Neely, the New York subway victim? A 'young man in real crisis,' advocates say\n\nThe public should focus on the needs of people experiencing homelessness and mental illness to understand the tragic, sudden and violent death of Jordan Neely on the New York City subway , lawyers and homeless advocates say.\n\nAttorneys for Neely's family said Neely, 30, began experiencing mental health problems at age 14 when his mother was brutally murdered.\n\nNeely's mother was strangled at age 36 by her boyfriend in the apartment where she and her teen son lived, the family's lawyer Lennon Edwards told USA TODAY. When Neely tried to say goodbye to his mother before leaving for school the day of her murder, he didn't know her fate - he only knew that her boyfriend had told him he couldn't enter the bedroom where his mother's body was, Edwards said.\n\nWhen Neely returned home from school that afternoon, he learned his mother's body had been stuffed in a suitcase and dumped in the Bronx. Her murderer was sentenced to 30 years in prison .\n\n\"That's the kind of trauma that can cause anyone to unravel,\" Edwards said. \"This is a family that's extremely burdened.\"\n\nNow, Neely's own death has also been ruled a homicide by a medical examiner.\n\nLawyers for Marine veteran David Penny, 24, said he acted in self-defense when he put Neely in a chokehold on May 1 after the well-known subway performer and Michael Jackson impersonator began acting erratically on the F train. Penny has not been charged, and authorities have not released key details about the incident.\n\nBut advocates for Neely say a cycle of violence, mental health problems and poverty were what led to the tragedy aboard the subway.\n\n\"Jordan Neely was a survivor of violence,\" Jamila Hodge , executive director of the national violence prevention group Equal Justice USA told USA TODAY. \"If we can see him first as a survivor of violence, it gives us a different perspective on what happened in the subway and helps us understand the trajectory his life had taken over the past 16 years.\"\n\nNeely grew up in a family of musicians who want him to be remembered as a \"human being,\" Edwards told USA TODAY. His mother was a professional singer and his father performed with a music group. Neely also had a flair for song and dance, which he would pursue into adulthood.\n\n\"He was someone who loved and enjoyed people and life,\" Edwards said.\n\nLater in his life Neely was known locally as a Michael Jackson impersonator who danced in the Times Square transit hub and was a beloved part of many New Yorkers' daily commute. By then, he suffered from depression, according to Edwards.\n\n\"What he could have been, the world will never know,\" Edwards said. \"But we do know that he was someone who should have had an opportunity and a chance, a chance to recover - a chance to turn his life around, a chance to fulfill a dream that he had as a child. You can't be around music without wanting to be a part of it and be in it.\"\n\nNeely experienced homelessness \"intermittently\" leading up to his death, according to Edwards. He spent some time living with an aunt, some time at a shelter and some time on the street.\n\nWhen he was killed, Neely \"still had a dream, and still wanted to accomplish something, and still had motivation to do it,\" Edwards said. \"Where he was in the process it's hard to say, but he still had aspirations.\"\n\nTari Tudesco, a backup dancer in the Michael Jackson tribute act \"Michael's Mirror,\" said many in the street performance community were searching for Neely, worried about his absence in recent years.\n\n\"We were in shock to find now that he was living homeless,\" she said. \"We feel terrible.\"\n\nIn a Wednesday news release , VOCAL-New York, a grassroots political organization fighting for the needs of low-income people, said Neely's death came after elected officials \"successfully campaigned to keep poor people in jails\" and \"flooded our subways with cops.\" The organization also said Neely's death is the direct result of \"abandonment and dehumanization of people experiencing homelessness and mental health complexities.\"\n\nOfficials have not provided a detailed account of what happened Monday. But witnesses and statements from lawyers paint an incomplete picture of a subway incident that quickly escalated into an extended, fatal chokehold.\n\nWhile riding the subway, Neely had been yelling about how hungry, thirsty and \"fed up\" he was before Penny held him in a chokehold for 6 to 15 minutes on the floor of the train car, according to interviews Edwards and his legal team conducted with witnesses, the lawyer said.\n\nIn a statement released Friday , Penny's lawyers said he \"never intended to harm Mr. Neely and could not have foreseen his untimely death.\"\n\nWitnesses told police Neely had been acting \"hostile and erratic\" toward other subway passengers when he was approached by Penny, The New York Times reported .\n\nBut Neely had not physically attacked anyone, according to the bystander who filmed the video, The New York Times reported .\n\nJeff Olivet, the director of the White House Interagency Council on Homeless, told USA TODAY the council \"in the strongest possible terms condemns the heinous and vigilante murder of Jordan Neely and calls for justice for Jordan and his family.\"\n\n\"It's pretty clear this was a young man in real crisis, without a home, calling out for help,\" Olivet said. \"The traumatic experience of homelessness itself is very hard on people's mental health, exacerbating depression, anxiety, psychosis and other illnesses.\"\n\nIn a Facebook post describing the incident, a bystander says Neely had said, \"I don't have food, I don't have a drink, I'm fed up.\"\n\nOlivet and Hodge said Penny's violent, lethal chokehold was an unacceptable stand-in for a public safety response that was lacking Monday afternoon in the subway.\n\n\"We have to redefine safety as something more than the absence of violence - but the presence of thriving communities, the presence of well-being, where people can have their needs met,\" Hodge said. \"The things that he was asking for in that car, what if someone had just given him what he was asking for, something to drink, something to eat?\"\n\nAdvocates are calling for justice for Neely after New York City police released Penny following questioning Monday.\n\n\"What public safety looks like is when everybody has all of their basic needs met and they don't have to fear for their lives,\" said Eric Tars, legal director for the National Homelessness Law Center.\n\nIn a Friday news release, the law center said Neely's death is directly linked to the fact that people of color are overrepresented among the U.S. homeless population, and that people experiencing homelessness are routinely criminalized.\n\n\"It is no coincidence that Jordan was murdered on the subway, because the NYC subway system has long been the target of dehumanizing campaigns that condition the public to view unhoused Black men as disposable,\" the law center statement says.\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams has called for the investigation into Neely's death to take its course, noting \"we cannot just blatantly say what a passenger should or should not do in a situation like that,\" when asked on CNN whether it's appropriate for subway passengers to take certain situations into their own hands .\n\nThe New York City subway - where many unhoused people often take refuge - has been the site of several killings of unhoused and housed New Yorkers in recent years.\n\nTars said rhetoric last year from Adams and other lawmakers likely drove up public fear of unhoused people experiencing mental illness on New York subways .\n\nLast year, Adams announced law enforcement could involuntarily hospitalize unhoused people with severe mental illness \"who pose a risk of harm to themselves, even if they are not an imminent threat to the public.\"\n\nThe policy's proponents, including Adams , say it's a \"compassionate\" response to the homelessness crisis. But it overemphasizes using force to restrain people who may be experiencing homelessness, and because of that, Neely's death was predictable, Tars said.\n\n\"We predicted this when the mayor of New York was riling up people's fears, telling people that people experiencing homelessness with mental health issues were dangerous and a threat,\" he said.\n\nThe law firm representing Neely's family said in a statement it understands \"our current times have created a heightened sense of fear (sometimes reasonable, sometimes not). However, there has to be a clear line of when lethal force can be used by anyone, including civilians.\"\n\nNow, a Manhattan District Attorney will determine whether Penny intended to harm Neely when he administered the chokehold. The question will be decided based on whether a \"reasonable\" New Yorker would have also acted in self-defense in the situation.\n\nHodge said she also wants to know: \"Why were people so afraid\" Monday afternoon on the F train.\n\n\"Fear is used to justify so much,\" she said. \"Fear has justified the control and killing of Black people in particular since the times of slavery. And fear to me has really gotten out of hand lately,\" she said, referencing recent instances of vigilantism in which people were killed for turning into the wrong driveway or for knocking on the wrong door .\n\nContributing: Christine Fernando, USA TODAY; The Associated Press"

      "text": "Manslaughter charge dismissed in Daniel Penny chokehold case; jury considers lesser charge\n\nNEW YORK - A judge in Daniel Penny's case on Friday dismissed a charge of second-degree manslaughter in the death of Jordan Neely, leaving the jury to consider a lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide. Prosecutors asked the judge to dismiss the first more serious count after jurors remained deadlocked Friday afternoon.\n\nNeely, an unarmed homeless man , died after former Marine Penny placed him in a chokehold on a crowded subway car last year. Neely had been screaming at passengers .\n\nA jury began deliberations this week after hearing more than a month's worth of witness testimonies and evidence presented by lawyers. They sent a note to the judge Friday morning saying they could not reach a unanimous verdict on the charge of manslaughter, defense attorney Steve Raiser told USA TODAY. The judge responded with instructions to keep deliberating, Raiser said.\n\nCourt was adjourned late Friday afternoon and the jury will continue deliberating Monday, Raiser said.\n\nVideo of Neely 's death gained national attention and sparked days of protest in New York after police questioned Penny and initially released him from custody after the killing on May 1, 2023. Neely, a Michael Jackson tribute artist, was well-known in and around Times Square , where he danced dressed up like the pop icon.\n\nPenny told responding officers that Neely, 30, \"came on the train threatening people. I put him out\" to keep him from harming fellow subway riders, according to court documents.\n\nDuring the trial, which began with jury selection Oct. 21, Penny, 26, was accused of recklessly disregarding the risk his chokehold would lead to Neely's death that day on the train car floor.\n\nPenny's charge of second-degree manslaughter would have carried a prison sentence of up to 15 years, and the conviction of criminally negligent homicide could carry a sentence of up to four years, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office said. But there is no minimum prison sentence, and if he's found guilty, the judge could decide on a sentence that involves no prison time, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office said.\n\nProsecutor Dafna Yoran argued Penny should have known Neely's life was at risk as the approximately 6-minute-long chokehold starved the 30-year-old Black man of oxygen. Yoran also argued Penny was unnecessarily reckless when he continued to hold Neely's neck long after Neely stopped posing a threat to passengers.\n\nPenny's defense argued Neely was acting \"psychotic\" and threatened to kill people in the subway car. Penny stepped in to protect all the people onboard, several of whom Neely lunged at before Penny placed him in the chokehold, defense attorney Thomas Kenniff said. Passengers had no way of knowing Neely did not have a weapon on him, Kenniff said, and several passengers feared for their life.\n\nThe defense team also argued Penny's chokehold alone could not have caused Neely's death, and that Neely's blood suffered an extreme sickle cell crisis on the train floor, blocking the flow of oxygen. However, a medical examiner testified Neely's death was caused by \"compression of the neck,\" and not other health issues.\n\nThe prosecution argued Penny did not hesitate before placing Neely in a chokehold and failed to try to defuse the situation another way. Another bystander who came to Penny's aid offered to hold Neely's arms down so Penny could let go of Neely's neck, but instead Penny kept tight hold even after Neely's body went limp, Yoran told jurors.\n\n\"He used far too much force for far too long,\" Yoran said.\n\nThroughout the trial, about a dozen protesters gathered outside the Manhattan Criminal Court most mornings, demanding justice for Neely and his family . The demonstrators' chants could be heard from the street below inside the 13th floor courtroom, and on the first day of the trial, Judge Max Wiley instructed the jury to ignore the noise and focus on the evidence presented by lawyers.\n\nNeely experienced mental health problems throughout his life, according to court records, and was homeless off and on since he was a teenager, when his mother was brutally murdered by her boyfriend in the family's home in New Jersey.\n\nOn May 1, 2023, Neely entered the F subway train in Lower Manhattan and immediately began yelling, saying he was ready to go to jail for life, court records show. Kenniff also pointed to evidence that Neely suffered from schizophrenia and was high on K2, a synthetic cannabinoid, at the time of the incident.\n\nJurors' personal experiences with violent crime, mental illness and drug use in the nation's largest city - particularly on the subway - likely play a major role in their deliberations, said David Barnard, a lawyer and director of jury selection at Magna Legal Services who has studied the case.\n\nDuring jury selection, prospective jurors were asked about their experiences riding the transit system. Some who were selected said they ride the subway regularly and saw outbursts like that of Neely, said Barnard, who was not involved in the case.\n\n\"Some people can see outbursts and say this is typical, run-of-the-mill New York City,\" said Barnard, who lives in Brooklyn. At the same time, many New Yorkers may feel the massive subway system is unsafe and out-of-control, Barnard said."

      "text": "Race, crime and mental health: How a subway killing divided the USA\n\nDaniel Penny's criminal trial over the death of Jordan Neely has become the latest cultural flash point underscoring deep divisions in how Americans view issues of race, crime and mental health in the United States.\n\nA New York City jury found Penny, a former Marine, not guilty on charges of killing Neely, a homeless Black man, on the subway last year after placing him in a choke hold for roughly six minutes . Penny's lawyers argued he did not intend to harm Neely and was trying to protect other subway passengers, who witnessed Neely screaming that he was hungry, thirsty and ready to kill someone.\n\nOn Friday, a judge in the case dismissed the more serious manslaughter charge after the jury was unable to come to a unanimous verdict - underscoring the divisive nature of the case and the controversial cultural topics at play.\n\nResponses to the case, like many issues in America, have fallen along cultural and political lines, with conservative-leaning pundits and politicians describing Penny as a hero, and progressives and activist groups calling him a murderer.\n\nThe NAACP said it was \" deeply disappointed \" by the verdict and argued that acquitting Penny set a dangerous precedent that promoted vigilante justice.\n\n\"Let's be clear ‒ mental health crises are medical emergencies, not crimes,\" the organization wrote in a statement. \"America has yet again criminalized our community and subverted accountability.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Vice President-elect JD Vance heralded the decision, saying that \"justice was done\" and that \"it was a scandal Penny was ever prosecuted in the first place,\" in a post on X , formerly Twitter, on Monday.\n\nThe dueling responses aren't surprising, given the details of the case , said Nicole Brenecki, a Brooklyn-based trial expert.\n\n\"This is showing the polarization of society right now because all the issues that society is grappling with came together in this particular case,\" Brenecki said, pointing to safety on the nation's largest subway system, mental illness and the homelessness crisis.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats have emphasized different parts of the complicated case, drawing on their opposing views on cultural issues.\n\nIn the weeks after the incident, Republican lawmakers rallied in support of Penny, painting him as a hero whose actions helped protect the lives of others on the subway.\n\nMuch like Penny's defense team, Republicans highlighted that Neely's actions scared some passengers on the subway. Penny, they asserted, was not only acting out of self-defense but for the public good.\n\nIn a video testimony about the altercation, Penny said Neely appeared to be on drugs when he entered the subway, threw his jacket at people and yelled threats that he was going to kill, was prepared to go to jail and was willing to die.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis , a former Republican presidential candidate, called Penny a \"Good Samaritan\" in a tweet shortly after Neely died in May 2023. He described the charges against Penny as part of a pro-criminal \"agenda\" by Democrats.\n\nDeSantis also criticized Democratic Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who announced the charges against Penny. Bragg led the prosecution of President-elect Donald Trump's New York hush money trial and has received ire from Republicans since.\n\nOn Monday, DeSantis commended the jury's decision to acquit Penny of criminally negligent homicide in the death of Neely, saying it was \"clearly the just and correct verdict.\"\n\nRudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York and a close Trump ally, called the verdict a \"great act of justice\" that rejected \"racist, unjust charges.\" He said Penny deserved a medal from the city for his actions.\n\nIn contrast, progressive Democrats described Neely's death as emerging from systemic issues related to race, poor funding for mental health care and lack of social services for the homeless.\n\nNeely, a street and subway performer, had experienced homelessness and poor mental health leading up to his death, according to lawyers for his family. His problems first started at age 14 when his mother was murdered and continued on and off for years.\n\nIf Neely had not been homeless, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, D-N.Y., suggested he may have been treated differently when he entered the subway car.\n\n\"(Because) Jordan was houseless and crying for food in a time when the city is raising rents and stripping services to militarize itself while many in power demonize the poor, the murderer gets protected,\" Ocasio-Cortez wrote in a tweet two days after Neely's death.\n\nJamila Hodge, CEO of Equal Justice USA, a national nonprofit focused on racial justice and community safety, argued that the case surrounding Neely's death is an example of how the criminal justice system fails to protect society's most vulnerable members when they're struggling and land in harm's way.\n\n\"We are constantly reminded that the law is not enough,\" Hodge, who is a former assistant U.S. Attorney, said, referencing a speech Martin Luther King Jr. gave in 1965 . \"Jordan Neely is dead and Daniel Penny has been acquitted because of the assumption of dangerousness that attaches to Black skin.\"\n\nDespite the political chasm, Brenecki said that while the cultural pieces of the case were important, there were other legal issues as well.\n\n\"If you bring this case down to its nuts and bolts, this case was not about all the other issues that were raised,\" she said. \"This case boiled down to whether the pressure that was applied to the victim's neck was unreasonable or not.\"\n\nThe \"minutia of the legal decisions\" governed how the case played out in court, Brenecki said, but the other details will continue to spark conversations about policy and public safety.\n\n\"The social and political discourse that results from them is very, very, very important for us to reflect upon,\" she said. \"At the end of the day, our governments and our legislators should be very, very busy acting upon our social discourse.\""

      "text": "Man who fatally choked Jordan Neely on NYC subway to face manslaughter charge, DA office says\n\nNearly two weeks after Daniel Penny used a fatal chokehold to restrain a man on the floor of a New York City subway car , the 24-year-old will face criminal charges, prosecutors said.\n\nPenny will be arrested and charged for killing Jordan Neely , a 30-year-old Black man experiencing homelessness and mental health problems after he had been shouting on board the subway. The white U.S. Marine Corps veteran will face a charge of secondary manslaughter, which could carry a jail term of up to 15 years.\n\nNeely's violent death sparked days of protests in New York after police questioned the man's killer but then released him from custody the same day of the incident. Last week, lawyers for Neely's family drew attention to the fact that the man had suffered from mental health problems since age 14 when his mother was brutally murdered.\n\nThe law firm Mills & Edwards, LLP could not answer questions about the case Thursday evening, press contact Michelle Watts told USA TODAY.\n\nLawyers for Penny said they could not provide any additional information about the charges until Penny is arraigned in a Manhattan criminal court, which they expect to happen Friday.\n\nAccording to a freelance journalist who witnessed the struggle, Neely had been screaming and saying how hungry and thirsty he was on board the train prior to the takedown but had not physically attacked anyone. Attorneys for Penny previously said their client, along with two other riders who helped restrain Neely, had acted in self-defense.\n\n\"Daniel never intended to harm Mr. Neely and could not have foreseen his untimely death,\" they said in a statement.\n\nHomeless advocates said Thursday the criminal charge against Penny was appropriate because he acted with violence against another subway passenger.\n\nIf Penny had wanted to keep the peace on May 1, he should have used \"non-violent de-escalation techniques\" to mitigate the tense situation, said Eric Tars, the legal director of the National Homelessness Law Center.\n\n\"He proceeded with violence and this is the outcome of that, and he needs to be responsible for that,\" Tars said.\n\nA former subway performer known for his spot-on Michael Jackson impression, Neely struggled in recent years with homelessness and worsening mental illness, friends said.\n\nLawyers for Neely's family say in the years leading up to his death he spent some time living with an aunt, some time at a Manhattan shelter, and some time living on the street. Neely grew up with parents who were musicians and had a love of performing, said Lennon Edwards, a lawyer representing the family.\n\nWhen he was killed, Neely \"still had a dream, and still wanted to accomplish something, and still had motivation to do it,\" Edwards said. \"Where he was in the process it's hard to say, but he still had aspirations.\"\n\nNeely had been arrested several times and had recently pleaded guilty to assaulting a 67-year-old woman in 2021 as she left a subway station. After pleading guilty, he missed a court date, leading to a warrant for his arrest that was still active at the time of his death.\n\nContributing: Associated Press"

      "text": "Daniel Penny's acquittal is a victory for justice. He's a hero, not a criminal. | Opinion\n\nHow thin is the line between hero and vigilante? It is razor thin, as the trial of Daniel Penny has shown.\n\nPenny is a white, former Marine who put Jordan Neely, a Black man, in a six-minute choke hold in the New York subway in May 2023. Neely died after the incident, and prosecutors charged Penny with killing him.\n\nOn Monday, a jury acquitted Penny of criminally negligent homicide. A second-degree manslaughter charge against Penny was tossed out Friday after the jury couldn't reach a verdict.\n\nReports on the deadly incident seemed to divide Americans over racial issues: privileged white man versus homeless Black man.\n\nBut the Penny case also involved questions that have nothing to with skin color: What level of threat are we willing to live with? Is it morally right for a bystander to use force to stop a threat?\n\nTo me, Penny is a hero who intervened to protect people who couldn't protect themselves. The jury was right to acquit him, and the fact he was on trial at all is an outrage.\n\nPenny might never have thought he would use fighting skills he learned in the Marines in a dangerous, chaotic confrontation on the F train in Manhattan. But he did - and he faced up to 15 years in prison because of it.\n\nAfter Neely screamed that he would kill someone , Penny placed him in a choke hold on the subway train's floor. Other passengers called law enforcement, who after arriving began to administer CPR. Neely later was pronounced dead at a hospital.\n\nPenny, under questioning at a police station, said his intention was to subdue Neely, not hurt him. But soon after Neely's death, Penny was charged.\n\nCellphone video and body cam footage provide clear views of what happened that day. During the choke hold, Penny is neither vicious nor malicious. He is focused and steady, clearly attempting to subdue a threat. Two men aid him in calming Neely. Passengers later testified they were relieved that Penny had taken the initiative to protect them.\n\nThe prosecution didn't argue that Penny intentionally committed murder. They argued that the choke hold went \"way too far,\" violating \"law and human decency.\"\n\nThe medical examiner ruled Neely's cause of death was a direct result of the choke hold (the defense disputed that finding), and the prosecution tried to make the case that good intentions that turn out poorly have legal consequences.\n\nBut the prosecutor's case looked weak throughout the trial. Despite substantial evidence, including video footage and eyewitness accounts showing that Penny acted heroically, prosecutors still brought the case against him.\n\nOther passengers on the F train that day testified that they felt real fear due to Neely's erratic behavior. A witness said she remembered Neely yelling, \"I don't give a damn. I will kill a motherf-----. I'm ready to die.\" She also said under oath that she \"was scared s---less\" by Neely's actions. And said she even thanked Penny for protecting her and other passengers afterward.\n\nAnother witness testified that he was \"terrified\" because of Neely's behavior, and a mother told jurors about trying to protect her child while Neely - previously arrested 42 times , including three arrests on charges of assaulting women on the subway - screamed threats.\n\nForensic pathologist Satish Chundru, a defense witness, testified that Penny's choke hold didn't kill Neely , but that the cause of death could instead be attributed to \"the combined effects of sickle-cell crisis, the schizophrenia, the struggle and restraint, and the synthetic marijuana.\"\n\nFellow Marines testified that Penny, awarded the Humanitarian Service Medal, was a man of honor and duty.\n\nThe case against Penny never seemed that it was truly about upholding law and order. The New York Post Editorial Board bemoaned that \"(District Attorney Alvin) Bragg's decision to prosecute looks like pure politics.\"\n\nAs a single woman, I think about my safety daily. The Penny case highlights some difficult questions: What if the threat to my safety is vague but seems serious? What am I willing to do to protect myself or others from that threat?\n\nIn recent months an ongoing social media \"debate\" has questioned whether a woman, alone in the woods, would rather face a bear or a man. To the shock of men, women have resoundingly said they'd choose the bear . These women argue that men, not bears, have a reputation for everything from unwanted catcalling to rape and murder.\n\nThe man-or-bear debate, however, is based on a logical fallacy that demonizes men and lumps them all together as predators. The subway incident involving Neely and Penny shows that sometimes a good man is needed to protect women (and men and children) from danger.\n\nStill, women must assess their risk-to-safety ratio every day while traveling, on a run in the neighborhood or going out alone to a store or school. Even the threat of violence at home is a gendered crime that endangers women far more often than men.\n\nWhen I first saw footage from the subway car, I felt sorrow for Neely, but also relief that men like Penny exist. I've been in dozens of scenarios where I have felt unsafe, and while my safety is my responsibility, I've also found myself at times looking for the nearest Daniel Penny.\n\nWomen would choose men over the bear every time if we knew for certain that more good men were willing and able to stop bad men. I'd want a man like Penny on my train, bus, plane or at a rest stop on a road trip any day.\n\nPsychologist and author Jordan Peterson has said , \"A harmless man is not a good man. A good man is a very, very dangerous man who has that under voluntary control.\" This sounds like Penny to me.\n\nThe world needs more Daniel Pennys, not fewer. He should be lauded as a hero.\n\nNicole Russell is an opinion columnist with USA TODAY. She lives in Texas with her four kids.

      "text": "Case against man accused in NYC subway chokehold death moves forward\n\nA New York judge has declined to dismiss the case of Daniel Penny, the man charged with manslaughter for killing Jordan Neely in a chokehold on a subway car in May, the New York County District Attorney's Office said Wednesday.\n\nPenny was charged with manslaughter after putting 30-year-old Neely, a Black man experiencing homelessness, in a chokehold from behind after Neely was acting erratically on the subway, according to witnesses.\n\nA medical examiner ruled Neely's death a homicide caused by compression of the neck.\n\nIn Wednesday's decision, judge Maxwell Wiley pointed to medical evidence and Neely's cause of death, and wrote that Penny \"placed the deceased, Jordan Neely, in a chokehold which then resulted in Mr. Neely's death.\"\n\nWiley also said witness evidence from prosecutors used in last summer's grand jury indictment is sufficient for the case to move forward - something defense lawyers contested last year.\n\n\" The Court has reviewed the cases cited by defendant in light of the evidence presented and finds that, here, the evidence was legally sufficient to establish that defendant acted with both recklessness and criminal negligence,\" Wiley wrote in his decision.\n\nDefense lawyers for Penny had filed a motion for the case to be dismissed, arguing that Penny did not intend to harm Neely and that several witnesses feared for their lives that day on the subway.\n\nNow that a judge has denied the defense's motion to dismiss the case, it will move forward and likely go to trial. The next conference meeting in the case is set for March 20, the district attorney's office told USA TODAY on Wednesday.\n\nLawyers for Penny said they disagreed with the judge's decision and argued Penny put Neely in a chokehold to protect other passengers on the subway.\n\n\"We are confident that a jury, aware of Danny's actions in putting aside his own safety to protect the lives of his fellow riders, will deliver a just verdict,\" defense lawyers Thomas Kenniff and Steven Raiser said in a statement.\n\nOn May 1, Neely started shouting on the train and threw his jacket on the floor, according to more than a dozen witnesses. He was acting erratically, witnesses said, but he did not have a weapon or strike anyone.\n\nIn recent months, lawyers on each side have argued that the other side's evidence cherry-picks witness accounts to exaggerate or downplay the fear Neely caused on the subway car when he began yelling and saying he was ready to fight .\n\nWitness accounts vary, lawyers say, in part because Neely was not in the direct line of vision of all passengers on the crowded car that morning.\n\nAfter Neely's outbursts, Penny, who is white, approached him from behind and placed him in a chokehold for several minutes, including after Neely stopped resisting.\n\nPenny was indicted on charges of manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide in June and pleaded not guilty.\n\nPenny's legal team fought to dismiss the case, arguing a reasonable person in their client's position in the subway car could have also felt force was necessary to prevent Neely from harming other passengers.\n\nIf Penny is tried in criminal court for second-degree manslaughter, a jury would be tasked with finding whether he engaged in reckless conduct that created an unjustifiable risk of death to Neely and then consciously disregarded that risk.\n\nProsecutors with New York's district attorney's office also argued more evidence in the case is needed to be considered, including witness accounts from some subway passengers who said outbursts like Neely's were not out of ordinary on New York City public transportation.\n\nIn his Wednesday decision, Wiley highlighted evidence from medical officials about the nature of Neely's death, including how Neely's body movements changed as the chokehold went on.\n\nA medical examiner who watched a video of the struggle between Penny and Neely noted that Neely's movements changed significantly while he was being held before he died.\n\nThe medical examiner \"was able to identify when Neely's movements went from being voluntary to those associated with death, all the while being held by the defendant,\" Wiley wrote.\n\nAt the time of his death, Neely's neck also suffered bruises, scrapes, bleeding and some of the muscles in his neck had hemorrhaged, according to the medical examiner, Wiley said.\n\n\"The evidence was legally sufficient to establish that defendant's actions caused the death of Neely,\" the judge said.\n\nNeely was experiencing homelessness and poor mental health in the months leading up to his death, lawyers for his family said last year. They said his mental health struggles began at age 14 after his mother was killed.\n\nIn adulthood, Neely was a street and subway performer known for his impersonation of Michael Jackson, which he often did in Times Square. He grew up in a family of musicians, according to lawyers for his family. Neely's mother was a singer and his father performed in a band.\n\nIn the years leading up to his death, Neely experienced homelessness off and on, according to his family's lawyers. Sometimes he lived with his aunt and her partner, and other times he lived at a shelter in Manhattan or on the streets.\n\nIn the months and weeks leading up to his death, there were times when Neely received mental health treatment at a facility, according to lawyers for his family.\n\nIn an interview with USA TODAY, one of the family's lawyers shared how Neely's mother was strangled at age 36 in the apartment where she and her teenage son lived. The woman's boyfriend strangled her in her bedroom, and when her son tried to tell his mother goodbye before leaving for school that day, her murderer told him his mother was asleep and not to bother her, Lennon Edwards, a lawyer for Neely's family, told USA TODAY last year.\n\nWhen 14-year-old Neely returned home that afternoon, he learned the man had stuffed his mother's body in a suitcase and threw it onto a highway in the Bronx.\n\n\"That's the kind of trauma that can cause anyone to unravel,\" Edwards said. \"This is a family that's extremely burdened.\"\n\nMore than a dozen witnesses have given varying accounts of what happened on the Manhattan-bound F train in the moments leading to Neely's death.\n\nAccording to bystanders, Neely had been yelling about how hungry and tired he was, saying: \"I don't have food, I don't have a drink, I'm fed up, I don't mind going to jail and getting life in prison. I'm ready to die.\" That came moments before Penny held him in a chokehold for six minutes.\n\nVideo captured by a freelance journalist who was also riding the subway shows Penny with his arms wrapped around Neely's neck and his legs wrapped around the man's waist and thighs from behind.\n\nAfter a few minutes, Penny releases Neely from his grasp and he lies motionless on the floor of the car, which was stopped at the Broadway-Lafayette MTA station, the video shows.\n\nPolice have said they responded the afternoon of May 1 to a 911 call about a \"physical fight\" inside the station. When they arrived, they found Neely unconscious and unresponsive.\n\nPenny was questioned by police but was released without charges. More than a week later, Penny turned himself in to authorities the morning after prosecutors announced he would be charged with manslaughter.\n\nDistrict attorneys said in court filings that the large number of passenger witnesses had varying accounts of what happened on the subway car.\n\n\"Witnesses differ in what they were able to see and hear at various times during the encounter as well as in their own subjective assessment of the level of danger posed by Mr. Neely that day,\" prosecutors wrote.\n\nProsecutors have argued evidence provided by the defense omitted \"accounts that undermine the notion of rampant and universal panic.\"\n\nIn court filings, prosecutors point to one such account from a witness who told investigators, \"For me, it was like another day typically in New York. That's what I'm used to seeing.\"\n\nProsecutors also argue that not a single witness said Neely came into physical contact with anyone until the defendant put him in a chokehold that would turn lethal."

      "text": "Verdict reached: Jury finds Daniel Penny not guilty in NYC subway chokehold case\n\nNEW YORK - A jury on Monday found former Marine Daniel Penny not guilty of criminally negligent homicide in the death of Jordan Neely, a homeless man who Penny placed in a chokehold onboard a New York City subway car last year.\n\nAround 11:30 a.m. Monday, the jury told the judge they reached a unanimous verdict on the second count in the case. The more serious charge of second-degree manslaughter was dismissed Friday after the jury was unable to reach a verdict on it.\n\nThe case catapulted into the national spotlight after video of the chokehold went viral following Neely's death, which a New York City medical examiner ruled was caused by \"compression of the neck.\" Neely suffered from schizophrenia, was high on synthetic marijuana and was shouting that he was hungry, thirsty and \" fed up \" seconds before Penny put him in a restraint learned during training with the Marine Corps.\n\nIn a trial that lasted more than six weeks , the prosecution argued Penny, 26, was negligent in keeping the unarmed Neely in a chokehold for about six minutes, even after he stopped resisting. The defense said Penny was defending fellow passengers after Neely threatened to kill them and acted \"psychotic.\"\n\nDefense attorney Steve Raiser said Monday he wouldn't yet comment on the case. When the first count was dropped on Friday he said his team hoped Penny could soon put the \"nightmare\" behind him, and lawyers could begin focusing on a civil lawsuit brought against him by Neely's father over his son's death.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said in a statement, \"we deeply respect the jury process and we respect their verdict.'' He also said it was \"unacceptable'' prosecutors were subjected to threats over the case, which drew public protests.\n\nNeely had been screaming at passengers before Penny subdued him by putting him in a chokehold to prevent him from harming anyone, the defense argued. Prosecutors said Penny recklessly used too much force for too long, starving the 30-year-old former Michael Jackson tribute artist of oxygen.\n\nLate Friday afternoon, the prosecution asked the judge to dismiss the charge of second-degree manslaughter after the jury deadlocked.\n\nA lawyer for Neely's family said it was \"unfathomable\" the jury acquitted Penny, an opinion shared by supporters who believe the former Marine's extended chokehold snuffed out Neely's life.\n\n\"We thought that the system would be there for us, but it was not,\" attorney Donte Mills, who is representing Neely's family in a civil suit, told USA TODAY.\n\nMills said that while some are calling Penny a hero for subduing Neely after he started screaming in a subway car, \"Jordan didn't have a hero\" that day.\n\nNow, Mills said, his team will continue to seek justice for Neely through a civil lawsuit filed against Penny by Neely's father, Andre Zachery, who was not available for comment.\n\nSecond-degree manslaughter would have required the jury to find Penny acted recklessly when he held Neely in the chokehold - that he knew Neely's life was at risk but kept squeezing his neck, the prosecution argued.\n\nCriminally negligent homicide would have required that the jury find that Penny failed to recognize that Neely's life was at risk as he struggled to breathe while being held in the chokehold, according to documents filed by prosecutors.\n\nAt the start of the trial, Judge Max Wiley instructed the jury they must agree on the charge of second-degree manslaughter before they could consider the criminally negligent homicide charge. If the jury found Penny not guilty on the first charge, both would be dropped, Wiley said.\n\nWhen the jury told Wiley they were deadlocked on the first count Friday, Wiley asked them to keep deliberating, but they remained stalled. That's when prosecutors asked the judge to drop the charge of second-degree manslaughter.\n\nPenny's defense argued Neely was acting \"psychotic\" and threatened to kill people in the subway car. Penny stepped in to protect all the people on board, several of whom Neely lunged at before Penny placed him in the chokehold, defense attorney Thomas Kenniff said. Passengers had no way of knowing Neely did not have a weapon on him, Kenniff said, and several passengers feared for their lives.\n\nThe defense team also argued Penny's chokehold alone could not have caused Neely's death, and that Neely suffered an extreme sickle cell crisis on the train floor, blocking the flow of oxygen. However, a medical examiner testified Neely's death was caused by \"compression of the neck,\" and not other health issues.\n\nDuring the trial, which began with jury selection on Oct. 21, Penny was accused of recklessly disregarding the risk his chokehold would lead to Neely's death that day on the train car floor.\n\nProsecutor Dafna Yoran argued Penny should have known Neely's life was at risk because of the long chokehold. Yoran also argued Penny was unnecessarily reckless when he continued to hold Neely's neck long after Neely stopped posing a threat to passengers.\n\nThe prosecution argued Penny did not hesitate before placing Neely in a chokehold and failed to try to defuse the situation another way. Another bystander who came to Penny's aid offered to hold Neely's arms down so Penny could let go of Neely's neck, but instead, Penny kept a tight hold even after Neely's body went limp, Yoran told jurors.\n\n\"He used far too much force for far too long,\" Yoran said.\n\nConsidering the jury was deadlocked after four days of discussion, including after the judge told them to keep deliberating, it's \"peculiar\" they reached a unanimous verdict of not guilty on the second charge with such speed, said Nicole Brenecki, a Brooklyn-based trial expert who has followed the case.\n\n\"I was really surprised that that's how quickly they came back,\" Brenecki, who was not involved in the case, told USA TODAY.\n\nBrenecki said it's possible some members of the jury changed their minds about the case over the weekend.\n\nAfter the more serious charge was dropped, it likely would have been easier to reach a guilty verdict on the second charge if the jury was already heading in that direction, she said.\n\n\"Maybe the jury just decided to jump off the train and acquit,\" Brenecki said, adding that Jordan Neely's death remains an enormous tragedy.\n\nThroughout the trial, the jury was faced with a \"melting pot\" of problems society is grappling with, Brenecki said, like public safety, drug use, mental illness and the homelessness crisis.\n\n\"He should have been helped, this should have been prevented,\" she said. \"There's definitely a discussion and a discourse this sparked.\""

      "text": "Jordan Neely's cause of death wasn't Daniel Penny chokehold - but 'combined effects' of drugs, struggle and schizophrenia: defense expert\n\nManage your account\n\nDaniel Penny's chokehold of Jordan Neely isn't what killed the homeless man - he died from the \"combined effects\" of synthetic marijuana, schizophrenia and other factors, the defense's medical expert testified Thursday.\n\nDr. Satish Chundru, a forensic pathologist based in Texas, told jurors in Manhattan Supreme Court that Neely's autopsy records and video of the fatal F train altercation in May 2023 didn't show signs typical of known chokehold deaths.\n\n\"In your opinion, did Mr. Penny choke Mr. Neely to death?\" Penny's attorney Steven Raiser asked.\n\n\"No,\" replied Chundru, \"the chokehold did not cause death.\"\n\nChundru, who said he has worked as a medical examiner for county governments in Florida and Texas, ruled out two medically recognized chokeholds - the air choke and the blood choke - because he believed Neely, 30, died from other causes.\n\nHe also pointed out what he said were discrepancies in Neely's medical records, specifically bruising on the homeless man's neck, and how there was \"almost negligible\" petechia - tiny spots of bleeding - found on his eyelids, that Chundru claimed were inconsistent with a fatal chokehold.\n\nInstead, Chundru - who dubs himself the \"Forensic Doc\" on his website - said that Neely died by \"the combined effects of sickle cell crisis, the schizophrenia, the struggle and restraint, and the synthetic marijuana.\"\n\nChundru claimed that schizophrenia carries an \"increased risk of sudden cardiac death.\"\n\nHe also testified that he'd seen deaths caused by K2 toxicity alone. Neely, a former Michael Jackson impersonator with a history of mental illness and drug abuse, had the synthetic marijuana in his system at the time of his death, trial evidence has shown.\n\nThe findings from Chundru - who was called by Penny's defense attorneys - were far different from those of the city medical examiner, who stood by her ruling that Neely's death was caused by asphyxiation as a result of the former Marine's chokehold.\n\nDr. Cynthia Harris, who performed the autopsy, said video of the fatal encounter convincingly showed the chokehold was his cause of death - that she wouldn't change her ruling even if it turned out Neely had enough drugs in his body \"to put down an elephant.\"\n\nHarris testified earlier this week that she and the other doctors at the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, including the chief, believed that Neely's death was caused by \"asphyxia,\" consistent with being choked, after seeing a journalist's video of the homeless man \"dying\" with Penny's arm wrapped around his neck.\n\nChundru was pressed Thursday by Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Dafna Yorna about his claim regarding the petechia on Neely's eyelids - and eventually conceded that other medical professionals, including his mentor, did find that such symptoms were consistent with death by asphyxiation.\n\nThe prosecutor also grilled Chundru about whether the darker color of Neely's face compared to his arms proved that blood wasn't flowing to his head because his arteries and veins were being blocked as a result of the chokehold.\n\nYoran pointed to the bystander video where Neely's face is darker than the rest of his skin as veins protrude from his forehead, and asked Chudru what he made of that.\n\n\"One suggestion is that he has some blockage, another suggestion is that he has a suntan,\" Chundru said, before eventually agreeing with the prosecutor.\n\nChundru's cross-examination will continue Friday, with closing arguments in the lightning-rod trial expected for Dec. 2.\n\nSeveral eyewitnesses have testified that Neely, who was unarmed, was threatening passengers on the train during the May 1, 2023 encounter, but had not touched anyone before Penny took him down to the subway floor and held him in the chokehold.\n\nPenny's lawyers have said he acted to protect other straphangers and shouldn't be held criminally liable for Neely's death.\n\nProsecutors say Penny knew his actions could be deadly and continued with them anyway.\n\nPenny, 26, is charged with second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. He faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted on the top charge."

      "text": "Daniel Penny found not guilty in chokehold death of Jordan Neely\n\nManage your account\n\nDaniel Penny was acquitted Monday of criminally negligent homicide in the chokehold death of Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old homeless man with a history of mental illness whose final moments on a New York City subway train were captured on bystander video that set off weeks of protests and drew national attention.\n\nThe decision, on the fifth day of deliberations, came after the jury deadlocked Friday on the more serious charge of manslaughter , leading the judge to dismiss it. Penny faced up to four years in prison.\n\nAs the jury foreperson read the \"not guilty\" verdict, some observers in the courtroom applauded. Others began to audibly sob and yell, including Neely's father, Andre Zachery, who was escorted out.\n\n\"This is America. That is the sound of Black pain,\" one person said outside of the courtroom in Lower Manhattan to the reaction.\n\nChants of \"no justice, no peace,\" could be heard echoing from outside.\n\nThe case divided people in New York - and beyond - in some cases along political and racial lines. Neely was Black. Penny is white. Some people viewed Penny as callous and his actions as criminal on the day he encountered Neely, who had been shouting and acting erratically when he boarded a subway train in Manhattan on May 1, 2023. Others contend Penny was selfless in his attempt to protect fellow passengers.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said he respected the jury's verdict. The jury deliberated for about an hour on the criminally negligent homicide charge after about four days spent considering the manslaughter charge.\n\n\"Their lengthy deliberation - and the totality of the facts and the evidence - underscored why this case was put in front of a jury of Mr. Penny's peers,\" Bragg said in a statement.\n\nThe anonymous jury, made up of seven women and five men, were told before they began deliberating that they had to come to a unanimous decision on the top charge of manslaughter in the second degree before moving on to consider criminally negligent homicide. But Judge Maxwell Wiley changed that order Friday after jurors twice sent a note saying they could not reach an agreement.\n\nThe judge had also instructed jurors to decide whether Penny's actions caused Neely's death and, if so, whether he had acted recklessly and in an unjustified manner.\n\nBefore he encountered Penny, Neely, a former Michael Jackson impersonator, ranted about being hungry and thirsty and said that he wanted to return to jail and didn't care if he lived or died, witnesses testified. Penny, 26, a former Marine and Long Island native, placed Neely in a chokehold that prosecutors said lasted almost six minutes.\n\nA New York City medical examiner ruled that Neely died from compression to his neck as a result of the chokehold.\n\nNeely's uncle, Christopher Neely, said he was \"taken aback\" as the verdict was announced because he thought the jury would at least convict him on the lesser charge.\n\n\"At least give him a charge because it should be some type of penalty that should have been been handed down to Danny Penny period. They gave him no penalty, and I feel like the jury gave up on us,\" Neely said.\n\nDonte Mills, a lawyer representing Neely's family, said at a news conference that he was disheartened by the verdict Monday, as supporters held up a picture of Neely dressed as Jackson. Mills asked that Neely's death have meaning, and urged that others, instead of becoming physical with someone who may be hungry, offer them food.\n\n\"He had a muffin in his pocket,\" Mills said of what police later discovered in Neely's jacket. \"Jordan just wanted someone to acknowledge him on the train, but instead, he was choked to death.\"\n\nLawyers for Penny could not immediately be reached for comment about the verdict, but had earlier expressed concern Monday to the judge that the jury could be influenced by the demonstrators' chanting coming from outside the courthouse.\n\nDuring the trial, Penny's attorneys told jurors that he stepped in because he believed Neely might attack other passengers and he intended only to restrain him until police arrived, which Penny also told police. They also argued that Neely was not killed by the chokehold and that it was impossible to measure how much pressure Penny had applied.\n\nA forensic pathologist hired by the defense testified that Neely died from a combination of his schizophrenia, synthetic marijuana, sickle cell trait and the struggle from being in Penny's restraint. But the medical examiner who performed the autopsy on Neely, Dr. Cynthia Harris, told jurors it was her medical opinion \"that there are no alternative reasonable explanations\" for his death and that those proposed by the defense were \"so improbable - that it stands shoulder to shoulder with impossibility.\"\n\nDuring cross-examination, one of Penny's attorneys, Steven Raiser sought to cast doubt on Harris' testimony about how she and her colleagues had come to a unanimous decision as to Neely's cause of death. Raiser suggested that they had failed to consider all the facts before making that determination.\n\nHe revisited that claim in his closing argument last week.\n\n\"I submit to you there was a rush to judgment, based on something other than medical science,\" he told jurors.\n\nThe case also spurred debates about safety within the city's subway system and failures in addressing homelessness and mental illness, both of which Neely had struggled with. Jumaane Williams, a Black Democrat who is New York City's public advocate, was among those who questioned why police let Penny go after questioning him at a precinct hours after Neely's killing. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, also a Democrat, said Neely had been \"murdered.\" Prominent Republicans like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Matt Gaetz praised Penny and promoted a fundraiser for his legal fund, which has raised more than $3 million. His defense team includes Thomas Kenniff, a Republican who ran unsuccessfully for Manhattan District Attorney in 2021.\n\nVice President-elect JD Vance said on X in response to the verdict that \"justice was done in this case. It was a scandal Penny was ever prosecuted in the first place.\"\n\nProsecutors did not dispute that Neely's actions on the train scared many of the passengers or that he was on synthetic cannabinoids, which were found in his system. In her opening statement, Dafna Yoran, an assistant prosecutor with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, said that Neely had \"demanded to be seen\" and that despite his not having touched anyone and not having displayed a weapon or threatened to use one, many people in the subway car were frightened of what he might do.\n\nShe has said Penny's \"initial intent was even laudable,\" but that he was reckless when he continued to choke Neely even after he posed no threat, including after the train doors had opened at the next station and passengers could exit. For some of that time, she said and video showed, two other men helped restrain Neely. One of those men testified that he believed Penny had held the chokehold for too long. At times, Yoran said, he even ignored the pleas of bystanders to let Neely go. In her closing argument, Yoran said that \"no one had to die\" and that Penny was not justified in his use of physical deadly force.\n\n\"You obviously cannot kill someone because they are crazy and ranting and looking menacing,\" Yoran told jurors in her closing argument. \"No matter what it is that they are saying.\"\n\nShe also said that Penny \"could have easily restrained\" Neely \"without choking him to death.\"\n\nIn his closing argument, Raiser prompted jurors to imagine that they were on the train the day Neely boarded \"filled with rage and not afraid of any consequences.\"\n\n\"With you sitting much as you are now in this tightly confined space, looking up at Mr. Neely,\" he said. \"You have very little room to move and nowhere to run.\"\n\n\"Danny,\" as the defense attorneys referred to Penny throughout the trial, \"put his life on the line\" and stepped up in the absence of police, Raiser said.\n\nBut Yoran challenged the portrayal of Penny as a self-sacrificing and benevolent subway rider. In her opening statement she said that Penny failed to acknowledge Neely's humanity. She continued that thread in her closing argument, playing video of Penny twice referring to Neely as a \"crackhead\" in an interview with police and telling jurors that he never asked about Neely's condition.\n\n\"There is something else that is glaringly missing from his statement. Any regret. Any remorse. Any self reflection,\" she said. She added: \"He never expresses any sorrow about the man's death.\"\n\nDuring deliberations, jurors asked to rewatch bystander videos of Penny restraining Neely, responding officers' body camera videos and video of Penny's subsequent interview with two police detectives at a precinct. They also asked to rehear the medical examiner's testimony about issuing a death certificate before Neely's full toxicology reports were completed. They also asked for the judge to read back the definitions of recklessness and criminal negligence and to have the definitions in writing.\n\nPenny chose not to testify. During the trial, jurors heard from more than 40 witnesses - subway passengers who witnessed Penny restrain Neely, police officers who responded to the scene, a Marine Corps instructor who taught Penny various chokeholds , the two pathologists, a psychiatric expert and six character witnesses , who included two Marines, Penny's mother and one of his sisters.\n\nOn Wednesday, Neely's father sued Penny accusing him of negligent contact, assault and battery that caused Neely's death. The civil suit was filed in New York state's Supreme Court, a trial-level court in New York state.\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com"

      "text": "Defense pathologist says Jordan Neely didn't die of chokehold on NYC subway\n\nManage your account\n\nJordan Neely died from the \"combined effects\" of a number of a factors, not a chokehold, a forensic pathologist hired by Daniel Penny's attorneys testified Thursday.\n\nPenny is charged with manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide in the chokehold death of Neely on a New York City subway train in May 2023.\n\nDr. Satish Chundru took the stand as the second expert witness for the defense team, which is trying to refute testimony from a New York City medical examiner who ruled that Neely died from compression to his neck as a result of a chokehold.\n\nChundru, a forensic pathologist and consultant who said he has worked as a medical examiner for counties in Florida and Texas, said he has conducted more than 9,000 autopsies. He said the defense retained him a little over two weeks after Neely's killing.\n\nNeely, 30, who had a history of mental illness, shouted, threw his jacket to the ground and made distressing comments about being hungry and thirsty and wanting to return to jail when he boarded an uptown F train on May 1, 2023. Penny, 26, who was a passenger on the train, put Neely in a chokehold and took him to the ground. His attorneys have said that he did not intend to kill Neely and that he acted to protect the people around him.\n\nProsecutors have said Penny held Neely in the chokehold for six minutes, letting him go only after he had become unconscious and gone limp. Two other people helped him restrain Neely for some of that time. A bystander video of Penny choking Neely on the floor of the subway car, which was widely shared online, divided people in New York and beyond. Some viewed his actions as praiseworthy, while others condemned them and labeled him a vigilante.\n\nChundru's testimony contradicted that of Dr. Cynthia Harris, the medical examiner who performed the autopsy on Neely and ruled that he died of the chokehold . Chundru said he did not believe that Neely died of a chokehold or that Penny had applied consistent and sufficient pressure to render him unconscious.\n\nChundru said he believed Neely died from \"the combined effects of sickle cell crisis, the schizophrenia, the struggle and restraint and the synthetic marijuana\" that was in his system. He said he had reviewed Neely's autopsy report, two toxicology reports, genetic studies, photographs from the autopsy, \"a couple of videos of the incident,\" psychiatric records, witness statements and transcripts of police body camera video, among other things.\n\nNeely's father, Andre Zachery, hung his head as parts of the bystander video were shown Thursday, and he left the courtroom multiple times during Chundru's testimony, including after he said Neely had not died of a chokehold.\n\nChundru criticized Harris, who told jurors Neely suffered \"an asphyxial death,\" for issuing a ruling about his cause of death before toxicology and other tests were complete.\n\nHarris, a prosecution witness, testified over three days and said she based her decision on the autopsy findings coupled with the video and the investigative information about it, as well as with knowledge of Neely's use of synthetic cannabinoids. She was in the courtroom Thursday during Chundru's testimony.\n\nOne of Penny's attorneys, Steven Raiser, spent hours trying to poke holes in her findings and testimony. He questioned how she came to her conclusion without full toxicology results.\n\n\"No toxicological result imaginable was going to change my opinion,\" she said.\n\nHarris walked jurors through Penny's final moments, explaining down to the minute when he made his last purposeful movement. She also testified that within the medical examiner's office, the \"consensus was unanimous\" about Neely's cause of death.\n\nCross-examining Chundru, Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Dafna Yoran appeared to raise questions about the quality of his work, suggesting through a series of questions that he performed more autopsies a year than is recommended by the National Association of Medical Examiners, of which he is a member. Yoran will continue her cross-examination Friday.\n\nThe defense this week called six people to testify as character witnesses, including Penny's sister and mother. His sister, Jacqueline Penny, 27, an accountant, testified about their suburban upbringing in West Islip on Long Island, a small town that she described as neighborly and beachy.\n\nShe said Penny had always been \"patriotic,\" so she was not too surprised when he enlisted in the Marines after he graduated from high school because other men in their family had also served in the military.\n\nTheir mother, Gina Flaim-Penny, a teacher's assistant who lives in Queens, testified that she taught Penny to \"treat others equally as you would like to be treated\" and that she believed he did so. She said that when she and Penny's father divorced, it was difficult on all four of her children but that they stayed close and leaned on one another. She said that they went to family counseling and that her children also went to a counselor. She testified that she knew her son to be an empathetic, compassionate and peaceful person.\n\nAlong with Penny's sister and mother, four other character witnesses were called by the defense to testify to Penny's empathy, honesty and integrity. Their testimony followed evidence submitted by prosecutors that suggested Penny had lied during an interview with police.\n\nHours after Neely was killed, according to a video shown to jurors, Penny told two detectives in an interview at a precinct that he did not put pressure on Neely's neck and that he had released his chokehold as soon as he received confirmation from the two men who helped him restrain Neely that they were holding Neely. But last week, one of those men, Eric Gonzalez, testified that Penny continued his chokehold after Gonzalez told him, \"I will grab his hands so you can let go.\"\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com"

A more serious manslaughter charge was dismissed last week because the jury deadlocked on that count.\n\nPenny, who had shown little expression during the trial, briefly smiled as the verdict was read. While celebrating later with his attorneys, he said he felt \"great.\"\n\nBoth applause and anger erupted in the courtroom, and Neely's father and two supporters were ushered out after audibly reacting. Another person also left, wailing with tears.\n\n\"It really, really hurts,\" Neely's father, Andre Zachery, said outside the courthouse. \"I had enough of this. The system is rigged.\"\n\nThe case amplified many American fault lines, among them race, politics, crime, urban life, mental illness and homelessness. Neely was Black. Penny is white.\n\nThere were sometimes dueling demonstrations outside the courthouse, including on Monday. High-profile Republican politicians portrayed Penny as a hero while prominent Democrats attended Neely's funeral .\n\nPenny's attorneys argued he was protecting himself and other subway passengers from a volatile, mentally ill man who was making alarming remarks and gestures.\n\nPenny \"finally got the justice he deserved,\" one of his lawyers, Thomas Kenniff, said while celebrating the outcome with him at a downtown Manhattan pub.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat whose office brought the case, said prosecutors \"followed the facts and the evidence from beginning to end\" and respect the verdict.\n\nThe anonymous jury, which had started deliberating Tuesday , was escorted out of court to a van.\n\nPenny, 26, served four years in the Marines and went on to study architecture.\n\nNeely, 30, was a sometime subway performer with a tragic life story: His mother was killed and stuffed in a suitcase when he was a teenager.\n\nAs a younger man, Neely did Michael Jackson tributes - complete with moonwalks - on the city's streets and subways. But Neely also struggled with mental illness after losing his mother, whose boyfriend was convicted of murdering her.\n\nHe subsequently was diagnosed with depression and schizophrenia, was repeatedly hospitalized, and used the synthetic cannabinoid K2 and realized it negatively affected his thinking and behavior, according to medical records seen at the trial. The drug was in his system when he died.\n\nNeely told a doctor in 2017 that being homeless, living in poverty and having to \"dig through the garbage\" for food made him feel so hopeless that he sometimes thought of killing himself, hospital records show.\n\nAbout six years later, he boarded a subway under Manhattan on May 1, 2023, hurled his jacket onto the floor, and declared that he was hungry and thirsty and didn't care if he died or went to jail, witnesses said. Some told 911 operators that he tried to attack people or indicated he'd harm riders, and several testified that they were afraid.\n\nNeely was unarmed, with nothing but a muffin in his pocket, and didn't touch any passengers. One said he made lunging movements that alarmed her enough that she shielded her 5-year-old from him.\n\nPenny came up behind Neely, grabbed his neck, took him to the floor and \"put him out,\" as the veteran told police at the scene.\n\nPassengers' video showed that at one point during the roughly six-minute hold, Neely tapped an onlooker's leg and gestured to him. Later, he briefly got an arm free. But he went still nearly a minute before Penny released him.\n\n\"He's dying,\" an unseen bystander said in one video. \"Let him go!\"\n\nA witness who stepped in to hold down Neely's arms testified that he told Penny to free the man, though Penny's lawyers noted the witness' story changed significantly over time.\n\nPenny told detectives shortly after the encounter that Neely threatened to kill people and the chokehold was an attempt to \"de-escalate\" the situation until police could arrive. The veteran said he held on so long because Neely periodically tried to break loose.\n\n\"I wasn't trying to injure him. I'm just trying to keep him from hurting anyone else. He's threatening people. That's what we learn in the Marine Corps,\" Penny told the detectives.\n\nHowever, one of Penny's Marine Corps instructors testified that the veteran misused a chokehold technique he'd been taught.\n\nProsecutors said Penny reacted far too forcefully to someone he perceived as a peril, not a person. Prosecutors also argued that any need to protect passengers quickly ebbed when the train doors opened at the next station, seconds after Penny took action.\n\nAlthough Penny told police he'd used \"a choke\" or \"a chokehold,\" one of his lawyers, Steven Raiser, cast it as a Marine-taught chokehold \"modified as a simple civilian restraint.\" The defense lawyers contended Penny didn't consistently apply enough pressure to kill Neely.\n\nContradicting a city medical examiner's finding , a pathologist hired by the defense said Neely died not from the chokehold but from the combined effects of K2, schizophrenia, his struggle and restraint, and a blood condition that can lead to fatal complications during exertion.\n\nPenny did not testify , but relatives, friends and fellow Marines did - describing him as an upstanding, patriotic and empathetic man.\n\nThe manslaughter charge would have required proving that Penny recklessly caused Neely's death. Criminally negligent homicide involves engaging in serious \"blameworthy conduct\" while not perceiving such a risk. Both charges were felonies punishable by prison time.\n\nDuring the criminal trial, Neely's father filed a wrongful death suit against Penny.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Joseph B.

His lawyer, Dante Mills, vowed to keep fighting while activists expressed outrage.\n\nWhile Daniel Penny celebrated his freedom after a NYC jury acquitted him in the subway choking death of Jordan Neely, Neely's father, Andre Zachary, expressed heartbreak.\n\n\"My son didn't have to go through this. I didn't have to go through this either ... It hurts. It really, really hurts,\" Zachary said in the aftermath of the verdict.\n\nAccording to the New York Post , Zachary had an outburst in the courtroom when he learned his son's killer would not be going to jail, and people clapped in celebration. He was dramatically kicked out of the courtroom after yelling at a person who applauded Penny getting off.\n\n\"What are we gonna do, people? What's gonna happen to us now? I had enough of this ... The system is rigged. C'mon, people. Let's do something about this,\" Zachary said during the press conference afterward.\n\n\"How dare you laugh and cheer when someone gets away with murdering us,\" said Hawk Newsome, co-founder of Black Lives Matter of Greater New York. \"Racists: burn in hell.\"\n\nPerhaps foreshadowing the outcome, last week, the jury was deadlocked over whether Penny, a former Marine, should be found guilty of manslaughter.\n\nJordan Neely, 30, was known as a subway performer who also had previous mental health challenges. During the conflict that led to his death, Neely had been yelling that he wasn't concerned about whether he lived and that he was hungry and thirsty.\n\n\"The district attorney did a good job, but the jury in this case let us down,\" said Dante Mills, the attorney for Jordan Neely's family. Mills vowed to keep pressing forward with a civil suit against Daniel Penny that seeks damages for Neely's death, citing negligence, assault, and battery.\n\nIn what feels like a reflection of collective exhaustion over the unarmed deaths of Black people, supporters of Jordan Neely took to social media to express outrage over no one being held criminally responsible for his death. Neely's killing raises concerns about vigilantism in an era of increasingly political and social violence.\n\n\"He deserved compassion, dignity, and protection - not the brutality that led to his death. His killing underscores the urgent and overdue need for a complete overhaul in how we address mental health crises and homelessness,\" twee ted New York City Councilman Yusef Salaam, a member of the Exonerated Five .\n\n\"Jordan Neely was unarmed. He needed support and care,\" tweeted Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett. \"Instead, he received a death sentence. His family grieves while the man who took his life walks free.\"\n\nShe added, \"This is more than a miscarriage of justice - it is a green light for more violence against unarmed Black Americans.\"\n\nMore must-reads:\n\nMcDonald's employee who called 911 in CEO's shooting is eligible for a reward, but it will take time\n\nJustice Department, Louisville reach deal after probe prompted by Breonna Taylor killing\n\nSean 'Diddy' Combs male accuser shares traumatic details of his alleged sexual assault at the rapper's infamous white party"

      "text": "Daniel Penny explains in his own words why he restrained Jordan Neely on the subway for so long\n\nManage your account\n\nSpeaking publicly for the first time since his acquittal, Daniel Penny said he restrained Jordan Neely on a subway car last May for more than five minutes because Neely was \"extraordinarily strong\" and Penny was worried he would get up and attack him or someone else.\n\n\"Part of my worry was if I let him go and an incoming train comes, as he's running away, pushes somebody onto the tracks,\" Penny said in an interview with Fox News host Jeanine Pirro. \"It's part of the reason why I did what I did in the way that I did it.\"\n\nPenny did not testify during his criminal trial. The Fox Nation interview is the first time Penny has spoken publicly in detail about the event, and the venue represented friendly terrain as Pirro thanked Penny for his actions.\n\nThe Marine veteran said in the interview he was also concerned about his own safety.\n\n\"I'm on the ground with him, I'm on my back in a very vulnerable position,\" he said. \"If I would have just let him go, I'm on my back now, he can just turn around and start doing what he said to me.\"\n\n\"Killing,\" Pirro said.\n\n\"Killing, hurting,\" Penny responded.\n\nDuring the trial, several witnesses testified they heard Neely say he was willing to go to jail for life but did not testify they heard him say he would kill.\n\nThe interview came after Penny was acquitted by a jury on a criminally negligent homicide charge in a case that raised questions about the safety of the New York City subways and what constitutes self-defense.\n\nPenny also faced a more serious second-degree manslaughter charge, but Judge Maxwell Wiley dismissed it at the request of prosecutors after jurors twice told the court they could not come to a verdict on the count. He could have faced up to 15 years in prison if convicted of manslaughter.\n\nThe case stemmed from the death of Neely , a 30-year-old street artist who struggled with homelessness, mental illness and drugs, on a subway car on May 1, 2023.\n\nProsecutors argued Penny went too far in putting Neely in a chokehold for so long, including after Neely stopped moving, while his defense said he was acting to protect others from a threat and challenged the medical examiner's determination Neely died from the chokehold.\n\nHe defended his actions in the Fox Nation interview and said he would do the same thing again.\n\n\"The guilt I would have felt if someone did get hurt, if he did do what he was threatening to do, I would never be able to live with myself,\" Penny said. \"I'll take a million court appearances and people calling me names and people hating me just to keep one of those people from getting hurt or killed.\"\n\nIn the interview, Penny said he was on his way from college classes at the New York City College of Technology, also known as City Tech, to the gym when Neely \"barreled\" onto the train, threw down his jacket, yelled demands for food and drink and said he was willing to go to jail for life or hurt and kill people if he didn't get them.\n\n\"This was unlike anything I've ever experienced,\" Penny said. \"I believed what he was saying.\"\n\nHe said he was nervous and scared, and over about 15 seconds, he considered what to do.\n\n\"Should I just wait? Should I go to a different car? Should I move away?\" he said. \"But I saw the looks on the mother, on the school kids, on the other passengers - women, children. I felt like the threats were imminent and something had to be done.\"\n\nPenny then grabbed Neely from behind in a chokehold and took him to the ground. He said he hoped that the train would get to the station and police would arrive and take over, but police took several minutes to get there.\n\nHe said Neely was \"thrashing\" and using the subway pole to try to escape the restraint. He described Neely as \"extraordinarily strong\" and so believed he was on drugs.\n\nSeveral other people helped restrain Neely, including one man who grabbed his arms. \"He said, 'You can let him go once I grab him,' (and) I said, 'He's gonna break out of that,' knowing how strong he is.\"\n\nOther subway riders thanked him for stepping in to help, he said.\n\nAsked whether he feels the Neely family's loss, he responded, \"Of course.\"\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of his acquittal Monday, Penny and his legal team went to a bar in lower Manhattan, a bar employee told CNN by phone. There, Penny held a drink in one hand while giving a thumbs-up with the other in a posed picture with his attorneys Thomas Kenniff and Steven Raiser, according to a photo from Kenniff .\n\nThe post-verdict celebration underscores a basic fact about Penny's future: The 26-year-old is now a free man .\n\nHis exact plans remain unclear. His attorneys have not responded to a CNN request for comment on his future.\n\nWhile the criminal case against him is over, Penny still faces a civil lawsuit from Neely's father, Andre Zachery, accusing Penny of assault, battery and causing Neely's death. Zachery, who is listed as the administrator of Neely's estate, accused Penny of having caused the death due to \"negligence, carelessness and recklessness.\" The suit does not specify the amount of money the family is seeking.\n\nKenniff, Penny's defense attorney, did not respond to a request for comment on the suit.\n\nAs for Penny's life and career, he took college classes in engineering and architecture at City Tech. He also served four years in the Marines as a sergeant, from 2017 to 2021, with his last duty assignment at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, according to military records.\n\nAfter restraining Neely last May, Penny spoke with police and made small talk with a detective about his Marine service and career plans.\n\n\"I'm in school. I'm using that GI Bill,\" Penny said, referring to the federal program that offers benefits to veterans for higher education. \"But we'll see. I miss the Marine Corps. I miss the camaraderie.\"\n\nFurther, the trial and debate over his actions on the subway have made him a recognizable public figure and a political talking point - for better or worse.\n\n\"Certainly you'll find people in society who look down upon what he did and his actions, but equally I think you'll see people who are really favorably inclined to embrace him because of his actions,\" CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson said.\n\nPenny's controversial actions in restraining Neely made him a target of protests outside court throughout the trial. The not-guilty verdict further sparked emotions Monday: Neely's father was escorted out of the courtroom after the verdict was read following an audible outburst with expletives, and Hawk Newsome, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter of Greater New York, yelled \"Small world, buddy,\" at Penny while being led out.\n\n\"I now have to kind of look over my shoulder. There's a lot of crazy people out there,\" Penny said in the Fox Nation interview. \"I have to worry about my family, and I have to worry about my future, which is harder to even comprehend.\"\n\nOn the other hand, right-wing political figures have praised his actions and elevated him as a hero. President-elect Donald Trump previously commented on the case, telling Fox News, \"It's an awfully tough case, I think.\" Vice President-elect JD Vance expressed his support for Penny on Monday, saying on X, \"thank God justice was done in this case.\"\n\nRep. Eli Crane, a Republican from Arizona, introduced a resolution in Congress on Monday to grant Penny a Congressional Gold Medal for his \"heroism,\" he said in a post on X.\n\nPenny told Fox Nation he's not a \"confrontational person\" and said he was uncomfortable with the public attention.\n\n\"I still feel completely normal,\" Penny said. \"I don't feel exceptional in any way, and I don't want to feel that. I don't want praise, I don't want attention, I don't want limelight. It just makes me very uncomfortable. I'd like to just go back to normal, but we'll see.\"\n\nCNN's Lauren del Valle, Gloria Pazmino, Celina Tebor and Emma Tucker contributed to this report.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com"

We're failing people like him. | Opinion\n\nManage your account\n\nAbout twice a week, I commute to USA TODAY's office in New York City - tap my card to pay the $2.90 subway fare, walk through the turnstile, wait on the platform and ride from my corner of Brooklyn into Manhattan. They're the same steps that more than half of New York City workers took on their commute in 2019 - an anomaly for the United States, even among other large cities.\n\nRecently, I've spent my time on the train thinking about Jordan Neely .\n\nNeely, a 30-year-old former Michael Jackson impersonator, was killed on the floor of an uptown F train in May 2023 after fellow passenger Daniel Penny put him in a choke hold for six minutes. On Monday, Penny was acquitted of criminally negligent homicide by a jury, days after Judge Maxwell Wiley dismissed a charge of second-degree manslaughter. Penny will walk free.\n\nPeople on the right have celebrated Penny, saying he acted to protect the people on the subway. His supporters donated more than $3 million for his legal expenses on a Christian fundraising platform. It completely disregards the fact that Neely was unarmed and in mental distress.\n\n\"I miss my son,\" Andre Zachary, Neely's father, told reporters outside of the courthouse. \" My son didn't have to go through this . I didn't have to go through this, either. It hurts.\"\n\nThis case is about more than public safety - it's about racial justice, homelessness and mental health care. It's about how our systems fail vulnerable members of our society. It's about the human being who lost his life, and the ways he was failed while alive.\n\nOpinion: Gen Z voters were the biggest disappointment of the election. Why did we fail?\n\nOn May 1, 2023, Neely stuck his hand through the door of a subway train at the Broadway-Lafayette station in lower Manhattan. He threw his jacket down, began yelling and pacing in the subway car .\n\n\"I don't have food, I don't have a drink, I'm fed up,\" he said, according to a freelance journalist who filmed the events. Penny's lawyers say the former Marine, who was 24 years old at the time, heard Neely threaten to kill, although the mother he supposedly said it to did not. Neely was unarmed; all he had in the pocket of his hoodie was a muffin .\n\nWithin moments, Penny wrestled Neely to the ground, putting him in a choke hold. Penny held onto Neely for nearly six minutes, even after he stopped struggling. In one video, a male passenger can be heard telling Penny to let go after Neely defecated on himself.\n\nWhen the police questioned Penny, he described Neely as a \" crackhead .\"\n\n\"These guys are pushing people in front of trains and stuff,\" Penny told detectives.\n\nThe coroner ruled Neely's death a homicide. Defense attorneys say it was also the result of cardiac arrest and a blood flow issue due to sickle cell disease.\n\nEither way, a man is dead because another subway passenger chose to put him in a headlock.\n\nNeely suffered from mental illness starting at age 14, when his mother was murdered by her boyfriend. He entered the foster care system. In 2013, he began having run-ins with law enforcement . He experienced homelessness intermittently during his life.\n\nNeely's life mattered. It should not have mattered that he was experiencing homelessness and was in the midst of a mental health crisis.\n\nOpinion: Trump appointments are punchlines to a morbid joke. But Democrats can't give up.\n\nI understand that people do not want to feel uncomfortable on public transportation. I also think Penny, or anyone else on the subway, could have acted in ways to de-escalate the situation that did not involve a choke hold.\n\n\"If the city just wants this to be a playground for the rich, that is the most dangerous outcome for all of us,\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told The Cut in a 2023 interview on Neely's death. \"We are all subject to violence if the value of our life is measured by our income, or measured by our mental health, or measured by our race.\"\n\nNeely's death also demonstrates a failure by police to act in a way that could have saved his life. It calls into question whether law enforcement, as opposed to first responders or health care professionals, are the best people to be answering mental health calls.\n\nDespite finding Neely not breathing when they arrived, police officers did not give him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and took minutes to begin chest compressions. In testimony, Sgt. Carl Johnson said he didn't tell his officers to give Neely mouth-to-mouth, fearing they would contract AIDS (which is not transmissible by saliva ) or another disease.\n\nInstead of being treated like a person experiencing a mental health crisis, Neely was treated as a perpetrator. It's hard not to think about how these moments could have played out differently had a health care professional been the one to answer the call.\n\nOpinion alerts: Get columns from your favorite columnists + expert analysis on top issues, delivered straight to your device through the USA TODAY app. Don't have the app?

      "text": "What Happened to Daniel Penny? Jordan Neely Subway Case Explained\n\nManage your account\n\nIn one of the most polarizing cases in recent history, former Marine Daniel Penny has received clearance in all homicide charges in the Jordan Neely case. Penny served as the prime suspect in Neely's death, which occurred on a New York City subway train in May 2023. This decision has created much buzz on the internet, effectively dividing the public into two groups. But, what did Daniel Penny exactly do?\n\nHere's everything you need to know regarding the much-discussed Jordan Neely case.\n\nTwenty-six-year-old Daniel Penny has officially been acquitted of murdering Neely after he controversially put the now-deceased man in a lethal chokehold last spring. The concerned jurors were unable to reach a verdict after five days of discussion, forcing the prosecutors to let go of the second-degree manslaughter charge.\n\nThe jury then levied a second allegation of criminally negligent homicide on Daniel Penny but soon decided to exonerate the ex-Marine of all charges. This has resulted in a serious uproar from one faction of the society, who seemingly deemed Penny guilty of engaging in racism, neglecting Jordan Neely's mental condition, and assaulting the 30-year-old man which ultimately led to his death.\n\nNeely, an individual of black ethnicity, last year participated in a public disruption after he unexpectedly started screaming at his fellow subway passengers. He even requested money, conveyed that he was hungry, and expressed his desire to return to prison. This act ended up terrifying the travelers, with one woman going as far as to shield her son. Daniel Penny then jumped into action and put Neely in a chokehold for six minutes, according to BBC .\n\nPrior to his passing, Neely used to perform at Times Square, mimicking Michael Jackson to earn his bread. He also possessed a rich past of criminal activity and served jail time for evading fares, theft, and assaults on women. However, Neely also suffered from several mental illnesses, which seemingly originated after the tragic murder of his mother during his childhood, as per his family.\n\nWhile the Jordan Neely case initiated much public unrest due to its supposed ties to racism and mental illnesses, the final verdict is now out and entails complete freedom for Daniel Penny.\n\nThe post What Happened to Daniel Penny?

Mr. Penny, who is white, lay flat on his back on the subway floor as he held Mr. Neely, who is Black, on top of him, clenching his neck in an arm vice from behind.\n\nImages of Mr. Neely's killing have sparked deeply emotional reactions across the country, laying bare not only the country's deep partisan divides, but also the contrasting values underlying the profoundly different reactions to Mr. Penny's actions on the New York subway. Today in Harlem, hundreds of people gathered to mourn at Mr. Neely's funeral at the Mount Neboh Baptist Church.\n\nDoes fear justify violence? The killing of Jordan Neely in a New York subway has revealed a chasm between stand-your-ground states and states like New York with a legal duty to retreat.\n\nWitnesses have described the actions of Mr. Neely, an unhoused person who had a history of arrests, including an assault on an elderly woman in 2021, as erratic and potentially violent . He screamed that he had no food or drink and didn't care if he went to jail, and took his coat off and threw it down. That's when Mr. Penny took him down to the floor from behind, witnesses said, keeping him in a chokehold for 15 minutes, even after he went limp.\n\nBefore the video became public, police questioned Mr. Penny and released him. But the video caused an uproar, and homeless advocates and Democratic politicians such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, said the circumstances of the encounter did not justify the former Marine's violent reaction. The video also led New York officials to later charge Mr. Penny with manslaughter.\n\n\"Was Mr. Neely behaving erratically? Reports indicate that he was. Might one feel threatened by such behavior? Certainly,\" says Christopher Fee, professor of English at Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania, who has taught service-based courses on homelessness for two decades. \"Should Mr. Neely have died for this behavior? No, of course not. Further, if he were not an African American man, it is quite unlikely that he would have.\"\n\nSince 2005, however, there has been a momentous shift in the ethical and legal understanding of self-defense as Republican states began to pass so-called stand-your-ground laws. Today, 27 states , mostly Republican-led, have passed laws that protect individuals' rights to use deadly force whenever they have a reasonable fear they are being threatened with danger. These laws eliminate what was legally known as a \"duty to retreat.\"\n\nThirteen mostly Democratic-led states, including New York , still impose the duty to retreat, which means individuals cannot resort to deadly force to defend themselves outside their homes if they are able to safely avoid the risk of harm and flee the situation.\n\nSo Republican politicians and many conservatives have seized upon the case to declare Mr. Penny a hero, a \"Subway Superman,\" an avatar of bravery and justified self-defense in the midst of an urban crime wave - and to castigate Democratic notions of justice in this case.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, in a reference to a well-known parable of Jesus, proclaimed Mr. Penny a \"Good Samaritan,\" altering the New Testament story about kindness to strangers to describe him as trying to take back the streets from criminals.\n\n\"We must defeat the Soros-Funded DAs, stop the Left's pro-criminal agenda, and take back the streets for law-abiding citizens,\" Governor DeSantis, who is expected to launch a run for the 2024 presidential race next week, tweeted . \"We stand with Good Samaritans like Daniel Penny. Let's show this Marine ... America's got his back.\"\n\nFormer South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, echoing her likely Florida rival this week, also urged New York's Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul to pardon Mr. Penny.\n\nIf she doesn't, Ms. Haley said that \"criminals will continue to rule the streets of New York because they will know that there is no accountability for anyone who tries to stop them,\" she told Fox News . \"If she pardons him, that sets right a lot of things. It'll put criminals on notice. And, it will let people like Penny - who really were very brave in that instance - it will let them know that we've got their back.\"\n\nIn fact, the crime rate in New York City remains a fraction of the rampant crime and violence the city experienced in the 1970s and 1980s. And while subway crime spiked during the pandemic and has remained an issue, it has been falling this year . Overall subway crime is down nearly 20% in 2023 compared to last year. Major crimes have fallen 10% since this time in 2022.\n\nIn a similar case, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said last month he plans to pardon the former Army Sgt. Daniel Perry, who was convicted of murdering an armed man during a Black Lives Matter protest in 2020 in Austin. Last week, a Texas judge sentenced Mr. Perry to prison for 25 years.\n\n\"Texas has one of the strongest 'Stand Your Ground' laws of self-defense that cannot be nullified by a jury or a progressive District Attorney,\" Republican Governor Abbott tweeted in April, noting that the parole board would have to issue a recommendation for pardon. \"I have already prioritized [reining] in rogue District Attorneys.\"\n\nImages of Mr. Penny choking Mr. Neely on the subway, however, have deeper associations in New York. In 1984, the notorious case of Bernhard \"Bernie\" Goetz also gripped the nation. Mr. Goetz, who had been a victim of subway crime, shot four Black teenagers after they attempted to rob him. Also hailed as a hero at the time, a jury acquitted Mr. Goetz of the charges of attempted murder and assault.\n\nBut the killings of Eric Garner in 2014 and George Floyd in 2020 have also informed the national debate over Mr. Neely's killing, as well as New York's reaction to chokeholds that have killed unarmed Black men.\n\nIn 1993, the New York Police Department banned the use of asphyxiating chokeholds. And after the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer, the state of New York became one of the first to ban the use of chokeholds by law enforcement statewide.\n\nIn 2022, a state court also reinstated a local law the New York City Council passed after the murder of Mr. Floyd in 2020. The Eric Garner Anti-Chokehold Act, or \"diaphragm law,\" banned the use of chokeholds - or any type of sitting, kneeling, or standing on a person's chest or back that could suffocate them.\n\nMany observers say Mr. Penny's actions to restrain Mr. Neely on the subway should be understood in the context of the nation's epidemic of mass shootings. In 2022, a Black nationalist entered a New York subway car, threw smoke grenades, and fired a handgun 33 times, injuring almost 30 people. No one was killed.\n\n\"I don't think this actual episode was as much about race - no real evidence that was a factor - and more about too many guns and gun shootings and the lack of government help for mental illness and homelessness,\" says Lori Brown, professor of sociology and criminology at Meredith College in North Carolina. \"And I do think there is an issue for the passengers on the subway who didn't trust the police to take care of things and decided to take care of things themselves.\"\n\nBut the contexts of gun violence can't be separated from the wider history of race in America, others say.\n\n\"These acts are rooted in fear: fear of death, fear of bodily harm, fear of the other, fear of that which we do not understand,\" says Professor Fee at Gettysburg College. \"Jordan Neely represented a terrible trifecta of sorts, in that he represented three categories Americans most fear: Black men, the poor and unhoused, and the mentally ill.\"\n\nRodney Coates, professor of critical race and ethnic studies at Miami University in Ohio, says it is not surprising that those who would ban discussions of the history of race and racism, or expel Black lawmakers from their midst, would then defend the chokehold killing of a Black man in a crisis situation.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

These deaths, these murders, even urban crime, or a young man walking and saying, 'I don't have anything to eat and drink, I don't have a place' - these are screaming huddled masses yelling, 'Hey, we're here.'\"\n\n\"What are we going to do about them?\" he says. \"Where is the American dream, and how do we make that American dream a reality? What does that look like? We are at this existential point in time. It's an existential moment that is going to define us as a people. Not Black, white, Native American, homeless without shelter, but as humans, as Americans.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

What often follows is the building of trust, which strengthens bonds at a time when other forces seem to be pulling people apart. On this week's \"Why We Wrote This\" podcast.\n\n( 3 min. read )\n\nWhen it comes to technology, faster usually means better. In communication technology, though, \"faster\" also means that you can miscommunicate rapidly, too.\n\n( 2 min. read )\n\nHonesty will be a prime topic at the Group of Seven summit this weekend in Japan. For leaders of these wealthy nations, there's still too much secrecy around an estimated $326 billion in debt held by more than 70 low-income nations. A default by any one of them - or worse, a country caught lying about its statistics - could spark a global financial crisis.\n\n\"It is essential to improve debt data transparency and accuracy to prevent future debt crises,\" says Japanese Finance Minister Suzuki Shunichi.\n\nYet the fact that the G-7 is even pressing more nations to be open about their debt details is a testament to the honesty already achieved in official data. Since the 1994-95 Mexican financial crisis, both the World Bank and International Monetary Fund have raised global standards by helping dozens of countries adopt advanced reporting systems. \"We are working hard to make statistics more comprehensive and available,\" says David Malpass, the departing World Bank president. In some countries, criticism of official data is still a crime.\n\nData transparency is a \"public good\" and \"a core principle of good governance,\" says the IMF. And not just to avoid a financial collapse or to better involve citizens in decision making. Without accuracy in climate-action data, for example, the world may not make as much progress against global warming. \"Sound public finances enable us to invest even more in the fight against climate change,\" says European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\n\nA leading example of how data dishonesty can ricochet around the globe is Greece. In 2009-10, a new government in Athens admitted the country had long lied about its national deficit. The sudden fear of a debt default triggered a severe financial crisis in Europe that almost ended the continent's experiment with a single currency, the euro.\n\nOne of those who exposed the truth about Greece's finances was a new member of the country's reformed statistics agency, Andreas Georgiou. \"As a statistician, you hold up a mirror to society: look, this is you,\" he told the German news outlet Süddeutsche Zeitung in March. \"And it is a constant of history that the rulers would like to keep this mirror in their own hands.\"\n\nToday, after an international bailout program for Greece, severe fiscal austerity for its people, and better reporting of official statistics, the country has experienced one of the most rapid rates of debt reduction in the world. The government budget is expected to show a surplus this year. And Greece's economy could be upgraded soon to \"investment grade\" by international credit agencies.\n\nAll of Greece's reforms during the country's 10-year debt crisis \"have all contributed to the maturity of the Greek society, enabling it to understand the new international economic environment,\" stated Greece's central bank in April.\n\nGreece's comeback from debt deceit will be in the background at the G-7 in Hiroshima. Financial statistics can be as dry as dust. Yet when officials are open and honest about such data, it can lubricate the world economy.\n\nEach weekday, the Monitor includes one clearly labeled religious article offering spiritual insight on contemporary issues, including the news. The publication - in its various forms - is produced for anyone who cares about the progress of the human endeavor around the world and seeks news reported with compassion, intelligence, and an essentially constructive lens. For many, that caring has religious roots. For many, it does not. The Monitor has always embraced both audiences. The Monitor is owned by a church - The First Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston - whose founder was concerned with both the state of the world and the quality of available news.\n\n( 2 min. read )\n\nConsidering what God knows about His children offers a healing perspective - as a woman experienced when faced with recurring periods of depression years ago.\n\nJames Wright (l.), a sophomore at Owensboro High School, learns how to weld a bead on a beam from Collin Baldwin, a pipe welder for Envision Contracting, during an annual Construction Career Day, Thursday, Apr. 24, 2025, in Owensboro, Ky. There's a growing push for high school students to consider vocational programs rather than four-year colleges, the cost of which has grown 181% since 1989-90 - even after adjusting for inflation, according to the Education Data Initiative.\n\nThank you for joining us. Please come back Monday, when Ann Scott Tyson will report on how China's young urbanites are responding to 20% unemployment.\n\nAlso, here's a bonus read , on Malcolm X Day: Although the Muslim leader and Martin Luther King Jr. often are seen as rivals, columnist Ken Makin looks at a mutuality between the two of them.\n\nWe want to hear, did we miss an angle we should have covered?

In communication technology, though, \"faster\" also means that you can miscommunicate rapidly, too.\n\n( 2 min. read )\n\nHonesty will be a prime topic at the Group of Seven summit this weekend in Japan. For leaders of these wealthy nations, there's still too much secrecy around an estimated $326 billion in debt held by more than 70 low-income nations. A default by any one of them - or worse, a country caught lying about its statistics - could spark a global financial crisis.\n\n\"It is essential to improve debt data transparency and accuracy to prevent future debt crises,\" says Japanese Finance Minister Suzuki Shunichi.\n\nYet the fact that the G-7 is even pressing more nations to be open about their debt details is a testament to the honesty already achieved in official data. Since the 1994-95 Mexican financial crisis, both the World Bank and International Monetary Fund have raised global standards by helping dozens of countries adopt advanced reporting systems. \"We are working hard to make statistics more comprehensive and available,\" says David Malpass, the departing World Bank president. In some countries, criticism of official data is still a crime.\n\nData transparency is a \"public good\" and \"a core principle of good governance,\" says the IMF. And not just to avoid a financial collapse or to better involve citizens in decision making. Without accuracy in climate-action data, for example, the world may not make as much progress against global warming. \"Sound public finances enable us to invest even more in the fight against climate change,\" says European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\n\nA leading example of how data dishonesty can ricochet around the globe is Greece. In 2009-10, a new government in Athens admitted the country had long lied about its national deficit. The sudden fear of a debt default triggered a severe financial crisis in Europe that almost ended the continent's experiment with a single currency, the euro.\n\nOne of those who exposed the truth about Greece's finances was a new member of the country's reformed statistics agency, Andreas Georgiou. \"As a statistician, you hold up a mirror to society: look, this is you,\" he told the German news outlet Süddeutsche Zeitung in March. \"And it is a constant of history that the rulers would like to keep this mirror in their own hands.\"\n\nToday, after an international bailout program for Greece, severe fiscal austerity for its people, and better reporting of official statistics, the country has experienced one of the most rapid rates of debt reduction in the world. The government budget is expected to show a surplus this year. And Greece's economy could be upgraded soon to \"investment grade\" by international credit agencies.\n\nAll of Greece's reforms during the country's 10-year debt crisis \"have all contributed to the maturity of the Greek society, enabling it to understand the new international economic environment,\" stated Greece's central bank in April.\n\nGreece's comeback from debt deceit will be in the background at the G-7 in Hiroshima. Financial statistics can be as dry as dust. Yet when officials are open and honest about such data, it can lubricate the world economy.\n\nEach weekday, the Monitor includes one clearly labeled religious article offering spiritual insight on contemporary issues, including the news. The publication - in its various forms - is produced for anyone who cares about the progress of the human endeavor around the world and seeks news reported with compassion, intelligence, and an essentially constructive lens. For many, that caring has religious roots. For many, it does not. The Monitor has always embraced both audiences. The Monitor is owned by a church - The First Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston - whose founder was concerned with both the state of the world and the quality of available news.\n\n( 2 min. read )\n\nConsidering what God knows about His children offers a healing perspective - as a woman experienced when faced with recurring periods of depression years ago.\n\nJames Wright (l.), a sophomore at Owensboro High School, learns how to weld a bead on a beam from Collin Baldwin, a pipe welder for Envision Contracting, during an annual Construction Career Day, Thursday, Apr. 24, 2025, in Owensboro, Ky.

The Russians oppose President Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine and had left their country shortly after last year's invasion, but the Ukrainians - both active-duty soldiers - stood firm. PEN canceled the panel that included Russians.\n\nAcclaimed Russian émigré journalist Masha Gessen quit as vice president of the PEN America board over the episode. Suzanne Nossel, the organization's CEO, called it \"a no-win situation.\"\n\nTo Americans who care deeply about Ukraine while also seeking to defend Russians who have nothing to do with the war or outright oppose it, the PEN America situation is exasperating.\n\n\"The relentless zero-sum approach is just awful,\" says an analyst with long experience in the post-Soviet world, speaking not for attribution. \"Don't these folks realize they are on the same side? Literally no one involved in this whole dispute supports Putin or his war, so what are they fighting about?\"\n\nThe sensitivities are understandable. Russia's invasion isn't just territorial; it's also cultural. Many Ukrainians now have a deep aversion to all things Russian - language, literature, performing arts. Anti-Russian sentiment has also gripped the West, leading to the cancellation of performances by Russian artists.\n\nThe Ukrainian writer-soldiers said that they faced legal and ethical restrictions that prevented their participation, and that they weren't \"boycotting.\" But the end result was the same: a curtailing of speech by PEN America, ironic for an organization founded to defend free expression.\n\nFor Mr. Rushdie, recipient of an award for courage, the gala was an opportunity to stand up to the tyranny of his foes. \"Terror must not terrorize us. Violence must not deter us,\" he said. \"The struggle goes on.\"\n\nUkrainians and anti-war Russians can also take heart in his message.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

The crux of this evolution: Taiwan emphatically prefers peace.\n\nFlorida proudly proclaims itself the freest state. It's a place where the pursuit of happiness is as complex as the people who seek it.\n\nIn New York's bohemian haunts, a movement of new conservatives is growing in reaction to what they see as liberal dominance in art and culture. Their work reflects a nation in flux.\n\nThe events of the past few years have laid bare the divisions simmering beneath the country's surface.

But this is only part of the story.\n\nThe U.S. homicide rate dropped by the most on record in 2023 - a welcome reversal after pandemic spikes in violence.\n\nClaudine Gay stepped down as president of Harvard Jan. 2. She and her defenders say her ouster was politically motivated. Critics say academic standards still matter.\n\nDuring his 10 years as head of the Catholic Church, Pope Francis has placed an emphasis on charity over doctrine.
