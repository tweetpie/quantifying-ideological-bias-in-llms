      "text": "'You can't just use guns': Maddow raises concern over DOGE's use of weapons\n\nRachel Maddow expressed concern about what she described as a troubling development in the Trump administration's efforts to reshape the federal government.\n\nOn her Monday evening MSNBC show, she highlighted recent actions by DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency), a cost-cutting agency led by President Donald Trump and Elon Musk , suggesting it may be evolving into a forceful entity reminiscent of an army.\n\nMaddow's opening monologue focused on reports that DOGE staff, allegedly accompanied by U.S. Marshals, had forcibly entered the U.S. African Development Foundation . This incident followed earlier reports of DOGE breaking into the U.S. Institute of Peace building after failing to gain entry with FBI agents days before.\n\nThe MSNBC host criticized these entries into independent agencies' buildings, arguing that these actions represent a dangerous overreach, stating, \"There are legitimate legal disputes as to whether this DOGE group has any legal authority over some of these agencies that they're trying to get into, so they can take over their systems and fire their staff and shut them down. Those disputes are legal disputes that need to be sorted out legally.\"\n\nMaddow emphasized the severity of these incidents, saying,  \"You can't just use guns to force your way in, in the meantime, as a means of settling that dispute.\" She went on to characterize these actions as \"an armed assault on the U.S. government,\" warning that if legal disputes are being resolved through force, it crosses into dangerous territory.\n\nThe incidents led Maddow to question whether DOGE has transformed into something more menacing than initially thought, especially if U.S. Marshals are now working for them \"against other parts of the government.\"\n\nShe raised a chilling question: \"Did they have an army?\"\n\nMaddow concluded by expressing alarm at the possibility that the president might have granted his top campaign donor the authority to use physical force against other parts of the U.S. government, suggesting this development places the country in uncharted and concerning territory.\n\n\"I mean, if the president has given his top campaign donor the ability to use physical force, the ability to use the force of arms against other parts of the U.S. government, we are in a different place than we thought we were.\"\n\nWatch the segment below or at this link:\n\n- YouTube www.youtube.com"

      "text": "Americans own guns to protect themselves from psychological as well as physical threats\n\nKamala Harris , Donald Trump , Tim Walz and JD Vance all have something in common. All four of them, along with an estimated 42% of American adults , have lived in a home with at least one gun.\n\nGun ownership in the United States is widespread and cuts across all sorts of cultural divides - including race, class and political ideology. Like all mass experiences in American life, owning a gun can mean very different things to different people.\n\nOne thing that American gun owners tend to agree on, no matter their differences, is that guns are for personal protection. In a 2023 Pew survey , 72% of gun owners reported that they owned a firearm at least in part for protection, and 81% of gun owners reported that owning a gun helped them to feel safer. This perspective contrasts to that of gun owners in other developed economies , who generally report that guns are more dangerous than safe and that they own a gun for some other reason.\n\nI'm a psychologist who studies contemporary society. In the lab, my colleagues and I have been investigating this feeling of safety that American gun owners report. We're trying to get a more complete sense of just what people are using their firearms to protect against. Our research suggests it goes much deeper than physical threats.\n\nBy combining social-scientific research on firearms ownership with a raft of interviews we've conducted, we've developed a theory that gun owners aren't just protecting against the specific threat of physical violence. Owners are also using a gun to protect their psychological selves . Owning a gun helps them feel more in control of the world around them and more able to live meaningful, purposeful lives that connect to the people and communities they care for.\n\nThis sort of protection may be especially appealing to those who think that the normal institutions of society - such as the police or the government - are either unable or unwilling to keep them safe . They feel they need to take protection into their own hands.\n\nThis use of a deadly weapon to provide comfort and solace may come at a cost, however, as firearms often bring a heightened sense of vigilance with them. Firearm instructors frequently teach owners to be especially aware of their environment and all the potential dangers and threats within. When gun owners look for danger, they often are more likely to find it .\n\nGun owners may end up perceiving the world as a more dangerous place, institutions as more uncaring or incompetent, and their own private actions as all the more important for securing their lives and their livelihoods.\n\nWhat does this cycle of protection and threat look like in everyday life? My colleagues and I recently ran a study to investigate . We're still undergoing peer review, so our work is not final yet.\n\nWe recruited a group of over 150 firearms owners who told us that they regularly carry their guns, along with over 100 demographically matched Americans who have never owned a gun. Over two weeks, our research team texted the participants at two random times each day, asking them to fill out a survey telling us what they were doing and how they were feeling.\n\nTo get a sense of how guns change the psychological landscape of their owners, we divided our gun-carrying group into two. When we texted one half of the group, before we asked any other questions, we simply asked whether they had their gun accessible and why they'd made that decision. For the other half of our gun-owning participants, and for our non-gun-owning control group, firearms and firearm carrying never came up.\n\nWhen subtly reminded of guns in general - regardless of whether their gun was accessible - our participants reported feeling more safe and in control and that their lives were more meaningful. Thanks to our random-assignment procedure, we can be pretty confident that it was thinking about guns, as opposed to any differences in the underlying groups themselves, that caused this particular increase in psychological well-being.\n\nAbout half of the times that we texted, the gun owners told us that they had a gun accessible at that moment. When a gun was handy, our participants told us that they were feeling more vigilant and anxious, and that their immediate situation was more chaotic. This result didn't seem to be driven by owners choosing to have guns available when they were putting themselves into objectively more dangerous situations: We found the same pattern when we looked just at moments when our participants were sitting at home, watching television.\n\nContemporary American gun ownership may have conflicting messages embedded within it. First, a gun is a thing you can use to bolster your fundamental psychological needs to feel safe, to feel in control and to feel like you matter and belong. Second, having a gun focuses your attention on the dangers of the world.\n\nBy both fueling a sense of danger and holding out the promise of rescuing you from the fear, messaging around guns may end up locking some owners into a sort of doom loop.\n\nMy collaborators and I are currently exploring whether stressing other parts of gun ownership may help owners to move beyond this negative spiral. For instance, while owners often talk about \"danger,\" they also talk frequently about \"responsibility .\"\n\nBeing a responsible gun owner is central to many owners' identities. In one study, 97% of owners reported that they were \" more responsible than the average gun owner ,\" and 23% rated themselves as being in the top 1% of responsibility overall. This, of course, is statistically impossible.\n\nTo more fully understand the many ways responsible firearm ownership can look, we are in the process of interviewing gun owners from all around the state of Wisconsin, a notably diverse state when it comes to gun ownership . We're tapping into as many of the ways of owning a gun as we can, talking with protective owners, hunters, sport shooters, collectors, folks in urban areas, folks in rural areas, men, women, young people, old people, liberals, conservatives, and, of course, trying to capture the complex ways that race shapes ownership .\n\nWho do gun owners feel they are responsible for? What kinds of actions do they think responsible owners take?\n\nWe hope to learn more about the many different ways that people conceptualize what a gun can do for them. American gun cultures are complex and distinct things. By exploring the worldviews that support firearm ownership, we can better understand what it means to live in the U.S. today.\n\nNick Buttrick , Assistant Professor of Psychology, University of Wisconsin-Madison\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "Analysis reveals Trump's 'dangerous' reasons for restoring 'remorseless' Mel Gibson's gun rights\n\nPardon attorney Elizabeth Oyer was fired from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) after refusing to restore actor Mel Gibson's gun rights, which were taken away because of a domestic violence case. Under a federal law passed in 1996 under President Bill Clinton, people convicted of domestic violence can be stripped of their gun rights - and in a 2011 domestic violence case, Gibson pleaded \"no contest\" to accusations that he assaulted his girlfriend.\n\nPresident Donald Trump picked Gibson as his ambassador to Hollywood. And Oyer is speaking out about being fired from DOJ, telling the New York Times , \"This is dangerous. This isn't political - this is a safety issue.\"\n\nOyer also discussed her firing with CNN's Kaitlin Collins and said that \"within hours\" of refusing to restore Gibson's gun rights, she was \"escorted out of my office by DOJ security officers.\"\n\nIn an article published on March 13 , Salon's Amanda Marcotte describes Gibson as a \"poster boy\" for \"red flag\" laws that \"allow the state to remove guns from people in a mental health crisis or who are an active threat to the community\" - emphasizing that Oyer was \"right\" when she refused to restore the actor's gun rights.\n\n\"A history of domestic violence is a strong predictor of a man's overall tendencies towards violence - a fact so well-known that even the far-right Supreme Court balked last year at ending the law prohibiting domestic abusers from having guns,\" Marcotte explains . \"Eighty-two percent of Americans agree that wife-beaters should not have guns, including even 81 percent of Republicans. Gibson's story illustrates why this is such a big deal. While Gibson downplayed the attack against his then-girlfriend as a 'slap,' prosecutors said he punched her hard enough to bust her teeth.\"\n\nMarcotte continues , \"But what's telling is how remorseless Gibson has been. During the attack itself, he screamed that she 'deserved it' while calling her names, outraged she refused to 'smile, and blow me.' In official court documents, he continued to insist his violence was merely 'an attempt to bring her back to reality.'\"\n\nTrump's aggressive defense of Gibson, Marcotte argues , is consistent with his \"long history of rewarding men accused of violence against women with praise, cushy jobs and legal interference to protect them.\"\n\n\"The battle over Gibson's gun rights underscores how this is not, as MAGA likes to pretend, a matter of feminist joykills complaining about a few off-color jokes,\" Marcotte explains . \"Gibson's legal right to tell jokes, no matter how tasteless, is not in dispute. The issue is letting him have weapons designed to kill people with ease. The research on this is crystal clear: Domestic abuse is far more likely to turn deadly when a gun is involved.\"\n\nMarcotte continues , \"But not only does Trump not care, it seems very much like the threat of violence is part of the allure. Trump's toxic brand of 'masculinity' valorizes violence and abuse, especially against people who are smaller or less powerful. That's why his administration appears to have intervened in the prosecution of Andrew Tate, a misogynist 'influencer' who was charged in Britain and Romania for rape and sex trafficking.\n\nWatch the video below or at this link."

      "text": "gun control\n\nThe use of bump stocks, which are devices that allow semiautomatic weapons to be converted into full-fledged machine guns, has been hotly debated by gun control and gun rights activists. And today, the U.S. Justice Department's Office of Public Affairs announced a clarification on bump stocks -asserting that they meet the definition of \"machine gun\" under federal law.\n\nFollowing a Sunday shooting in Jacksonville, Florida that left at least three people, including the gunman, dead and several others injured, student activists- galvanized in the wake of the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February-are planning to protest Tuesday afternoon at the offices of Republican senators backed by the National Rifle Association (NRA).\n\nU.S. Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, is filing an emergency bill to block Education Secretary Betsy DeVos' plan to allow federal funds to be used to put guns in classrooms .\n\nOn June 5, a call came into the Broward County Sheriff's Office alleging an ongoing hostage situation at the family home of student activist David Hogg, a survivor of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Law enforcement officers arrived on the scene only to find no such situation: Hogg and his family had been swatted.\n\nFormer President Jimmy Carter has called U.S. politics a system of \"legalized bribery\" in which powerful interests spend billions of dollars on lobbying and campaign funding to ensure that members of Congress pay more attention to them than to the general public. With the upcoming midterm elections, we will see the full force of this tsunami of cash washing over our electoral system.\n\nPolice in Denver, CO are investigating after an off-duty FBI agent allegedly sent a man to the hospita l early Saturday morning, ABC 7 reports.\n\nThe parent of one of the students murdered in the Santa Fe, Texas high school massacre was not impressed with President Donald Trump's Thursday visit . Trump flew to spend some time with the victims' families before heading on to a fundraiser in Dallas.\n\nAt least 41 people have been killed so far this year with guns at our nation's schools, more than three times the number of American military deaths in combat zones, but Trump is working to increase American gun sales overseas.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Broward State Attorney's Office released videos of Parkland shooter Nicolas Cruz mercilessly plotting his attack.\n\nLauren Hogg, a student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School where 17 people were shot and killed earlier this year, slammed Mike Pence on Friday after the vice president offered his prayers for the victims in Friday's shooting in Indiana.\n\nSince America's instant check system for gun buyers went online in November 1998, the gun control movement and its allies in Congress have made the expansion of the system their  primary focus. The National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS)  was designed to be fast and easy. Licensed dealers call in a prospective gun buyer's information to an FBI call center in Clarksburg, West Virginia, where checkers run the name through three separate computer databases of past criminal offenders and those adjudicated for mental illness. The process takes only a few minutes."

      "text": "Revealed: Gun lobbyists and Cambridge Analytica weaponized gun owners' private details\n\nThese highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.\n\nArthur Douglas has been passionate about guns his entire life. He spent his childhood hunting, then amassed a treasured collection of firearms, including antique rifles he considers priceless. For years, he's worked as a firearms instructor for the National Rifle Association and the U.S. Concealed Carry Association.\n\nBut the 61-year-old building contractor was incensed to learn from ProPublica that his name, age, New Hampshire address, phone number and registered voting status were in a database compiled by the gun industry's chief lobbying group to help friendly politicians win elections.\n\nDouglas said he never gave anyone permission to use his personal information for political purposes. He considers his privacy rights sacrosanct, like those bestowed by the Second Amendment. \"I like the idea that they're pro-gun advocates,\" he said of the gun industry. \"I don't like the idea that they're getting information, possibly illegally, to forward their agenda.\"\n\nDouglas is one of millions of people whose sensitive personal information was compiled over two decades by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, working with some of America's most iconic gun-makers and retailers. As ProPublica previously reported, the industry group assembled data on this collection of gun owners and others without their knowledge or consent to persuade them to vote in the industry's interests. The NSSF credited the campaign with landmark victories that vanquished gun control efforts.\n\nWhat happened to Douglas' data in the past decade has never before been revealed. It involves a transatlantic transfer to a now-disgraced political firm, questions of illegality and concerns from insiders about the repercussions should authorities discover the secret data sharing. This story, built on interviews and a new cache of internal documents obtained by ProPublica, details for the first time the sophisticated and invasive nature of the gun industry's electioneering.\n\nThe NSSF , based in Shelton, Connecticut, represents thousands of firearms and ammunition manufacturers, distributors and retailers, along with publishers and shooting ranges. While not as well known as the NRA, the trade group is considered the voice of the industry and is a power broker in business and politics.\n\nIn 2016, as part of a push to get Donald Trump elected president for the first time and to help Republicans keep the Senate, the NSSF worked with the consultancy Cambridge Analytica to turbocharge the information it had on potential voters. The U.S. subsidiary of a London-based firm, which would later go out of business amid a global scandal over its handling of confidential consumer data, Cambridge matched up the people in the database with 5,000 additional facts about them that it drew from other sources.\n\nThe details were far-ranging and intimate. Along with the potential voters' income, debts and religious affiliation, analysts learned whether they liked the work of the painter Thomas Kinkade and whether the underwear women had purchased was plus size or petite.\n\nCambridge analysts ran the enhanced data through an algorithm to create psychological profiles that allowed for more incisive targeting. Potential voters were assigned one of five personality groups: risk-takers, carers, go-getters, individualists and supporters. Each got a tailored message. Risk-takers were viewed as highly neurotic and susceptible to ads that pricked their fears, Cambridge records show. Go-getters , on the other hand, would respond better to messages of optimism and the promise of a better future.\n\nPrivacy experts told ProPublica that companies that shared information with the NSSF may have violated federal and state prohibitions against deceptive and unfair business practices. Under federal law, companies must comply with their own privacy policies and be clear about how they will use consumers' information, privacy experts said. A ProPublica review of dozens of warranty cards from those gun-makers found that none of them informed buyers that their details would be used for political purposes.\n\n\"There's a pretty clear argument that in some of these cases, there is deception and practices that go against the language in the privacy policy,\" said Calli Schroeder, senior counsel and global privacy specialist at the Electronic Privacy Information Center.\n\nAs it did after the presidential election of George W. Bush, the NSSF credited itself with helping Trump win in 2016, paving the way for a radically different American and global era.\n\nThe NSSF declined to comment for this story. It previously defended its data collection, saying its \"activities are, and always have been, entirely legal and within the terms and conditions of any individual manufacturer, company, data broker, or other entity.\"\n\nProPublica obtained a portion of the NSSF database that contains the names, addresses and other information of thousands of people. The list was created by Cambridge for a voter survey. ProPublica is not making the record public but reached out to 6,000 people on the list.\n\nAlmost all of the 38 people who responded expressed outrage, surprise or disappointment over learning they were in the database.\n\nAlvin Ingram, a retired chemist in Virginia who worked in the aerospace industry and is an avid hunter, described himself as a stickler for \"accuracy and precision,\" especially in legal matters. Ingram was dismayed to learn he was in the NSSF data given to Cambridge. \"I think it's horrible that there is such a thing,\" he said.\n\nJoseph LeForge, a self-described \"privacy nut,\" struggled to understand how it could've happened. The 74-year-old contractor has no Facebook account or email address and spoke to ProPublica on a flip phone. He wondered if he tripped a wire when he bought shotgun shells over a decade ago. \"I don't recall having to give them a driver's license or anything,\" he said, \"but I might have.\"\n\nKathy Gavin, who briefly owned guns in the late 1980s, remembered that a dealer at the time had filled out and mailed a warranty card on her behalf. She shopped at Cabela's, first in person and later online, for equipment for her father, an avid fisherman. ProPublica previously found that the sporting goods store was among those that shared information for the database.\n\nFor years, Gavin received loads of mail during election season, urging her to vote for pro-gun politicians. She threw it away without much thought. But now that she knows about the database, she wants answers from the NSSF: \"Why is my information in there? Why did you need it or want it? Yes, you could use it to pummel me with postcards, but what else are you doing with it?\"\n\nThe 2016 election was a critical crossroads for the gun industry.\n\nDuring Barack Obama's presidency, the industry fought repeated attempts to enact gun control legislation after a series of horrific killings.\n\nIn November 2009, a psychiatrist committed the deadliest mass shooting ever at an American military base, killing 13 people and injuring more than 30 others at Fort Hood in Texas. An attempted assassination of then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in 2011 left six dead and more than a dozen wounded, including the Arizona Democrat.\n\nThe next year, during a midnight screening of \"The Dark Knight Rises,\" a young man killed 12 and wounded 70 at a theatre in Aurora, Colorado. And five months later, less than three miles from the NSSF's Connecticut headquarters at the time, another young man, armed with an assault rifle, slaughtered 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School, including 20 children.\n\nThe Sandy Hook massacre prompted Obama to make gun control a priority. He announced 23 executive actions , but his most ambitious proposals, including an assault weapons ban and universal background checks, failed to win enough support in Congress amid fierce opposition from the NRA and the NSSF.\n\nFor the gun industry, a Democratic majority in the Senate and a Hillary Clinton presidency would have meant more legislative battles and a possible return to gun restrictions and loss of profits. Patrick O'Malley, the man who had been running the NSSF's largely successful electioneering effort for more than a decade, realized it needed to modernize , according to Cambridge emails.\n\nSo in April 2016, O'Malley, an NSSF contractor and political consultant, hired Cambridge Analytica. The written agreement called for Cambridge to mobilize supporters of the Second Amendment in the battleground states of Florida, North Carolina, Virginia, Missouri, Colorado, Nevada, Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire.\n\nThe aim, according to staffers on the project, was to help the GOP win the presidency and retain control of the Senate.\n\nSince 2002, the NSSF had paid O'Malley millions to help oversee its voter outreach campaign, called GunVote, internal records show.\n\nFor the effort, the trade group had created a huge database of potential supporters. From the late 1990s on, at least 10 gun industry businesses, including Glock, Smith & Wesson, Olin Winchester and Mossberg, had handed over names, addresses and other private data on their customers, NSSF records show. (Most of the companies named in the NSSF documents declined to comment or did not respond to ProPublica. One denied sharing customer data, and the new parent company of another said it had no evidence of data sharing with the NSSF under prior ownership.)\n\nBy 2002, the database - filled with warranty card information and supplemented with names from voter rolls and hunting licenses - contained at least 5.5 million people.\n\nIn an interview with ProPublica, Larry Keane, senior vice president of the NSSF since 2000, downplayed the significance of the database and said the trade group's 2016 campaign involved only commercially available data, not information from gun-makers' warranty cards.\n\nBut an internal Cambridge email from before the work began said O'Malley had been \"leveraging a database of firearms manufacturing warranty cards\" over the years for the NSSF and that Cambridge would receive the trade group's data. O'Malley signed the contract and Cambridge received the data in April 2016, records show.\n\nA report by Cambridge said the files included 20 years of information about gun buyers harvested from manufacturer warranty cards along with a database of customers from Cabela's, the outdoor and sporting goods store.\n\nFor the 2016 campaign, records show, the NSSF attempted to acquire even more personal details about gun owners beyond the warranty card information obtained from gun-makers.\n\nKeane and O'Malley launched talks with Gunbroker.com, the largest online firearms auction site in the U.S., and Bass Pro Shops, one of the nation's largest sporting goods retailers.\n\nDuring a June 13 conference call, O'Malley, Keane and Steve Urvan, Gunbroker.com's founder and then-CEO, hashed out the details of a possible data transfer.\n\n\"At a minimum,\" O'Malley wrote in an email to Urvan later that day, \"we're keenly interested in the buy/sell records of your users, specifically rifle, shotgun or handgun and sale/purchase frequency.\"\n\nThe next day, Urvan said he could provide data on about 1.1 million registered users of the website in the states Cambridge planned to target.\n\nHe also sent a link to the company's privacy policy, which said: \"We hire contractors to provide certain services on our behalf, including trend and statistical analysis, marketing campaigns, information processing and storage, and development of new products and services.\"\n\nThe policy did not mention using customer information for political purposes.\n\n\"This project,\" Urvan wrote , \"would fall under trend and statistical analysis.\"\n\nHe asked that Cambridge certify that it would destroy the records once the analysis was done.\n\n\"In an era where a large part of the population posts every tidbit of personal info about themselves online for anyone to see, the [Federal Trade Commission] has backed down from privacy substantially,\" Urvan said in an email sent on June 15. \"Still I don't want the FTC or some state agency to come knocking on our door saying we violated the privacy of our users.\"\n\nCambridge pushed back, saying destroying the records after conducting its analysis would be like \"an engineer shredding his blueprints after handing over designs to the client: counterintuitive, counterproductive and detrimental to the knowledge accumulation process.\"\n\nUrvan refused to back down, and the talks fizzled.\n\n\"Much of this data is HIGHLY sensitive,\" Urvan said . \"If you have it, it can be leaked, subpoenaed, or misused, and under any of those cases the data would point back to our company. Those are substantial business risks we are not willing to take.\"\n\nO'Malley and Urvan did not respond to requests for comment. During an interview in September, Keane said he didn't remember discussions with Gunbroker.com and Cambridge about turning over customer information. He said Gunbroker.com worked with the NSSF to send election-related messages to customers but that the company didn't provide names and addresses to his organization.\n\nUnlike in Great Britain, France, Italy and other major democracies, the U.S. has no federal or state laws that require companies to notify consumers and gain clear, specific informed consent before their data is shared, privacy experts said. And since 1995, the European Union and its member countries have allowed individuals to object to using their information for direct marketing purposes. Only a handful of states, such as California, have in recent years adopted privacy laws that give consumers the ability to opt out of their information being shared.\n\nDespite those weaknesses in American privacy protections, several experts who reviewed the emails at ProPublica's request concluded that if the deal had actually been done, Gunbroker.com would have broken its privacy agreement with customers and possibly violated federal and state laws. Under the Federal Trade Commission Act's prohibition against deceptive or unfair business practices, companies must follow their privacy policies and be clear with consumers about how their information will be used. Many states have adopted similar legal requirements.\n\nMatt Schwartz, privacy analyst at Consumer Reports, said the NSSF and Cambridge would have had to provide \"trend and statistical analysis\" directly to Gunbroker.com, rather than using it for their own political purposes, for the information exchange to comply with the company's policy.\n\n\"It seems like a stretch,\" Schwartz said.\n\nJon Leibowitz, who was appointed to the Federal Trade Commission by George W. Bush and served as chair under Obama, said even if Gunbroker.com's CEO truly believed Cambridge and the NSSF would do a trend or statistical analysis, it would not justify giving customer information to Cambridge.\n\n\"Here, consumers believed their data would be used for commercial purposes and for high level trends, not for political purposes of convincing individual voters,\" Leibowitz said, adding that the deal would have involved \"an element of either deception or unfairness by Gunbroker.\"\n\nLike Gunbroker.com, Bass Pro Shops demanded secrecy and the destruction of its data, but it also had other conditions.\n\nInstead of sending its customer databases directly to Cambridge, Bass Pro wanted to direct the files to the credit reporting company Experian - and for Cambridge to work through Experian to retrieve the information about its customers, emails show .\n\nCambridge's decision to do the data analysis in London also meant Bass Pro attorneys would have to \"verify we have appropriate rights\" from customers before the retailer could send the dataset overseas. They were concerned that they might otherwise run afoul of the United Kingdom's tougher privacy laws.\n\n\"To avoid this, is there a U.S.-based alternative?\" emailed Marsha Green , paralegal to Larry Wilcher, Bass Pro's vice president and general counsel at the time.\n\nThe final sticking point was Bass Pro's demand that Cambridge purchase insurance to protect the transfer, which Bass Pro insisted was standard for all its data recipients.\n\nCambridge decided the cost was too onerous and quit the pursuit.\n\nIn response to questions from ProPublica, Bass Pro's general counsel, Colby Irving, stressed that \"safeguarding our customers' privacy is something we take very seriously.\" Irving provided a 2016 email from Bass Pro's legal office that emphasized any agreement with Cambridge had to be \"consistent with our privacy policy,\" and he said none of the Bass Pro employees in the emails obtained by ProPublica had the authority to finalize a deal with Cambridge. Irving said Bass Pro, which acquired Cabela's in 2017, had been unable to find evidence of Cabela's \"sharing customer information that was not compliant with their privacy policies at or prior to the time of acquisition.\"\n\nThe Cambridge alchemy had three phases.\n\nFirst, the company compared the NSSF and Cabela's data with information about consumer purchases, supplied by data broker companies L2 and Infogroup. That produced more than 1.3 million matches.\n\nIncluded were details about whether people donated to children's causes and international aid, had retail store cards, owned antiques or were interested in wine, smoking, audiobooks, board games, camping, scuba diving or cars and auto parts.\n\nNext, analysts used an algorithm to score each person's behavioral traits based on their habits and shopping history. From those scores, Cambridge placed each of the potential voters into one of the five personality groups.\n\nThe third phase involved reaching out to potential voters. Lists and maps were generated and given to NSSF contractors responsible for mailings. Cambridge also found the targeted people on Facebook.\n\nA sample of the NSSF database, containing more than 6,300 people in the 10 battleground states, was given to the Tarrance Group, a Republican research firm, for the first of many polls, conducted over the phone.\n\nThe survey included a critical question asking if people would be more likely to vote for a candidate who supported nominating a new Supreme Court justice \"who would uphold our Constitutional gun rights.\" An overwhelming majority, 86%, indicated they would be much more likely to vote for such a candidate.\n\nThe response drove the first set of Facebook ads aimed at voters in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Ohio, New Hampshire and Wisconsin. Each pop-up ad said it came from the NSSF's GunVote page, but they were crafted by Cambridge. The ads used the Supreme Court to promote support for Republican Sens. Richard Burr, Pat Toomey, Roy Blunt, Rob Portman, Kelly Ayotte and Ron Johnson.\n\nThey were sent to potential voters in key states from June 21, 2016, through July 1, 2016, tailored to the leanings of each personality group. The ads highlighted the role that the senators played in blocking the appointment of Merrick Garland, Obama's nominee to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe fear-susceptible risk-takers were targeted with ads that introduced negative scenarios before providing a reassuring and authoritative tone. In Missouri, risk-takers were told, \"Senator Blunt is working hard to keep Obama from turning the Supreme Court into an enemy to your gun rights.\"\n\nThe forward-focused go-getters, however, were shown what appeared to be a father and his son hunting together. In North Carolina, they were told, \"Join us in thanking Senator Burr for opposing Obama's Supreme Court nominee to protect your future and your gun rights.\"\n\nNearly 817,000 people saw the ads, according to Cambridge's internal metric reports. For the next three months, Cambridge blasted other ads and videos across social media. All together, they garnered nearly 378 million views and drove more than 60 million visitors to the NSSF's website.\n\nThe evening of Nov. 8, 2016, was triumphant for the NSSF.\n\nRepublicans maintained control of the Senate, which guaranteed continued protection from gun proposals opposed by the industry. Surveys indicate 62% of gun owners voted for Trump over Clinton.\n\nPolitical observers widely credited Cambridge Analytica's data work on behalf of the Trump campaign for the historic victory, but the firm's work for the NSSF to reach gun owners and others sympathetic to the Second Amendment wasn't publicly known.\n\nIn a report titled \"Make America 2nd Amendmentable Again,\" Cambridge concluded that its campaign for the NSSF had encouraged nearly 10,000 more voters to turn out in Missouri, 7,744 more voters in Ohio, 6,979 more in North Carolina and 4,743 more in Pennsylvania. The numbers weren't pivotal, but they contributed to victory for the NSSF's preferred senatorial candidates in all those states. The back page of the report featured the cartoon character Yosemite Sam holding a six-shooter in each hand.\n\nAt 9:17 the morning after the election, Keane, the NSSF vice president, fired off an email of praise to Cambridge's project managers.\n\n\"Thank you for all your hard work on an incredibly successful #GUNVOTE campaign. NSSF and our 13,000 members are grateful to you all for your efforts,\" Keane wrote.\n\nThroughout the organization, there was a collective sense of relief.\n\n\"After a long eight years of President Obama,\" an NSSF report reviewing 2016 said, \"the firearms industry can finally operate without daily attacks from the Oval Office thanks to the election of Donald J. Trump.\n\n\"Furthermore, thanks in part to our efforts, there is a pro-gun majority in the U.S. House and Senate.\"\n\nJanet Eastham of The Telegraph contributed research."

The 2022 regulation was focused on those sold online in kits with everything needed to build a functioning firearm - sometimes in less than 30 minutes, according to court documents.\n\nThe kits, long popular with hobbyists, were considered gun parts rather than firearms under federal law, so buying one didn't require the kind of background checks and age verification that licensed gun stores run.\n\nThat also made the products popular, authorities say, with people who couldn't legally buy a gun, including those who were under 21 or couldn't pass a background check. Without a serial number, ghost guns found at crime scenes are also nearly impossible to trace.\n\nThe kits can still be sold, but after new regulations and a series of local lawsuits against manufacturers, police have seen the number of recovered ghost guns decline in cities like New York, Los Angeles and Philadelphia, according to court documents.\n\n\"We've seen them drop pretty significantly off the radar, I think, because of that regulation,\" said Adam Garber, executive director of the gun violence prevention group CeaseFirePA, based in Philadelphia, where a mass shooting carried out with an AR-15-style ghost gun left five people dead.\n\nIn Baltimore, a city long plagued by gun violence, ghost gun recoveries have dropped last year for the first time since 2019, according to court documents.\n\n\"The biggest problem is, people who aren't able to purchase a gun, whether prohibited adults or under 21, were able to purchase these guns through the mail and the internet,\" said police Commissioner Richard Worley. \"Bottom line, we want less violence. We just have to limit that as best we can by the process of getting illegal guns off the street.\"\n\nBut industry and gun rights groups say the ATF overreached by targeting a product that had long been legal. More than two dozen Republican-leaning states backed those arguments in documents filed before the Supreme Court.\n\n\"No matter how wise ATF's final rule or how 'weighty' petitioners' policy concerns may be, the final rule exceeds ATF's statutory authority. And that should be the end of the matter,\" the states said in the brief authored by the West Virginia Attorney General's Office.\n\nThere are many ways people can get guns, and the best way to address violence is enforcing the laws already on the books, said Lawrence Keane, the senior vice president and general counsel at the National Shooting Sports Foundation, an industry group. \"Nobody wants to see any product used to harm another person, whether it's a firearm, a bat or a car. But those are criminal justice issues. Congress would need to take action,\" he said.\n\nThe Supreme Court, by a 5-4 vote , previously intervened to keep the regulation in effect during the legal fight. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined with the court's three liberals to form a majority, but four conservative justices would have kept the regulation on hold while the case played out.\n\nThe justices expanded gun rights in 2022 with a landmark opinion that found the nation's historical traditions, rather than modern public safety concerns, determine which gun laws can stay on the books.\n\nThe ghost gun case, though, isn't directly about the Second Amendment.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court on Friday struck down a Trump-era ban on bump stocks , the rapid-fire gun accessories used in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, in a ruling that threw firearms back into the nation's political spotlight.\n\nThe high court's conservative majority found that the Trump administration overstepped when it changed course from predecessors and banned bump stocks, which allow a rate of fire comparable to machine guns. The decision came after a gunman in Las Vegas attacked a country music festival with semiautomatic rifles equipped with the accessories.\n\nThe gunman fired more than 1,000 rounds into the crowd in 11 minutes, sending thousands of people fleeing in terror as hundreds were wounded and dozens killed.\n\nThe ruling thrust guns back into the center of the political conversation with an unusual twist as Democrats decried the reversal of a GOP administration's action and many Republicans backed the ruling.\n\nThe 6-3 majority opinion written by Justice Clarence Thomas found the Justice Department was wrong to declare that bump stocks transformed semiautomatic rifles into illegal machine guns because, he wrote, each trigger depression in rapid succession still only releases one shot.\n\n(AP Graphic)\n\nThe ruling reinforced the limits of executive reach and two justices - conservative Samuel Alito and liberal Sonia Sotomayor - separately highlighted how action in Congress could potentially provide a more lasting policy, if there was political will to act in a bipartisan fashion.\n\nOriginally, imposing a ban through regulation rather than legislation during Donald Trump's presidency took pressure off Republicans to act following the massacre and another mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida . Prospects for passing gun restrictions in the current divided Congress are dim.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, who supports gun restrictions, called on Congress to reinstate the ban imposed under his political foe. Trump's campaign team meanwhile, expressed respect for the ruling before quickly pivoting to his endorsement by the National Rifle Association.\n\nAs Trump courts gun owners while running to retake the presidency, he has appeared to play down his own administration's actions on bump stocks, telling NRA members in February that \"nothing happened\" on guns during his presidency despite \"great pressure.\" He told the group that if he is elected again, \"No one will lay a finger on your firearms.\"\n\nThe 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas was carried out by a high-stakes gambler who killed himself, leaving his exact motive a mystery. A total of 60 people were killed in the shooting, including Christiana Duarte, whose family called Friday's ruling tragic.\n\n\"The ruling is really just another way of inviting people to have another mass shooting,\" said Danette Meyers, a family friend and spokesperson. \"It's unfortunate that they have to relive this again. They're really unhappy.\"\n\nRepublican Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, the former county sheriff in Las Vegas who has refused to sign multiple gun control measures the Democrat-controlled Legislature has sent to his desk, said in a statement Friday, \"While I have always been a supporter of the Second Amendment, I have been a vocal opponent of bump stocks since my time in law enforcement, and I'm disappointed by the Supreme Court's decision today.\"\n\nThe opinion comes after the same Supreme Court conservative supermajority handed down a landmark decision expanding gun rights in 2022. The high court is also expected to rule in another gun case in the coming weeks, challenging a federal law intended to keep guns away from people under domestic violence restraining orders .\n\nThe arguments in the bump stock case, though, were less about Second Amendment rights and more about whether the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, a Justice Department agency, had overstepped its authority.\n\nBump stocks are accessories that replace a rifle's stock, the part that rests against the shoulder. Invented in the 2000s, they harness the gun's recoil energy so that the trigger bumps against the shooter's stationary finger, allowing the gun to fire at a similar speed as an automatic weapon.\n\nThe Supreme Court majority found that the 1934 law against machine guns defined them as weapons that could automatically fire more than one shot by a single function of the trigger. Bump stocks don't fit that definition because \"the trigger must still be released and reengaged to fire each additional shot,\" Thomas wrote. He also pointed to over a decade of ATF's findings that claimed bump stocks weren't automatic weapons.\n\nThe plaintiff, Texas gun shop owner and military veteran Michael Cargill, applauded the ruling in a video posted online, predicting the case would have ripple effects by hampering other ATF gun restrictions. \"I'm glad I stood up and fought,\" he said.\n\nThe Supreme Court building is seen on Thursday, June 13, 2024, in Washington. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)\n\nIn a dissent joined by her liberal colleagues, Justice Sotomayor said that bump stocks fit under the ordinary meaning of the law: \"When I see a bird that walks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck,\" she wrote. The ruling, she said, could hamstring the ATF and have \"deadly consequences.\"\n\nATF Director Steve Dettelbach echoed the sentiment, saying that bump stocks \"pose an unacceptable level of risk to public safety.\"\n\nThe high court took up the case after a split among lower courts. Under Republican President George W. Bush and Democrat Barack Obama, the ATF decided that bump stocks didn't transform semiautomatic weapons into machine guns. The agency reversed those decisions at Trump's urging . That was after the Las Vegas massacre and the Parkland, Florida, shooting that left 17 dead.\n\nSixteen states and the District of Columbia have their own bans on bump stocks that aren't expected to be affected by the ruling, though four state bans may no longer cover bump stocks in the wake of the ruling, according to the gun-control group Everytown.\n\nCargill was represented by the New Civil Liberties Alliance, a group funded by conservative donors like the Koch network. His attorneys acknowledged that bump stocks allow for rapid fire but argued that they are different because the shooter has to put in more effort to keep the gun firing.\n\nThe Biden administration had argued that effort was minimal, and said the ATF came to the right conclusion on bump stocks after doing a more in-depth examination spurred by the Las Vegas shooting.\n\nThere were about 520,000 bump stocks in circulation when the ban went into effect in 2019, requiring people to either surrender or destroy them at a combined estimated loss of $100 million, the plaintiffs said in court documents.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Mark Sherman and Lisa Mascaro in Washington, Jill Colvin in New York, Mike Catalini in Trenton, New Jersey, Jim Salter in St. Louis, Scott Sonner in Reno, Nevada, and Jim Vertuno in Austin, Texas, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been updated to correct a reference assault rifle rather than semiautomatic rifle.\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court .\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Eleven-year-old Domonic Davis was not far from his mom's Cincinnati home when a hail of gunfire sprayed out from a passing car. Nearly two dozen rounds hurtled through the night at a group of children in the blink of an eye.\n\nFour other children and a woman were hurt in the November shooting that killed Domonic, who had just made his school basketball team.\n\n\"What happened? How does this happen to an 11-year-old? He was only a few doors down,\" his father, Issac Davis , said.\n\nThe shooting remains under investigation. But federal investigators believe the 22 shots could be fired off with lightning speed because the weapon had been illegally converted to fire like a machine gun.\n\nCommunities around the U.S. have seen shootings carried out with weapons converted to fully automatic in recent years, fueled by a staggering increase in small pieces of metal or plastic made with a 3D printer or ordered online. Laws against machine guns date back to the bloody violence of Prohibition-era gangsters. But the proliferation of devices known by nicknames such as Glock switches, auto sears and chips has allowed people to transform legal semi-automatic weapons into even more dangerous guns, helping fuel gun violence, police and federal authorities said.\n\n\"Police officers are facing down fully automatic weapon fire in amounts that haven't existed in this country since the days of Al Capone and the Tommy gun,\" said Steve Dettelbach, director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF. \"It's a huge problem.\"\n\nThe agency reported a 570% increase in the number of conversion devices collected by police departments between 2017 and 2021, the most recent data available.\n\nGuns with conversion devices have been used in several mass shootings, including one that left four dead at a Sweet Sixteen party in Alabama last year and another that left six people dead at a bar district in Sacramento, California , in 2022. In Houston, police officer William Jeffrey died in 2021 after being shot with a converted gun while serving a warrant. In cities such as Indianapolis, police have seized them every week.\n\nA row of AR-15 style rifles is displayed for a photograph, one with a conversion device installed making it fully automatic, and one a fully automatic M-16 machine gun, at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), National Services Center, Thursday, March 2, 2023, in Martinsburg, W.Va. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nThe devices that can convert legal semi-automatic weapons can be made on a 3D printer in about 35 minutes or ordered from overseas online for less than $30. They're also quick to install.\n\nOnce in place, they modify the gun's machinery. Instead of firing one round each time the shooter squeezes the trigger, a semi-automatic weapon with a conversion device starts firing as soon as the trigger goes down and doesn't stop until the shooter lets go or the weapon runs out of ammunition.\n\n\"You're seeing them a lot in stunning numbers, particularly in street violence,\" said David Pucino, deputy chief counsel at Giffords Law Center.\n\nIn a demonstration by ATF agents, the firing of a semi-automatic outfitted with a conversion device was nearly indistinguishable from an automatic weapon. Conversion devices with differing designs can fit a range of different guns, enabling guns to fire at a rate of 800 or more bullets per minute, according to the ATF.\n\n\"It takes two or three seconds to put in some of these devices into a firearm to make that firearm into a machine gun instantly,\" Dettelbach said.\n\nBetween 2012 and 2016, police departments in the U.S. found 814 conversion devices and sent them to the ATF. That number grew to more than 5,400 between 2017 and 2021, according to the agency's most recent data.\n\nThey took hold in Minneapolis in 2021, and helped fuel record-breaking gun violence that year, said police Chief Brian O'Hara. Along with spraying out bullets at a dizzying speed, switches make a gun much more difficult for the shooter to control, so more people can be hit by accident.\n\n\"The thing is shaking as it's firing, so we wind up getting multiple victims, people hit in extremities during the same shooting incident, because the person cannot control the weapon,\" O'Hara said.\n\nA conversion device that can make a semi-automatic pistol fully automatic, is displayed for a photograph at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), National Services Center, Thursday, March 2, 2023, in Martinsburg, W.Va. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nThe city has seen a decline in their use since the September 2022 arrest of a man charged with selling switches that he had ordered from Russia and Taiwan or made himself, O'Hara said. But \"it's still a very, very real problem,\" he said. \"This is having a really deep impact on families, on neighborhoods and communities.\"\n\nWhile the devices are considered illegal machine guns under federal law, many states don't have their own specific laws against them. In Indiana, police were finding them so often - multiple times a week in the state's capital - that the state changed the law to ensure it included switches.\n\n\"We have to update the laws regarding machine guns to deal with the problems of today,\" Indianapolis police Chief Chris Bailey said.\n\nOnly 15 states have their own laws against the possession, sale or manufacture of automatic-fire weapons, according to Giffords. Indiana was one of many states that have regulations with exceptions. Five states have no state-level machine-gun regulations at all.\n\nA semi-automatic pistol with a conversion device installed making it fully automatic is fired as four empty shell casings fly out of the weapon, at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), National Services Center, Thursday, March 2, 2023, in Martinsburg, W.Va. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nBut long before any prosecution, police have to find the conversion devices. Often about the size of a quarter, they can easily go unnoticed by the untrained eye after being installed, said Dettelbach.\n\nHe recalled visiting a Texas police department after the ATF hosted a training on conversion devices. Afterwards, the chief searched the weapons in the evidence room and found several with previously undetected conversion devices.\n\n\"These items don't always look as dangerous as they are,\" he said. \"If you see some of them, they're pieces of plastic and metal, and sometimes it's even hard to recognize them when they're actually on or in the firearm because they blend in.\"\n\nThey're also increasingly a fixture online, in social media and rap lyrics, Davis said. \"Everyone is talking about switches,\" he said. \"It's a scary trend.\"\n\nA handful of fully automatic conversion devices is displayed for a photograph, above semi-automatic pistols, some with conversion devices installed making them fully automatic, at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), National Services Center, Thursday, March 2, 2023, in Martinsburg, W.Va. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nDavis struggles to talk about the loss of his son. Domonic would often come with his dad on Fridays to get a haircut at the barber shop where Issac Davis works. The shooting also fell on a Friday, making the end of the week an especially tough time.\n\nDavis hopes to start a foundation called For Every Eleven to fight gun violence and honor his son's memory.\n\n\"I still want to keep his name going,\" he said. \"He deserved to be still relevant. So I have to keep going. No matter how much grief I grieve him in private.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court seemed likely Tuesday to uphold a Biden administration regulation on ghost guns, the difficult-to-trace weapons found in increasing numbers at crime scenes.\n\nIn arguments that ranged from classic cars to Western omelets, key conservative justices seemed open to the government's argument that kits allowing people to make nearly untraceable guns at home can be regulated like other firearms.\n\nTwo conservative justices, Chief John Roberts and Amy Coney Barrett, previously joined with the three liberals to allow the rule to go into effect and seemed skeptical of the arguments that the Biden administration overstepped by trying to regulate gun parts rather than finished weapons.\n\nMany of the justices' questions focused on whether the kits were close enough to functioning weapons to be regulated as guns.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito compared the components to food, suggesting eggs, peppers and ham aren't necessarily a Western omelet so shouldn't be treated like one.\n\nBarrett, though, proposed gun kits are more like meal kits ordered online that contain everything needed to make a specific dinner, like turkey chili.\n\nRoberts, for his part, seemed skeptical of the challengers' position that the kits are mostly popular with hobbyists who enjoy making their own weapons, like auto enthusiasts might rebuild a car on the weekend.\n\nMany ghost gun kits require only the drilling of a few holes and removal of plastic tabs.\n\n\"My understanding is that it's not terribly difficult for someone to do this,\" he said. \"Drilling a hole or two, I would think, doesn't give the same sort of reward that you get from working on your car on the weekend.\"\n\nA ruling is expected in the coming months.\n\nWhile guns are at the center of the case, Garland v. VanDerStok, the legal issues are about the power of federal agencies rather than Second Amendment rights. The case comes after the high court struck down another firearm regulation, a Trump-era ban on gun accessories known as bump stocks that enable rapid fire. In that case, the court found that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives wrongly categorized the accessories as machine guns.\n\nThe ghost gun regulation came after their numbers around the country soared , going from fewer than 4,000 recovered by law enforcement in 2018 to nearly 20,000 in 2021, according to Justice Department data. The number of ghost guns has since flattened out or declined in several major cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Baltimore, according to court documents.\n\nFinalized at the direction of President Joe Biden, the rule requires companies to treat the kits like other firearms by adding serial numbers, running background checks and verifying that buyers are 21 or older.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear a challenge today on a Biden administration regulation on ghost guns. AP correspondent Donna Warder reports.\n\nChallengers to the rule argue that most people who commit crimes use traditional guns and that the kits can be hard to assemble.\n\n\"Congress, in the Gun Control Act, did not seek to pursue its purposes of controlling access to firearms to the nth degree,\" said attorney Peter Patterson, representing manufacturers, gun rights groups and people who own firearms parts.\n\nU.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor in Texas agreed with the challengers and struck down the rule in 2023. The U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals largely upheld his decision. The administration appealed to the Supreme Court, which allowed the rule to go into effect while the litigation played out.\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh said he was concerned that businesses might accidently run afoul of the regulation. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar responded that the regulation is not aimed at unwitting sellers, an answer Kavanaugh called helpful.\n\nPrelogar argued that regulation of weapons that can be \"readily converted\" to shoot is well within ATF's authority, and law-abiding hobbyists can still buy the kits with the regulation place.\n\n\"Our nation has seen an explosion in crimes committed with ghost guns,\" she said. \"The evidence shows that these guns were being purchased and used in crime.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Andy Manis)\n\nMILWAUKEE (AP) - People will be allowed to carry guns within blocks of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee next month and protesters will be given two outdoor stages, one within sight of the convention arena, under a security plan law enforcement authorities released Friday.\n\nDemonstrators pushed back, arguing that the plan's protest zones are so far from the Fiserv Forum that they won't be seen or heard.\n\nThe plan calls for two perimeters that extend for blocks around the arena. Vehicles will have to pass through checkpoints to travel between the two boundaries. Pedestrians will be allowed to move freely without being screened in that area but only convention goers will be allowed within the inner perimeter.\n\nNo weapons of any kind will be allowed within the inner perimeter but people will be able to carry guns openly or concealed elsewhere as allowed under state law. Wisconsin statutes outlaw only machine guns, short-barreled shotguns and silencers.\n\n\"It's about behaviors,\" Milwaukee Police Chief Jeffrey Norman said. \"So, understand that there is going to be that level of surveillance and monitoring that that's the particular right that you like to express.

Organizers say extra police will be on hand Sunday, along with many other precautions.

(AP Photo/Steve Karnowski)\n\nST. LOUIS (AP) - It's a scenario that plays out over and over again at American crime scenes: The investigation reveals that the shooter didn't get his firearm legally from a store or gun show, but instead obtained it from someone who did.\n\nIt's known as a straw purchase. A federal law signed in 2022 takes aim at the practice, and federal investigators have made it a priority to combat it. Those caught can face lengthy prison sentences. But despite that, evidence suggests straw purchases are becoming even more problematic.\n\nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives defines a straw purchase as buying a firearm for someone who is prohibited by law from possessing one, or for someone who doesn't want their name associated with it. Weapons bought through straw purchases sometimes end up in the hands of convicted felons, or minors.\n\nA federal report released in February 2023 showed that 54% of guns that police recovered at crime scenes in 2021 had been purchased within three years, a double-digit increase since 2019. The quicker turnaround can indicate illegal gun trafficking or a straw purchase. The increase was driven largely by guns bought less than a year before, the report stated.\n\nIn 2022, President Joe Biden signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, a measure spurred in part by mass shootings including the massacre of 19 students and two teachers at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas.\n\nThe law made it a federal crime to traffic in firearms. It also created stronger penalties for straw purchases - up to a 25-year prison sentence if the weapon is used in an act of terrorism, or while drug trafficking.\n\nMeanwhile, the Department of Justice said it is has invested resources to investigate and prosecute violations involving firearms trafficking and straw purchases. The agency's website says it has charged more than 60 people for violations since the law was passed and seized hundreds of firearms in connection with those cases.\n\nStraw purchases were at the center of two cases announced this week.\n\nThree men in Kansas City, Missouri, were charged with federal counts related to the illegal purchase of high-powered rifles and guns with extended magazines. Two of the guns were connected to last month's shooting at the Kansas City Chiefs' Super Bowl parade and rallly , authorities said Wednesday.\n\nThe complaints do not allege that the men were among the shooters. Instead, they are accused of involvement in straw purchases and trafficking firearms, including guns used in the Feb. 14 shooting at the Chiefs' rally that killed a woman and wounded nearly two dozen others, including children.\n\nOne weapon recovered at the scene was a loaded Anderson Manufacturing AM-15 .223-caliber pistol. According to an affadavit, one of the suspects bought the AM-15 from a gun store and illegally trafficked many others.\n\nAlso recovered at the scene was a Stag Arms .300-caliber pistol that the complaint said was purchased by another suspect at a gun show in November. Prosecutors said that man gave the gun to the third suspect, who was too young to legally purchase one himself.\n\n\"Stopping straw buyers and preventing illegal firearms trafficking is our first line of defense against gun violence,\" U.S. Attorney Teresa Moore said in announcing the charges.\n\nOn Thursday, authorities in Minnesota announced charges against a woman accused of buying guns used in the killings of three first responders last month at a home in the Minneapolis suburb of Burnsville.\n\nThe woman conspired with the shooter, Shannon Gooden, to illegally get him guns, U.S. Attorney Andrew M. Luger alleged at a news conference. Officers Paul Elmstrand and Matthew Ruge, both 27, and firefighter-paramedic Adam Finseth, 40, were slain during a standoff. Gooden then killed himself.\n\nDakota County Attorney Kathryn Keena called the woman \"the reason he had an arsenal of firearms in his possession that ultimately resulted in the murder of three of Dakota County's finest.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "The Ineluctable Logic of Gun Ownership\n\nI wish no one were armed. But if practically everyone is, how do we ensure our own safety?\n\nW hen we were in our 20s, my friend Jim Ferguson would say that if you find yourself living someplace where you need to own a gun, you should move. That made sense to me then; it's not so easy now to find safe places. If you live in a remote area, it can take the sheriff an hour or more to get to you, so if there's a deadly threat from an intruder, you are on your own. And the past few years-indeed, the past few weeks-have shown us that gun violence knows no boundaries of geography, socioeconomic status, or age. Wherever you are, violence can find you. This reality has pushed me toward a moral dilemma: I wish no one were armed, but because practically everyone else is, I have a gun myself.\n\nThe problem with having a gun is that you can be tempted to use it. Guns also make committing acts of violence seem easier and less personal; if you're not looking someone in the eye, it may not seem as real when you pull the trigger. To control that risk requires mental and emotional preparation, as well as rigorous training. As a reluctant gun owner, I continue to be baffled by the lack of regulation on gun ownership. Shouldn't it be at least as difficult to get a gun license as a driver's license-or better still, as difficult as it is to get a private pilot's license? Gun owners should have to prove their competency and their ability to exercise good judgment, just as other licenses require. Responsible gun owners will consider every other alternative before pulling out a gun, even in states such as California that have a \"castle doctrine\" that permits, in certain circumstances, a homeowner to use force (including deadly force) in self-defense against an intruder. Gun owners' first thought should always be to avoid confrontations in the first place, and they should have a clear understanding of when using a firearm for self-defense is acceptable.\n\nI realize that the phrase responsible gun owner has become a trope of the gun-rights lobby, but behind the cliché, it can actually mean something. Every two years, I take six hours of firearms training with an off-duty police detective. Most of the day is spent on finding ways to remove myself from a dangerous situation before things escalate. Can I run? Can I hide? Running and hiding are not cowardice; they mean taking the higher moral ground of avoiding confrontation in a situation where the person seemingly threatening you might be drunk, or off their meds, or simply confused about which is their car or the right address.\n\nRyan Busse: The rifle that ruined America\n\nI am not talking about hypotheticals. Look at the string of recent incidents in the news: the 20-year-old woman shot for being in a car that turned into the wrong driveway, the teenage boy shot for ringing the wrong doorbell, the cheerleaders shot for getting in the wrong car in a supermarket parking lot, the 6-year-old girl shot while trying to retrieve a basketball from her neighbor's yard. Do these gun owners feel justified in shooting because an unwanted person came too close, invaded their space? I have been in situations when I felt threatened and pulled out my gun. But that is what the training is for: You should shoot someone only as a last resort , you're taught. You should not shoot just because you feel wronged or scared and can't control your fear or frustration.\n\nM y education as a liberal gun owner began when my 70-year-old mother, living in Bel Air, Los Angeles, felt that she needed to get a pistol. My sister and I were against it, figuring that if she ever tried to use it, the most likely outcome would be that she would shoot my father. Despite our objections, she bought herself a Smith & Wesson .357 Magnum. That same day, my father bought himself a Remington 870 12-gauge shotgun (I assumed to defend himself from intruders, not from my mother).\n\nNeither of my parents ever ended up using their gun, so far as I know, in any real-life situation. But the sort of home invasion they feared happened to my wife, Heather, and me, at our house in Hollywood. After that traumatic experience, we made the wrenching decision to keep a firearm in our home. Heather, a very logical neuroscientist, reluctantly agreed that it was warranted; we came to an understanding about my having the gun by which Heather said, in effect, \"I can accept this; I just don't want to be reminded of it.\" By this time, my mother was 80 and complaining of arthritis, and so I suggested that she let me borrow her Smith & Wesson-just until her arthritis cleared up, we said. It's not the gun I would have bought for myself, but I kept it. I didn't like the idea of selling it in case it wound up in the hands of someone who might use it in a crime (even though California is one of the few states that maintains a central database of firearms transfers); so I preferred to hold on to my mom's pistol and registered it in my name.\n\nTwo years later, another intruder entered our property. As I've previously described , I was sitting at my desk one morning, looking out at the garden, and I saw a man peering into the windows and doors, trying each of them to see if they were unlocked. I called the police and told them what was going on. I didn't know if the man was armed, if he had lock-picking tools, or even if I had remembered to lock all the doors and windows.\n\nFrom the December 2012 issue: The case for more guns (and more gun control)\n\n\"We're too busy to come out now,\" the dispatcher said, \"but call us back if he gets in the house.\" To that, I said: \"I am armed, and I'm worried that if he gets into the house, I may not have the time to call you, and there may be a much bigger mess here for you to clean up.\" She said someone would be there in 20 minutes (an eternity when you're on alert).\n\nI got out my mother's gun, took a deep breath, and started to run through different scenarios. If the intruder was armed, I might have to shoot him. I would have to live knowing that I had killed a man-justifiably, according to the law-but I'd spend the rest of my life wondering if there had been other options. There was a more practical issue: I am a good shot, but I'm no professional-how would I perform in a high-stress situation against someone who may do this for a living?\n\nI snuck out through the garage with the .357 in my waistband and waited on the corner for the police. When the patrol car arrived, I held my hands out in front of me, palms facing them, and told them I was the one who'd called, and that I had a gun in my waistband. \"Thanks for telling us,\" the lead officer said. \"Just don't reach for it.\" They went to the house and found the man still trying to get in; they arrested him without violent incident.\n\nAfterward, the officer suggested that I'd do better protecting our home with a shotgun-you're more likely to hit and stop an assailant, he explained, when you're under pressure. My father had never even taken his Remington out of the case, and he agreed to let me \"borrow\" that too. Heather adapted to having the second gun in the house as long as I took care of it and she didn't have to think about it.\n\nSince then, we have not had another burglary or forced entry. But a couple of harrowing incidents did occur because of a \"destination stalker\" who slept in her car for a month in our neighborhood in hopes of finding me. When she did, she told me that the world was going to end in 2035 because of something involving music and the brain, and that I, as a neuroscientist who had written on that subject, was the only person in the world who could help her warn people. The LAPD got involved. (This being Hollywood, the department has a dedicated stalker unit.)\n\nThe police detective knew from the state registry that I had firearms-and he was glad to hear that I did. When the police are happy you have a gun, you know there is more violent crime than they can handle. (I am keenly aware that if I were a person of color, my conversation with the police could have been very different.)\n\nI hope I never need to use my guns. My wife and I would like to live in a country where everyone feels that way. But how can we hope to remove the guns from American society, the firearms in so many homes like ours? We can't. That is the conundrum we face: The individual's decision to be armed feels rational, maybe is rational, but the societal sum of all those individual decisions is madness. That is the country, the place, we live in now.\n\nI have spent my career studying the way the human brain works and how it can be influenced, including by stress. We know that when individuals are extremely stressed, their decision-making can be impaired, leading to impulsive or irrational behavior. When someone has a firearm, a single moment of impaired judgment can have devastating consequences. Just this week, a driver raced through a stop sign at a crosswalk in my neighborhood at 50 miles per hour, almost knocking me and my dog over. I didn't have my gun, but for a moment I wanted to shoot at his tires.\n\nRead: Keeping guns away from angry people\n\nWanting and doing should be very different things. My firearms instructor repeats the mantra: Never pull out the gun unless you are facing an undeniable threat to human life. Not \"I am feeling uncomfortable,\" or \"This might be threatening,\" but an unambiguously imminent danger. \"Okay,\" he says. \"You shot someone in self-defense. There will almost certainly be a trial, and the judge and jury will be asking themselves, Did he have any other options at all? \" Practicing all this in your head, and feeling it in your heart, are key-so that when the adrenaline kicks in, you can rely on your training.\n\nOne night, when we knew the stalker was still lurking in the neighborhood, we heard a loud, insistent pounding on our front door. I locked the door to our bedroom and called the police. Heather suggested that I try to find a clear path out of the house; meanwhile, she'd stay in the bedroom. I agreed, but I wasn't going to leave her unarmed. I handed her the shotgun. She held it for the first time. One of the things I love about Heather is her unflagging idealism; another thing I love is that when push comes to shove, she is very practical.\n\nThe police came and we didn't have to use our firearms after all. But reality had forced Heather to do something she never imagined she would do and really didn't want to. We at least had the solace of each other's company, straddling the line of this impossible moral quandary of gun ownership."

      "text": "'How Much Blood Is Your Fun Worth?'\n\nI saw the gun-violence epidemic-and my relationship to it as a gun owner-as an abstraction. Then a mass shooting happened in the little city where I work.\n\nDuring my first semester of teaching while in grad school, I made a habit of showing up to my classroom half an hour early. I was green as a sapling and felt wholly unqualified for the task before me, and I had the vague sense that arriving before anyone else and looking prepared was one way to earn the respect of students who were barely younger than I was. The second week of classes, coffee in hand and the day's reading tucked under my arm, I arrived to find an undergrad crouched in front of a half-open window. He was taking a photo with his phone, and when he saw me, he jumped. My presence was unexpected.\n\nThe student, whose name I was struggling to recall, screeched the window shut and turned to face me. His cheeks were flushed red. When I asked if everything was all right, he said he was making sure the windows opened. \"My mom told me to always check to make sure they work, just in case, you know ...\" His voice trailed off and his face turned more crimson still. I must have looked confused because he continued: \"In case some gun nut with an AR-15 tries to shoot up the place. When a new semester starts, my mother makes me send her a photo of the open windows in each of my classrooms.\" I tried to come up with something to say and found I could not. \"She's a little paranoid, I guess,\" he offered. Then another bleary-eyed student shuffled in and the conversation ended.\n\nRyan Busse: The rifle that ruined America\n\nLast night, as I sat on my couch watching CNN anchors discuss a mass shooting that left 18 dead and 13 injured in Lewiston, Maine-the little city where I teach at Bates College and where I lived until recently-I thought about my terrified students who were sheltering in place. About my colleagues who live in town who could have been at the bar or bowling alley where the violence unfolded. About my former neighbors on whose porch my wife and I had spent many evenings drinking wine and talking politics. I thought about the hospital workers who were in the middle of the worst night of their life, and-as the child of a retired police officer-about the sons and daughters and spouses waiting at home while their loved ones ran toward the danger rather than away from it. I thought about all the people waiting for news, or getting news.\n\nAnd for the first time in years, I thought, too, about that student and that window, opened to prove to his worried mother that he had an escape route. His phrase-\"gun nut\"-came to my mind again and again as I exchanged worried, confused, furious messages with co-workers and students. As the night wore on and surreality gave way to cold reality, my grief also slowly gave way to guilt. I felt guilty and complicit and, in some imprecise but unshakable way, culpable for the violence on my television and social-media feeds. I felt, for the first time, like I was part of the reason that mothers have to ask their children for photos of open windows. That I was part of the reason America is a country where college campuses and bars and bowling alleys are all too often shooting galleries. I felt guilty because gun nuts are, whether I like it or not, my people: I grew up in gun country. I spent my teenage years working at a Pennsylvania gun club. I've been a gun owner nearly my entire life.\n\nIn Walker Percy's classic novel The Moviegoer , the titular protagonist observes that mass media can make it feel like the only places that really, truly exist are big cities. When you unexpectedly see your small town on the silver screen, however, you get a fleeting sense that you belong to an important place: Where you call home, he says, has been \"certified.\" \"If he sees a movie which shows his very neighborhood,\" Percy writes of the moviegoer, \"it becomes possible for him to live, for a time at least, as a person who is Somewhere and not Anywhere.\" Last night, a place where I work and have called home was certified in the grimmest possible way. I am embarrassed to say that this is what it took-a place I love to become somewhere that a uniquely American tragedy has taken place-for me to fully understand our country's mass-shooting problem.\n\nThe honest truth is that I have always viewed the gun-violence epidemic-and my relationship to it as a gun owner-as an abstraction, remote from my own life or choices. Like many gun owners, I had always supported stronger gun control. If it requires written and practical exams and dozens of hours of training to earn the right to drive a motor vehicle, I have never understood why the same should not apply to firearms. But my views on gun control have also been wonkish, academic in nature: It is something I care about and have written about but have never felt deeply. That changed yesterday as I found myself racking my brain, wondering if I had ever heard my students or colleagues or friends or neighbors mention Schemengees Bar & Grille. Wondering if someone I knew could have been there. Wondering if I was going to get The Call or The Text or The Email.\n\nZusha Elinson and Cameron McWhirter: The creator of the AR-15 didn't see this coming\n\nToday, as my wife and I stay locked in our home-the gunman, still on the loose, is the subject of a sprawling manhunt-I am filled with nothing so much as rage. Rage at my gun-nut friends from home who will see this tragedy as a reason for less gun control, rather than more of it. Rage at every conservative pundit who has ever uttered the phrase \"good guy with a gun.\" Rage at the state of Maine, which has some of the most lax gun laws in the country. Rage at the politicians here and beyond who have refused to solve a problem for which solutions readily exist. Rage at myself for being so blind.\n\nIf you had asked me before yesterday why I own guns, I would have fed you the same line I had fed my liberal friends and my wife-and, above all, myself-for years. I would have told you that I own guns for hunting, for protection, for blasting clay pigeons out of cloudless October skies. I would have told you that I own guns because I come from a gun family and guns are some of the only things I have left from people I have loved. I would have told you about the rifle that my holler-born, Great Depression-surviving grandmother kept under the bed, the 20-gauge my grandfather used to bring home Thanksgiving turkeys, the 30-06 that took my father's first deer. I would have told you I own guns because I am a hunter and I own guns because I write things that sometimes make people angry.\n\nBut it is only now that gun violence has visited my little corner of the world that I have been forced to confront reality, a truth that has been there all along but that I have refused to admit: I own guns because I like them and because I am an American and I'm allowed to and no one stops me. I own guns because-until this moment-gun violence was something that happened Anywhere else and not Somewhere close to me. I own guns because I have never been forced to question-to really question-why I do or what they're for or what would happen if I had to work a little harder for the right to own them. You might find this confession myopic or selfish, but it's also the truth. And I'm admitting it because I think the root of our country's gun problem is that we refuse-gun owners and gun critics alike-to say this truth out loud.\n\nWe have made the gun debate a conflict over facts and motivations and laws and amendments. Gun-control advocates rightly point out that guns do not in fact make anyone safer. That the majority of mass shootings are not ended by the mythical \"good guy with a gun\" but by law-enforcement or suicide. That buying a gun makes you more likely to die of a gunshot wound, not less. The Second Amendment crowd argues that self-protection is a right, granted by God and the Constitution, and that a degree of risk is the price to pay for living in a free society. I have neither the patience nor the energy to rehash these debates. And I don't think there's any point in arguing about policy right now. There is zero reason to expect that meaningful laws will be passed as a result of the events that transpired in Lewiston.\n\nSo rather than rattle off a list of warmed-over ideas such as \"assault-weapons ban\" or \"mandatory background checks\" or \"red-flag laws\" or \"commonsense gun reform\" that are probably not going to come to fruition tomorrow or the day after or next year or the year after, I'll just resort to being honest. The inescapable fact is that the only people capable of shifting the gun conversation in this country are the people who buy them.\n\nElizabeth Bruenig: Coming undone in the age of mass shootings\n\nI am, like most Americans who own guns, responsible. Yesterday's events haven't made me change my mind about being a gun owner. The reasons that motivated me to own guns in the first place are no different today than yesterday. The shooting in Lewiston changed my mind about being a quiet gun owner. I have spent years of my life making apologies on behalf of my gun-nut acquaintances. Staying silent when friends bring up the National Rifle Association despite my fierce opposition to that organization. Not pushing back when they call minor reforms such as mandatory waiting periods \"totalitarian.\" Changing the subject rather than asking Why do you need a military-style rifle?\n\nAs a gun owner from gun country, I'll let you in on the dirty secret that everyone knows in their heart of hearts: The AR-15 is America's best-selling rifle not because people need them for protection or because our country is full of aspiring militiamen or paranoid whack jobs waiting for civil war. People own AR-15s because they think they're sexy and cool and manly. Because they have barely any recoil and Army surplus ammo is cheap. Because their buddies have them, so why shouldn't they? Because they are toys-the most dangerous toys in America, but toys nonetheless. Mothers must ask their sons for pictures of open windows because Americans own AR-15s, and they own them because they are fun.\n\nAnd if the past 24 hours have convinced me of anything, it is that the only way things are ever going to get better is if more gun owners start asking our friends the one question that matters: How much blood is your fun worth?"

      "text": "How to Persuade Americans to Give Up Their Guns\n\nThe way to reduce gun violence is by convincing ordinary, \"responsible\" handgun owners that their weapons make them, their families, and those around them less safe.\n\nW hen the coronavirus pandemic struck last year, people throughout the developed world raced to buy toilet paper, bottled water, yeast for baking bread, and other basic necessities. Americans also stocked up on guns. They bought more than 23 million firearms in 2020, up 65 percent from 2019 . First-time gun purchases were notably high. The surge has not abated in 2021. In January, Americans bought 4.3 million guns, a monthly record.\n\nLast year was also a high-water mark for gun violence -more people were shot dead than at any time since the 1990s-though 2021 is shaping up to be even worse. There was one bright spot in 2020. When Americans self-isolated, mass shooters were denied their usual targets. But as America began to return to normal, so did the mass shooting s: 45 in the single month between March 16 and April 15.\n\nThe shock and horror of mass shootings focus our attention. But most of the casualties are inflicted one by one by one. Americans use their guns to open fire on one another at backyard barbecues, to stalk and intimidate ex-spouses and lovers, to rob and assault, and to kill themselves. Half of the almost 48,000 suicides committed in 2019 were carried out by gun. All of this slaughter is enabled by the most permissive gun laws in the developed world.\n\nYou know this. You've heard it before. Maybe you have even gotten sick of hearing it. Yet the problem continues to get worse. The Biden administration is developing strategies to try to decrease gun violence-to crack down on rogue gun dealers, to \"keep guns out of the wrong hands.\" That's a worthy project, of course, but it, too, may sound wanly familiar. Over the past decade, many states have relaxed their gun laws, making these weapons even easier to get.\n\nThis fall, the Supreme Court will hear a case, New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Corlett , that could expand gun rights even further. Thirteen years ago, in District of Columbia v. Heller , the Court for the first time recognized people's constitutional right to own firearms as individuals, not just as members of a \"well regulated Militia.\" Now lawyers for the New York affiliate of the National Rifle Association will argue that the Second Amendment should be interpreted as granting a constitutional right to carry firearms in the streets, parks, playgrounds . If the NRA prevails, the nearly 400 million guns in the United States will show up in even more places than they do now.\n\nThe legalistic approach to restricting gun ownership and reducing gun violence is failing. So is the assumption behind it. Drawing a bright line between the supposedly vast majority of \"responsible,\" \"law abiding\" gun owners and those shadowy others who cause all the trouble is a prudent approach for politicians, but it obscures the true nature of the problem. We need to stop deceiving ourselves about the importance of this distinction.\n\nPre-pandemic, about 30 percent of American adults owned a gun, according to a Pew Research Center survey . Another 33 percent rejected the idea of gun ownership. The remainder, about 36 percent, did not happen to own a gun at the time they were asked the question-but had either owned a gun in the past or could imagine owning a gun in the future. In 2020, the future came, and millions of them queued at gun shops, pandemic stimulus dollars in hand.\n\nRead: Americans don't really understand gun violence\n\nThey were not buying weapons for hunting. Only about 11.5 million Americans hunt in a given year, according to the latest Department of the Interior survey, fewer than the number who attend a professional ballet or modern-dance performance.\n\nNor were they buying weapons to play private militia. Fewer than 10 percent of Americans amass arsenals of five weapons or more. And for all the focus on assault rifles, they make up a small portion of the firearms in private hands: approximately 6 percent of all guns owned.\n\nThe weapon Americans most often buy is the modern semiautomatic handgun-affordable, light, and easy to use. This is the weapon people stash in their nightstand and the glove compartment of their car. This is the weapon they tuck into their purse and shove into their waistband. Why? Two-thirds of American gun buyers explain that they bought their gun to protect themselves and their families.\n\nAnd here is both the terrible tragedy of America's gun habit and the best hope to end it. In virtually every way that can be measured, owning a firearm makes the owner, the owner's family, and the people around them less safe. The hard-core gun owner will never accept this truth. But the 36 percent in the middle-they may be open to it, if they can be helped to perceive it.\n\nFrom the January 1993 issue: Erik Larson on the story of a gun\n\nThe weapons Americans buy to protect their loved ones are the weapons that end up being accidentally discharged into a loved one's leg or chest or head. The weapons Americans buy to protect their young children are years later used for self-harm by their troubled teenagers. Or they are stolen from their car by criminals and used in robberies and murders. Or they are grabbed in rage and pointed at an ex-partner.\n\nThe record shows case after case of guns escalating ordinary disputes into homicides or attempted homicides. In March 2020, a man was fatally shot in the head after an altercation over a parking space at an Atlanta shopping mall. In August 2020, a 75-year-old Nashville homeowner reportedly shot and wounded a landscaper for not properly hauling brush from his property. In November 2020, a gun owner shot and killed a teenager for playing music too loudly in the parking lot of the motel they were both staying at, police said.\n\nThese incidents are unusual in only one way: The victims were all men. A frequent use of guns in American life is to dominate and terrorize women. According to a 2017 study, some 4.5 million American women have been threatened by a gun-wielding partner or former partner. Almost 1 million American women have survived after a gun was used by a partner against them.\n\nPut moments of rage or malice aside, and catastrophes still keep happening, due in part to Americans' collective overconfidence in their gun-handling skills.\n\nAltogether, about 500 Americans a year die from unintended shootings. That's four times the rate of deaths from unintended shootings in peer nations. Yet this grim statistic still understates the toll of Americans fooling around with weapons. Unintended shootings tend not to be lethal. They account for only about 1 percent of all U.S. gun deaths. But they account for more than one-third of American gun injuries-injuries that can leave people disabled or traumatized for life. A majority of gun owners fail to store their weapons safely, according to research by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. That's why the annals fill with so many heartrending stories of children shooting themselves or others.\n\nDavid Frum: It's the guns\n\nAbove all else, guns are used for suicide . In any given year, twice as many Americans die by suicide as by homicide. Suicide is the second-leading cause of death among teenagers and young adults, behind only accidents. The good news is that suicide is highly preventable. Most suicide attempts are impulsive, an act of depression or panic. If a person survives an attempt, he or she will almost certainly survive the suicidal impulse altogether. A gun in the house massively raises the likelihood that a suicide attempt will end in death .\n\nGun advocates counter this tally of unnecessary bloodshed by generating piles of studies on successful \"defensive gun use.\" Estimates of defensive gun use vary wildly, from as few as 60,000 incidents a year to as many as 2.5 million. The higher estimates are distorted by a crucial error: They rely heavily on self-reporting by gun owners themselves, with a huge risk of self-flattering bias. If an argument spirals until one person produces a gun and menaces the other into shutting up, the gun owner might regard that use as \"defensive.\" A third party, however, might perceive a situation that only spiraled in the first place because the gun owner felt empowered to escalate it. Whose perception should prevail?\n\nBut there's a larger absurdity to the project of counting \"defensive gun uses.\" For decades, the world has witnessed a colossal natural experiment in gun laws. With one exception, virtually all developed countries strictly regulate firearms, especially handguns. If there were any merit to the \"defensive gun use\" argument, you'd expect that one permissive nation to boast much greater safety. Instead, the one outlier nation-the United States-suffers the deadliest levels of criminal violence. Guns everywhere engender violence everywhere.\n\nIn national debates, America's gun carnage is often blamed on the National Rifle Association. That group is indeed highly blameworthy. But the NRA has been mired in scandal and bankruptcy since 2019 , without any notable alteration in the political balance of power on the gun issue. America has a gun problem because so many Americans are deceived by so many illusions about what a gun will do for them, their family, their world. They imagine a gun as the guardian of their home and loved ones, rather than the standing invitation to harm, loss, and grief it so much more often proves to be.\n\nIt would be good to reverse the permissive trends in gun law. It would be good to ban the preferred weapons of mass shooters. It would be good to have a stronger system of background checks. It would be good to stop so many Americans from carrying guns in public.\n\nBut even if none of those things happens-and there is little sign of them happening anytime soon- progress can be made against gun violence , as progress was once made against other social evils: by persuading Americans to stop, one by one by one.\n\nDrunk driving has been illegal in the United States since automobiles became commonplace. Yet laws against drunk driving went lightly enforced until the 1980s. Police and courts treated drunk drivers leniently. The offenders seemed so remorseful. Had they not suffered enough?\n\nThat practice of leniency began to change in 1980, with the founding of Mothers Against Drunk Driving by one determined woman, Candy Lightner, who had lost her daughter to a repeat hit-and-run driver. From Fair Oaks, California, MADD spread across the nation. Before it pressured politicians to amend laws, before it persuaded courts and police to enforce those laws, it enabled those reforms by working directly on public attitudes. MADD convinced American drivers that they were not weak or unmanly if they surrendered the car keys after drinking too much. MADD empowered the families and friends of those drivers to insist that the keys be surrendered.\n\nThat kind of cultural change beckons now. The mass gun purchases of 2020 and 2021 have put even more millions of weapons into even more hands untrained to use and store those weapons responsibly.\n\nToday, a new generation of determined women are emulating MADD, this time fighting against gun violence. The day after the Sandy Hook gun massacre, a Colorado mother of five, Shannon Watts, launched a group that now numbers 6 million: Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. After the large Republican gains in the state elections of 2014, Moms Demand Action fought mostly on defense, helping prevent Tennessee from restoring gun rights to violent felons, for instance, and Alaska from compelling state universities to allow guns to be carried on campus. In the 2020s, Moms Demand Action and allies could reshape the national gun debate more fundamentally. It's the kind of effort that should be much more widely embraced, and not only by mothers.\n\nThe gun buyers of 2020-21 are different from those of years past: They are more likely to be people of color and more likely to be women . They are not buying guns to join a race war, or to overthrow the government, or to wait for Armageddon in a bunker stocked with canned beans. They just want to deter a burglar or an assailant, should one come.\n\nThose dangers are real, and it's understandable that people would fear them and seek to avert them. But like the people who refuse lifesaving vaccines for fear of minutely rare side effects, American gun buyers are falling victim to bad risk analysis.\n\nThey need to meet the grandparents who stuffed a gun beneath a pillow while cooking-and returned to their granddaughter's dead body. They need to see the man in prison because he lost his temper over a parking space. They need to listen to the parents whose teenager found a suicide weapon that had not been locked away. They need to know more about the woman killed in the electronics aisle at an Idaho Walmart when her 2-year-old accidentally discharged the gun she carried in her purse.\n\nThey need to hear a new call to conscience, aimed not at the paranoid and the extreme, not at the militiamen and the race warriors, but at the decent, everyday gun owner.\n\nYou want to be a protective spouse, a concerned parent, a good citizen, a patriotic American? Save your family and your community from danger by getting rid of your weapons, and especially your handguns. Don't wait for the law. Do it yourself; do it now. Do it because you just bought your first home, do it because you just got married, do it because you just had the baby you cherish more than anything in this world. The gun you trust against your fears is itself the thing you should fear . The gun is a lie.\n\nAs more Americans recognize the lie, they may notice a powerful new possibility. Once emancipated from the false myth of the home-protecting gun, they will find it easier to write laws and adopt policies to stop the criminals and zealots who carry guns into the streets. Win enough elections, and the federal courts will retreat from their sudden gun advocacy-and return to their historic deference to state regulation of firearms.\n\nNone of this will be easy, but it is not impossible. Over the past half decade, we've seen American society changed for the better through mass movements such as #MeToo. Now we need a new moral reckoning.\n\nTwenty-five hundred years ago, the Greek writer Thucydides described the progress of civilization. It began, he said, when the Athenians ceased carrying arms inside their city, and left that savage custom to the barbarians . It's long past time for Americans to absorb this first lesson from the first democracy.\n\nThis article appears in the October 2021 print edition with the headline \"Responsible Gun Ownership Is a Lie.\""

      "text": "Guns Are a Threat to the Body Politic\n\nAmerica must regulate guns not only to protect life, but to protect its citizens' equal freedoms to speak, assemble, worship, and vote without fear.\n\nUpdated at 1:03 p.m. ET on March 8, 2021.\n\nWhy regulate guns? The standard answer is that gun laws can prevent needless deaths and physical injury. But this is not a complete accounting. As gun-brandishing protesters and armed invasions of legislatures demonstrate, guns inflict more than physical injuries-they transform the public sphere on which a constitutional democracy depends. America must regulate guns not only to protect life, but to protect its citizens' equal freedoms to speak, assemble, worship, and vote without fear. If legislators and judges do not focus on the freedoms that gun regulation protects, guns will threaten those freedoms.\n\nIs the Second Amendment an obstacle to gun regulation intended to protect the public sphere against weapons threats? In 2008's District of Columbia v. Heller , the Supreme Court found that Americans have a right to keep and bear a handgun in their home for self-defense. In doing so, the Court assumed a paradigmatic scene of gun use: a \"law-abiding citizen\" defending his or her household against a criminal invader. But the Court did not address scenes in which guns threaten the exercise of liberties by other law-abiding citizens, whether those threats occur in the home or in public.\n\nHeller 's distinctive focus may well have created a blind spot. The Court-changed by Donald Trump's appointments-is now poised to expand constitutional protections for gun rights outside the home, but may do so without taking into account how the practice of public carry has changed in the past decade. Over the past 10 years, advocates have sought, with some success, to normalize open carry of firearms in public spaces as they participate in market and political activities. The result is not just lone individuals carrying guns while buying coffee at Starbucks or shopping at Walmart. Open-carry advocates in militia dress amass at right-wing political protests, including in Charlottesville in 2017, at \"gun sanctuary\" rallies, at anti-lockdown demonstrations, and at Black Lives Matter counterprotests.\n\nThis phenomenon raises fundamentally different questions than does the scene on which Heller was premised. These gun owners are not wielding guns against home invaders-they are bringing their guns to public spaces, seeking to dominate those spaces. Though armed protesters may employ a language of self-defense and victimhood, they do so to justify acting against those with whom they disagree . Some of them do not even invoke the self-defense that Heller described, but rather rely on the \"insurrectionary theory\" of the Second Amendment-claiming they are defending the republic against its enemies.\n\nPublic-health arguments for gun control do not fully capture all the harms these incidents inflict. Armed mobs threaten democratic life itself. As the organizers of \"Stop the Steal\" had hoped, the nation witnessed its leaders crouched under benches in the Capitol, unable to count the electoral vote. Such threats and assaults, and the failure to evenhandedly police those harms, transform the public sphere and elevate some rights and some voices above others. In these and many other circumstances, gun regulation defends the body politic.\n\nGun-rights advocates have thus expanded practices of gun use, and urge the Supreme Court to extend Heller 's constitutional protections to public carry outside the home. But many advocates of gun regulation focus on threats of physical injury only. Without question, gun regulation is needed to address the mass shootings, intimate-partner violence, suicides, and daily homicides that account for roughly 40,000 deaths and 100,000 injuries every year. * Americans also need their democratic government to work, and that means protecting citizens from intimidation when they exercise their civic rights, and protecting government officials from weapons threats when they are trying to conduct normal business.\n\nIs there a constitutional basis for this argument? Gun-rights supporters claim that constitutional history places the rights of armed citizens above all others. But, as we argue in a forthcoming article , this claim is based on a mistaken understanding of the relevant legal history and of Heller itself. For centuries, the Anglo-American common law has regulated weapons not only to keep members of the polity alive, but to protect their liberties from weapons threats and to preserve public peace and order. William Blackstone himself, the great chronicler of the common law, wrote that \"riding or going armed, with dangerous or unusual weapons, is a crime against the public peace, by terrifying the good people of the land.\" The \"peace\" that the law protected encompassed more than physical safety. As Blackstone made clear, \"terrifying the good people of the land\"-not just attacking them-was \"a crime against the public peace.\"\n\nThat regulatory tradition has long shaped state and federal law. And as we demonstrate, it grounds the understanding of the Second Amendment in Heller , where Justice Antonin Scalia specifically invoked it as a basis for government's authority to limit the exercise of gun rights. In the course of recognizing the individual right to self-defense, Justice Scalia emphasized that \"nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions\" like those \"forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings.\" Invoking Blackstone and other authorities, Heller recognized the power of governments to regulate weapons so as to prevent terror and preserve the peace.\n\nThis understanding of Heller can change what gun laws are enacted, and how they are litigated and enforced. Legislatures can draft laws specifically tailored to preventing intimidation- banning guns at polling places , for example, or tightening restrictions on armed domestic abusers, who, though they sometimes kill, more commonly use guns to coerce and terrorize their victims. Once we appreciate the liberties that public safety secures, we can better hold government accountable for the evenhanded enforcement of weapons laws .\n\nIf Americans do not recognize the social dimensions of public safety-the ancient role that weapons laws play in securing peace and public order-the use of guns will come to define America's constitutional democracy, rather than the other way around.\n\n* This article previously misstated that mass shootings, intimate-partner violence, and homicides account for roughly 40,000 deaths each year. In fact, that figure also includes suicides involving a firearm.\n\nThis story is part of the project \" The Battle for the Constitution ,\" in partnership with the National Constitution Center ."

      "text": "What's Your Earliest Experience With Guns?\n\nHaving grown up in Indiana, and with family in rural Illinois (where the itinerary for a family reunion in 2014 included a trick shooting show and a two-hour block of time for \"introduction to firearms\"), I know more than a few people for whom owning guns is a significant part of their lives. When I've asked an ex's father or a second cousin why they hunt or maintain a collection of firearms, they've typically said something about growing up with them in the house, or that they were the focal accessory in bonding time with a mentor.\n\nThat's also the gist of several comments in this discussion thread I found. This passage in particular shows a striking dichotomy of early exposure to guns:\n\nI have an extremely negative memory for my first experience with a gun. My older cousin (who was about 16 or 18 at the time) tried to shoot me. I was about five years old.\n\nMy four-year-old cousin saw him aim the gun at where I was swinging. She jumped off of her swing and pulled me back. I was really mad at her until I heard the crack of the rifle. I froze while realizing what happened. The bullet missed me but went through the window of our trailer. He walked away, angry.  I still have no idea why he tried to shoot me. I can't ask him because his younger brother killed him about seven years ago.\n\nLuckily a short while after this incident, my father gave me a positive memory with a firearm. He taught me how to shoot. It was a great bonding experience. He taught me how to aim and care for a gun, mentioning that the most important things were to treat guns and people with respect and to properly clean guns. We spend most of the afternoon shooting the target in the yard.  I think it was a mock-up of a deer.\n\n\"Guns brought my father and I closer together,\" the commenter says in a later post. \"It was something he knew well that he was able to teach me. I will pass on the same values to my little one.\"\n\nAs part of our special project on police, crime, and guns in America , we'd like to hear from you about your earliest memories of guns.

      "text": "One Nation Under Guns\n\nHow this year's Supreme Court ruling on Second Amendment rights is changing everything\n\nSince the horrific murders at Sandy Hook Elementary a decade ago , America has seen hundreds more mass shootings, a sharp rise in gun deaths generally, and an alarming turn toward gun-glorifying political extremism. Yet we still depend on hundreds of laws that keep guns out of crowded public places, stop teenagers from buying handguns, and prohibit criminals from arming themselves with assault rifles. Now, because of a recent Supreme Court ruling, many of these remaining regulations are in danger of being dismantled. As bad as America's gun-violence problem is, it could be about to get much worse.\n\nLess than two years after the appointment of President Donald Trump's third pick for the U.S. Supreme Court created a 6-3 conservative supermajority, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the majority opinion in the case New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen . The Court could have issued a narrow decision and directed New York to be more lenient in issuing concealed-carry permits. But as in the Dobbs v. Jackson decision on abortion, which came a day after Bruen this year, the conservative majority seized an opportunity not to adjust precedent incrementally, but to destroy it completely.\n\nFor public safety and gun policy, the Bruen opinion is proving nothing short of seismic. Even as the nation struggles with yet another series of mass shootings, courts across the country are rushing to deal with a spate of lawsuits and motions that will create regulatory chaos over firearms. Many of these cases are tailored to produce appeals that may ultimately go up to a Supreme Court predisposed to the broadest possible interpretations of Second Amendment rights.\n\nIn the Bruen opinion, Thomas made clear that, henceforth, the Court's conservative majority would judge all firearms regulations by a new originalist standard: If there is no historical proof of a gun law linked to 1791 or 1868-the years when the Second and Fourteenth Amendments, respectively, were ratified-then any modern law restricting firearms is liable to be ruled unconstitutional. Never mind that any teenager with a modern AR-15 rifle can fire several times every second, whereas a well-trained 18th-century soldier could fire a musket, at best, three or four times a minute.\n\nAaron Tang: What if the Court saw other rights as generously as gun rights?\n\nAn effect of the Thomas opinion is to press judges in lower courts into serving as historians and archival researchers. To decide new gun cases, they must go searching for precedents among incomplete or nonexistent records, some of which are centuries old and difficult to decipher. The results are likely to shock Americans who rely on long-established public-safety laws to protect children in schools and citizens who gather in churches or attend sports events and the like. Instead of making it more difficult for a troubled 18-year-old to become a deadly mass shooter, this Court has made it much easier-all in the cause of empowering an unrepresentative, radical pro-gun minority of Americans whose vocal demands about their right to bear arms have found sympathetic ears on the Supreme Court.\n\nS everal cases already give us a glimpse of the future under Bruen . In West Virginia, a judge recently ruled unconstitutional the federal law that mandates serial numbers on guns, because he can find no evidence of a statute requiring firearms to carry a serial number dating to 1791. If that judge's decision is upheld, police detectives will find it almost impossible to solve gun crimes, because serial-number records are the basis for most such investigations.\n\nIn Texas, a judge just struck down the prohibition of gun ownership by domestic abusers . His reasoning derives from the regrettable truth that spousal abuse was not a criminal offense in the 1700s. This decision is set to undo laws across the nation that have prohibited more than 300,000 gun purchases by abusers-and at a time when recent data show a steep rise in the number of women, including Black women at a disproportionate rate, killed by a male gun owner in their lives.\n\nIn New York, in October, a judge ruled that guns must be allowed in places of worship , because he couldn't find any old laws that prohibited armed parishioners. Laws that regulate magazine capacity in several states are also currently facing challenges, which could mean that no state or municipality could regulate the sale of 30-round, or even 100-round, magazines for any sort of gun, including the AR-15s preferred by mass shooters who desire to inflict as much carnage as they can without having to pause to reload (a moment that makes them vulnerable to citizens fighting back to subdue them).\n\nRead: Have the justices gone gun-shy?\n\nAnother Texas law prohibiting teenagers from carrying handguns was recently struck down because young men alive at the time of our founding faced no such regulation. Similar cases are making their way through other courts, which, if they stand, could not only permit 18-year-olds to buy handguns (the current national law mandates a minimum age of 21), but also imperil hope of imposing a national age restriction on the sale of AR-15 rifles. Meanwhile, in several states other suits are threatening to overturn laws that regulate the sale of those same assault rifles.\n\nOther likely Bruen -induced outcomes include lawsuits to end all background checks, based on the absurd argument that running background checks on gun sales violates the Constitution because no nationwide computerized database of criminal records existed at the country's founding. That such a lawsuit would not only threaten efforts to close the gun-show loophole but also aim to eliminate the entire background-check system-the same one that has stopped millions of dangerous criminals from purchasing guns-reveals just how far the Bruen decision is moving the needle.\n\nF or most Americans , this survey of the post- Bruen lawfare should sound shocking and dangerous. But it's a dream come true for extremists who place gun rights at the forefront of their culture-warring. They see an opportunity to grasp a wider victory from the way Bruen alters the foundation of a long-accepted balance between individual rights and society's need to ensure collective safety. This same reordering of values and priorities lies at the heart of efforts to dismantle government influence more generally, including over environmental protections and public-health mandates.\n\nThese new attacks are so extreme that even laws supported by the gun industry are coming under threat. Until not so long ago, an overwhelming majority of leaders in the firearms industry, in which I spent more than 25 years as a sales executive, accepted the necessity of regulations like the ones that flowed from the 1939 Supreme Court case U.S. v. Miller , which upheld the 1934 National Firearms Act. That statute severely restricted the sale of sawed-off shotguns, silencers, and fully automatic weapons such as the \"tommy guns\" used by criminal organizations like Al Capone's.\n\nMiller thus clarified the balance between individual freedoms and collective safety as a sound constitutional test for all gun laws. This finding led to other bedrock laws such as the federal background-check system, or NICS , which was instituted in 1998. This statute protected citizens by making it harder for criminals to obtain firearms, while also providing reasonable liability protection for responsible gun manufacturers. Up until the late 2000s, most people I knew in the industry approved of laws enabled by the Miller standard that helped prohibit \"bad guys\" from buying guns.\n\nUnfortunately, for three decades, the industry was also partnering with the National Rifle Association-at a time when the organization was radicalizing a political base that became hell-bent on destroying those laws. The first big victory for this coalition came in 2008 with the Supreme Court's D.C. v. Heller decision, which reinterpreted the Second Amendment to establish a broader individual right to own a gun for self-defense.\n\nHeller was just the start. While the NRA helped rally opposition to newly elected President Barack Obama, fringe actors and conspiracy-theory-mongers were empowered to make guns a totemic issue for the right. As the NRA's power grew, judges who hoped for advancement-as far as nomination to the Supreme Court-got the message, and started issuing more radical decisions on gun rights as a way to keep their names at the top of lists of potential nominees.\n\nBrett Kavanaugh, then a federal judge on the D.C. Circuit, illustrated this trend when he wrote a dissent arguing that courts should cease to rely on constitutional tests for gun laws that balanced public safety with Second Amendment rights-the foundation of the Supreme Court's ruling in Miller . After President Trump announced his pick of Kavanaugh, the NRA's leader, Wayne LaPierre, was quick to call on members to urge senators to confirm him. The NRA played an equally prominent role in the nomination processes of Trump's other two justices, spending millions in partnership with the Federalist Society to promote Neil Gorsuch and rallying confirmation votes for Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nThe NRA's political effort helped create the current Supreme Court majority that elevates the rights of gun owners above almost all others . For now, the results are manifesting in the lower courts. How this conservative-dominated high-court bench will ultimately rule on each Bruen -inspired challenge is not certain, but one thing is: Those cases now racing up through the circuits will quickly force the justices to decide whether they were serious about undoing the balance of Miller .\n\nThis is no quibble or nicety. The justices will be forced to decide whether we are to be a country that must allow armed citizens in every grocery store, church, or park. They will be forced to decide whether we must expand the right of open carry to every state in the nation, including its largest metropolises, with all the potential for mayhem that portends. They will be forced to decide whether we must abandon laws that prohibit abusers from buying guns and killing their spouses or that prevent troubled teenagers from arming themselves with AR-15s. Given the gravity of it all, perhaps the NRA is right about this much-more than any other part of the Constitution, it is the Second Amendment that determines whether we are to govern ourselves or not."

      "text": "We Need to Learn to Live With Guns\n\nA passive Congress and hostile judiciary leave Americans with little choice but to change the culture of firearms.\n\nThe most important thing you need to know about yesterday's tragic school shooting in Texas is that absolutely no laws are going to change as a result of it.\n\nIn the 14 years since the Supreme Court found an individual right to bear arms under the Second Amendment in the landmark case of D.C. v. Heller , the federal judiciary has only grown more conservative. The courts will likely bar any meaningful restrictions on the possession of firearms for at least another generation.\n\nYour fellow Americans, meanwhile, who collectively bought 40 million firearms in 2020 and 2021, have grown even less enamored with the various gun-control measures typically floated by politicians after such tragedies. In Texas, the same Republican lawmakers cruising to reelection this fall made relaxing the state's already permissive gun laws a priority in the last legislative session.\n\nAnd the simple commercial problem facing firearms manufacturers has not changed: They make highly durable goods. Firearms can be passed down through generations. To meet growth targets, then, firearms manufacturers must figure out ways to scare or otherwise motivate people who already own firearms to buy more firearms.\n\nRead: What critics don't understand about gun culture\n\nFor decades, these firearms manufacturers have- in both subtle and not-so-subtle ways -convinced white people that they need to buy arsenals to protect themselves from people of color. More recently, thanks in part to various shootings perpetrated by those heavily armed white people, people of color have responded by arming themselves in greater numbers , which must delight the firearms manufacturers.\n\nSo we should all stop saying that something is going to change. Nothing is going to change. Democratic lawmakers-for whom overpromising and underdelivering is an incurable habit -propose measures after these shootings that they know will never pass through a highly divided Congress, or be sustained by federal judges hand-selected to stymie progressive legislation for the next three or four decades.\n\nWe all need to adjust to the idea that unfathomable levels of gun violence, including school shootings, are going to get worse, not better, in the decades to come. In the past month alone, my two sons had a baseball game canceled because of a shooting at the park where they were meant to play and, two weeks later, soccer practice cut short because a nearby gunman had opened fire on a school down the road . In that latter incident, no innocent lives were lost thanks only to the gunman's inability to effectively use any of the three assault rifles-I'm sorry, \"modern sporting rifles\"-he had stockpiled in his apartment overlooking the school.\n\nThis is America, folks. This is who we are.\n\nSo what should we do?\n\nFirst, we need to make firearms education a national priority. Once upon a time, when I was a young boy, a friendly organization called the National Rifle Association did great work teaching Americans about the safe use of firearms in hunting and other shooting sports. It still does some of that, but it's a smaller and smaller portion of what that now extremely troubled organization is about.\n\nThe government, then, should step up. If we're going to allow everyone in America to own as many firearms as they want, our children need to understand what to do if they see a firearm, which they inevitably will. Don't touch it. Go find an adult. Older children, meanwhile, should also understand how to unload a firearm and render it safe. Families might not have any interest in firearms, but firearms are going to be ever-present in the lives of their children.\n\nRead: When was the last time children were so afraid?\n\nThe Pittman-Robertson Act of 1937 funds various conservation and wildlife-habitat-restoration initiatives through taxes on firearms and ammunition. We should raise those taxes and use the additional funds to help state wildlife and natural-resources departments teach firearm and hunter safety in our schools. I knew how to safely operate a rifle by the age of 10, and I don't think it's ever too early to teach young children the golden rules of firearm safety:\n\nTreat every firearm as if it is loaded.\n\nNever point the muzzle at anything you are not willing to destroy.\n\nKeep your finger off the trigger until you are ready to fire.\n\nAlways be sure of your target and what's beyond.\n\nI still hunt and shoot sporting clays on a regular basis, and whenever I return from the range or from hunting, I clean my shotguns on newspapers spread out over the dining-room table. I use the opportunity to reinforce the rules for the proper handling of firearms to my three young children. I want my children to treat firearms as objects of respect, not of lust. I do not want them to fetishize these tools.\n\nBecause the second and much harder thing we need to do is to shift the gun culture in America. I have written before about how the gun culture I have observed develop since the September 11 attacks-the emphasis on tactical weaponry, the marketing of ceramic plate carriers and Kevlar helmets to civilians-is so very different than the gun culture I grew up with in East Tennessee in the 1980s, when the seemingly ever-present firearms were mostly shotguns for hunting and bolt-action rifles.\n\nI bought a used rifle not too long ago, and the federal firearms license-holder to whom I had to temporarily transfer the rifle-I now live in the District of Columbia, where all firearms must first be registered with the police-told me her other customers were fascinated by it. Indeed, on a rack mostly filled with semiautomatic 9-mm pistols people were waiting to pick up, my rifle stood out: a single-shot, break-action rifle chambered for big game. About as far away, in other words, from a Glock or AR-15 as you can get.\n\nMy wife, who grew up in the suburbs of New York without any firearms in her home, tells me that I am fighting a losing battle. She tells me it's impossible to recapture a more responsible approach to firearms.\n\nBut we have to try. Because the firearms are just not going away. The shootings are not going to stop. Our children are going to be exposed to a level of everyday gun violence that children in literally no other developed nation experience.\n\nI wish it were not this way. But this is the country we've chosen for ourselves, and it is not changing anytime soon."

      "text": "14 Reader Views on Guns\n\nThe woman arming herself against MAGA America, gun owners against gun culture, and more weigh in.\n\nThis is an edition of Up for Debate, a newsletter by Conor Friedersdorf. On Wednesdays, he rounds up timely conversations and solicits reader responses to one thought-provoking question. Later, he publishes some thoughtful replies. Sign up for the newsletter here.\n\nLast week I asked readers for their thoughts on guns.\n\nMark laments changes in American gun culture:\n\nTo compare my experience as a little boy in the early '60s to that of a 10 year old raised in the last decade ... The firearms my friends learned to use were primarily hunting rifles. I never heard talk of shooting for \"fun,\" it wasn't why firearms were kept. Those dads taught their sons about father/son rituals, not about firearms as recreation, or arming for arming's sake. If today's boys mostly learn about guns through gaming, social media, and entertainment, no wonder firearms aren't feared or viewed as inherently dangerous-how can boys react with grief or feel the horror of actual gun deaths when they are exposed to ubiquitous, gratuitous, and immersive gunplay designed to pump adrenaline or dopamine with addictive fury? Today, there is no separating firearms from fantasy; sadly, the result is overly accessible firearms in the hands of people who never learned to fear a loaded weapon pointed at another human being.\n\nDennis concurs:\n\nI grew up in the decades after World War II on Western films and movies about The War. Many of us kids had toy guns realistic enough that today a person might get shot by a police officer who encountered you carrying one. We played war, and cowboys and Indians-a lot. However, my father was an Army Reservist all through my childhood, and I remember a lot of military firearms on our kitchen table as my dad refreshed his memory on disassembly, cleaning, reassembly. My dad made it plain that there was a big difference between our toy firearms and the actual firearms he worked on. My dad was also a hunter. He would go to hunt rabbits, pheasants, ducks. He kept a shotgun, a side-by-side double. And that for me is a touchstone for that time. Most guns were about hunting, less firepower was better than more. Double guns were \"better\" than pump-action or self-loading shotguns. Lever-action rifles were cool thanks to all the Western movies of the era, but serious shooters used bolt-action rifles, which were more accurate and showed that the person behind the sights could do the job with one shot. Accuracy, precision were respected; the ability, or tendency, to just blast away was not.\n\nAll that is to explain the shaking of my head as I look at what \"gun culture\" has become. I like firearms the way I like other well-designed and well-crafted tools. I own handguns and a shotgun. Still, I know a lot of people don't own or like them. As I look at the gun \"landscape\" I'm not surprised. When an AR is a \"modern sporting rifle,\" when the firearms in the news are just like the rifles handled by soldiers in combat footage, what are non-fans going to think? That gun owners are delusional lunatics ... Eliminate high-capacity magazines. Limit all mags to 10 or 12 rounds. Encourage owners to turn others in and confiscate any found in interactions with law enforcement. Compensate owners for their loss. Or at least require the sort of licensure that applies to full-auto weapons. There's just no point for 20 or 30 round magazines in the civilian world.\n\nMerideth fears MAGA America and has armed herself against the threat she perceives from it:\n\nIn spring of 2021, I saw news from NPR: first-time gun owners helped \"push record levels of gun sales for what looks like the second year in a row.\" I was/am one of those first-time gun owners.\n\nDonald Trump led a horde of fascists out of their dungeons and now they are spreading like Covid. My wife and I are queer. Most of my friends are women. Many of my friends are queer. Fascism is a threat to everyone, but especially to women and LGBTQs, as evidenced by the erosion of LGBTQ rights and protections under the law and the spread of state laws prohibiting abortion. Trump's brand of evil, coupled with the resurgence of fascism (and evidence of military and law enforcement officers joining fascist paramilitary groups in droves) are what led me to decide to purchase a firearm. I will defend myself and my family since I can't trust the police or the military to defend us.\n\nI had never even fired a gun prior to purchasing one, which should make a reasonable person pause to consider whether California's so-called \"strict\" gun laws are actually that strict. I decided against taking a photo with my wife brandishing my bolt-action shotgun. My imagined meme: \"Locked and loaded: now try and come for our marriage.\"\n\nEric believes that understanding where gun culture has gone wrong is the key to reforming the right to bear arms without abolishing it:\n\nI appreciate guns as useful tools. I will own some form of hunting rifle in the foreseeable future. And yet, I must state plainly and unequivocally, that the love and obsession that parts of American culture feel towards guns is abhorrent, perverse, and disgusting. Growing up in a family of avid hunters, no gun was described as \"cool.\" Nobody considered maximizing bullets they could shoot per minute. Those aren't things a healthy gun owner considers. This is not to say a person cannot have a healthy sporting desire to have a well-functioning gun. But if a person is reading gun magazines, joining gun clubs, and spending considerably more time and energy with guns than with other hobbies, there is no good explanation other than a deep desire, at some point, to harm another. I'm sure many such persons believe they will harm another in scenarios of self-defense or protection of others, or to defend liberty, or some other noble goal; still, such a person seeks to actively hone their abilities to harm another living being.\n\nWe can build a society that has a healthier relationship with guns. We can protect the right to bear arms to protect home and community. We can have sporting gun clubs. We can protect ourselves against tyranny. But we should not confuse those laudable goals with the sick desire infesting too many of our people, mostly young men, to be ready to kill at a moment's notice. We can allow single-shot rifles and handguns, which serve all of our noblest goals. No reasonable hunter uses a semi-automatic weapon capable of delivering 20+ rounds per minute. We can ban or severely curtail semi-automatic weapon ownership and still protect the individual's ability to protect family and preserve traditions. We cannot prevent all mass murders, but we can significantly curb them.\n\nLee is a convert to narrowing the Bill of Rights:\n\nThe most recent mass shootings have finished changing my mind about the 2nd amendment. The US constitution is a groundbreaking, time-tested document. But the founders failed to anticipate a populace that would feature more guns than people, and automatic weapons that could kill all 39 white men who signed the constitution in far less time than it took them to sign it. So yeah. They screwed the pooch with the 2nd amendment. And today, churchgoers and school children and others, usually minority but not always, are literally being gunned down in cold blood because the most developed nation in the world can't navigate itself around a rule created well over 200 years ago.\n\nWe must be crazy.\n\nI don't know exactly what gun control should be put in place. I only care that it works to avoid killing innocents. Many will claim that it's not the gun pulling the trigger. But if there is no trigger to pull, then school kids, elderly churchgoers, black supermarket shoppers, hair salon and nightclub patrons, music concert attendees and others might get to live their lives. It's been 10 years since Sandy Hook. And every level of government has failed Americans. Do not quote the 2nd amendment at me. That's just bureaucratic bullshit.\n\nL.H. is a teacher with detailed gun-policy preferences:\n\nAs a gun owner, I would rather see assault weapons licensed than banned. One must pass a written exam and undergo hours of in-person, small-group instruction to be allowed behind the wheel of a motor vehicle; I'd think it fair to require the owners of powerful firearms to do the same. The study time would put a brake on impulsive acts, and an instructor's impression of their students' attentiveness, seriousness, and mental state would be a useful adjunct to a background check. (I wouldn't go so far as to let an instructor unilaterally declare a student unfit to purchase an assault weapon, but I'd allow them to confidentially flag a student for a more intensive background check if something about the student seems off.) Another idea would be to raise the minimum age to purchase assault weapons (so many mass shooters have been barely adults).\n\nAs a policy nerd, I'd advise anyone writing bans or restrictions on \"assault weapons\" to carefully consider how they define that term. A huge variety of firearms are made and sold in the U.S., along with an even greater variety of modifications, attachments, and replacement parts that can alter the capabilities of those firearms. Policymakers should study the record of mass shootings, pinpoint the features that make a firearm more capable of causing mass casualties, and take care that their ban (1) covers any design that provides those features and (2) causes minimal disruption to firearms they don't intend to cover. For example, I've heard many calls to ban \"high-capacity\" magazines, but the size limit I most often see discussed (10 rounds) is less than the factory default for many medium-to-large handguns (including my own, a popular brand's \"compact\" model, which shipped with 15-round magazines). And banning any weapon \"capable of accepting\" a high-capacity magazine would be a mess: that would leave third-party manufacturers able to effectively outlaw a firearm just by designing and producing a higher-capacity magazine for it. Also, the distinction between a pistol and a rifle is blurrier than you might think (see the weapon used in the 2021 Boulder, CO, shooting).\n\nAnd as a high-school teacher (and fellow human), I'd encourage communities to remember that the problem of mass shootings has two sides: both the wide availability of powerful firearms and the widening availability of people willing to commit atrocities with them. Whatever it is about our society that's driving more and more of its members to mass murder, it's not going to be solved by speeches, protests, or even changes to gun laws. Human problems can only be solved at the human level, one to one, through a web of relationships strong enough to ensure that no one ends up so isolated and divorced from empathy that shooting up school children starts to make sense. One of the biggest protective factors for youth against mental health crises (of any sort) is having at least one trusting relationship with an adult. Knowing this, I do what I can to connect with each of my students, so that at minimum they know I notice their presence, appreciate their efforts, and am available to talk if they're struggling. Is that enough to change a mind that's already set on violence? Maybe not, but it might be enough to keep a mind from going down that path in the first place. Whoever you are, ask yourself: what can I do to show the young people in my life that they're valued and needed?\n\nMatt believes that guns can protect us from tyranny even if the right to bear them resides in state militias:\n\nI very much believe the proper modern interpretation of the right to bear arms, which actually begins in reference to \"A well regulated militia ...\" would be for the continued right of states to have their own militias (or national guards) independent of federal control. It's the military version of checks and balances. Every ability we as citizens have to acquire personal firearms is a privilege, to me, no different than our privilege to have a driver's license.\n\nI say that as a gun owner, as a lifelong gun user, and supporter of the availability of firearms. I hunt and target shoot and hope to continue doing both for a long time. An AR-15 or other assault weapon has one purpose and it is to kill people. Even as a target shooting weapon, an AR-15 makes target shooting too easy. I've shot one and actually found it a little disappointing in that there wasn't much challenge to it. Point, click, hit the target. Go figure they are used repeatedly to murder masses of people in short amounts of time. People mostly want them because they are fun to shoot, and yes they are, but our right to have fun ends at the repeated mass murder of innocent people.\n\nJonathan gets philosophical:\n\nAyn Rand was asked about her attitude on gun control at the Ford Hall Forum in '73 and her response was, \"It's a complex, technical issue in the philosophy of law. Handguns are instruments for killing people-they are not carried for hunting animals-and you have no right to kill people. You do have the right to self-defense, however. I don't know how the issue is to be resolved to protect you without giving you the privilege to kill people at whim.\" If it were possible to regulate guns out of existence we would lose some of our ability to defend ourselves against criminals but we might gain a less fearful and less violent society. I'd be willing to make that trade. Killing people at a whim is far too easy and we should all hope to limit that ease.\n\nDavid asks Americans to reflect on what their foreign adversaries are saying:\n\n\"Politicians in Washington are in no position to talk about human rights worldwide before getting their own house in order. Hope that the day Americans can live free from gun violence and fear will come sooner rather than later.\" That was from today's Twitter feed of Hua Chunying 华春莹, the spokeswoman for China's foreign ministry. I follow her because she is very adept at pouncing on every American weakness. In fact, if our country ever did an analysis of our Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (a \"SWOT\" in business school/consulting speak), her Twitter account would be a good place to start for the Ws and Ts.\n\nAs we look inward on America's exceptionalism in gun violence, it would be helpful to look outward as well. When a massacre occurs, especially one that kills young children, what does the rest of the world think? They think that for all our wealth, for all our strengths in commerce and technology, for all our freedoms, we cannot keep our children safe. Our inability to do so makes us look weak and unserious. And barbaric. And, as much as I hate to say it, when so many American children die every year from gun violence and we do nothing, we look like the worst type of hypocrites when we lecture other countries about human rights violations. The mostly Republican fetish for the Second Amendment decreases American power because it decreases our moral standing. Hua Chunying's words sting, so I'll repeat them: \"Politicians in Washington are in no position to talk about human rights worldwide before getting their own house in order. Hope that the day Americans can live free from gun violence and fear will come sooner rather than later.\"\n\nRead: Mass shootings, young men, and what can be done\n\nRichard urges Americans to look north:\n\nAs a Canadian firearms owner and competitive shooter, I think it's unfortunate, for America, that a moderate system of gun control like Canada's would be so impossible, politically, in your country. To own a rifle or shotgun here, you need a license, issued after a background check that includes asking your spouse if they have any objections. People with a history of domestic violence, other crimes, or mental problems can't get one, generally speaking. Most rifles and shotguns don't have to be registered, although it is a criminal offence to sell or give one to somebody who doesn't have a license. You're also required to keep them trigger locked, or in a safe, unless you're in a spot where you need it handy for defence against predators, not uncommon in rural Canada. Overall, it's pretty easy to own a hunting rifle or shotgun. Recently, the federal government has tightened up the rules about assault-style semiautomatic rifles considerably. Depending who you ask, this is either Justin Trudeau's favourite kind of political theatre, at the expense of people who'd never vote for him anyway, or a legitimate attempt to prevent a repetition of the 1989 Ecole Polytechnique mass shooting in Montreal, in the wake of the many further and horrific examples from the USA.\n\nAssault-style rifles, in Canada, are just range toys anyway. To take a few examples that may be known to your readers: The AR15 has always been restricted to shooting range use, and the AK47 has been outright prohibited, although the Ruger Mini 14 has, until recently, been unrestricted. Nobody even pretends that these rifles are essential, or even particularly useful, for hunting or predator defence. As for handguns, since at least the 1930s we've observed a sharp distinction between long guns and handguns.\n\nHandgun ownership is rarer than in the USA. Handguns have to be registered, and that license involves an even more thorough background check. Concealed carry is a serious criminal offence. The only lawful purposes for civilian handgun ownership are target competition, employment as an armoured car guard (not just a security guard), or for prospectors and the like to carry in Grizzly country (where anyone with any sense is toting at least a 12 gauge shotgun, not a handgun). Smallish handguns (with a barrel of 4 inches or less) are prohibited entirely, since they're not suited to any of those lawful purposes.\n\nIt follows that the pocket pistols, occasionally used by drug gangs in Toronto and the suburbs of Vancouver, mostly to shoot inaccurately at one another, have largely been smuggled in from the USA. When I visit the USA with my family, I try to ignore the fact that many of the people out and about have handguns concealed in their clothes or vehicle, or that anyone, apparently even a teenager, can acquire an AR15 and a high capacity magazine. As a summer customs officer at a tourist crossing, years ago, I was amazed to see how many Americans had a handgun in the glove compartment, or rattling around in the back of the Winnebago, which they were very often incompetent to unload safely.\n\nI might own a carry pistol too if I lived in, say Houston (though not Seattle). I'm grateful that I don't have to make that choice. I'm also grateful that the Canadian police officers in my family don't have to be much concerned that there'll be a firearm in the car when they conduct a traffic stop. Despite these restrictions on our liberties, we enjoy a functioning democracy. We really aren't worried that we need an armed militia to deter King George or his descendants from coming back or to overthrow our own government.\n\nJudd writes:\n\nI don't mean to be glib when I say that I think that one of the best things we can do to reduce these mass killings is to increase paid time off. Companies really like to \"get the most\" out of their employees. If society can enable people to spend more of their time in their communities and with their families, we stand a much better chance of reducing \"lone wolf\" alienation and other sources of this disease. On a related note, the \"we are failing men\" message-while probably true-really undersells the incredible resilience of women, who have plenty of challenges and yet are never these killers.\n\nKevin defends gun rights, including AR-15 ownership:\n\nFirst off, I like guns. I grew up with guns, was a member of a Fish and Game Club in upstate New York and participated in the junior Civilian Marksmanship Program as a high schooler. When I went away to a Quaker liberal arts college, I didn't shoot very often until after I completed law school and had been in the workforce for several years. I got back into guns and shooting when I was about thirty and now have what many would consider a small arsenal of rifles, pistols and shotguns. I know of course that I don't \"need\" all of those guns, but as an enthusiast it is hard to resist the siren call to collect. I shoot semi-regularly as a member of a private gun range. I shoot pistols, largely to stay familiar with my pistols and adept at their use. I shoot rifles for fun, mostly bolt action rifles at long ranges or my .22 at shorter ranges. It is a hobby, a form of fun, and a considered choice to be armed in the event of some sort of emergency.\n\nConstitutionally, I do believe that the Second Amendment provides an individual right to bear arms. The much contested Second Amendment is not a model of clarity and it is fair to contest its meaning. I am a lawyer and have very rigorously read many of the briefs.\n\nThe Constitutional Convention, like any legislative body, was populated by people with different aims, desires, and understandings and was created as a compromise of all these competing thoughts. There certainly was a strain of the body that was concerned that a strong federal government might attempt to restrict state militias. But there were also strands of thought concerned with individual rights. I think the best reading of the amendment, that gives value to both propositions and which best comports with the contemporary understanding of the amendment, is that the Framers wanted to protect both state militias as well as individual rights and that the best way to preserve a militia was to protect the right of individuals to keep and bear arms so that a large percentage of the population might be familiar with the usage of firearms. I don't believe the right is restricted to those who participate in a militia. Furthermore, the \"militia\" as then understood was the entire adult male population (which via our modern understanding of the constitution would now consist of the entire adult population).\n\nAs to logic or arguments based on first principles and without recourse to the constitution, I think that overall, there should be a right to carry. I am happy to condition that right on some government regulation, and to grant the government the right to restrict firearms from sensitive locations, events, etc. Experience teaches us that licensed concealed carriers in the U.S. are extraordinarily law abiding and very rarely misuse their firearms. If we could realistically restrict firearms carrying to only those who have a carry license, we would very easily be in the same line of gun violence as experienced by all the western European countries always mentioned. The problem of gun violence does not flow from the people who obtain a carry license. Rather, it largely flows from criminal elements (i.e., those who are engaged in criminal activity separate and apart from their ownership/use of guns) who use guns. If we truly are a country that wants to maximize individual freedoms and curtail them only to the extent necessary to protect the rest of the population from abuses of those rights, then we should be focusing gun violence prevention efforts more narrowly on the people who abuse those rights and less broadly on the larger population who responsibly enjoys those rights.\n\nFabrice is wrestling with how to understand human nature:\n\nI am a longtime liberal and I at one point in my life considered myself a gun enthusiast. My hobbies have not changed, but the world of gun culture in the US has changed around me.\n\nThe discussion about the right to bear arms and whether people should be permitted to do so is linked to a more fundamental question-can people be entrusted with the right to govern themselves and still live in a healthy and safe society? My view on gun ownership is linked to a fundamentally optimistic view-that yes, people in general are trustworthy enough to bear arms and that the norms of American society are sufficient to keep the right in check.\n\nAll of the shootings over my adult life should compel a questioning of this belief, but I struggle with the implications. If enough people cannot be trusted to bear arms, on what basis do we entrust them with the franchise? Voting for a sufficiently bad government is arguably an even worse outcome since the effects become wide-ranging instead of localized. If we can't trust each other on the street to responsibly own a firearm, how many other assumptions about personal responsibility must be tested?\n\nThe rise in gun violence is most likely part and parcel of an unraveling of American society in general, where we begin to actively distrust each other in motive and intention. This is a sad state of affairs, and likely moves us to a place not fundamentally compatible with democracy. The sickness of modern gun culture is evident here, because there's a not-small chunk of gun owners who would actively cheer the downfall of democracy and either the rise of strongmen or a total societal collapse.\n\nWhile I favor concepts like firearm insurance and red flag laws, I think the root issue has to be re-embedding all of these young male shooters back into society and getting them invested in the world around them, rather than stewing on /k/ and /pol/ and all of the derivative festering holes on the internet. No gun policy other than a total ban would significantly mitigate the root problem, and I don't have a solution for the root problem.\n\nI did have one suggestion, harkening back to the idea of societal ties. Invert the concept of a red flag law and require anyone who wants to buy a gun to bring a hand-signed affidavit from someone not related to them, affirming that the person is someone they would trust to own a firearm. (The less constitutional but more effective version: apply this restriction to men only, and require the affidavit be signed by a woman.) Most shooters are young manchildren soaked in the brine of the worst parts of the internet as a social substitute for their lonely real life existence. I suspect that something along the lines of this restriction would have stopped the majority of recent shooters.\n\nJohn warns the NRA to compromise:\n\nI am a concealed carry permit holder. I live in rural America, and I love to hunt. I have a bolt-action rifle every bit as powerful as the weapons used in these appalling mass-shootings, but the fire-rate and magazine capacity are lower and smaller. My words to the NRA and its powerful constituency: Compromise. Right now. If you look to the future, you will recognize threats to your beloved pastimes. The younger generations have made their voices very clear, and they will not tolerate this nor should they. Frankly, they are more interested in cell phones and social media than firearms, and the wise among you know it. Compromise now, or they will amend the constitution.\n\nThanks for all of your emails. I'll see you Wednesday."

      "text": "America's Tragedy Is Its Culture of Fear-Armed With Millions of Guns\n\nSenior Opinion Editor\n\nI've long avoided writing about anything related to guns -being both largely unfamiliar with firearms, and lacking a passionate view on either \" gun control \" or \" gun rights .\"\n\nJudging by national polling on the subject, I suppose you'd call me \"middle of the road\" on guns, believing citizens do indeed have the constitutional right to bear arms , but that the government can (and should) impose certain limitations on that right. (This is the view of both the average American and the average member of the NRA .)\n\nI don't have a legal background and don't claim to be an expert on constitutional interpretations of the Second Amendment , though I suspect the word \"well-regulated\" is in there for a reason. And while I wish the Founding Fathers (or their near descendants) would have had the sense to be a little more specific about the rights of \"the people\" to own and carry instant gratification machines that are also instruments of death-I accept that this is America. We are a gun culture.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nStill, I find gun abolitionists to be living in a fantasy world. You're never going to ban guns in the United States. The country is too big, with too many wildly different cultures, and a federalist system that makes such top-down edicts essentially impossible. Guns outnumber people in this country, and probably always will.\n\nMost Americans who feel strongly about their constitutional right to own guns will not give them up voluntarily, and if you think the government will someday go door-to-door demanding people fork over their weapons, please allow me to remind you of the fact that many Americans believed government workers going door-to-door to offer free, voluntary COVID-19 vaccines was a harbinger of oncoming Stalinism (or Hitlerism). That should disabuse you of the notion that there will ever be a peaceful de-weaponization of the American population.\n\nBut after so many years as a gun policy agnostic, I've been moved by the right's myriad culture war panics to wonder why the same tribes who provide U.S. gun culture with its intellectual and political heft have absolutely nothing to say about America's heritage of gun death?\n\nAngry parents and community members protest after a Loudoun County School Board meeting was halted by the school board because the crowd refused to quiet down. Critical race theory was the topic at hand.\n\nUNITE BE AFRAID OR DIE\n\nThe MAGA flag-humpers, the DeSantis stans, the edgelord libertarians, to name a few-they're all freaked out about something.\n\nIt could be Twitter's pre-Elon Musk content moderation policies-\" Worse than Watergate! \" It could be temporary vaccine mandates in public spaces that mostly ended in 2021-\"You're never going to force me to take the New World Order clot shot! \" And, of course, LGBTQ-themed books and biographies of civil rights figures in school libraries-\"Keep your porn and critical race theory out of our kids' brains, you groomer woke moralists!\"\n\nYet, the roughly 20,000 gun-related deaths in the U.S. last year (if you count suicides, it's more than double that amount) don't move the right's culture war outrage needle. Not one bit.\n\nSure, they'll wax poetic about the dangers of \"Democrat\" cities-the deteriorating public safety of San Francisco, the endless violent crime on the south side of Chicago, and the attacks on a federal building in Portland staged by antifa clowns that happened three years ago. These all still strike fear and loathing in the hearts and minds of Fox News viewers-but not the fact that America holds a unique and shameful place as the Western world's capital of gun violence.\n\nIt's a common mistake to confuse anecdotes with data. But drag story hour videos on Libs of TikTok, breathless talk by cryptic-speaking Joe Rogan guests of a vast conspiracy to hide countless COVID vaccine injuries, and Toni Morrison books in school libraries have all been used as evidence to prove Western civilization is in peril. (Or that Communist China, the World Economic Forum, and Bud Light are all aligned in a conspiracy to turn Americans into self-hating groomers with blood clots.)\n\nSince we've established that anecdotes matter when it's your point to be made , let's briefly note a few uniquely American stories from the past week.\n\nIn a small town in Alabama, 32 people were shot (four killed) at a birthday party. Also last week, in upstate New York, a 20-year-old woman was shot and killed by a 65-year-old man after the car she was in mistakenly turned into his driveway. (Police said it was \"a very rural area with dirt roads,\" poor cell service, and \"easy to get lost.\") And in another case of a \"good guy with a gun\" defending his castle-a 16-year-old boy in Kansas City, looking to pick up his siblings from a friend's house, mixed up the address and was shot in the head by an 84-year-old man after mistakenly knocking on the man's door.\n\nAnd because this is America, the anecdotes can go on and on-like the two cheerleaders shot in Texas for accidentally opening the wrong car door in a parking lot, and the 6-year-old girl and her dad in North Carolina who were shot by a neighbor, reportedly after an errant basketball rolled into his yard.\n\nThat's five different states, in just a few days.\n\nWomen express excitement over handgun merchandise during the Conservative Political Action Conference in Dallas.\n\nGUNS DON'T KILL PEOPLE, TERRIFIED PEOPLE WITH GUNS KILL PEOPLE\n\nAgain, the plural of anecdote is not data. And as the right is wont to note, the vast majority of gun deaths are not in mass shootings, they're killings of the everyday American variety-with handguns.\n\nIt wouldn't be hard to scrape local news sites for even more anecdotal evidence, but there's no need, because the hard data is devastating enough. To cite just one piece of such data, over the past two years gun deaths for people under the age 18 are up 50 percent .\n\nStill, the right-wing fearmongering culture warriors have nothing to say. However, I don't have any doubt that had any one of the aforementioned shootings been committed by an undocumented immigrant or a Muslim fundamentalist, the \"Don't Tread on Me\" right would be calling for the suspension of all kinds of liberties, so precious is even a single American life snuffed out by \"the other.\" And if these deaths had been attributed to COVID vaccines, Joe Rogan's guests would be lining up to demand their Nobel Prizes .\n\nBut when it's Americans killing each other, the enormity of the numbers doesn't resonate. Neither does the evidence that points to a culture of fear being the driving force in a lot of these killings.\n\nThe Daily Beast's Matt Lewis-a gun-owning conservative who lives in West Virginia-last weekend tweeted a story about a time he got lost in North Dakota and had to convince a would-be vigilante posse that he meant no harm when he pulled into the wrong driveway. Here's how The Atlantic 's Derek Thompson described the phenomenon : \"More guns -> more deadly civilian violence -> more total paranoia -> more unjustified shootings -> more paranoia -> more shootings,\" adding, \"Fear, protectiveness, anger, revenge-seeking... these aren't American emotions. They're human emotions, and America has made the decision to arm [people] with deadly machines through which these inevitable emotions can be expressed.\"\n\nThe Daily Beast contributor Nicholas Grossman cited data that showed even with the brief spike in violent crime nationally in 2020, levels are markedly lower than they were at the start of the 2010s, to say nothing of previous decades. Grossman wrote, \"An info environment that calls the bottom of this graph a terrifyingly massive crime wave, lies that cities burned down, lies that prosecutors don't charge, insists we're on the verge of collapse, and tells people they need guns to take matters into their own hands isn't healthy.\"\n\nGun culture is, in many ways, a fear culture.\n\nYOU'LL PRY MY CAR FROM MY COLD DEAD HANDS\n\nAs previously stated, I don't believe gun abolition is possible, or even advisable in a country forever awash in deadly weapons. But anarcho-capitalists and gun fetishists alike both believe in private property, which requires certain protections from the government, which requires obeying laws that infringe on certain freedoms.\n\nFor instance, to operate a car, you need to be licensed by the government, your car must be registered with the government, and you're even obligated to buy insurance for your car.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause you or someone driving your car might kill someone. Therefore, the government requires you to be able to pass the most rudimentary of operating tests and correctly answer a few basic questions about traffic laws. It also requires a record of your car's ownership and compliance with the state's registration requirements-including insurance in the event your car damages people or property.\n\nBut where in the Constitution does it say the gubmint can impose on my right to own and drive a dangerous shitbox? It doesn't. But you comply anyway.\n\nIt's a cliché, but the same basic requirements mandated of vehicular enthusiasts should also be made of gun owners.\n\nWill it immediately solve the scourge of gang crime in the inner city? Will it cut down on suicides-which are dramatically fewer in countries without instant murder machines so readily available? Will drivers who make a wrong turn be less likely to be mowed down by trigger-happy suburbanites?\n\nI don't know. It's possible none of this makes any difference. And I'm very wary of the instinct to \"Do something, anything!\" in the face of a crisis. Such panic-driven policy-making is how you end up with the Patriot Act, or \" Papers, Please \" laws to crack down on undocumented immigrants in Arizona, or do-gooder progressive schools forcing kids to wear masks outdoors in 2023 .\n\nBut this is more than a crisis, it's part of the fabric of American society‚ and it should be a national shame. Yet it's met with a shrug by libertarians who are great at diagnosing societal ills but too often run for cover in culture-war bullshit when asked to propose a solution. And for much of the rest of the right, gun violence is the self-fulfilling prophecy to demand even more guns in more public places -the \" good guy with a gun \" fallacy.\n\nA demonstrator holds a sign referencing calls for legislation to address gun violence outside the U.S. Capitol.\n\nHOLLOW PATRIOTISM\n\nAlong with drag story hours and \"genocidal COVID vaccines,\" the activist right has really been up in arms over America's supposed declining patriotism .\n\nIt's true that there is a loud and prominent subset of the academic and activist left that considers America an irredeemably racist and unjust place, and who inexplicably believe communism will totally work this time around and won't immediately descend into an authoritarian police state.\n\nBut there are a lot of people who think their country is pretty swell, and are grateful to have been born into it, but also don't think of their country as a delicate and jealous lover that needs to be constantly reassured.\n\nIt's OK to be ashamed of your country when it launches wars of choice that are morally indefensible and politically counterproductive. It's OK to be ashamed of your country when it arbitrarily locks up its own citizens during a racist panic. It's OK to be ashamed of your country when a defeated president allies with neo-fascist street gangs to sack the Capitol-and then hours later 147 congressional Republicans cast their votes in favor of the coup attempt.\n\nI consider myself a patriotic American-I pay my taxes and to quote Megadeth's Dave Mustaine , \"I go to court when I have to.\"\n\nBut I'm ashamed of the undue political influence held by gun fetishists whose only answer to our culture of gun violence-be it tied to the inner-city drug trade, hotheads popping off at a party, or panicky homeowners living in terror that the BLM/antifa/fentanyl blob is going to show up at their front door disguised as a teenager looking to pick up his siblings-is for easier access to guns.\n\nThe late comedian Bill Hicks , in 1991, performed a routine about the disparity between gun deaths in the U.S. and the U.K. (where it is rare even for police to carry handguns, and all but unheard of among the public). With savage irony, Hicks surmised: \"There's no connection between having a gun and shooting someone with it, and not having a gun and not shooting someone... and you'd be a fool and a communist to make one.\"\n\nAgain, the data is there. While there are outliers-like heavily progressive Vermont-that have high gun ownership rates and relatively low gun death tolls, for the most part there's an obvious correlation between states where a lot of people own guns and states with a lot of gun deaths .\n\nAs of 2021, Montana ranks highest among states in percentage of armed citizens, and 7th overall in per capita gun death rates. Five other states are in the top 10 on both lists: Wyoming, Alaska, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Alabama. But you'd be a fool and a communist to make any connection between the two.\n\nGuns are more American than baseball, apple pie, and Chevrolet. They're not going anywhere. But what if... hear me out... proponents of gun culture actually demonstrated some patriotism for our bleeding country and some responsibility to our fellow Americans?\n\nIf we're talking data, and not anecdotes, there is no argument that guns are making Americans safer. We'd be better off without them-or at least, a whole lot less of them. But since we're stuck with them forever, and the current methods are not working, maybe we can experiment with something different?\n\nWe're a country of pioneers and innovators, and sometimes we even unite to undo historic wrongs committed by our government. There's no reason we can't look at our culture of irrational fear, tied to our culture of firearm worship, and say, \"Let's do just a little better than this.\"\n\nSenior Opinion Editor\n\nAnthony.Fisher@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Trump Proudly Brags That He 'Did Nothing' About Guns\n\nFormer President Donald Trump boasted to a gathering of National Rifle Association members Friday in Pennsylvania that his administration \"did nothing\" about guns.\n\nAfter stoking fears that the current president wants to \"confiscate your guns and annihilate your God-given right to self-defense,\" Trump recapped how he handled calls for stricter gun legislation.\n\n\"During my four years, nothing happened!\" he bellowed. \"And there was great pressure on me having to do with guns. We did nothing. We didn't yield. And once you yield a little bit, that's just the beginning. That's [when] the avalanche begins.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDuring Trump's presidency, notable mass shootings occurred in Las Vegas in 2017, Sutherland Springs, Texas the following month, and at Florida's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February 2018 , after which Trump couldn't help but send out a tweet mashing together his comments on the shooting and unrelated, political complaints about the FBI.\n\nSubsequent shootings occurred at a Santa Fe, Texas high school, a Pittsburgh synagogue , a Thousand Oaks, California bar, an El Paso, Texas Walmart in 2019, and outside a Dayton, Ohio bar that same month.\n\nDespite Trump's assertion to a receptive audience that his administration \"did nothing\" to restrict gun laws, the record shows otherwise. He did, for instance, ban bump stocks after the devices were used by the Las Vegas shooter to fire multiple rounds at once.\n\nYet the majority of Trump's actions as chief executive indeed went the other route, like reversing an Obama-era policy of background checks for those with mental illnesses. In late 2019, after pressure from the NRA and with a former gun lobbyist as his deputy assistant, he reneged on prior plans to combat gun violence.\n\nSince leaving office, Trump has continued along those lines, having suggested -at an NRA convention in 2022 after the Uvalde, Texas school shooting -that arming teachers is the way to go.\n\nOn stage Friday, Trump all but demanded the NRA endorse his presidential bid.\n\n\"They better endorse me,\" he said, promising that \"no one will ever lay a finger on your firearms\" if he's re-elected.\n\nThe NRA, with whom Trump said he has a \"great relationship,\" did so in 2016 and 2020 , and considering his unabashed gun-friendly rhetoric Friday night, it seems a safe bet that they will again.\n\nwilliam.vaillancourt@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Dumb About Guns? An Ex-Marine Answers Your Questions\n\n1. What's a semiautomatic weapon?\n\nA semiautomatic weapon fires one shot every time the trigger is pulled until the magazine is empty.\n\nAR-15s are \"gas operated\" -- the original design used \"direct impingement\" or \"direct gas impingement\" - a vent in the barrel funnels gas from the shot fired back through a tube, which pushes the bolt carrier group to the rear of the weapon, where it impacts the buffer, and is then sent forward, reloading another round.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAK-47s are gas operated as well, but use a long- stroke piston. The long- stroke piston is the reason for AK-47's reliability, but poor accuracy. Some new ARs use a short- stroke piston. Short- stroke pistons are cleaner, but slightly heavier.\n\nPistols use a different mechanism to achieve semi-automatic fire. They are usually either recoil, operated for higher- power calibers, or blowback, operated for less powerful calibers.\n\n2. What's an automatic weapon?\n\nAn automatic weapon fires continually until the trigger is released.\n\n3. Automatic weapons are in fact illegal, is that right?\n\nSome are. There are specific restrictions, but lots of wiggle room. In order to own an automatic weapon in the US, you must have a Federal Firearms License (FFL).\n\n4. So what is it about the AR-15 that these people love?\n\nThe ArmaLite AR-15 was designed to be a lightweight assault rifle and to fire a new high-velocity, lightweight, small-caliber cartridge to allow the infantrymen to carry more ammunition. It was developed to keep up with the Soviet AK-47, used by the North Vietnamese forces in jungle fighting in Vietnam. The rifle, when first produced, was not available for civilian use. It was designed and purpose-built to kill as many people as possible as quickly and efficiently as possible. The U.S. military purchased it in 1962 and designated it the M-16. It became standard issue for troops serving in Vietnam.\n\nInitially, it was sold to law enforcement and a few civilians who saw themselves as \"survivalists.\" It became popular with civilian shooters after the 1989 Stockton mass murder (the perpetrator killed five children at an elementary school). Manufacturers of the AR-15 used aggressive marketing tactics to sell the weapon to the public and sales soared.\n\nMany people like the AR-15 because it is very accurate, has very little recoil, and shoots high-velocity .223 bullets that hit with three times the energy of a 9mm pistol round and cause massive trauma to flesh.\n\n5. What are some other guns like the AR-15?\n\nThe AK-47, SKS, Ruger Mini-14...basically any semi-automatic rifle with high-capacity, detachable magazines.\n\n6. Were these banned under the assault weapons ban?\n\nSome. See Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act, H.R.3355, 103rd Congress (1993-1994) , Government Printing Office. Retrieved January 26, 2013.\n\nThe criteria for what constituted an assault weapon under the ban was s Semi-automatic rifles able to accept detachable magazines, with two or more of the following characteristics:\n\nAlso, s emi-automatic pistols with detachable magazines and two or more of the following:\n\nSemi-automatic shotguns with two or more of the following:\n\nThe ban defined these semi-automatic firearms, as well as any copies or duplicates of them in any caliber, as assault weapons . Some weapons were created to specifically bypass the restrictions of the ban.\n\n7. So these weapons were invented solely to be used by soldiers to kill other soldiers. Is that basically true?\n\nYes. These weapons were specifically engineered for the hunting of enemy soldiers on the battlefield and purpose-built to kill as many people as possible as quickly as possible. Any gunfight involves three elements: speed, power, and accuracy. The AR-15 has very low recoil, which maximizes target re-acquisition after firing a shot. It has detachable high-capacity magazines that enable faster reloading, thus getting the weapon back into action faster for a longer period of time between reloads. And as noted above, it fires a high-velocity .223 bullet that hits with three times the force of a 9mm pistol bullet. The bullet is designed to tumble and spin through the human body causing grievous wounds accompanied by a cavitation effect that damages or destroys tissue surrounding the bullet's path.\n\n8. And how can a person convert a semiautomatic to an automatic? Is it really easy?\n\nThere are kits that change the trigger assembly. There are also accessories like bump stocks, crank triggers, etc. Once you get one of these accessories, yes, it is very easy to convert the weapon. Obtaining the accessories is easy as well, as they are not subject to much regulation, and are generally very affordable (Slide Fire stocks range from $150-400).\n\n9. And why would someone do that, and would it make a difference in these mass-shooting situations?\n\nThese modifications enable near-automatic rates of fire. Some shooters think that it is fun to blaze away at the range. That's primarily how these accessories are marketed.\n\nMass shooters use these modifications to kill people more quickly. For instance, in Las Vegas, the killer was able to kill and injure as many people as the U.S. Marines and Army absorbed in two months of sustained urban combat in the Second Battle of Fallujah in Iraq in 2004. We are now seeing battlefield-level casualties on the streets of America.\n\nWhile automatic shooting may be fun at the range, and it enabled the Las Vegas shooter to shoot rounds very quickly, professionals almost never use automatic fire when employing assault rifles, although military models do contain select fire options.\n\n10. And what exactly do bump stocks do? And why was the Vegas shooter the first well-known mass shooter to use one-that is, why don't all these people use them, if their goal is to kill quickly and indiscriminately?\n\nThey use the natural recoil of the rifle to depress the trigger faster and easier. According to the manufacturers, they are designed to \"use natural recoil to ...fire multiple shots in succession... safely and accurately.\" (Slide Fire). It's marketed for range shooting most often. Their purpose is to simulate an automatic weapon's rate of fire.\n\nWhile the bump stock allowed the Las Vegas shooter to shoot a high number of rounds in a short period of time, it is important to note that bump stocks render a weapon hideously inaccurate - even more inaccurate than modifications to the trigger assembly that allow for automatic fire, because bump stocks utilize the \"bump\" of the recoil to achieve automatic fire. Professionals almost never use automatic fire with assault rifles. A military unit that require automatic fire uses much heavier machine guns, with longer barrels, shot from a prone position, typically with the use of a bipod or tripod.\n\n11. Now let's talk about ammunition. First of all, a \"round\" is one bullet, right?\n\nA round is a single piece of ammunition comprised of a bullet (projectile), casing (usually brass), gunpowder (in the casing), and a primer (that is struck by a firing pin and ignites the powder).\n\n12.And what's a cartridge?\n\nA cartridge is a round.\n\n13. Okay. What's a magazine?\n\nA magazine is essentially a metal or plastic box that mates with a weapon that is used to store rounds for firing. It is most often spring-loaded to move rounds into the chamber during firing.\n\n14. How many rounds does it hold?\n\nIt varies. Drums that coil rounds in a belt-fed fashion can hold 100-plus. Standard issue military magazines hold 30. Handguns are almost always based on size of the rounds and size of the grip (how much can the manufacturer fit in the space available). Larger magazines are sold aftermarket that will extend the grip to hold sometimes three times the ammo of the stock. California regulates magazines to hold 10 rounds max.\n\n15. What's involved in changing a magazine? How long does it take? And is it hot to the touch?\n\nPress the magazine release, allow the empty magazine to fall or retain it in the non-firing hand, and replace it with a filled magazine. Experiences shooters can do this in mere seconds. The empty magazine is not hot to the touch.\n\n16. We read that these people fired off 700, 800 rounds sometimes. Out of context, that sounds mind-boggling. Is it?\n\nThe cyclic rate for an M-16A2 or A4 or AR-15 is 800 rounds per minute. The restriction with an assault rifle is not how fast you can fire-it is how many rounds/magazines you can carry. The standard load out for a Marine would be six magazines, normally only loaded with 25 or 28 rounds, to protect the spring, for a total of 150-168 rounds.\n\n17. When a recreational shooter takes a semiautomatic rifle to a shooting range, how many rounds will he fire off in half an hour?\n\nIt depends on the rate of fire. See here for M-16A2 and A4 rates of fire. As a Marine Corps Combat Marksmanship Coach, I know that a rifle qualification consists of four days. The qualification involves 50 rounds. Training days, shooters will shoot 70 rounds over the course of a couple of hours. During close-quarters combat marksmanship training, a \"string\" or \"course of fire\" might consist of 100-150 rounds, fired in drills of two-to-eight rounds. A course of fire might take 15 minutes to a half hour.\n\n18. Now talk about hunting rifles. What are some popular rifles a person would take into the woods to kill a deer?\n\nFirst off, you wouldn't use an AR-15 for deer. The .223 bullet tumbles too much and destroys too much meat. Also, it isn't large enough to ensure a single-shot kill - which is the object of all ethical hunters. Almost all deer rifles are bolt-action rifles that fire one shot at a time. Examples would be: the Remington 783, the Mossberg Patriot, the Weatherby Mark V.\n\n19. Are these all single-bolt action rifles?\n\nYes.\n\n20. And that means one shot at a time, basically?\n\nYes.\n\n21. Do some people actually use semiautomatic weapons to hunt game?\n\nYes. Some folks use AR-15s to hunt nuisance animals, predators, or varmint such as hogs, or coyotes - when there is less concern with a quick kill, or preserving meat, or, in the case of invasive hog species, when a property owner may be trying to kill a large number of hogs at once.\n\n22. And how about a really quick primer on bullet calibers?\n\nMost deer rifles are chambered for .30 caliber rounds and larger, although there are smaller rounds, such as the Winchester .270. The range usually tops out around a .308 Winchester round. Of course, every deer hunter has his or her favorite rounds and they will argue endlessly about which is best.\n\nIn the tactical community, arguments over caliber are a constant debate. Shooters will talk about \"stopping power,\" kinetic energy transfer, terminal ballistics, bullet drop, penetrability, max effective range. What is important about the 5.56mm round of the AR-15 is the \"small caliber high velocity\" concept-a round that can penetrate, but is small enough that it does cause very much recoil, allowing the accurate placement of rapid follow on shots.\n\n23. Okay, let's move to handguns. These, too, come in single-shot, semiautomatic, and automatic varieties?\n\nWhile there are some single-shot pistols, handguns mostly come in two types: revolvers and semi-automatics. Revolvers come in single-action and double-action. Single action is when you have to cock the hammer with your thumb before you can pull the trigger. Double action is when the trigger pull cocks the hammer and releases it to strike the bullet primer.\n\n24. And are automatic ones banned?\n\nThere are automatic pistols, but they are very rare due to their inaccuracy. They require a FFL license.\n\n25. No one hunts with a handgun, do they?\n\nYes. Many people hunt with handguns. Typically these are revolvers, and many people use scopes on them as well. The bigger the animal, the bigger the handgun used. The really big ones, like the .454 Causll and the Ruger .480 are not fun to shoot due to the extreme recoil. The Smith and Wesson .500 pistol round is truly awful to shoot.\n\nSome hunters will carry pistols as self-defense weapons as well.\n\n26. What are the legitimate reasons someone would own one?\n\nAs stated above, some hunters do use a handgun. It may seem odd, but like bow hunting, handgun hunting offers its own unique challenges that appeal to some hunters. Hunters may also carry a pistol as a personal defense weapon - against possibly aggressive animals, such as bear, or moose. Finally, while the merits of owning a gun for self-defense in populated areas may be debated by both sides, it is certainly difficult to begrudge folks who live in very remote areas, such as Alaska, who may own pistols for personal protection and self-defense.\n\n27. We all know that it takes all kinds of people to make the world go round, but: Can you explain the thrill or joy of shooting a gun?\n\nTarget shooting can be fun. Like at a golf driving range, or batting cage, it's a challenge to shoot accurately. It's more challenging to shoot accurately and quickly. And it's supremely challenging to shoot accurately and quickly while moving. There is also a social aspect to a shooting range or gun club. Many of the people there are normal, well-adjusted humans. In many ways it is the same as any skill-sport. There's the challenge of doing it well, and joy when it happens.\n\nAs for myself, while I shot occasionally growing up, we did not own guns in my household. I shot as part of Boy Scouts, or the rifle team briefly in my high school. But I fell in love with tactics and marksmanship when I joined the Marine Corps. There is a terrible beauty to a squad of infantry Marines moving in coordinated precision through a field, or through a house, clearing rooms.\n\nMarksmanship, like martial arts, is a physical endeavor. A gun has weight to it. The noise of a burst raises the adrenaline. Your senses can heighten, and your muscles tighten to absorb the shock of recoil when in an aggressive shooting stance. I've run gun drills with no ammunition until my hands bled, and shot until I was sore from recoil and holding the weapon, my flak jacket soaked through with sweat. There is a satisfaction in that kind of weariness, like after a gym session or a run.\n\nMarksmanship requires practice, discipline, patience, skill. It is a rewarding and challenging endeavor, even more so when practiced as part of a team or squad.\n\n28. What are some dumb, uninformed things you've heard gun-control advocates say in gun debates?\n\nNothing rankles a gun owner more than someone unfamiliar with guns making claims about weapons that are untrue, or misidentifying parts of a weapon. It is a magazine - not a clip. An assault rifle is not a \"machine gun\" - a machine gun is a much heavier weapon, meant to be implemented by a crew of 2-3, designed for automatic fire.\n\nOn the flip side, I'm often horrified by the weapons-handling of civilian gun owners - I've been \"flagged\" (when the line of the muzzle crosses my body) countless times by folks claiming to be safe and responsible gun owners. \"But it's not loaded\" they might insist. In the military we treat every weapon as it if were loaded. Also, keep your damn finger straight and off the trigger until you intend to fire.\n\nNot all gun owners are gun-hugging, Bible-thumping nut jobs.\n\nNot all gun reform advocates want to seize all your weapons.\n\nMy personal pet peeve is Hollywood myth - guns don't go \"click\" when they are empty. The bolt of the rifle, or the slide of the pistol, will lock to the rear.\n\nThis may seem like a small gripe, but assault rifles, pistols, shotguns - these are tools in the hands of military and law enforcement professionals. We treat them without passion or prejudice. As stated in the Marine Corps rifleman's creed: \"We seek to master [them], as we master [ourselves.]\" We try to employ them to achieve the desired effect on target, as safely, efficiently, and professionally as possible. This means dedication to training with, handling, and firing these weapons. In order to talk about guns, we have to sweep aside myths, allusions, passion, and look at them for what they are. Misunderstandings on both sides have to be corrected - even something as simple as a \"click.\"\n\nPeter Lucier is a Marine veteran and a student at Montana State University.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Dumb About Guns? An Ex-Marine Answers Your Questions\n\n1. What's a semiautomatic weapon?\n\nA semiautomatic weapon fires one shot every time the trigger is pulled until the magazine is empty.\n\nAR-15s are \"gas operated\" -- the original design used \"direct impingement\" or \"direct gas impingement\" - a vent in the barrel funnels gas from the shot fired back through a tube, which pushes the bolt carrier group to the rear of the weapon, where it impacts the buffer, and is then sent forward, reloading another round.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAK-47s are gas operated as well, but use a long- stroke piston. The long- stroke piston is the reason for AK-47's reliability, but poor accuracy. Some new ARs use a short- stroke piston. Short- stroke pistons are cleaner, but slightly heavier.\n\nPistols use a different mechanism to achieve semi-automatic fire. They are usually either recoil, operated for higher- power calibers, or blowback, operated for less powerful calibers.\n\n2. What's an automatic weapon?\n\nAn automatic weapon fires continually until the trigger is released.\n\n3. Automatic weapons are in fact illegal, is that right?\n\nSome are. There are specific restrictions, but lots of wiggle room. In order to own an automatic weapon in the US, you must have a Federal Firearms License (FFL).\n\n4. So what is it about the AR-15 that these people love?\n\nThe ArmaLite AR-15 was designed to be a lightweight assault rifle and to fire a new high-velocity, lightweight, small-caliber cartridge to allow the infantrymen to carry more ammunition. It was developed to keep up with the Soviet AK-47, used by the North Vietnamese forces in jungle fighting in Vietnam. The rifle, when first produced, was not available for civilian use. It was designed and purpose-built to kill as many people as possible as quickly and efficiently as possible. The U.S. military purchased it in 1962 and designated it the M-16. It became standard issue for troops serving in Vietnam.\n\nInitially, it was sold to law enforcement and a few civilians who saw themselves as \"survivalists.\" It became popular with civilian shooters after the 1989 Stockton mass murder (the perpetrator killed five children at an elementary school). Manufacturers of the AR-15 used aggressive marketing tactics to sell the weapon to the public and sales soared.\n\nMany people like the AR-15 because it is very accurate, has very little recoil, and shoots high-velocity .223 bullets that hit with three times the energy of a 9mm pistol round and cause massive trauma to flesh.\n\n5. What are some other guns like the AR-15?\n\nThe AK-47, SKS, Ruger Mini-14...basically any semi-automatic rifle with high-capacity, detachable magazines.\n\n6. Were these banned under the assault weapons ban?\n\nSome. See Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act, H.R.3355, 103rd Congress (1993-1994) , Government Printing Office.

Ted Deutch (D-FL) is seeking to bankroll with the proposed Buyback our Safety Act. The Arizona Daily Star notes that City Councilman Steven Kozachik of Tucson had a run-in with state law when he held a buyback in 2013, collecting thousands of weapons in a police station parking lot in exchange for $50 certificates to a grocery store. The Arizona state legislature immediately passed a measure stating that any weapons acquired in such programs had to then be sold to a dealer rather than be destroyed.\n\nKentucky has similar statutes, as Louisville investor Steve Bass discovered when he proposed a gun buyback program there in 2012. Louisville Insight reported that he was informed it would be a violation of state law.\n\n\"I wanted to do something; you can't, it's the law,\" Bass told The Daily Beast on Wednesday. \"It's craziness.\"\n\nHe reported that gun violence in Louisville has only grown worse in recent  months, following COVID-19 as another kind of  public health threat.\n\n\"We're having a total epidemic,\" he said.\n\nAs of June, Louisville reported 90 homicides this year, up from 53 during the same period in 2020.\n\nAnd unless the serial number is defaced, even murder weapons in Kentucky are auctioned to gun dealers once they are no longer needed as evidence. The loved ones of the victim in a gun homicide where the weapon is recovered and the killer is convicted are left with the knowledge that the gun is again out there. A cops who risks all to recover a gun cannot seek comfort in thinking that it will not endanger anybody ever again.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kentucky State Police (KSP) are holding a virtual \"Confiscated Gun Sale\" on July 12. The website notes:\n\n\"DUE TO COVID-19 (CORONA VIRUS) CONCERN: THE WEAPONS AUCTION FOR JULY 12, 2021 WILL BE CONDUCTED IN A VIRTUAL BID FORMAT.\"\n\nThe \"July 12 KSP Firearms Auction List\" shows that 1,008 guns will be available to the highest bidder. And because the great majority of the weapons figured in a crime, the list affords some insight into which instruments of  death are favored by law breakers. Glock 9mm semi-automatic pistols appear to be the most popular.\n\nAlong with the list, the website offers a 16-minute video preview of the auction offerings.\n\n\"Hello, this is the July 2021 Kentucky State Police Firearms Auction,\" Keith Cox of the KSP Supply Branch says. \"I'm going to walk through and let you look at some of these guns. Anyway, here we go.\"\n\nThe guns are hanging by their trigger guards in rows on long metal rods. The camera goes with him as he walks up one side of a row and down the other, the muzzles all pointing away from the lens, then directly into it. No doubt innocents who have had one of these guns pointed at them will forever remember that black round hole at the end of the barrel. Some victims will never see anything else. And because the bidders are all licensed dealers, they will then look to sell any purchase as did a dealer who bought a revolver at an auction in 2014 that a teenager subsequently used to stick up a Domino's Pizza. It was auctioned again in 2018 for $50.\n\nIn the video, Keith now pauses by a large semi-automatic pistol.\n\n\"There's a big guy there,\" he says.\n\nHe then examines another weapon with a paper tag marked 402, which corresponds to an IAI (Israel Aerospace Industries) 10mm pistol on the list.\n\n\"That's an Israeli gun,\" Keith says. \"Kind of a unique gun.\"\n\nHe continues on to the cheap Saturday night specials, which were the top sellers in America prior to the advent of the pricey semi-automatics such as the Glocks.\n\n\"You pretty much know what you're going to get there,\" he says. \"You can see there's certainly nothing spectacular about anything in here. However there's some affordable guns for folks that don't want to spend a lot of money... You know the drill.\"\n\nHe continues on to the long guns, which included a number of assault rifles.\n\n\"Remember, that the guns are sold as is,\" he says. \"You are bidding on used guns. None of these would be considered new. So take that into account.\"\n\nHe adds in summation, \"Nothing special that I can see that really stands out... Average bunch of guns.\"\n\nThe Tucson Police Department destroyed the guns it recovered until it was ordered to stop by the Arizona Supreme Court in 2017. The court also ruled that if the department held a buyback, it could not destroy any guns it collected, as is the practice in all such programs. The court said those guns also had to be sold to dealers.\n\nIn April, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey signed a new \"Second Amendment Sanctuary City Law,\" ordering local governments to ignore federal gun regulations in favor of state provisions. Tucson Mayor Regina Romero and the city council responded on June 22 with a resolution pledging to continue observing federal gun laws.\n\nBut the state Supreme Court ruling on sales still stands, and to that end Tucson police now use Sierra Auction to sell guns. Sierra also has a big firearms auction on July 12, including two Glock 23s with extended magazines. That is the gun that was used  to shoot former Arizona U.S. Rep Gabby Giffords and 18 others just outside Tucson in 2007.\n\nThe early online bidding on the Glocks has started at $210 and $160.\n\nSpecial Correspondent\n\nmichael.daly@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

Vance (R-OH), formally accepting the GOP's vice presidential nomination on Wednesday, received a loud cheer from the crowd at the Republican National Convention after he relayed a story about his gun-loving grandmother.\n\nThe account came just days after Donald Trump was shot in the ear by an attempted assassin. The former president, sitting in the audience, listened as Vance retold the tale of his \"Mamaw.\"\n\n\"When Mamaw died shortly before I left for Iraq in 2005, and when we went through her things, we found 19 loaded handguns,\" the former Marine said, drawing sustained laughter from many observers in the convention hall.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"The thing is, they were stashed all over her house-under her bed, in her closet, in the silverware drawer, and we wondered what was going on,\" Vance continued. \"It occurred to us that towards the end of her life, Mamaw couldn't get around so well, so she was sure that no matter where she was, she was within arm's length of whatever she needed to protect her family. That's who we fight for. That's the American spirit.\"\n\nVance used a portion of his speech-surely his most widely viewed appearance in the national spotlight to date-to provide background about his upbringing, which included being raised in part by his grandmother in a rural town in Ohio.\n\nVance also described his undergraduate education at Ohio State University, and after cheers from Ohio delegates, joked that that could cost the Republican ticket in the battleground state of Michigan.\n\n\"We've gotta chill with the Ohio love. We've gotta win Michigan too,\" Vance said early on.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Michigan, I had to get that in there,\" he said later after mentioning his alma mater, acknowledging again the rivalry between OSU and the University of Michigan.\n\nAfter delegates from Michigan countered by chanting \"Let's go Blue,\" Vance joked: \"We've had enough political violence.\"\n\nwilliam.vaillancourt@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Yes, They Want to Take Your Guns Away\n\nThirty thousand people are killed by firearms each year in the United States, an astronomically high figure for a developed Western country not in a state of civil war.\n\nPresident Obama reminds Americans of this sad statistic with depressing regularity, and he did so again last month after a mass shooting in Oregon took the lives of nine people. \"We know there are ways to prevent it,\" the president said.\n\nWe do indeed know there are \"ways\" to stop gun violence in the United States, yet we adamantly refuse to name them. The perennial \"national conversation\" about guns is predictably stale because its contestants-those favoring a largely unfettered right to personal gun ownership and those opposing it-are talking past each other. Prevarication characterizes the debate, as each side adheres to a core principle that, for reasons of propriety and political calculation, it is unwilling to admit publicly.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor the gun-control side, the unspoken belief is that nothing short of all out confiscation will have an appreciable effect on decreasing gun deaths. Then again, it's not that unspoken-gun-control advocates just prefer tergiversation to clarity. Democratic candidates, officeholders, and liberal websites frequently invoke the example of Australia, for example. After a 1996 shooting rampage killed 35 people, the Australian government outlawed an array of firearms and instituted a compulsory buyback program that effectively eliminated private gun ownership. Since then, gun violence has dropped precipitously.\n\nRarely in American gun-control advocates' references to the Australian policy, however, do they acknowledge that the program amounted to confiscation. \"When Australia had a mass killing-I think it was in Tasmania-about 25 years ago, it was just so shocking, the entire country said, 'Well, we're going to completely change our gun laws,' and they did,\" Obama said after a June shooting in a Charleston church killed nine people. Curiously, the president omitted just what \"change\" the people of Australia decided to implement.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton told an audience in New Hampshire last month that \"Australia is a good example\" of gun-control laws, so much so that it \"would be worth considering\" the Antipodean solution here in the United States. She, too, neglected to mention the obligatory nature of the gun buyback scheme.\n\nThe following week, after having explicitly praised gun confiscation, however, she mocked the National Rifle Association for supposedly scaring its members into thinking that \"they're the only thing that's going to stop the black helicopters from landing in the front yard and people's guns being seized.\"\n\nHolding up Australia as a model of sensible gun policy without mentioning how that government forced its citizens to turn over their weapons is like praising Chinese population-control efforts without mentioning the one-child policy.\n\nThese advocates of gun control note the efficacy of the confiscations they only hint at while sidestepping the fact that none of the restrictive measures they explicitly endorse-banning so-called assault weapons, limiting the size of magazines, or requiring background checks on the private transfer of firearms-would have prevented these mass shootings, committed as they were by individuals using legally obtained firearms that did not fall under the definition of \"assault weapon.\"\n\nThat the perpetrators violate a host of well-intentioned laws, like bringing a weapon onto a \"gun-free zone,\" just goes to show how difficult it is to eliminate such crimes when people are determined to inflict harm in a society so permeated with guns.\n\nBut if it would seem that confiscation on a massive scale is the only way to solve American gun violence, why don't we talk about it more?\n\nTo understand why, we must first recognize the incompatible nature of the values at stake. Those advocating for stricter gun laws believe that the harm produced by private gun possession outweighs whatever benefits it entails.\n\nWriting in the aftermath of the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, certainly the most horrific in recent American history, Gary Wills likened this country's enthrallment to guns as the equivalent of a perpetual human offering to the biblical Moloch, \"the sacrifice we as a culture made, and continually make, to our demonic god.\" America's decades-long debate over guns boils down to this: Gun-rights advocates are willing to make that sacrifice for their right to bear arms; gun-control advocates think it's too high a price.\n\nWhich leads to the second unspoken truth of America's gun debate, that held by the pro-gun side: Americans should be willing to tolerate tens of thousands of gun deaths per year as the cost of the inalienable right, as enumerated in the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, to bear arms.\n\n\"Guns don't kill people; people kill people,\" goes the proverbial pro-gun mantra. That is, of course, true, but a whole lot fewer people would be killed in the United States were there not some 350 million guns-more than one for every man, woman, and child)-in private circulation. (Stabbings, for instance, are eight times less likely to kill than a gunshot wound.)\n\nWhat gun-rights advocates necessarily believe but choose not to say is that the right to bear arms takes precedence over the negative externalities of ensuring that right. This attitude toward the Second Amendment follows from a similar, more widely accepted understating of the freedom granted by the First Amendment. Just as we must tolerate the airing of all sorts of unpopular opinions as the consequence of unfettered free speech, so is gun crime the inevitable cost of living in a free society.\n\nFurthering the analogy, mass shootings, in the eyes of most gun owners, are akin to pornography, or public demonstrations by the Ku Klux Klan: the unwanted side effects of living in a country that maximizes individual liberty more than any other on Earth. Americans' relationship to guns, in this view, is not unlike our use of technologies that cause pollution. No serious person would advocate eliminating cars and airplanes because they sully the earth, so why would we ban guns simply because they're occasionally used in ways we don't approve of?\n\nLikening tragedies such as Sandy Hook to the hurt feelings caused by hateful speech or air pollution-the unpleasant but hardly overwhelming detritus of freedom-would strike many people as insensitive. That is why you don't hear supporters of gun rights make such comparisons. Instead, they propose measures other than restrictions on gun ownership, like firearm safety training and increased resources for mental-health services.\n\nBut like the policies endorsed by gun-control advocates that fall short of confiscation, so too are these measures mere Band-Aids to what is the inevitable result of the Second Amendment. And just as the political exigencies of acknowledging the societal price imposed by that amendment are too stark for its devotees to make, so too do gun-control advocates resist stating their fundamental opposition to this constitutional right. That's because the prospect of confiscation-as much as it might, theoretically, reduce drastically or even eliminate gun crime altogether-is simply impossible in the United States.\n\nOn a practical level, Australia, that paragon of successful gun control, confiscated just 650,000 guns, an infinitesimally small amount compared to the number of weapons in the U.S.\n\nA more fundamental obstacle to successful confiscation, however, is Americans' reverence for gun rights. This devotion-aptly illustrated by the not insubstantial public support expressed for presidential candidate Ben Carson's insistence that Hitler's extermination of German Jews \"would have been greatly diminished\" had the Nazi leader not disarmed them first-would never permit anything remotely resembling the wide-scale seizure of privately owned firearms.\n\nSecond Amendment enthusiasts are fond of arguing that gun rights are enshrined in the Constitution not only for the sake of hunters or people who want to protect their homes and businesses from criminals, but also to allow the population to resist an overreaching government. If federal agents came to round up firearms, many gun owners would be prepared to shoot back. Clinton can joke all she likes about Americans fearing \"black helicopters\" taking their guns away, but it is no exaggeration to suggest that civil war could erupt on American soil were the U.S. government to attempt anything remotely resembling what was done in Australia.\n\nAnd so Americans are condemned to engage endlessly in futile argument-futile thanks to the legal enshrinement of private gun ownership in our founding document, as well as to a refusal to state clearly our mutually exclusive convictions: that the intrinsic cost of this right is tens of thousands of unwanted deaths and that the only way to stop these deaths is outright gun confiscation.\n\nPerhaps, in a perfect world, the United States would never have had the Second Amendment. But such a country-one not forged in armed revolution against arbitrary rule from afar and founded upon the principle of individual liberty-would not be the United States, with all its virtues and vices. For Americans like myself with no attachment to guns but who respect the vast majority of responsible gun owners who exercise their right to own them, one can only observe gun violence, and the debate surrounding it, with a sense of dreary resignation.\n\njameskirchick@gmail.com\n\nGot a tip?

I'm Amy Goodman. We're broadcasting from Milwaukee, from the Republican National Convention.\n\nSaturday's shooting of Donald Trump is being widely viewed as the Secret Service's biggest failure since 1981, when a gunman shot President Ronald Reagan just over two months after Reagan's presidency began. Reagan was hospitalized for nearly two weeks. Three other people were injured, including Reagan's press secretary James Brady, who was shot in the head and left partially paralyzed.\n\nBrady and his wife Sarah would go on to become prominent gun control advocates pushing for a bill that became known as the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. Brady was also involved in a gun control organization that changed its name to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. It's now known simply as Brady.\n\nTo talk more about Saturday's shooting at the Trump rally, the attempted assassination of the former president and the current presidential candidate Trump, we're going to Washington, D.C., where we're joined by Kris Brown, the president of Brady.\n\nKris, first, your response to what happened on Saturday? You have this young 20-year-old with some AR-15-type rifle climbing this building and opening fire on the Trump rally, grazing the former president over his right ear, ultimately killing a spectator. Two are critically wounded. He was immediately shot dead by Secret Service. Kris, your response?\n\nKRIS BROWN : Well, like John and, I'm sure, Americans across this country, my reaction is one of horror. Even though, to be honest, Amy, we know that gun violence is omnipresent, we do expect higher scrutiny and a security apparatus to ensure the safety of our candidates. But it's not perfect. And in a nation awash in firearms, in firearms that are assault-style weapons, which the reports indicate was the kind of weapon that this shooter used, designed for the battlefield, it's not a stretch to understand that there is that kind of potential risk that exists.\n\nAnd it's a horrific element of American life that we, as Brady, want to ensure is no longer the reality. And there are very simple, commonsense things that we can do to reduce and, indeed, virtually eliminate this kind of risk from American life. And politicians seeking office have very different perspectives about that very thing, as you covered even in the focus on the kinds of weapons that you can carry around the convention. You can't carry a water bottle, but you can carry a firearm. There's a deep inconsistency here in American life that needs to be tackled. Just as Jim and Sarah Brady devoted their lives to commonsense gun laws, there's a lot more work we have to do here.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, I mean, you just heard John Nichols describe the rules here in Milwaukee -\n\nKRIS BROWN : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : - right outside the convention center. Hard water -\n\nKRIS BROWN : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : - bottles, no. Tennis balls, no. Guns, yes. And even when the governor attempted to modify this, the state said no.\n\nKRIS BROWN : Yeah. Well, that's an increasing trend across the country. And I will note, certainly, my thoughts and prayers go to former President Donald Trump, associated with this horrific shooting.\n\nThe reality, when he was president, is he tried to make what's called concealed carry reciprocity - lots of fancy words for a basic premise that every single kind of local law about who could be permitted to carry a gun in public would have been overturned. So, the idea of local rule to protect the safety of citizens by local politicians, that would have been completely upended.\n\nAnd let's just be very clear: When Trump was president, a major focus of his presidency, largely thwarted by organizations like Brady, was guns everywhere, for anyone, at any time. We know an America awash in guns, an America where individuals are carrying firearms in public, in public places, means that it's much more likely that those firearms are used in the subjective view of an individual to protect themselves. But the criteria for when and how that happens is up to the individual. And so, we will see in that kind of America much more violence, much more actions just like this. And that's what's deeply concerning to people like me, Americans across this country with children, and hopefully grandchildren, living in a world where reasonable and appropriate gun violence prevention measures save lives. And too often we're going on the brink of stopping that America from happening, creating a much more dangerous, highly charged, politically fraught environment in which to attempt to advance democracy.\n\nAnd democracy and gun violence don't fit together. As you have noted, we have lost presidents, obviously. It's not just that, Amy. It's also the people who stand by and come in a democracy to participate in it - that is the quintessence of democracy - someone like Jim Brady who serves a president. So, it's not just the individual, the candidate, who is the target of these kinds of attacks. It's all of the innocent bystanders who are effectively essential to a participatory democracy. And we have to internalize that, as well.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, Kris, you know, I don't know how many people realize that the press room that we watch at the White House is actually called the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, where all of -\n\nKRIS BROWN : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : - the journalists at the White House question President Biden, his press secretary, etc. Can you talk about the radically different approaches to guns of President Biden and President Trump? What are their policies? What was Trump's when he was president? What has Biden called for in the past? What has he been prevented from doing now? I mean, essentially, isn't he one of the people for the weapons ban that was in place in the Senate for so many years?\n\nKRIS BROWN : So much, Amy, and it's hard to encapsulate in a few minutes, but the easiest way to synthesize this is it's night and day, literally.\n\nOne of the top priorities for former President Trump was to overturn a lot of the most basic gun violence prevention laws that had been in effect for years and years and years. So, when he first assumed the role of president after being sworn in, through an arcane law called the Congressional Review Act, he overturned an Obama rule that would have ensured a process to remove firearms temporarily from veterans who are at risk of harming themselves or others. That was his top priority. And he used a tool that had almost never been used in history to overturn that rule, that had been the subject of review and discussion and public comment in support of the rule for years before it was finalized.\n\nHe went on then to introduce two different pieces of legislation, neither of which ultimately passed, because groups like ours opposed it. So much information came out. The first was concealed carry reciprocity, which is a very fancy way to say permitting systems across this country, adopted by state and local governments, people like Tony Evers saying, \"This is the kind of permitting system that we want to have, heightened scrutiny about who gets to carry guns in public. Is the person at risk or not? And we get to deny it.\" There was legislation to overturn all of these laws across the country. We successfully pushed that back.\n\nAnd then, another bill, dubbed the Hearing Protection Act, but that would have basically switched how the sale of silencers occurs across this country, which are subject to heightened scrutiny under the 1934 Firearms Act, it would have removed those protection and allowed the sale of firearms, basically, in your Costco or in your Walmart or other major vendors where firearms are sold. And let's be clear: The purpose of silencers, from the 1934 time forward, was to mute the sound of gunfire, making it much harder for police to respond instantly to these kinds of horrific shootings.\n\nSo, that's the stark reality of President Trump and his focus, fueled by one of his greatest investors for his campaign, contributing more than any other nonprofit, the National Rifle Association.\n\nLet's contrast that to President Biden. From day one on the campaign trail, and he is - this is consistent with his 40-year history as a public servant, he has said reduction of gun violence in America, the number one killer of our kids, is a top priority. And from day one, he has done everything he can to make that happen. He's responsible for passage of the most bipartisan legislation in the history of the gun violence prevention movement, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. More than 15 Republicans, including John Cornyn from Texas, who was a chief co-sponsor of that legislation, passed. It called for expanded background checks across the country, incredible, unprecedented funding for community violence intervention. These programs are shown to work, to reduce things like homicide. And by the way, under President Biden, we have had record reductions in homicide in cities across this country. He offered a rule on ghost guns. He has authorized many more inspections of gun dealers across this country. And, Amy, we have more gun dealers than Starbucks and McDonald's combined.\n\nAnd this president understands it's not just about policy. Policy is important. But unless you enforce that policy well, you will never have a true reduction in gun violence. So he has someone at ATF leading ATF , Steve Dettelbach, who is laser focused on giving gun dealers - giving the ATF the tools to inspect gun dealers and shut down the few of them, relatively, that are responsible for a huge amount of crime guns that are flooding the market across the country. And he established the Office of Gun Violence Prevention, led by two survivors of gun violence. They fight night and day to have a whole-of-government approach to address this issue. The surgeon general has issued a report on gun violence as a public health epidemic. I could go on and on and on. And none of these actions -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Kris, we -\n\nKRIS BROWN : None of these actions are inconsistent with a reasonable view of the Second Amendment, Amy, and I think that's really important.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Kris, just before we go, and we just have a minute, I want to read a CNN report that came out right before this weekend, the attempted assassination. This is from CNN . \"Vending machines selling ammunition will now be in grocery stores in Alabama, Texas and Oklahoma - a move that has generated mixed feelings from officials in those states. American Rounds, the distributor of the machines, uses AI technology to scan the customers' identification as well as facial recognition software to verify a customer's identity, according to the company's [website].\" Again, vending machines selling ammunition will now be in grocery stores in Alabama, Texas and Oklahoma. Your final comment?\n\nKRIS BROWN : Well, I think this is a horrific trend and one that, really, the Biden administration is aware of and deeply concerned about. We think that the Department of Justice should look at this and seek action to shut this down. Look, if you're shopping in a grocery store and you're standing in line with your children, the idea that any person can come in and buy ammunition from a vending machine, where all it's checking, Amy, is: Are you the person you say you are? - it's not doing a background check. It's doing nothing to stop the sale of that ammunition, other than to confirm you are the person you say you are. That is deeply concerning, because we, as we know, have a huge problem with gun violence in this country. And dealers, gun dealers in this country today sell firearms and ammunition. Those clerks, the individuals that most quality gun dealers - and most of them are - train to stop sales if they view a person is at risk. AI is no substitute for that. This will, make no mistake -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Kris Brown, we're going to have to leave it there.\n\nKRIS BROWN : It will - thank you. Thank you.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Thank you so much, president of Brady, one of the oldest gun violence prevention organizations in the United States, named for Jim Brady, who was shot in the head during an attempted assassination of former President Ronald Reagan.\n\nWhen we come back, Israeli airstrikes kill at least 90 people in a massive attack on a designated safe zone in Gaza. Hundreds more are wounded. Back in 30 seconds.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "You turn to us for voices you won't hear anywhere else.\n\nSign up for Democracy Now!'s Daily Digest to get our latest headlines and stories delivered to your inbox every day.\n\nBy Amy Goodman & Denis Moynihan\n\nTwo courtroom dramas unfolded this week in the U.S., both the result of America's gun obsession: In Florida, jurors recommended Nikolas Cruz be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. Cruz murdered 17 students and staff at Parkland's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Valentine's Day, 2018. Meanwhile, a Connecticut jury decided on financial penalties for conspiracy peddler Alex Jones, who was found guilty of defamation.\n\nJones long claimed that the Dec. 14, 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School was staged, and that some of the grieving parents were actually \"crisis actors,\" reading government-provided scripts in a false flag operation mounted to justify gun confiscation. The jury awarded eight families and one FBI agent in the suit a stunning sum of almost $1 billion. Outside these courtrooms, the cycle of gun violence continues, as Americans amass an unprecedented private arsenal estimated at close to 400 million firearms - more guns than people.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ), more than 45,000 people died by gunfire in the U.S. in 2020. Over 24,000 were by suicide, while over 19,000 were homicides. More than 1,000 people were shot to death by police. These grim figures are without comparison in the world. U.S. gun deaths have become so commonplace they barely warrant a mention in the media. We, as a society, have grown accustomed to the carnage.\n\n\"We are a nation under siege,\" Nina Turner, national co-chair of the Bernie Sanders 2020 presidential campaign, said on the Democracy Now! news hour last July, one day after a teenager fired on a July 4th parade in Hyde Park, Illinois, killing seven and wounding 48. \"When you cannot take your family to a parade, you can't go to the grocery store - I'm thinking about Buffalo - your babies are not safe in schools - Uvalde - and other incidents over the last past 20 years in this country, we have a problem. Part of this problem is the gun obsession in the United States of America. Unfortunately, we have too many elected officials who are bought and paid for by the NRA .\"\n\nA majority of Americans support stricter gun controls. But enacting meaningful federal gun control legislation has become virtually impossible. In June, President Biden signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act into law. It strengthens background checks for gun buyers under 21 years old, provides money for school security and for mental health services. It doesn't address the core problem, as explained on Democracy Now! by Robin Lloyd, managing director of the gun violence prevention organization Giffords, in the wake of the Uvalde, Texas school shooting last June:\n\n\"There's definitely something specific to the United States and our lack of strong gun laws and our patchwork of gun laws that we have across different states that allow this to keep happening, in addition to the sheer number of firearms that exist in this country and how easy it is to access them.\"\n\nGiffords is named for its co-founder, former Congressmember Gabby Giffords. She survived being shot in the head on January 8, 2011 while holding a public constituent meeting in a Tucson supermarket parking lot. A gunman opened fire, killing six people, including a nine-year-old girl.\n\nThe pervasiveness of guns and gun violence in the U.S. is bleeding into Mexico. The Mexican government has just filed suit in federal court in Arizona, charging five Arizona gun dealers with engaging in arms trafficking.\n\n\"Eighty percent of the guns traced back to the U.S. are coming from shops in Arizona, which is a major corridor for most of the top cartels in Mexico, like the Sinaloa Cartel and the Cártel de Jalisco Nueva Generación,\" journalist Luis Chaparro said on Democracy Now!\n\nThe United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, in a recent report, tracks the flow of illicit weapons to armed conflicts and organized crime, leading to more violence and the erosion of governance.\n\nHere in the United States, hundreds of millions of guns are purchased legally; too many are wielded with criminal or seditious intent. This was frighteningly demonstrated on January 6th, 2021, when thousands of President Trump's supporters, many of them armed, stormed the U.S. Capitol, seeking to overturn Trump's election loss to Joe Biden. Some even wanted to execute perceived enemies of Trump, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nTrump ally Alex Jones long championed resistance to the peaceful transfer of power in 2021. He has been subpoenaed by the House Select Committee investigating the January 6th attack on the Capitol, but has refused to cooperate.\n\nCan democracy survive in a society awash in guns as violence-promoting charlatans like Donald Trump and Alex Jones are increasingly embraced by Republican Party elites? It is the job of us all to see that it does.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Secretary-General António Guterres renews his call for an immediate halt to fighting in Sudan between the country's military and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, we speak with New York Times correspondent Declan Walsh about how the conflict is being fueled by the illicit gold trade. He reports that Sudan's gold riches are being smuggled out of the country by both sides in order to pay for the drones, guns and missiles that have killed tens of thousands of people since the start of the civil war in April 2023. Much of that wealth is ending up in the United Arab Emirates, which backs the RSF despite mounting evidence of the group's war crimes and crimes against humanity. \"Gold is really at the heart of the RSF's ascent to power,\" says Walsh.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org. I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.\n\nWe turn now to Sudan. Earlier today, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres renewed his call for an immediate halt to the fighting between the Sudanese military and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. Guterres also condemned last week's drone attack on the last functioning hospital in the besieged city of El Fasher in North Darfur. The attack killed an estimated 70 people. Sudan's government blamed the RSF for the massacre.\n\nOver 14 million people have been displaced by the war in Sudan, which started in April of 2023. Three million of those have become refugees, most of them crossing the border to South Sudan and Chad.\n\nWe go now to Declan Walsh, chief Africa correspondent for The New York Times , based in Nairobi, Kenya. Last month, he wrote a piece headlined \"The Gold Rush at the Heart of a Civil War.\"\n\nDeclan, thanks so much for being with us. Explain why gold is so essential to what the U.S. is now in Sudan calling a genocide even.\n\nDECLAN WALSH : Thanks, Amy. It's great to be with you.\n\nLook, it's really the most astonishing thing in this huge war. You know, the war has been going on for two years. It has destroyed the country, pushed it into famine. It has just absolutely crushed the economy. And yet, the one thing that is still functioning - in fact, the one business that's still thriving is gold. Sudan has some of the richest gold deposits in Africa. And since the war has started, our reporting showed that both sides have stepped up their efforts to exploit that gold, most of which ends up being traded in the United Arab Emirates in the Gulf, and they're using that funding for - to fund the weapons purchases that are being used to fight the war.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Declan, could you talk about the role of the United Arab Emirates in this conflict?\n\nDECLAN WALSH : So, one of the aspects of this conflict that have really bedeviled efforts to try and bring the two warring sides to peace is the fact that so many foreign countries have gotten involved on both sides. But far and away the most significant meddlesome foreign power, if you like, is the United Arab Emirates. Our reporting and reporting by other outlets has shown that they have been smuggling weapons across the border into Sudan to the Rapid Support Forces - that's the paramilitary group that the U.S. has now determined committed genocide during the war. They've been smuggling those weapons for about the last 18 months.\n\nAnd it's become - certainly in the last months of the Biden administration, it had become quite a sensitive point between the two countries. Biden administration officials, up to Vice President Harris, had raised this issue in private with the Emiratis, asking them to stop the support for the RSF . There is a certain degree of support in Congress. Some lawmakers have introduced laws - or, had proposed laws, rather, suggesting that the U.S. should condition weapons sales to the Emirates, so that it would stop supporting the RSF .\n\nBut in public, the Biden administration was actually, I would say, much more supportive of the Emiratis. The Emirates, of course, is an incredibly wealthy country with a lot of money to invest. It buys a lot of American weapons. And so, that support has continued. Just last Friday, as news was coming through of the drone strike that you referenced in the introduction there that killed about 70 people at a hospital in Darfur, we had a word from some lawmakers in Washington who said that they had been informed officially by the Biden administration that despite the promises by the Emiratis that they would stop funding or arming the RSF , that that arming continues to this day.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And what is the reason, the purpose of the Emiratis in their support of the RSF ?\n\nDECLAN WALSH : Well, it should be said the Emiratis absolutely deny that they've - they've consistently denied that they provide any support to the RSF . But as we know, you know, Sudan is a country with immense natural resources, not just gold, but it also has huge amounts - huge, immense agricultural potential, a lot of agricultural land along the Nile that is coveted or desirable to many Gulf countries that are facing a future where their own food security could be in doubt. But it's also a very strategic place. It has a long coastline along the Red Sea, and there are many countries that are jostling, in the hope - including Russia, that hope that they may at some point be able to set up a port along that.\n\nAnd frankly, the other reason is just because the Emirates can. They have - the Emirates has a long-standing relationship with the Rapid Support Forces and with its leader, General Mohamed Hamdan, that goes back to the campaign that the UAE waged along with Saudi Arabia in Yemen some years ago. As part of that campaign, the Emirates paid for the Rapid Support Forces to send some of its troops to Yemen to fight alongside its own forces. And so, there is this long-standing relationship between some of these - the leaders of the Emirates, effectively, members of their royal family, and the RSF . And the Emirates appears to have taken a calculation that they thought that he could win this war. But increasingly, the RSF has been losing ground on the battlefield, and there's a real question mark over whether - I mean, there's a question mark, frankly, over whether either side can win this war by purely military means.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And, Declan Walsh, as we wrap up, I wanted you to take us on the journey that you begin \"The Gold Rush at the Heart of a Civil War\" piece with. You say, \"The luxury jet touched down in Juba, the capital of South Sudan, on a mission to collect hundreds of pounds of illicit gold. On board was a representative of a ruthless paramilitary group accused of ethnic cleansing in Sudan's sprawling civil war, the flight manifest showed. The gold itself had been smuggled from Darfur, a region of famine and fear in Sudan that is largely under his group's brutal control.\" Take us from there to UAE , where the gold goes to, and the fact that you interviewed the head of the RSF , what, back in 2019, when they took over a gold mine, and yet minimized its power, though ultimately it fueled the RSF to the power it is today.\n\nDECLAN WALSH : Yeah, gold is really at the heart of the RSF's ascent to power. I mean, the RSF endeared itself to the autocratic ruler of Sudan, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, before he was overthrown in 2019. But it also grew incredibly rich by taking over the largest gold mine in the country and by using that money to build a business empire that extended into many businesses. And that's why when I met the leader of the RSF in 2019, I asked him about that. At the time, he tried to downplay it, but our reporting shows just how pervasive it's been.\n\nAnd the incident that you referred to that we reported on in the story was really just an effort to illustrate just one of many, many routes that gold follows when it flows out of Sudan. Sudan is a country that borders about seven other countries. Gold seems to be flowing across almost all of those borders into those countries, and sometimes through very circuitous smuggling routes involving a whole range of officials, not just in Sudan, but in neighboring countries, involving companies, gold traders in the UAE themselves. It ends up in the UAE , where, you know, research has showed about 90% of the gold from across Africa, including many conflict zones, like Sudan, ultimately is traded.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Declan Walsh, we want to thank you so much for being with us, chief Africa correspondent for The New York Times , based in Nairobi, Kenya. We'll link to your pieces on Sudan at democracynow.org, \"The Gold Rush at the Heart of a Civil War.\"\n\nComing up, Holocaust survivors mark 80 years since the liberation of Aushwitz. We'll speak to the Israeli American Holocaust scholar Raz Segal. Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "Meet America's gun super-owners - with an average of 17 firearms each\n\nSome are collectors with elaborately curated selections of historical firearms, while others are 'just accumulators'. They say it is surprisingly easy to get to 17\n\nF or years, Rich, a refinery operator from Wilmington, Delaware, was a typical American gun owner. He had only one or two guns, including a handgun he stashed in a bottom drawer in his bedroom. He never took it out and never fired it.\n\nThen, in December 2012, 20 first-graders were murdered in a school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, sparking renewed calls for a ban on the AR-15 military-style rifle the shooter had used.\n\nWorried that a ban was coming, Rich joined the crowd of people at a local gun store and paid roughly $2,000 in cash for an AR-15 - about twice what the gun is worth today.\n\n\"I never really wanted one before,\" he said, \"but at that time there was the fear that if you don't buy it now, you may never, ever get one.\"\n\nOne purchase followed another. Three months after the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting, Rich owned 10 guns. Today, he says, it's at least 43, and he asked that his last name not be published, for fear that publicizing too many details might attract thieves.\n\nThe 39-year-old is now one of America's firearms super-owners - part of the 3% of American adults who collectively own 130m firearms, half of the nation's total stock of civilian guns.\n\nThe collection in his safe includes three AR-15 lower receivers that will allow each of his three children to customize their own rifles when they come of age, whether an assault weapon ban is passed or not. But Rich said semiautomatic AR-15s had become a little boring to him. He's much more excited about historic military weapons, and dreams of someday owning a fully automatic weapon. That's \"a grail gun\", he said. \"It's like a whole other arena of firearms ownership.\"\n\nBeing called a \"gun nut\" didn't bother him, Rich said. \"I kind of take it as a term of endearment.\"\n\nIn all, 22% of American adults are gun owners, according to a new survey of gun ownership produced by researchers from Harvard and Northeastern universities.\n\nIn the new survey, conducted in 2015, about half of all gun owners fall into Rich's previous demographic: they own a single gun, maybe two. Another third of American gun owners own between three and seven guns.\n\nThat top 14% of gun owners - a group of 7.7m people, or 3% of American adults - own between about eight and 140 guns each. The average is 17.\n\nThese super-owners include collectors with elaborately curated selections of historical firearms, serious hunters, firearms instructors, gunsmiths, people who love tinkering with and customizing their firearms, and Americans worried about feeding or defending their families in the wake of a disaster scenario. But you don't have to be prepping for the breakdown of civilization to end up with 17 guns. In fact, gun enthusiasts say, it's surprisingly easy to get to 17 - especially because many Americans inherit multiple guns from their parents and grandparents.\n\n\"I'm from Texas, and I just have an assload of guns,\" said John Risenhoover, a retired agent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms who now lives in Colorado.\n\nRisenhoover said he owns about thirty guns, including firearms given to him by his father-in-law and grandfather, his self-defense Glocks, a shotgun for hunting ducks, a larger rifle for hunting elk, and a few .22 handguns, \"little plinker guns\" he used to teach his children how to shoot. (His daughter is more enthusiastic than his son, he noted.)\n\n\"The fact that you'd open the closet and have a stack full of guns in this country is really not a big deal,\" he said. \"I know it sounds weird.\"\n\nTo him, he said, \"it's like buying shoes.\"\n\nMost gun owners are deeply private about what's in their gun collection - both for fear of government intrusion, and for fear of theft. Several gun owners agreed to talk to the Guardian in detail about their collections only on the condition that their full names or precise locations not be disclosed.\n\nLike Risenhoover, many super-owners described gun collections that had grown organically or even haphazardly, with different guns added for a mishmash of reasons, from practical need to the appreciation of a gun's historical significance or aesthetic value.\n\nFred, a 39-year-old truck driver from Ocala, Florida, has about 40 guns - roughly 24 pistols and 14 long guns. He said his firearms collection began to grow after he became a father. He had a \"catastrophic knee injury\" that he worried would make it hard for him to protect his wife and child, and when he researched his neighborhood, he saw crime was going up.\n\n\"I want everyone in my home to be able to defend themselves at a moment's notice if a violent criminal decides he wants to break down the door,\" he said.\n\nFred said his wife usually carried a gun in her purse or on her person, and his 70-year-old mother, who sings in the church choir, had become such a gun enthusiast that he got her a laser sight for her gun for Christmas.\n\nHe keeps guns stored in the living room; in his bedroom, on both his side and his wife's side of the bed; and in his garage workshop.\n\n\"If I'm working in my garage and someone wanders in and he wants rob me, I can't say: 'Can you hang on for a second?'\"\n\nFred couldn't know where he might be \"when the worst day in my life arrives\", he said. \"If I'm going to believe that I'm prepared, I better be prepared.\"\n\nIt's not just a home intruder that worries him, but a broader societal breakdown. He spent five years as a civilian truck driver during the Iraq war making deliveries between military bases in southern Iraq. Today, he sees the fragility of America's food supply network. If the interstate highways aren't drivable, or if the electrical grid fails and diesel stations can't pump their fuel, many local stores would quickly run out of food, he said.\n\n\"All of our morals or ethics would be out the window in the fear of the inability to survive as soon we got just a little bit hungry.\"\n\nHis collection includes five AR-15s for self-protection, and rifles and shotguns for hunting small, medium, and large game, since a rifle that's good for hunting deer \"would just obliterate\" a rabbit.\n\nBut the benefit of his gun collection isn't just the security. It's the joy of being able to constantly tinker with his guns, personalizing and improving them. He bought one rifle for $700 and then spent more than $1,500 customizing it.\n\n\"Some of them were just pretty,\" he said. \"It's kind of like man jewelry, for lack of anything better to call it.\n\n\"In Florida, we cannot open carry unless we're on personal property or our own business, so these things are never really going to be seen by the general public,\" he said. But he likes knowing that there's something fully custom-made for him, in a custom-designed holster, on his hip. \"It kind of makes me giggle. It's not different than a woman who would have a very very nice tennis bracelet that she wouldn't dream of wearing out just to go to dinner and catch a movie, but when you open up the jewelry box, it's there.\"\n\nCompared with gun owners overall, people who own more than eight guns are more likely to be men, less likely to be black or Hispanic, and more likely to own a gun for protection, said Deborah Azrael, a Harvard School of Public Health firearms researcher and the lead author of the new survey of gun ownership .\n\nBut American women are firearms super-owners, too. Patti Bonnie, 45, a military veteran and small-business owner in Florida, used to own just a single handgun and a shotgun. Then, in May 2014, she used one of her guns to deter an attempted home invasion - simply by raising the shotgun and moving toward the intruder, she said. Today, she owns an estimated 25 to 30 guns.\n\n\"You know, it's kind of like tattoos,\" she said. \"You can't have just one.\"\n\nVicki, a firearms instructor who lives in a western state, said she and her husband own about 20 guns for their personal use, as well as an additional 20 guns - a set of four guns each in five different calibers - that she uses to introduce women to shooting.\n\n\"All of our guns have a purpose,\" she said. \"I'm not about pretty guns.\"\n\nEven among friends, gun owners didn't tend to boast about the number of guns they had, Phil Schreier, a senior curator at the National Rifle Association's National Firearms Museum, said.\n\n\"I've been pleasantly surprised by the number of guns a lot of my friends have owned,\" Schreier said.\n\nGun collections are valuable and are viewed by many people as a financial investment, he said. A well-chosen gun collection might grow in value like a 401k.\n\nThough gun collecting has been around since the dawn of firearms in the 1400s and 1500s - Henry VIII was an early collector, as were Thomas Jefferson and George Washington - in the United States, gun collecting started to take off around the 1930s, as more Americans began to have the kind of disposable income that allowed them to buy for pleasure, not just for immediate need.\n\n\"It's hard to get somebody to identify themselves as a collector,\" Schreier said. \"Nine out of 10 of them, you'll say, 'You' re a gun collector,' they'll go, 'Nah, I'm just an accumulator.\"\n\nThe United States does have serious community of firearms collectors. The NRA sponsors an annual gun collectors' show with more than $10,000 in prizes for the best collections. There are more than 120 gun collectors' clubs across the United States.\n\nAmong the serious gun collectors is Robert, from central Florida, who has a collection of American military firearms that has been featured in several firearms television programs.\n\nThe collection of roughly 100 firearms includes weapons used in the revolutionary war through the modern day, including a \"near-complete collection of small arms from world war two and Vietnam\".\n\nAmong the firearms he owns are several fully automatic weapons, including a Thompson submachine gun, or Tommy gun, and a Model 50 Reising submachine gun. These are prized collectors' items in the US, where ownership of these guns has been strictly regulated, tracked and limited.\n\nRobert meets friends at a range weekly to fire some of his historic guns. \"I probably have less than 10 that I would not fire,\" he said, though ammunition for some of the more exotic guns is expensive enough to make firing them a rare treat. With the Thompson submachine gun, he said, \"you can easily go through $100 worth of ammunition in one shooting session\".\n\nFor Americans concerned about about a potential government breakdown, though, it's more commonly available guns that often have the most potential value.\n\n\"If I had to pick a number to survive a collapse, I think every person in your family or group should have a personal handgun and a personal carbine. That's a bare minimum,\" said Bryce Towsley, the author of Prepper Guns, who gave away copies of his book at this year's National Rifle Association convention. He added: \"You should have a couple of backups,\" and recommended guns that use the most common forms of ammunition - perhaps 9mm for handguns and .223 for rifles.\n\n\"I know there are preppers out there who are buying guns and ammunition with the anticipation that's bartering material, and I don't think they'll be wrong.\"\n\nBut Towsley, though he believes in preparing in case of disaster, is optimistic that in the United States government, \"grown-ups take over and get us back on track\".\n\n\"I hope it never happens,\" he said. \"My worst nightmare is having to shoot anybody in defense of myself or my family.\"\n\nTowsley lives in a Vermont home overflowing with books, which he also collects avidly, and his own gun collection includes a selection of guns for the hunting trips he takes around the world, as well as for competitive shooting events.\n\nHe said he is weary of gun owners being demonized and held up as a threat by Hillary Clinton and other politicians.\n\n\"I'm what used to be considered a Joe Average American,\" Towsley said. \"I'm a little conservative in my politics. I work hard. I pay my taxes, I raised my kids ... I try to give back.\"\n\n\"How many guns is enough? I don't know - I'll let you know when I get there.\""

      "text": "Meet America's gun super-owners - with an average of 17 firearms each\n\nSome are collectors with elaborately curated selections of historical firearms, while others are 'just accumulators'. They say it is surprisingly easy to get to 17\n\nF or years, Rich, a refinery operator from Wilmington, Delaware, was a typical American gun owner. He had only one or two guns, including a handgun he stashed in a bottom drawer in his bedroom. He never took it out and never fired it.\n\nThen, in December 2012, 20 first-graders were murdered in a school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, sparking renewed calls for a ban on the AR-15 military-style rifle the shooter had used.\n\nWorried that a ban was coming, Rich joined the crowd of people at a local gun store and paid roughly $2,000 in cash for an AR-15 - about twice what the gun is worth today.\n\n\"I never really wanted one before,\" he said, \"but at that time there was the fear that if you don't buy it now, you may never, ever get one.\"\n\nOne purchase followed another. Three months after the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting, Rich owned 10 guns. Today, he says, it's at least 43, and he asked that his last name not be published, for fear that publicizing too many details might attract thieves.\n\nThe 39-year-old is now one of America's firearms super-owners - part of the 3% of American adults who collectively own 130m firearms, half of the nation's total stock of civilian guns.\n\nThe collection in his safe includes three AR-15 lower receivers that will allow each of his three children to customize their own rifles when they come of age, whether an assault weapon ban is passed or not. But Rich said semiautomatic AR-15s had become a little boring to him. He's much more excited about historic military weapons, and dreams of someday owning a fully automatic weapon. That's \"a grail gun\", he said. \"It's like a whole other arena of firearms ownership.\"\n\nBeing called a \"gun nut\" didn't bother him, Rich said. \"I kind of take it as a term of endearment.\"\n\nIn all, 22% of American adults are gun owners, according to a new survey of gun ownership produced by researchers from Harvard and Northeastern universities.\n\nIn the new survey, conducted in 2015, about half of all gun owners fall into Rich's previous demographic: they own a single gun, maybe two. Another third of American gun owners own between three and seven guns.\n\nThat top 14% of gun owners - a group of 7.7m people, or 3% of American adults - own between about eight and 140 guns each. The average is 17.\n\nThese super-owners include collectors with elaborately curated selections of historical firearms, serious hunters, firearms instructors, gunsmiths, people who love tinkering with and customizing their firearms, and Americans worried about feeding or defending their families in the wake of a disaster scenario. But you don't have to be prepping for the breakdown of civilization to end up with 17 guns. In fact, gun enthusiasts say, it's surprisingly easy to get to 17 - especially because many Americans inherit multiple guns from their parents and grandparents.\n\n\"I'm from Texas, and I just have an assload of guns,\" said John Risenhoover, a retired agent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms who now lives in Colorado.\n\nRisenhoover said he owns about thirty guns, including firearms given to him by his father-in-law and grandfather, his self-defense Glocks, a shotgun for hunting ducks, a larger rifle for hunting elk, and a few .22 handguns, \"little plinker guns\" he used to teach his children how to shoot. (His daughter is more enthusiastic than his son, he noted.)\n\n\"The fact that you'd open the closet and have a stack full of guns in this country is really not a big deal,\" he said. \"I know it sounds weird.\"\n\nTo him, he said, \"it's like buying shoes.\"\n\nMost gun owners are deeply private about what's in their gun collection - both for fear of government intrusion, and for fear of theft. Several gun owners agreed to talk to the Guardian in detail about their collections only on the condition that their full names or precise locations not be disclosed.\n\nLike Risenhoover, many super-owners described gun collections that had grown organically or even haphazardly, with different guns added for a mishmash of reasons, from practical need to the appreciation of a gun's historical significance or aesthetic value.\n\nFred, a 39-year-old truck driver from Ocala, Florida, has about 40 guns - roughly 24 pistols and 14 long guns. He said his firearms collection began to grow after he became a father. He had a \"catastrophic knee injury\" that he worried would make it hard for him to protect his wife and child, and when he researched his neighborhood, he saw crime was going up.\n\n\"I want everyone in my home to be able to defend themselves at a moment's notice if a violent criminal decides he wants to break down the door,\" he said.\n\nFred said his wife usually carried a gun in her purse or on her person, and his 70-year-old mother, who sings in the church choir, had become such a gun enthusiast that he got her a laser sight for her gun for Christmas.\n\nHe keeps guns stored in the living room; in his bedroom, on both his side and his wife's side of the bed; and in his garage workshop.\n\n\"If I'm working in my garage and someone wanders in and he wants rob me, I can't say: 'Can you hang on for a second?'\"\n\nFred couldn't know where he might be \"when the worst day in my life arrives\", he said. \"If I'm going to believe that I'm prepared, I better be prepared.\"\n\nIt's not just a home intruder that worries him, but a broader societal breakdown. He spent five years as a civilian truck driver during the Iraq war making deliveries between military bases in southern Iraq. Today, he sees the fragility of America's food supply network. If the interstate highways aren't drivable, or if the electrical grid fails and diesel stations can't pump their fuel, many local stores would quickly run out of food, he said.\n\n\"All of our morals or ethics would be out the window in the fear of the inability to survive as soon we got just a little bit hungry.\"\n\nHis collection includes five AR-15s for self-protection, and rifles and shotguns for hunting small, medium, and large game, since a rifle that's good for hunting deer \"would just obliterate\" a rabbit.\n\nBut the benefit of his gun collection isn't just the security.

      "text": "Six million Americans carried guns daily in 2019, twice as many as in 2015\n\nThe trend is expected to continue, after the supreme court ruling earlier this year overturning strict limits on public gun-carrying\n\nAn estimated 6 million American adults carried a loaded handgun with them daily in 2019, double the number who said they carried a gun every day in 2015, according to a new study published in the American Journal of Public Health.\n\nThe new estimates highlight a decades-long shift in American gun ownership, with increasing percentages of gun owners saying they own firearms for self-defense, not hunting or recreation, and choosing to carry a gun with them when they go out in public, said Ali Rowhani-Rahbar, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Washington, and the study's lead author.\n\nA landmark supreme court case this summer overturned a New York law that placed strict limits on public gun-carrying, ruling, for the first time, that Americans have a constitutional right to carry a handgun for self-defense outside the home.\n\nWhile recent surveys show that nearly a third of American adults say they personally own a gun, the percentage who choose to regularly carry a firearm in public is smaller, with about a third of handgun owners, or an estimated 16 million adults, saying they carried a loaded handgun in public at least once a month, and an estimated 6 million saying they did so daily, the study found.\n\nBut public gun-carrying has appeared to increase rapidly in recent years. A 2015 study by the same researchers, using the same methodology, had found that 3 million adults said they carried a loaded handgun daily, and 9 million did so once a month.\n\nToday, the number of adults carrying a gun daily is probably even higher than the 2019 estimate, thanks to a record-breaking increase in gun sales during the pandemic, Rowhani-Rahbar said. \"We have every reason to believe this is a trend that is probably going to continue,\" he added.\n\nThe 2019 study is the most recent available peer-reviewed estimate of how many Americans regularly carry guns in public, he said, and an equivalent post-pandemic survey has yet to be conducted.\n\nWhile the effect of permissive gun-carrying laws on gun crime has been sharply debated inside and outside research circles, \"the totality of evidence is leaning toward an association between those [permissive] policies and an increase in violence,\" Rowhani-Rahbar said.\n\nBut he said more research is needed, including increased examination of how often \"carrying results in self-defense or protection in a way that saves lives\", as many American gun owners believe it does.\n\nDemographically, those who chose to carry a gun in public in 2019 were more likely to live in the south, the study found. Four in five gun carriers were male, and three in four were white, Rowhani-Rahbar said. Other demographic factors, like education and household income, did not make a difference in whether gun owners chose to carry their guns in public or not, he said. About a quarter of the gun carriers had a household income of at least $125,000 a year, and nearly a third had graduated from college, the researchers found.\n\nOnly about 8% of handgun owners and carriers were at the lowest income level, making less than $25,000 a year.\n\nThe increase in self-reported handgun carrying comes as more US states have passed laws to make it easier to carry a gun in public, with dozens of states removing the requirement that residents had to obtain a \"concealed carry permit\" in order to carry a concealed firearm on their person.\n\n\"The country has been moving as a whole, in the past two or three decades, very clearly and dramatically toward loosening gun-carrying laws,\" Rowhani-Rahbar said.\n\nRowhani-Rahbar's study found that a lower percentage of gun owners chose to carry in public in states that had very strict carrying laws, but that there wasn't a substantial difference between states where it was easy to get a permit and states that required no permit at all.\n\nBut the handful of large states that had strict carrying laws, including New Jersey and California, are now in the process of changing them, thanks to the supreme court's decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v Bruen this June, said Adam Skaggs, the policy director at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates for increased regulation of firearms.\n\n\"Bruen is only going to accelerate the number of people carrying guns in public,\" Skaggs said, noting that, anecdotally, the number of gun-carrying permits being issued in those states is already on the rise.\n\nThe 2019 gun-carrying study was based on the self-reported behavior of a nationally representative sample of US adults living in firearm-owning households. Because of opposition from gun rights advocates, there are no official government statistics on the number or demographics of US gun owners, or even the exact number of annual consumer gun sales in the US, meaning that survey-based estimates are sometimes the best statistics available."

Controversy had previously bubbled over alleged pressure on a Justice Department pardon attorney who had refused to recommend that Gibson have his right to own firearms reinstated.\n\nElizabeth G.

      "text": "Supreme Court Upholds Biden Rules For Ghost Guns\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld a Biden administration regulation on the nearly impossible-to-trace weapons called ghost guns , clearing the way for continued serial numbers, background checks and age verification requirements for buying the kits online.\n\nThe 7-2 opinion found that existing gun laws allow regulation of the kits increasingly linked to crime. It comes after President Donald Trump ordered a review of federal gun policy that could undermine or reverse regulations championed by his predecessor.\n\nSales of the homemade firearms grew exponentially as kits allowing for easy at-home building came into the market, Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in the majority opinion. \"Some home hobbyists enjoy assembling them. But criminals also find them attractive,\" he said.\n\nThe number of ghost guns found at crime scenes around the country has also soared , according to federal data. Fewer than 1,700 were recovered by law enforcement in 2017, but that number grew to 27,000 in 2023, according to Justice Department data.\n\nSince the federal rule was finalized, though, ghost gun numbers have flattened out or declined in several major cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Baltimore, according to court documents. Manufacturing of miscellaneous gun parts also dropped 36% overall, the Justice Department has said.\n\nGhost guns are any privately made firearms without the serial numbers that allow police to trace weapons used in crime. The 2022 regulation was focused on kits sold online with everything needed to build a functioning firearm - sometimes in less than 30 minutes, according to court documents.\n\nGhost guns have been used in high-profile crimes, including a mass shooting carried out with an AR-15-style ghost gun in Philadelphia that left five people dead. Police believe a ghost gun used in the slaying of UnitedHealthcare's CEO in Manhattan was made on a 3D printer rather than assembled from a kit of the kind at the center of the Supreme Court case.\n\nFinalized at the direction of then-President Joe Biden , the \"frame and receiver\" rule requires companies to treat the kits like other firearms by adding serial numbers, running background checks and verifying that buyers are 21 or older.\n\nGun groups challenged the rule in court in the case known as Garland v. VanDerStok. Most crimes are committed with traditional firearms, not ghost guns, they argued. It's legal for people to build their own firearms at home, the challengers said, arguing that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives overstepped its authority by trying to regulate the kits.\n\nThe Supreme Court majority disagreed, pointing out that the law gives the ATF the power to regulate items that can be quickly made into working firearms.\n\n\"The 'Buy Build Shoot' kit can be 'readily converted' into a firearm too, for it requires no more time, effort, expertise, or specialized tools to complete,\" Gorsuch wrote, referring to a specific product.\n\nSome kits may take more time to build into guns and therefore fall outside the ATF's power, he wrote, but many popular kits are subject to regulation.\n\nIn response to the ruling, a Justice Department spokesperson said the administration would \"continue to support and defend the Second Amendment rights of all Americans.\"\n\nGun safety groups celebrated the ruling, with Everytown Law executive director Eric Tirschwell saying the rule also had broad support from law enforcement. \"Fundamentally, today's decision confirms the ghost gun industry is dead as a viable business model,\" he said.\n\nA Michigan woman whose son lost an eye when he was accidently shot by a friend who bought a ghost gun before he was old enough to legally buy a typical weapon also applauded. \"We are deeply relieved by today's ruling, which will help ensure that a tragedy like ours never happens again,\" she said.\n\nNew Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin said the ATF policy is a major factor in two years of record-low numbers of shootings in his state. \"These are common-sense regulations on ghost guns that all too often end up in the hands of felons,\" he said.\n\nThe court previously expanded Second Amendment rights with a finding that modern gun regulations must fit within historical traditions. The justices also struck down a firearm regulation from President Donald Trump's first administration, a ban on gun accessories known as bump stocks that enable rapid fire.\n\nIn a dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that the ghost gun rule should meet the same fate. The kits, he wrote, are only firearm parts and shouldn't be subject to a regulation that could open the door to rules on other popular weapons. \"Congress could have authorized ATF to regulate any part of a firearm or any object readily convertible into one,\" he wrote. \"But, it did not.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "You Cannot Regulate Guns Unless You Know How To Use One\n\nFormer CEO of Reddit\n\nI am a pro-gun-control liberal who does not believe in the Second Amendment.\n\nI also possess five guns: three handguns and two rifles -- one which I built myself from parts. It was fairly easy and a lot of fun, as I am an engineer by training.\n\nI also believe that guns at home are more likely to result in injury than be used successfully for home defense, so I believe in storing them at the local gun club or armory.\n\nI used to run a very popular internet forum . In that job, I witnessed a great diversity of opinions. I learned one big thing: no matter how unreasonable you think your opponent is, he knows many important things that you do not, and you need to understand those things to have any hope of reaching an agreement.\n\nMany blue state liberals feel an increasing sense of helplessness when confronted with another mass shooting. After every shooting, no new legislation is passed and research even shows that gun laws tend to loosen as a result. During Obama's time in office, over 100 million new guns have been sold. What can you do?\n\nWell, I am here to tell you the first thing you need to do if you want meaningful gun control legislation to be passed in America.\n\nIf you want to personally do something that will help , here it is:\n\nSounds crazy, right?\n\nAlmost every gun control advocate I know hates guns and wants nothing to do with them. They are vaguely (or very) afraid of them, and believe that if they fire a gun or buy one, they will suddenly become a gun nut or turn evil.\n\nThat is nonsense. You need to understand guns intimately if you want to regulate them.\n\nThis kind of thinking is common sense when it comes to making laws about anything else, yet somehow it flies out the window when it comes to regulating something as simple and dangerous as guns.\n\nBeing a gun owner who doesn't believe in the Second Amendment is really lonely. My liberal friends react with a sort of politely sanctimonious horror to learn that I own all these weapons. My gun friends think it's absurd and despicable that I can be into guns but not support the Second Amendment. But it gives me a very special insight into the gun debate, which is this: many gun owners would be willing to support reasonable gun control but they will not have a conversation with gun control liberals because without exception, every time you open your mouth to speak about guns, you reveal that you know absolutely nothing about how guns work.\n\nDo you think it's reasonable for old white men who say things like \"the female body has ways of shutting that down\" to make laws about abortion and contraception?\n\nDo you think it's reasonable for people who have their emails printed out for them to make laws about encryption standards and internet governance?\n\nDo you think it's reasonable for people to make traffic laws and emissions standards if they've never owned or driven a car, or even ridden in one?\n\nThat is the kind of thing you are expecting when you want to regulate guns but have never used one in your life.\n\nYou need to learn how to fire a gun, how to be safe with a gun, how to clean and take apart a gun, and you need to know what the process is like when you buy a gun.\n\nStill don't believe me?\n\n***\n\nI'm going to present a series of misconceptions that you probably believe. What's interesting about these is that without exception, almost every gun owner will get these right, whereas almost every non-gun-owning gun control advocate will get them wrong (apologies in advance to gun people who read this; I will be glossing over minor technicalities).\n\nI'll explain why each one is wrong, and offer an analogy to familiar liberal issues often aligned with gun control.\n\nWW2-era M1 Garand\n\nM16 US military standard-issue\n\nWhich one of these is the more powerful rifle?\n\nYou would probably say the M16. You'd be wrong.\n\nThe WW2-era M1 Garand rifle fires a larger bullet with nearly twice the muzzle energy of the modern M16. (The reason we use the M16 today is due to other characteristics relevant to battlefields and military operations, beyond the scope of this piece) A round fired from an M1 Garand can tear through multiple targets while the M16 cannot.\n\nWhy does this matter? Because it leads people to say things like the AR-15 (the civilian model of the M16) is \"the deadliest rifle\" or to misunderstand how it's not appropriate for hunting. That's true that the AR-15 is not appropriate for hunting, but not because it's a scary military rifle -- it's because it's underpowered.\n\nMaking this kind of error because of assumptions you think are reasonable but really aren't is like insisting that abstinence-only programs prevent teen pregnancy. They don't.\n\nYou're letting plausible-seeming assumptions lead you to be grossly misinformed about how and why things work and the many factors involved.\n\nThis is false, and entirely a Hollywood construct. There is literally no device in the world that will make a gun quiet.\n\nA typical gun discharge is somewhere in the range of 150 to 170 dB.\n\nAdding a silencer (or as the gun community prefers to call it nowadays, because of this myth, a suppressor) will lower that volume to about 130 dB at best. Here is a list of common noise levels :\n\n10 dB: pin drop\n\n30 dB: whisper\n\n60 dB: conversation\n\n90 dB: lawnmower\n\n110 dB: being at a rock concert or near a jackhammer\n\n140 dB: jet engine at takeoff\n\nHow often can you fail to hear a jackhammer even a block away from your house?\n\nNevertheless, silencers are banned in a number of states (e.g. California) but not for any good reason -- entirely because those who support a ban only know about them from films and not reality. Being near a firearm is damaging to your hearing even with ear protection. The correct nanny-state legislation would actually be to mandate that all guns include silencers on them to protect the hearing of sportsmen and shooters.\n\nBelieving otherwise is like saying that making contraceptives and sex education available to teens will result in promiscuity, earlier teen sex, and more pregnancies. It's untrue and contradicted by the evidence. Places with comprehensive sex education have lower teen pregnancy rates and teens delaying their first sexual activity.\n\nThinking otherwise only happens when one has been fooled by false and sensationalist media, while the true, evidence-based solution is to encourage broader adoption.\n\nSaying this to a gun person will immediately reveal that you don't understand anything about how bullets work.\n\nBullets roughly do one of two things when they hit a human being: they either over-penetrate and shoot all the way through, or they \"mushroom\" (deform) and stay inside the first thing they hit. The \"hollow\" part of hollow-point bullets is what makes them deform.\n\nIn a home defense scenario, the most important thing you are taught is to avoid either 1) missing the bad guy and shooting through a wall and hitting your loved ones on the other side, or 2) hitting the bad guy with a bullet that does the same thing because it went through him entirely. You want bullets that stop in the first thing they hit: hollow-point bullets are the ones most likely to do this.\n\nThus, hollow-point bullets are the opposite of cop-killer bullets: they are the ones most likely to be stopped by a cop's protective vest, rather than punching through it.\n\nIn most cases, using hollow-point bullets is one of the safest things you can do.\n\nThe reason you may believe otherwise is because the information you got about hollow-point bullets is from 1980s-era sensationalist media, and not any real understanding of how bullets work. You're misinformed because of someone's fear-mongering, like how anti-abortion activists believe that the only thing Planned Parenthood does is provide abortions, rather than 90 percent of their services just being medical and pre-natal care. You're missing the facts, and like anti-abortion activists, haven't been interested in educating yourself.\n\nDon't be like that.\n\nBonus round: \"The killer used an automatic weapon. There's no reason to own those and we should ban them!\"\n\nWhen you say this, every single gun owner can instantly tell that you don't know anything about guns.\n\nThere are two things wrong with this statement:\n\n1. The killer did not use an automatic weapon. Automatic weapons have been banned since 1971 , and their possession is strictly controlled. It's very, very hard to get one.\n\n2. The killer likely used a semi-automatic weapon. This is not a semi-automatic weapon:\n\nThe killer did not use a weapon like this.\n\nA semi-automatic weapon is a gun that fires ONE bullet each time you press the trigger. To fire another bullet you need to press the trigger again, individually. One press, one bullet.\n\nFor example, this common hunting rifle is a semi-automatic:\n\nRuger Mini-14\n\nA semi-automatic weapon is differentiated from non-semi-automatics because you don't need to manually pull the little handle back, eject the cartridge, hand-load another one, and then fire. It does not \"fire bullets continuously while you hold down the trigger.\" A semi-automatic rifle is a pretty reasonable thing to have because when you are hunting or target shooting, you don't want to hand-load every bullet one at a time. It's primitive.\n\nEvery gun person knows this, and when you say something like claiming the killer had an automatic weapon and that they should be banned, you immediately reveal a total ignorance the same way anti-abortion people do when they say things like \"the morning-after pill causes third-trimester abortions, so they should be banned.\" All it does is show that you don't know simple key terminology, or even what the existing laws are.\n\nYou cannot say \"we need to ban automatic weapons\" and expect to be taken seriously in any discussion of guns ever.\n\nNow that you know this, go look and see how often this statement is made. You'll find that it's everywhere, and you'll begin to see how much ignorance there is. It's why people who own guns tune you out, even though many of them supposedly agree with you.\n\n***\n\nI agree.\n\nBut, how much would you want to listen to a politician who made statements about abortion or women's bodies like the ones I've listed above? That's what you sound like when you talk about gun control. You literally don't know what you're talking about and need to educate yourself.\n\nOne of the things gun control advocates seem to think (consciously or subconsciously) is that guns are sinful and shouldn't be touched. Like if they believe they should be regulated or banned, they themselves shouldn't ever fire one, learn about one, or own one, otherwise you'll be somehow contaminated or something.\n\nYou know how some people think sex is sinful and dirty? They need to get past that and see that sex is natural and healthy, but with well-understood risks. Viewed pragmatically and without mystique, those risks can be managed with education and reasonable policies. The same is true of guns.\n\nOne of the more popular gun control ideas is that guns should be regulated like how cars are, by requiring registration, training, and insurance. You can learn to drive a car, enjoy driving, collect cars, all without being a dangerous driver or believing that it should be a Constitutional right.\n\nIf you want to regulate something as complex as guns in America, be willing to understand them intimately. Guns are a powerful tool, but you are a responsible adult and you can and should learn how to safely use and store one if you want to advocate for regulations that will affect 300 million Americans.\n\nThe more passionate you are about regulating guns, the more you personally need to be familiar with guns, how to use them, how they work, and how they are bought and sold.\n\nTake the first step to doing that.\n\n***\n\nIf you are a friend or acquaintance of mine who favors gun control, I will teach you how to use guns.\n\nI will take you to the range, explain gun safety to you, show you how to use common rifles and handguns, and even show you how to purchase a gun- I've found that this is important to understand, since many proposed regulations involve the purchasing process, so it's important to understand the experience.\n\nI am friendly to your cause, and genuinely believe this will help you achieve your aims, and help promote the conversation that needs to happen in this country for us to move forward.\n\nIf we don't know each other personally or you live outside California, ask your local gun friend.\n\nI have found that gun enthusiasts are without exception friendly and helpful. A gun store or a firing range is one of the most polite places you'll ever find yourself (for obvious reasons). You won't be shunned or made fun of for your ignorance. They are eager to demystify guns and teach new people.\n\nGive it a try, you will be glad that you did.\n\nThis is the first step.\n\nA version of this post originally appeared on Medium .\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

They need to get past that and see that sex is natural and healthy, but with well-understood risks. Viewed pragmatically and without mystique, those risks can be managed with education and reasonable policies. The same is true of guns.\n\nOne of the more popular gun control ideas is that guns should be regulated like how cars are, by requiring registration, training, and insurance. You can learn to drive a car, enjoy driving, collect cars, all without being a dangerous driver or believing that it should be a Constitutional right.\n\nIf you want to regulate something as complex as guns in America, be willing to understand them intimately. Guns are a powerful tool, but you are a responsible adult and you can and should learn how to safely use and store one if you want to advocate for regulations that will affect 300 million Americans.\n\nThe more passionate you are about regulating guns, the more you personally need to be familiar with guns, how to use them, how they work, and how they are bought and sold.\n\nTake the first step to doing that.\n\n***\n\nIf you are a friend or acquaintance of mine who favors gun control, I will teach you how to use guns.\n\nI will take you to the range, explain gun safety to you, show you how to use common rifles and handguns, and even show you how to purchase a gun- I've found that this is important to understand, since many proposed regulations involve the purchasing process, so it's important to understand the experience.\n\nI am friendly to your cause, and genuinely believe this will help you achieve your aims, and help promote the conversation that needs to happen in this country for us to move forward.\n\nIf we don't know each other personally or you live outside California, ask your local gun friend.\n\nI have found that gun enthusiasts are without exception friendly and helpful. A gun store or a firing range is one of the most polite places you'll ever find yourself (for obvious reasons). You won't be shunned or made fun of for your ignorance. They are eager to demystify guns and teach new people.\n\nGive it a try, you will be glad that you did.\n\nThis is the first step.\n\nA version of this post originally appeared on Medium .\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "It's Easier Than You'd Think To Buy A Machine Gun\n\nNational Reporter, HuffPost\n\nIn a video clip uploaded three months ago, one of YouTube's most prominent gun reviewers took aim at a steel target with a Glock 17 pistol equipped with a device called an autosear.\n\n\"All right, full auto!\" he said as about half the spray of bullets ricocheted off the coffin-shaped target while the rest flew into the dirt behind it. He burst through the entire magazine in less than a second.\n\n\"I can't believe how many rounds I burned through already,\" Hickok45 said after ringing more steel, then exploding a terra cotta pot, popping several soda bottles and knocking over a bowling pin. \"It's fun. And we wanted to bring the fun to you.\" The video has attracted 681,000 views.\n\nCongress first tightened regulation of machine guns back in 1934, in response to Prohibition-era gang violence. Modern machine guns and conversion devices have been banned from civilian use since 1986. Unlawful possession of an autosear can land an offender in prison for up to a decade, whether or not the device is attached to a pistol.\n\nBut machine guns are making a fast comeback.\n\nTinkerers are constantly devising new ways to shoot semiautomatics faster. The 3D printer has made it possible to turn a common pistol into a machine gun for less than $100. And the spread of information in the digital age has made it easier for enthusiasts like Greg Kinman of Tennessee, who posts on social media as Hickok45, to jump through the hoops necessary to buy or build fully automatic weapons legally.\n\nThat rapidly growing market has created new challenges for law enforcement. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is waging a public education campaign to help dispel the notion that machine gun conversion devices like the ones portrayed in Hickok45′s video are legal. Some Democratic-led jurisdictions are taking legal action against Glock in an attempt to make its guns harder to modify.\n\nBut lawmakers and regulators face a complex problem that piecemeal efforts are unlikely to solve. The result is that faster-shooting guns - both legal and illegal - are likely to become an increasingly common fact of modern American life.\n\nMachine guns have played a niche role in the civilian firearms market for about as long as they've existed.\n\nCongress sharply restricted civilian access with the National Firearms Act of 1934 (NFA) but didn't ban machine guns entirely. Instead, it required civilians to register fully automatic weapons and pay a $200 tax each time one changes hands. The transfer cost - roughly equivalent to $4,732 today , after nearly a century of inflation - made machine gun ownership prohibitively expensive for most Americans.\n\nCongress did not criminalize civilian machine gun possession until it passed the Firearm Protection Act of 1986. That law, however, allowed machine guns produced on or before that year. About one-third of the states prohibit machine guns, regardless of when they were made.\n\nAmericans who want to buy a legal machine gun today need to track down a legally registered one, apply for a transfer and pay the tax - which is still $200. The tight supply of pre-1986 machine guns means that most of them easily fetch five-figure prices.\n\nAs of 2021, Americans had registered about 741,000 machine guns in the United States under this process, according to ATF data, up from 457,000 in 2011.\n\nIt's hard to tell what that 62% jump in federally registered automatic weapons really means because the ATF does not publish how many of those weapons are in civilian hands. Private sellers who make or sell modern automatic firearms directly to law enforcement agencies also have to register them under the NFA, which lumps them into the same statistical category as civilian-owned, pre-1986 machine guns.\n\nThe biggest growth in legal access to faster rates of fire has come from tinkerers who have spent the last two decades devising ways to make semiautomatic guns fire faster.\n\nManufacturers submit new designs for products that will make guns fire faster to the ATF to assess their legality before taking them to market. The federal definition of a machine gun is one that fires multiple shots by a \"single function of the trigger.\" That wording gives creative minds a lot of leeway.\n\nThe Akins Accelerator, patented in 2000, pioneered the technique of harnessing a semiautomatic rifle's recoil to make it shoot faster. The spring-operated sliding stock allowed the gun to move back and forth in the shooter's hands. By pushing forward with the non-shooting hand and keeping pressure against the trigger, the shooter could fire bullets at a rate of about 800 per minute.\n\nThe ATF approved it in 2002. Then, in 2005, the agency changed its mind, issuing a new rule that classified the Akins Accelerator as a machine gun.\n\nBy then, however, a separate device based on the Akins Accelerator, the \"bump stock,\" had hit the market. The only significant difference between the two items was that the bump stock lacked the spring found inside the Akins Accelerator. Still, the ATF classified bump stocks as firearm parts instead of machine guns, allowing their sale to civilians for more than a decade.\n\nThat changed with the 2017 mass shooting at the Route 91 Harvest Festival on the Las Vegas Strip, when a gunman on the 32nd floor of a hotel sprayed more than 1,000 rounds into the crowd below from semiautomatic rifles equipped with extended magazines and bump stocks. The shooting left 60 dead and more than 850 injured, making it the deadliest mass shooting carried out by a lone gunman in American history.\n\nThe massacre fostered wide bipartisan consensus in favor of banning bump stocks. But Congress did not move forward with a bill. Instead, then-President Donald Trump directed the ATF to reclassify bump stocks as machine guns.\n\nThat strategy frustrated the gun industry and reformers alike. The National Shooting Sports Federation (NSSF), the trade group for the firearms industry, faulted the ATF for reversing its decision instead of deferring to Congress.\n\n\"People build businesses around ATF's determination letters, but when it became politically expedient, the ATF pulls the rug out and moves the goal posts,\" said Larry Keane, NSSF's senior vice president and general counsel. \"The ATF is making law and exceeding the statute that Congress wrote.\"\n\nEric Rubin, a legal fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, also questioned the legal logic of shoehorning bump stocks into a definition for \"machine guns\" written in the 1930s instead of more straightforward congressional action.\n\n\"There's a story of political dysfunction when it comes to bump stocks that has gotten overlooked. How is it that a device that resulted in the worst mass shooting in American history - and that says a lot - and has no utility for self-defense or hunting can't be banned through a law?\" Rubin said. \"Legislators should respond in an ideal world, when that's consistent with the will of the electorate. We can't stop technology from advancing.\"\n\nAustin, Texas, gun store owner and firearms instructor Michael Cargill sued the ATF the day the bump stock ban went into effect, arguing that only Congress had the power to change the rule and that a bump stock did not meet the definition of automatic fire because the shooter still physically taps the trigger every time a shot is fired.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court appeared sympathetic to Cargill's arguments when it heard the case in February, repeatedly questioning Deputy Solicitor General Brian Fletcher about why Congress hadn't specifically banned the devices and raising concerns that people who had bought the devices legally would be exposed to felony prosecution because of the ATF's flip-flopping. The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the case next month.\n\nRegardless of how they rule, people still have easy access to semiautomatics that shoot with similar speed. The binary trigger, for example, allows the shooter to fire a round when pulling the trigger and another when releasing, effectively doubling the rate of fire of semiautomatic weapons. The ATF does not classify the binary trigger as a machine gun because it counts the pull and release of the trigger as two separate functions of the trigger instead of a single function.\n\nAnd those willing to take the time to learn can bump-fire pretty much any semiautomatic weapon using only their hands and a rubber band or belt loop.\n\nEnthusiasts who want truly unfettered access to modern machine guns are taking advantage of the most glaring loophole by becoming federally licensed firearms dealers.\n\nIndividuals can obtain a Federal Firearms License, or FFL, and sell guns out of their homes. An FFL holder can then apply for a Special Occupational Tax, or SOT, that allows the holder to possess and transfer modern machine guns legally. A separate SOT allows the holder to build machine guns, including at home.\n\nKinman did not respond to a request for comment for this story, but the Hickok45 poster says in one of his videos that he holds an FFL/SOT combination that allows him to possess automatic weapons legally.\n\nThose who deal in machine guns are free to shoot them, noted Cargill. Cargill holds an FFL/SOT combination that allows him to manufacture automatic weapons.\n\n\"I can build my own machine gun - a modern-day machine gun,\" Cargill said. \"I can take it to the range and shoot it every day, as long as that machine gun comes back to the store every night. It has to go to sleep in the gun store.\"\n\nA longstanding ATF ruling holds that making legally obtained machine guns available for others to shoot at an onsite shooting range owned by the FFL holder is \"not considered to be a sale, disposition, or delivery of the firearms,\" an ATF official wrote in an email to HuffPost. \"The on-premises rental of NFA firearms owned by an FFL is therefore permitted.\"\n\nThe ATF requires machine gun sellers to have a business intent when applying for their license - it's not supposed to act as a backdoor to owning machine guns.\n\n\"It has to be for a legal purpose,\" an ATF official told HuffPost. \"It cannot just be, 'I got my FFL and SOT - I'm going to go and make all the machine guns I want.' You cannot do that.\"\n\nSeveral companies online offer to help the average citizen get their hands on a machine gun, often emphasizing the novelty of being able to access post-1986 machine guns. YouTube is chock-full of machine gun demonstrations by people claiming to possess legal authority to shoot automatic weapons.\n\n\"This is a machine gun,\" a YouTuber who posts as \"PSR\" says in one video. \"This is a Glock switch. It is not mine. I am not in possession of it. I am on the range and my friend, who has an FFL07, SOT Class 2, is the owner of this machine gun.\"\n\n\"While there are plenty of people running around with these illegally, of course, this is one that is legal, and my friend behind the camera is supervising me as I test fire this machine gun,\" the YouTuber added. \"With that said. Fuck the NFA. Fuck the machine gun ban.\"\n\nThe same tinkering that birthed bumps stocks has turbocharged the black market for automatic weapons. It doesn't take much technical expertise to convert many semiautomatic firearms into automatic ones. Attaching an autosear, like the one in Hickok45′s video, onto the firearm will do the job.\n\nThe autosear has existed for a long time. But over the last few years, autosears fitted for Glock pistols have proliferated to such a degree that many people have come to call them \"Glock switches.\"\n\nThe overwhelming majority of them are made illegally with 3D printers or sold on shady websites and imported from China and Russia. They often come equipped with trademark-infringing branding that gives the false impression that they're made by Glock itself.\n\nThe ATF has confiscated some 31,000 of them over the last five years . Glocks equipped with switches are increasingly showing up at crime scenes - most notably a mass shooting in Sacramento that left six dead and a dozen more wounded in 2022.\n\nReformers have taken aim at Glock itself, accusing the gun maker of failing to act while criminals take advantage of a flaw in its pistols' design. Unlike many other popular pistols, Glocks typically feature a removable slide plate. Once removed, turning the pistol into an automatic weapon is a simple job - a small protrusion from the autosear blocks a part of the gun called the trigger bar from rising and halting the firing pin from firing another round.\n\nThe city of Chicago sued Glock last month under a new Illinois law that exposes firearm manufacturers to civil claims from people harmed by gun violence. The lawsuit asks the courts to force Glock to modify its pistol designs to make them harder to convert into machine guns.\n\nThe city of Honolulu voted last month to file a similar lawsuit , though it has yet to do so. And this month, New York state Sen. Zellnor Myrie filed a bill that would ban the sale of \"easily modified pistols.\" Though the text names no brand, Myrie's proposition was directed squarely at Glock.\n\nGlock did not respond to HuffPost's requests for comment about the legal actions filed against it.\n\nBut the National Shooting Sports Federation, the firearm industry trade group, views the attacks on Glock as misguided and questions the legal logic of the proposed New York bill. The proposal, which lacks a technical definition of \"easily modifiable pistol,\" would criminalize pretty much all striker-fired pistols, according to Keane.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Reliability is safety.\"\n\nEven if reformers compelled Glock to modify its design tomorrow, there would still be millions of the current generations lingering on the market indefinitely. Those willing to break the law would have a wide array of options for turning semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. Other pistol-makers struggle with the same problem of black market modifications as Glock. And firearms are simple machines. A savvy enthusiast can turn an an AR-15 into a machine gun with a coat hanger .\n\n\"It's not difficult to do any of this stuff,\" said Cargill, the gun store owner. \"It's a matter of do you want to become a felon or not.

Americans seem to double down on gun violence by answering each mass shooting with a resounding shrug.\n\nIn some cases, after a mass shooting, Americans don't just ignore the facts about gun violence, they cash in.

      "text": "Are Ghost Guns Really Guns? Here's What SCOTUS Police Think.\n\nNational Reporter, HuffPost\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday will hear oral arguments in Garland v. VanDerStok, a case that promises to settle the question of whether weapon parts kits for \"ghost guns\" require the same regulation as complete firearms bought and sold at gun stores. The case hinges on a key question: Is a bundle of parts that can be readily assembled into a working firearm the same thing as a gun?\n\nAs nine of the most powerful legal minds prepared to consider whether ghost guns qualify as firearms, Chris Harris thought of someone who may already have an answer: the Supreme Court's police force.\n\n\"I noticed on the link that guns are prohibited on tours (makes sense),\" the vice president of communications for Giffords Law Center, a major gun law reform group, wrote in an email to Supreme Court Police. \"Quick question ― Does that prohibition on firearms apply to unfinished frames similar to the one linked below even though it is incapable of firing in its current state?\" He then included a link to an incomplete Glock-style pistol frame that might be used to assemble a ghost gun.\n\n\"Correct, you cannot bring ANY weapon of ANY kind into the Supreme Court building or grounds,\" the security team responded in a message shared with HuffPost.\n\nFor gun reform advocates, the issue is as obvious as it is for the Supreme Court Police: A gun is a gun.\n\n\"These emails reveal that the Supreme Court itself considers ghost guns to be guns - because they are,\" Harris wrote in an email to HuffPost. \"Justices must apply that same common sense to the law and allow the [Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF)] to do the job it was created to do.\"\n\nThe case raises similar disputes over definitions that doomed a rule implemented during the Trump administration to ban bump stocks , the devices that accelerate semiautomatic fire, after they were used in the October 2017 Route 91 Harvest Music Festival shooting in Las Vegas, which left 60 people dead and more than 400 injured. The Supreme Court contended that the ATF overstepped its bounds by redefining the devices as \"machine guns.\"\n\nTuesday's case does not raise Second Amendment issues . Instead, two individuals, a nonprofit group and several businesses have challenged the Justice Department's authority to alter the definition of \"firearm,\" as well as the definitions of \"frame\" and \"receiver,\" so that home-assembled guns count as firearms under federal law. Because they contain the firing mechanisms, the pistol frames and long gun receivers are subjected to the same regulations as complete firearms, while other parts, such as stocks, trigger groups and magazines, can be bought and sold more freely.\n\nThe government considers frames (for pistols) and receivers (for rifles) the defining parts of a firearm, requiring them to bear serial numbers and subjecting them to the same regulation as as complete guns. Frames and receivers play similar roles in a firearm, housing the firing mechanism.\n\nAmericans have long had the ability to make firearms for private use at home. But in recent years, with the explosion of internet commerce, easier accessibility to high-quality machining and the proliferation of 3D printing, user-assembled guns have become a growing challenge for law enforcement.\n\nUnlike complete guns sold by federally licensed firearms dealers, producers of ghost guns did not have to have a serial number on their products or become federal firearms licensees (FFLs) to sell them at commercial scale until two years ago. Without the FFL requirement, customers were free to purchase ghost gun kits without passing a background check and to order them online - though several states restrict their sale.\n\nThose features make them attractive to criminals. Though ghost guns make up a tiny segment of the U.S. firearms market, they have become far more common at arrests and crime scenes. The ATF submitted 1,600 ghost guns for tracing in 2017, according to court filings. That figure shot up to 19,000 by 2021.\n\nWithout serial numbers, the ATF traced fewer than 1% of more than 45,000 ghost guns to their original purchasers from 2016 to 2021.\n\nTo confront that problem, the ATF, an agency within the Department of Justice, adopted a rule in 2022 clarifying that the term \"firearm\" applied to weapon kits that could be readily assembled into a working gun. It made the same clarification to the terms \"frame\" and \"receiver.\" Weapon kits often include frames and receivers that require a small amount of tooling to make them operable, such as milling down bits of plastic with a grinding tool.\n\n\"Before the ATF acted, literally anyone could obtain an untraceable ghost gun with no background check,\" Harris wrote in an email. \"That should horrify anyone who is concerned about gun violence, crime, or their family's safety.\"\n\nThat change prompted a lawsuit from Jennifer VanDerStok and Michael Andren, two Texans who wanted to buy weapon kits despite the new rule. The Firearms Policy Coalition, a nonprofit that has been involved in numerous lawsuits to maintain or expand Second Amendment rights, is also a plaintiff in the lawsuit, as well as several companies that produce the weapon kits.\n\nThe lawsuit contends that Congress had the chance to define those terms along the lines proposed by the ATF back when it passed the Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA) but didn't. It notes that Tactical Machining LLC, a Florida company that is part of the lawsuit, submitted its weapon kits to the ATF for classification before the new rule; the ATF found that the kits did not constitute firearms.\n\n\"The Final Rule defies the plain language of the GCA and longstanding agency interpretation suggesting that the items at issue here, sometimes colloquially referred to as receiver blanks, unfinished frames or receivers, or 80% frames or receivers, are not firearms,\" the complaint says.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ultimately sided with the plaintiffs, invalidating the rule last year.\n\nThe Biden administration contends that the 5th Circuit's ruling contradicts the spirit of the law and the ATF's longstanding interpretation. The ATF has long held that firearms, frames and receivers retain their classification even when disassembled.\n\nCongress passed the Gun Control Act of 1968 and imposed serialization and background checks largely to confront the problem of criminals, minors and other prohibited buyers from obtaining weapons by mail - challenges that have resurfaced with ghost guns.\n\nUpholding the 5th Circuit's ruling, government lawyers argue, would make it easy to evade decades-old laws designed to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.\n\n\"If a State placed a tax on the sale of tables, chairs, couches, and bookshelves, IKEA could not avoid paying by insisting that it does not sell any of those items and instead sells 'furniture parts kits' that must be assembled by the purchaser,\" Justice Department attorneys wrote in a court filing. \"So too with guns: A company in the business of selling kits that can be assembled into working firearms in minutes - and that are designed, marketed, and used for that express purpose - is in the business of selling firearms.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Life in America's Culture of Ultraviolence\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\n\"I hated having the power to kill someone,\" my father once told me about carrying a gun. But many, many Americans seem to love it.\n\nA child aims a handgun using a computer simulator during the 142nd annual National Rifle Association convention on May 4, 2013, in Houston.\n\nWhen I was 6 years old, I learned from my mother that my father had sometimes carried a gun. When he was a lieutenant in the Army, she told me, he would be \"officer of the day\" once a month. Usually soldiers didn't walk around base armed, but when he was officer of the day, he was responsible for patrolling the barracks and had to carry a loaded revolver.\n\nThis thrilled me in a way that nothing had thrilled me before in my brief life. I already knew from watching TV that guns were tremendously exciting . Good men of various genres shot bad men of different types. The world was full of problems, and guns were always the electrifying solution, banishing wrongdoing from the universe one squib at a time. And now it turned out Dad had possessed one of these devices of glorious power.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nI rushed to find him so I could learn the details. I located him in his basement office, where he did something that involved several concepts I was unclear about: Apparently he had homework (?) from his job (??), which was math (???). I stood on the threshold, my head full of so many questions there was a traffic jam at my mouth. Finally I got some of them out: Was it true? He used to have a gun? Was it as amazing as I believed, or even more so ? I was already calculating which friends to tell first about my father and guns.\n\nAn expression passed across his face that I'd never seen before. He looked pained in some profound way.\n\nYes, he told me. He'd carried a gun when he was officer of the day. He always dreaded it as the time approached on the calendar. He looked at me and said: \"I hated having the power to kill someone.\"\n\nMy boisterous enthusiasm suddenly halted, as though I'd run into a brick wall at 200 miles an hour. On the one hand, there was my fervid imagination about the world. On the other hand, there was Dad. Much to consider.\n\nI've been considering this ever since. I considered it when I later learned that my father had once been firing a machine gun on the Army range and it exploded. There were two codified ways to fire a machine gun, he said: lying down or sitting cross-legged. He'd been lying down, and the shrapnel passed directly over him, where his face would have been if he'd been sitting up. Then the Army tried to charge him for the cost of the machine gun.\n\nI considered it the summer after my sophomore year of high school, when two of my classmates went to the beach in Delaware with their families. One was my neighbor from the next street over; the other was his best friend. My neighbor found a gun in his brother's suitcase. As he and his best friend examined it, my neighbor accidentally shot and killed his friend. My neighbor was so distraught that he himself had to be taken to the hospital and sedated.\n\nI considered it when I was walking home at 6 a.m. through a steamy New York City August morning after an unsuccessful date, covered in blue face makeup. (It's a long story.) As I passed a guy on the street, he yelled \"Watch out, bluey!\" and whipped a grape at my head. I turned around and advanced toward him through the garbage-scented air, as every cell in my body shrieked at me to exact revenge. He put his hand in his jacket as though reaching for a gun. It took everything my cerebrum had to tell my cells to stand down and retreat.\n\nA boy plays with a machine gun during a graduation ceremony for Rangers at Eglin Air Force Base in western Florida on Jan. 27, 2006.\n\nAll this considering has led me to several extremely unpleasant conclusions. First, there is no escape from America's culture of guns and ultraviolence. I've consciously tried to stay as far away from it as possible. But it has touched my life glancingly all the same and could do so again more directly at any moment, just as it may touch yours.\n\nSecond, there is something in a boy that loves a gun. America's adoration of these death machines exists thanks to decades of cultivation and accentuation of an aspect of human nature, but it did not create it. After the school shooting in Texas, I called my friend Robert ToTeras, a film and TV composer in Los Angeles with two children. He told me that when he heard about it, he asked his wife to come into his home studio, \"and I just started bawling.\"\n\nBut he and I have discussed for years that guns radiate some kind of fatal beauty, and you can't be honest about this if you don't acknowledge it. Robert himself used to go to a shooting range for pure recreation, until he stopped when he became disturbed by gun culture and its political exploitation by the right. With musical instruments, he points out, \"something in your body connects with them, they just scream - pick me up and use me in the way that I'm intended to be used.\" The same thing, he says, is true of guns: \"It's the way it's shaped for your hand. It's just naturally alluring.\"\n\nThird, America has changed during my lifetime, and it is never changing back. When my father told me about carrying a gun, it would never have occurred to him in a million years that 6-year-old me might head off to school one day and never return. Now, \"I know I can't protect my children from something like this,\" says Robert. \"I can't protect my family.\"\n\nThe great reporter William Greider made a dark prediction 30 years ago in his 1992 book \"Who Will Tell the People.\" Greider believed that progressive, democratic politics were necessary to keep the U.S. from falling to pieces. \"The nation's sense of its own continuing search for something better is endangered,\" he wrote, \"and, without that civic faith, this nation is in deep trouble. If democratic character is lost, America has the potential to deteriorate into a rather brutish place, ruled by naked power and random social aggression.\" That had always been true for many Americans, of course. But Greider saw the future, and now the entrenchment of minority rule has made it true for everyone.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren't on the beat?\n\nThe kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable. The Intercept is an independent nonprofit news outlet. We don't have ads, so we depend on our members to help us hold the powerful to account. Joining is simple and doesn't need to cost a lot: You can become a sustaining member for as little as $3 or $5 a month.

They had come together as part of the Defense Trade Advisory Group, which advises the State Department about how to make it easier to export U.S. weapons around the world.

Photo: Claudia Torrens So when the time came for public comment on the proposal, Antonio Tizapa stood. Tizapa's son Jorge Antonio was one of 43 students from a teachers college in Ayotzinapa in the Mexican state of Guerrero, who were attacked and forcibly disappeared in 2014 . The local police implicated in the students' disappearance were armed with U.S.-produced Colt assault rifles.\n\nAntonio Tizapa, father of Jorge Antonio Tizapa, poses for a photo at City University of New York on March 18, 2015. The 47-year-old Mexican immigrant last saw his son, who was among the students that disappeared in 2014 in Ayotzinapa, when the boy was 5 years old.\n\nThe chair, Bill Wade of the Pentagon contractor L3 Technologies, clearly did not want Tizapa to say anything. \"We're really pressed for time, unless you have a question,\" Wade said. Tizapa had planned to speak in Spanish through an interpreter, but, faced with the chair's hostility, he spoke directly in English.\n\n\"My name is Antonio, I am the father of one of the 43 disappeared students in Mexico,\" he said. \"Because the police used weapons, my son disappeared 40 months ago. He is my son. Please, don't send more weapons to Mexico. I am looking for my son. There are not just 43, it's more.\"\n\nAfter Tizapa spoke, Wade moved on to the next comment without missing a beat or acknowledging his appeal in any way.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe Trump administration is set to make it easier for guns to flow to forces like those that disappeared Tizapa's son. As part of an \"Arms Transfer Initiative\" aimed at boosting all U.S. weapons sales , the administration will likely soon announce policies that would ease the rules by which the United States sends guns and munitions abroad. Under the new regime, oversight of export licenses is expected to move from the State Department to the Commerce Department, and many fear there will be less scrutiny with regards to human rights and national security concerns.\n\nMexico has already been a major beneficiary of easy U.S. arms exports. Since 2007, Mexico and the United States have undertaken a joint security strategy aimed at battling cartels and controlling narcotrafficking and other illicit activities. That strategy has coincided with an enormous increase in firearms sales from the U.S. to Mexico.\n\nRecent Mexican and U.S. government data analyzed by The Intercept shows that legal U.S. gun and explosives exports to Mexico are higher than ever, and that the guns are flowing to all levels of the Mexican security and police apparatus. Legal U.S. firearm and ammunition exports to Mexico between 2015 and 2017 amounted to almost $123 million, according to U.S. Census Bureau trade records - more than a dozen times what they were between 2002 and 2004. Last year, four times such exports went to Mexico than to any other Latin American nation. But if the aim of firearms sales to Mexico is to abate criminal violence, it has failed dramatically. Homicide victims in 2017 in Mexico surpassed 29,000 , the highest on record.\n\nThe exponential growth in sales to Mexico has not been accompanied by controls to track where the guns go or to ensure that they do not land in the hands of police or military units that are credibly alleged to have committed gross human rights abuses or colluded with criminal groups - the very groups that security forces are being armed to combat. Legally exported U.S. firearms have been used in massacres, disappearances, and by security forces that collude with criminal groups in Mexico on a broad scale.\n\nThree members of the Mexican army keep watch in the residential Anahuac neighborhood in Monterrey, Nuevo León state, Mexico on Feb. 5, 2012, after clashes between a group of gunmen and Mexican army.\n\nThe Mexican military is the only legal importer of firearms into Mexico. In turn, the Mexican army is the only legal distributor of guns within the country; personal possession of firearms is highly restricted, with a single military-run retail store for gun sales in Mexico City. Aside from the weapons that the military acquires for its own forces, most legally imported guns in Mexico are sold to state and local police forces. More than half of the 305,086 guns sold by the Mexican Secretariat of National Defense - which includes the army and air force and is known by its Spanish acronym SEDENA - from 2010 through 2016 were sold to police, according to documents released by SEDENA in response to a public records request.\n\nSince criminal organizations arm themselves with U.S. assault weapons illegally trafficked from the U.S. retail market, legal exports to police and the military are part of a deadly arms race with these organizations. More than 20,000 firearms obtained by Mexican state and federal police went missing or were stolen from 2006 to 2017, according to SEDENA data. More than 7,000 of the weapons went missing from police in Mexico City and Mexico state. In the state of Guerrero, the number of guns gone missing or stolen between 2010 and 2016 amounts to nearly one-fifth of the firearms police acquired in the state during the same period.\n\nThere is also evidence that firearms legally imported from the United States have been used in some of the worst human rights violations in Mexico in recent years. The local police who attacked the 43 Ayotzinapa students were armed with AR6530 rifles , a model variant of the AR-15, legally supplied through licensed shipments from Colt, according to documents in the judicial record.\n\nAn investigation by Mexico's National Human Rights Commission found that Federal Police, who carried out the massacre of 22 persons in Tanhuato, Michoacán, in 2015, killed five of them with Dillon Aero guns mounted on Black Hawk helicopters. The Dillon guns fire some 125 rounds per second, and Mexico obtained 16 of them for the army in 2013 , for just over $1 million, and then another 12 in 2015, according to Mexico's most recent Arms Trade Treaty report .\n\nA customer validates his purchase with a soldier before exiting the country's lone gun store in Mexico City on July 15, 2016.\n\nThese are unusual cases, in that we know which weapons were involved. Most homicides in Mexico - including those carried out by state forces - are never investigated, so there is no judicial record identifying the firearms that were used. But the volume of U.S. firearms going to Mexico, combined with the well-established record of police and military forces colluding with organized crime and committing gross human rights violations, means that U.S. guns are certainly at the scene of many more crimes.\n\nThe example of U.S. gun producer Sig Sauer is instructive as to how guns move from the military to police. In April 2015, the U.S. State Department issued a $266 million license to Sig Sauer: $265 million for gun sales, and $1 million for other equipment and technical support to the Mexican navy, defense ministry, interior ministry, and federal and state police forces. That year, Mexico imported 3,060 rifles, 3,819 pistols, and 505 machines guns produced by Sig Sauer's New Hampshire production facilities. The license also permits the Mexican navy to assemble Sig Sauer MPX submachine guns, capable of firing 850 rounds a minute , from \"kits\" made of parts produced by the company. All told, as of January, $29.3 million in guns and gun parts had been exported from Sig Sauer and other New Hampshire manufacturers to Mexico since April 2015, according to Census Bureau trade records - meaning that Sig Sauer has at least $235 million left in sales to make before its license expires in 2024.\n\nOn its end, since 2014, the Mexican military has sold 1,400 U.S.-produced Sig Sauer firearms to police in 18 Mexican states, including states where there is an extensive record of collusion with organized crime, such as Tamaulipas, Michoacán, and Chihuahua, SEDENA records show. State authorities also distribute these weapons to local police; in the state of Mexico, for example, Sig Sauer weapons were sold to police in five municipalities, while Colt weapons went to three other municipalities, as well as state police, according to a state police document.\n\nAccording to data recently released by the Mexican military, other U.S. gun producers that have exported thousands of firearms each to Mexico for use by the police or private individuals include: Colt, Bushmaster, Mossberg, Smith & Wesson, DS Arms, Remington, and Browning. The Mexican military has also purchased military weapons from U.S. producers Nammo Talley, Barrett Firearms, and Knight Armament Company since 2014. In Veracruz, the police responsible for at least 15 death squad murders purchased, since 2013, at least 674 firearms exported by three U.S. arms companies: Colt, Bushmaster, and Combined Systems, according to the Veracruz public security secretariat. Local police in Veracruz also obtained weapons from Sig Sauer and Connecticut-based Mossberg.\n\nBeyond guns, U.S. Census Bureau trade data show that just over $8.3 million in military explosives were delivered to Mexico from Arizona in September and October 2017, more than in any year in the last decade for all states combined. (In all of 2016, military explosives exported from the entire United States to Mexico amounted to less than $800,000.) The Census records do not indicate which company exported the explosives. In addition, Milkor USA, based in Tucson, sold M32A1 grenade launchers used by the Mexican military special forces . In 2017, more than $5 million worth of grenade launchers were exported to Mexico from Texas alone.\n\nThe permissive U.S. attitude toward gun exports has prompted several gun producers based in the European Union to beef up production in the United States, thus evading EU restrictions on arms sales to countries with widespread violence or human rights violations. Sig Sauer, for instance, whose parent company is in Germany, more than quadrupled global exports from the United States between 2009 and 2016, according to data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. (Germany stopped approving licenses for gun exports to Mexico after 2010.) Beretta (Italy) and Glock (Austria) produce guns in Tennessee and Georgia, respectively, and are the two brands that Mexico has imported in the largest numbers since 2007, per SEDENA records. The State Department in February 2016 issued a license to Glock to export more than 11,000 9mm and .45 caliber pistols from its Smyrna, Georgia, facility for re-sale to Mexican police.\n\nHundreds of firearms are displayed before being destroyed at the Morelos military headquarters in Tijuana, Mexico, on Aug. 12, 2016. According to the army, thousands of weapons were obtained in several seizures and handed in by citizens during Mexico's firearm exchange program.\n\nThe State Department is supposed to track end users of U.S. arms exports, to ensure that they don't go missing or end up in the hands of criminal elements - exactly as is feared is the case in Mexico. But the methods for tracking gun shipments have systemic problems, State Department officials admit behind the scenes. And with the Trump administration's proposed changes, the process could be undermined even further.\n\nOfficials in the State Department's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, speaking on background during a meeting last summer, told me that U.S. and Mexican systems for identifying firearm shipments from the United States to Mexico are incompatible and incapable of talking with each other, making it impossible to track firearm shipments without physical inspections, which happen only occasionally.\n\nIn addition, when the State Department Bureau of Human Rights, Democracy and Labor, or DRL, receives firearms exports license applications to review for human rights concerns, approximately 80 percent of the applications show the end user as the military in Mexico City, according to a DRL official in December, who also spoke on background. That's entirely inconsistent with SEDENA's data, which shows that most of more than 305,000 firearms it distributed between 2010 and 2016 went to police and private users outside Mexico City. (Although the U.S. government compiles and releases some records on gun exports, Mexican public records requests have resulted in this more granular look at the end users in Mexico of U.S. guns. But Mexico recently passed an \"Internal Security Law,\" which classifies more military information and may make it harder for the public to access those records.)\n\nWhen the applications did identify units that would receive the firearms, according to a State Department official who spoke on background in May 2017, DRL did not crosscheck those units with a human rights database known as INVEST, which is designed for screening military and police units nominated for U.S. assistance. A State Department spokesperson said that commercial arms sales are subject to a different process from assistance, \"which still takes into account reports of human rights violations, including by foreign security units,\" but neglecting the INVEST database may help explain how many end users with tarred records received U.S. gun exports.\n\nFor its part, the Trump administration is poised to make the gun export licensing system favor the arms industry even more, with a planned transfer of export licensing from the State Department to the Commerce Department.\n\nThe arms industry has long pushed for this change - and won significant changes from the Obama administration easing export restrictions on many types of military equipment. Despite soaring arms sales under Obama, human rights controls remained nominally a priority, but many are concerned that the Trump administration's overhaul will jettison them. In announcing the Arms Trade Initiative last week, the White House included human rights among the things to be taken into consideration, but it remains to be seen how vetting will actually be applied. A move to Commerce would remove congressional oversight of the licenses, which has in the past led to the cancellation of gun export deals to the Philippines - where armed forces have allegedly carried out thousands of extrajudicial killings - and to Turkey's presidential guard, after guard members beat up demonstrators in Washington, D.C.\n\nWorried by Trump's proposal, three U.S. senators wrote last September that firearms exports \"should be subject to more - not less - rigorous controls and oversight.\"\n\nGiven the record under today's controls, it seems certain that loosening them further will mean that Antonio Tizapa and the tens of thousands of other Mexicans who have lost family members to gun violence will be joined by new victims of U.S.-sourced weaponry.\n\nTop photo: Mexican soldiers patrol during an operation against alleged members of organized crime in Culiacán, Mexico, on Feb. 16, 2018.\n\nWAIT!

Not for hunting. Not for sport, unless your sport is murder.\n\nWatch what happens in Congress in the coming days. Empty platitudes. Bullshit proposals: \"We must do something about this.\" And, of course, a lot of prayer. But none of that is going to change to the fact that we live in a sick society that believes guns bring us security. A nation that has been taught by powerful, twisted people that guns aren't part of the problem. That everything except guns - and how easy they are to get - is the problem. Mental illness is the problem. Muslims are the problem. Gangbangers in Chicago are the problem. Not having a gun is the problem. And when these mass shootings happen, most of the time, the shooter is a white man. We want to know who he was, why did it, what his motive was, as we should.

One headline (since changed ) in the Washington Post said he \"enjoyed gambling, country music, lived quiet life before massacre.\" Black victim is a thug; white shooter is a character from a country western song who just happens to murder 58 people.

And let's make them speak for their entire race.\n\nWe all know why the narratives are different. And another thing: We're hearing once again that this is the most deadly mass shooting in U.S. history. It's just not true. There are several examples of white gunmen killing huge numbers of black people. The 1917 East St. Louis massacre resulted in an estimated 100 black people being shot and lynched; in 1873, between 60 and 150 black people were massacred in Colfax, Louisiana.

Presidents who get prayerful are praised instead of held accountable for the role they play in sustaining this nation's gun addiction, in promoting the gun industry that profits off of murder. When the shooter is an Arab or a Muslim, they are often immediately branded as a suspected terrorist. After Las Vegas, the president and other politicians called this shooter \"deranged\" or \"insane\" or another word that's lost all meaning - \"evil.\"\n\nWhen it's a Muslim shooter, it's perfectly acceptable to talk about what the U.S. response should be: watchlisting, banning people from entering the country, surveillance of mosques. But when white people do the killing, don't talk about guns. That's politicizing the tragedy, disrespecting the victims. Whether it's someone inspired by ISIS murdering his coworkers or a white man shooting up a school or a white man gunning down Sikhs because he thought they were Muslims, they all do it with guns.\n\nWe don't need prayers.

After Las Vegas, the president and other politicians called this shooter \"deranged\" or \"insane\" or another word that's lost all meaning - \"evil.\"\n\nWhen it's a Muslim shooter, it's perfectly acceptable to talk about what the U.S. response should be: watchlisting, banning people from entering the country, surveillance of mosques. But when white people do the killing, don't talk about guns. That's politicizing the tragedy, disrespecting the victims. Whether it's someone inspired by ISIS murdering his coworkers or a white man shooting up a school or a white man gunning down Sikhs because he thought they were Muslims, they all do it with guns.\n\nWe don't need prayers. We don't need fake unity over the tragedy. We need to look at the common factor in all of these heinous acts of mass murder: guns. Anything else is just putting a Band-Aid on a gaping, infected, and lethal wound on our society.\n\nAdapted from Jeremy Scahill's commentary on Intercepted .\n\nTop photo: Weapons on display at the K&W Gunworks store on Jan. 5, 2016, in Delray Beach, Florida.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "The U.S. Is Organizing a $5 Million Gun Sale to Mexican Forces Accused of Murder and Kidnapping\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nAs the two countries meet this week to discuss security cooperation, lawmakers see the sale as evidence of a systemic problem.\n\nThe Biden administration is pressing forward with the sale of millions of dollars in weapons to specialized elements of the Mexican military despite growing concern from lawmakers over the recipients' abhorrent human rights records.\n\nIf completed, Sig Sauer, a New Hampshire-based company, would sell more than $5 million worth of assault rifles and suppressors to Mexico's navy and marines. Long considered by U.S. officials to be Washington's most trustworthy ally in the war on drugs, the Mexican navy, particularly its elite marine special operations teams, has been linked to a string of kidnappings and extrajudicial killings in recent years.\n\nAnnounced in July, the State Department's approval of the sale came just months after 30 Mexican marines were arrested for orchestrating a wave of disappearances and murders in a case that has drawn international attention and condemnation. The U.S. government takes human rights into consideration in all cases involving the approval of gun sales to foreign security forces, the State Department said in an email to The Intercept. The department refused to say how those standards were applied in Sig Sauer's sale to the Mexican navy specifically. Sig Sauer did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe weapons deal is a touchpoint in a wider set of concerns raised by Democratic lawmakers in recent months surrounding oversight of the multimillion-dollar flow of U.S.-made guns to the Mexican military as the two countries embark on what both have described as a new era of security cooperation. \"We have a number of substantive concerns with these transfers based on recent reporting and credible documentation of abuses,\" a Democratic aide on the House Foreign Affairs Committee told The Intercept. \"We are currently engaged with the State Department on such concerns.\"\n\nThis week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Attorney General Merrick Garland, and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas will travel to Mexico City for a multiday \" high-level security dialogue \" with their Mexican counterparts. In recent months, Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard has repeatedly underscored Mexico's intention to overhaul its relationship with Washington by leaving behind a $3 billion security aid package known as the Mérida Initiative. Senior Biden administration officials have signaled support for the idea.\n\nThe focus on the aid program, however, is somewhat misleading. Though Mérida did begin with an emphasis on sending military aid and equipment to Mexico in the mid-2000s, it has gone through various iterations since. Today, the program is more focused on reform of Mexico's judicial system and other rule of law and civil society initiatives than on hard-edged drug war operations. The militarization of Mexico that Mérida came to symbolize, and the abuses that have come with it, is arguably better reflected in the lucrative private arming of problematic security forces resulting from weapons deals like the one President Joe Biden's State Department approved this summer. As both governments' pursuit of the Sig Sauer sale suggests, that pipeline of weaponry appears well entrenched.\n\nThe visit by Biden's top Cabinet-level officials to Mexico City this week follows months of inquiries from Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy's office concerning exactly how those deals work and whether the U.S. really knows where the weapons it is approving are going.\n\nLast month, Leahy's office sent Blinken a letter , co-signed by Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, and Dick Durbin of Illinois, linking the Sig Sauer sale to a broader pattern of U.S.-made weapons, including those manufactured by Sig Sauer, making their way to units credibly implicated in kidnappings and massacres. If the U.S. government cannot keep track of where the weapons exports that it is approving are ultimately headed, the senators argued, then those sales should stop.\n\nThe senators' letter was based in part on Mexican military records that tie U.S.-made guns to specific and notorious cases of abuses by Mexican security forces. Those records were obtained through public records requests by John Lindsay-Poland, a researcher and analyst with Global Exchange, a nonprofit human rights organization that publishes reports on U.S. weapons exports to Mexico through its Stop U.S. Arms to Mexico initiative. (In 2018, Lindsay-Poland wrote about U.S. arms sales to Mexico for The Intercept .)\n\n\"This letter from the four senators, it was an important step,\" Lindsay-Poland said. \"Nobody in Congress has said if certain conditions are not met, we should stop selling these weapons.\"\n\nMexican marines on patrol near a maximum security prison in Almoloya de Juárez, Mexico, on July 12, 2015.\n\nPresented as Mexico's answer to the Navy SEALs, Mexico's marines have much in common with their northern counterparts, including responsibility for their country's most sensitive operations. With deep U.S. security connections, marine special forces have for years enjoyed an aura of untouchability in the face of grave human rights abuse allegations. Recently, however, that's begun to change.\n\nIn April, 30 marines from across the country were called to Mexico City under the auspices of an unspecified mission. Once on the ground, the marines were arrested on kidnapping charges. In total, 257 marines were suspected in the abduction or murder of nearly 60 men, women, and children, including American citizens, over a matter of months in early 2018.\n\nThe arrests were largely due to the efforts of families of disappeared persons and local human rights advocates in the northern Mexican state of Tamaulipas, whose decision to speak up in one of the border's most dangerous places came at great personal risk.\n\nIn the winter of 2017, an element of marines led by a commander who was said to have a \" direct line with the Pentagon's military intelligence \" was sent to the Tamaulipan city of Nuevo Laredo, just across the border from Laredo, Texas, as part of an anti-cartel offensive. By the time the unit's six-month deployment was through, nearly 50 people last seen in marine custody were gone - some turned up dead, and others were never seen again. The victims had no evident ties to organized crime and included two 14-year-old boys, whose bodies were later found half-buried in the desert.\n\nThe following spring, families of Nuevo Laredo's disappeared blocked the international bridge into Texas, bringing millions of dollars in trade to a halt. With activists calling the marines out by name, the action drew the attention of Mexico's biggest newsrooms. Bit by bit, the horrors of what had happened in Nuevo Laredo came to light, as families described loved ones taken away by heavily armed marines without explanation or answers as to where they had gone. The United Nations Human Rights Office in Mexico launched an investigation and by the end of the month had confirmed 21 disappearance cases. The office's high commissioner called on Mexico to \"take urgent steps to end a wave of disappearances in and around the city of Nuevo Laredo.\"\n\nTwo years later, an investigation by the human rights office of the Mexican federal government concluded that the marines had abducted 27 people in Nuevo Laredo - 12 of whom turned up dead - and perpetrated a series of \"illegal searches and arbitrary detentions.\" The commission has separately found evidence of widespread torture and sexual abuse in cases involving individuals in marine custody. In July of this year, in the wake of the marines' arrests in Mexico City, the navy offered a rare acknowledgment and apology for its crimes in Tamaulipas.\n\nIn a country where 98 percent of violent crimes, including murders, go unsolved and security forces are routinely involved in some of the most heinous attacks, the fact that so many members of the military's most elite teams were facing possible accountability marked a moment unlike anything in recent history.\n\nIt would have been all but impossible for State Department officials with an eye toward Mexico to miss one of the country's biggest national security and human rights stories, one described in the New York Times , the BBC , and the Washington Post . Just last year, Politico Magazine published a deeply reported investigation into the case of Jorge Antonio Dominguez, an 18-year-old U.S. citizen who was snatched off the street by marines in April 2018 and remains missing to this day. In the article, a former high-ranking official in the State Department's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs described how closely the department monitors media reporting on issues like kidnapping.\n\nAnd yet the State Department, in its July notification to Congress , which came less than two weeks after the Mexican navy acknowledged responsibility for the Nuevo Laredo kidnappings, listed \"human rights\" among the issues it reviewed in approving the sale of millions of dollars in Sig Sauer weaponry to the navy.\n\nThe Intercept asked the State Department what criteria it used to arrive at its conclusion.\n\n\"Without speaking to individual cases, all proposed defense sales and transfers are assessed on their individual merits in accordance with the Arms Export Control Act, the U.S. Conventional Arms Transfer Policy and other related law and policy guidance which accounts for a broad range of political and economic considerations including human rights,\" a State Department spokesperson said in an email.\n\nThe relationship between the State Department, Sig Sauer, and the Mexican navy - and by extension the Mexican marines - long predates the sale in question today and is in fact part of a multiyear exchange of guns and cash.\n\nIn 2015, the State Department approved a license for Sig Sauer to export $265 million worth of assembly kits for semi-automatic pistols and submachine guns to the Mexican navy through 2024. By 2018, as human rights abuses by the marines began picking up coverage, $26.7 million in gun parts and $4.3 million in complete guns had already been exported through the deal.\n\n\"This means that Sig Sauer has at least $234 million left in sales to make before its license expires in 2024,\" a report published by Lindsay-Poland and colleagues at the Mexican Commission for the Defense and Promotion of Human Rights noted at the time. \"If the license is completely fulfilled, the navy's weapons purchases from Sig Sauer alone would nearly double the already elevated U.S. exports of guns and gun parts to Mexico.\"\n\nThousands of protesters march to demand justice for the disappearance of 43 students in the state of Guerrero, in Mexico City on Oct. 8, 2014.\n\nWith hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S.-made guns and gear on the line and repeated evidence of the recipients of that equipment engaging in murder and kidnapping, a handful of lawmakers are pushing for answers on the oversight of U.S. weapons to Mexico.\n\nFor decades, oversight of arms exports to foreign governments was the sole responsibility of the State Department. Under former President Donald Trump, elements of those responsibilities were controversially shifted to the Department of Commerce. Under the revised framework, State approves licenses and has responsibility for end-use controls for fully automatic firearms, while Commerce approves licenses and has responsibility for end-use controls for semi-automatic and nonautomatic firearms. The shift, which removed meaningful congressional oversight of the licensing process, marked the accomplishment of a long-standing goal of the arms industry.\n\nIn March, Leahy, Durbin, Merkley, and Booker sent Blinken a letter - co-signed by Sens. Robert Menendez, Ben Cardin, Chris Van Hollen, and Tim Kaine - seeking information on how the new oversight regime was playing out with respect to Mexico, the top government buyer of American guns in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe senators cited several reasons for concern. The lawmakers pointed to documents from the Mexican Secretariat of National Defense, or SEDENA, showing that U.S.-made guns, many of them manufactured by Sig Sauer and then purchased by SEDENA, were sold to security forces implicated in massacres and extrajudicial killings going back years and extending into the present day.\n\nIn September 2019, members of a U.S.-trained Tamaulipas state police special operations unit known as the GOPES massacred eight civilians in Nuevo Laredo, the same border city where the marines had carried out their abductions a year before. In the two months that followed, \"SEDENA sold hundreds of Sig Sauer rifles and pistols that it imported from the United States\" to the public security office under which the GOPES are housed. The senators noted: \"The sale to this unit proceeded even after the United Nations announced within two weeks of these killings that it was investigating them, and prior to a trial of three officers of the Tamaulipas SSP, which has not yet taken place as of the writing of this letter.\"\n\nTwelve more members of the GOPES were arrested for another massacre in March of this year, accused of murdering 19 migrants and incinerating their remains just south of the Texas border. \"Online images posted by the Tamaulipas state government show GOPES agents with Sig Sauer rifles,\" the senators wrote. Despite the trail of violence, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Drug Enforcement Administration officials in Mexico presented the commander of the GOPES with an award in August , citing his \"exceptional,\" \"outstanding,\" and \"continuous contributions\" to joint U.S.-Mexico law enforcement efforts.\n\nThe military documents reviewed by the lawmakers also showed that U.S.-made guns were used in one of the most notorious crimes in Mexican history: the 2014 disappearance by Mexican security forces of 43 students from the rural teachers college known as Ayotzinapa, in the state of Guerrero. Recently, leaked testimony in the case has pointed to the Mexican army's direct involvement in the students' disappearance. From 2010 to 2016, nearly one-fifth of guns purchased by the army and sold to police forces in Guerrero went missing or were stolen.\n\n\"The documents from SEDENA show that Colt Manufacturing was notified on February 3, 2015, that hundreds of rifles it produced were exported and destined for police forces in eight states,\" the senators wrote, including the public security office in Guerrero. \"That notification came only two months after public reports implicated the Guerrero SSP in the forced disappearance of 43 students in Iguala, Guerrero, on September 26, 2014. Judicial documents from the investigation of the Ayotzinapa disappearances show that municipal police in Guerrero implicated in the disappearances were armed with Colt rifles.\"\n\nTaken together, the documents pointed to a potentially systemic misrepresentation of where American guns are going in Mexico spanning more than a decade. The Mexican army provided hundreds of end-use certificates for \"U.S. exported firearms destined for state and local police forces between 2008 and 2019,\" the senators wrote. \"Although the firearms were exported for use by police forces, in every single certificate, SEDENA listed itself - the army - as the end user.\"\n\nGiven the alarming picture emerging from the military's own records, the lawmakers asked whether the government tracked U.S.-made weapons that the Mexican army sells to police units; whether embassy officials were aware of the sales to Mexican security forces accused of killings and abductions in Guerrero and Tamaulipas; and how oversight of arms exports would function with the recent transfer of responsibilities to the Department of Commerce.\n\nThe State Department, in its reply the following month, delivered just one week after the marines were taken into custody in Mexico City, indicated that its ability to track weapons once they are sold to the Mexican military is limited and deferred to the Commerce Department on matters of oversight going forward. As for whether U.S. officials were \"aware that U.S. firearms were sold for use by police forces in Guerrero and Tamaulipas,\" the department did not provide a direct answer, instead listing its general policies.\n\nThe lawmakers were not satisfied. \"We remain concerned to learn from your response that the U.S. Embassy has not been consulted about instances regarding Mexican police forces as end users of U.S. exported firearms,\" they wrote in a follow-up letter last month. \"We are also concerned about a proposed license to export $5.5 million worth of Sig Sauer automatic rifles to the Mexican Navy, whose units are implicated in forced disappearances and torture, without adequate end user controls.\" The senators pointed to a 2019 report which found that more than 65 percent of \"detainees over a ten-year period said that they suffered torture while in Navy custody, including asphyxia, electric shocks, burns, and rape.\"\n\nThe lawmakers called on Blinken to \"immediately begin a review of all existing licenses for exports of firearms to Mexico for use by the Mexican police and Navy\" before and since March 2020. They also called for a suspension of licenses in cases in which end users appeared in a government database known as INVEST, which the State Department uses to monitor abuses by security units that receive U.S. training.\n\n\"Given the extensive documentation of widespread infiltration of Mexican police forces by criminal organizations, and police and military participation in atrocities, we expected the Departments of State and Commerce to establish mechanisms to ensure that U.S. firearms do not contribute to these crimes,\" they wrote. Instead, they said, \"the Commerce Department issued a rule change in December 2020, without public comment, that eases firearms exports to Mexico.\"\n\nAs for guns going to problem units in Guerrero and Tamaulipas, the senators wrote that the State Department's April response \"clarified how licenses for firearms exports to Mexico should identify end users, but did not state whether this was the case for the firearms transferred in 2015 to state police in Guerrero and in 2019 to state police in Tamaulipas.\"\n\nThe lawmakers demanded to know: \"When were U.S. Embassy staff or other U.S. officials first aware that U.S. firearms were sold for use by police forces in Guerrero and Tamaulipas? What actions were taken, if any, to prevent further U.S.-exported firearms from ending up in the hands of these police forces? If no action was taken, why not? We asked these questions in our March letter, and ask them again.\"\n\nThe senators have yet to receive answers to their questions, a spokesperson for Leahy's office said in an email to The Intercept, though, he added, their inquiry continues.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

The lawmakers pointed to documents from the Mexican Secretariat of National Defense, or SEDENA, showing that U.S.-made guns, many of them manufactured by Sig Sauer and then purchased by SEDENA, were sold to security forces implicated in massacres and extrajudicial killings going back years and extending into the present day.\n\nIn September 2019, members of a U.S.-trained Tamaulipas state police special operations unit known as the GOPES massacred eight civilians in Nuevo Laredo, the same border city where the marines had carried out their abductions a year before. In the two months that followed, \"SEDENA sold hundreds of Sig Sauer rifles and pistols that it imported from the United States\" to the public security office under which the GOPES are housed. The senators noted: \"The sale to this unit proceeded even after the United Nations announced within two weeks of these killings that it was investigating them, and prior to a trial of three officers of the Tamaulipas SSP, which has not yet taken place as of the writing of this letter.\"\n\nTwelve more members of the GOPES were arrested for another massacre in March of this year, accused of murdering 19 migrants and incinerating their remains just south of the Texas border. \"Online images posted by the Tamaulipas state government show GOPES agents with Sig Sauer rifles,\" the senators wrote. Despite the trail of violence, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Drug Enforcement Administration officials in Mexico presented the commander of the GOPES with an award in August , citing his \"exceptional,\" \"outstanding,\" and \"continuous contributions\" to joint U.S.-Mexico law enforcement efforts.\n\nThe military documents reviewed by the lawmakers also showed that U.S.-made guns were used in one of the most notorious crimes in Mexican history: the 2014 disappearance by Mexican security forces of 43 students from the rural teachers college known as Ayotzinapa, in the state of Guerrero. Recently, leaked testimony in the case has pointed to the Mexican army's direct involvement in the students' disappearance. From 2010 to 2016, nearly one-fifth of guns purchased by the army and sold to police forces in Guerrero went missing or were stolen.\n\n\"The documents from SEDENA show that Colt Manufacturing was notified on February 3, 2015, that hundreds of rifles it produced were exported and destined for police forces in eight states,\" the senators wrote, including the public security office in Guerrero. \"That notification came only two months after public reports implicated the Guerrero SSP in the forced disappearance of 43 students in Iguala, Guerrero, on September 26, 2014. Judicial documents from the investigation of the Ayotzinapa disappearances show that municipal police in Guerrero implicated in the disappearances were armed with Colt rifles.\"\n\nTaken together, the documents pointed to a potentially systemic misrepresentation of where American guns are going in Mexico spanning more than a decade. The Mexican army provided hundreds of end-use certificates for \"U.S. exported firearms destined for state and local police forces between 2008 and 2019,\" the senators wrote. \"Although the firearms were exported for use by police forces, in every single certificate, SEDENA listed itself - the army - as the end user.\"\n\nGiven the alarming picture emerging from the military's own records, the lawmakers asked whether the government tracked U.S.-made weapons that the Mexican army sells to police units; whether embassy officials were aware of the sales to Mexican security forces accused of killings and abductions in Guerrero and Tamaulipas; and how oversight of arms exports would function with the recent transfer of responsibilities to the Department of Commerce.\n\nThe State Department, in its reply the following month, delivered just one week after the marines were taken into custody in Mexico City, indicated that its ability to track weapons once they are sold to the Mexican military is limited and deferred to the Commerce Department on matters of oversight going forward. As for whether U.S. officials were \"aware that U.S. firearms were sold for use by police forces in Guerrero and Tamaulipas,\" the department did not provide a direct answer, instead listing its general policies.\n\nThe lawmakers were not satisfied. \"We remain concerned to learn from your response that the U.S. Embassy has not been consulted about instances regarding Mexican police forces as end users of U.S. exported firearms,\" they wrote in a follow-up letter last month. \"We are also concerned about a proposed license to export $5.5 million worth of Sig Sauer automatic rifles to the Mexican Navy, whose units are implicated in forced disappearances and torture, without adequate end user controls.\" The senators pointed to a 2019 report which found that more than 65 percent of \"detainees over a ten-year period said that they suffered torture while in Navy custody, including asphyxia, electric shocks, burns, and rape.\"\n\nThe lawmakers called on Blinken to \"immediately begin a review of all existing licenses for exports of firearms to Mexico for use by the Mexican police and Navy\" before and since March 2020. They also called for a suspension of licenses in cases in which end users appeared in a government database known as INVEST, which the State Department uses to monitor abuses by security units that receive U.S. training.\n\n\"Given the extensive documentation of widespread infiltration of Mexican police forces by criminal organizations, and police and military participation in atrocities, we expected the Departments of State and Commerce to establish mechanisms to ensure that U.S. firearms do not contribute to these crimes,\" they wrote. Instead, they said, \"the Commerce Department issued a rule change in December 2020, without public comment, that eases firearms exports to Mexico.\"\n\nAs for guns going to problem units in Guerrero and Tamaulipas, the senators wrote that the State Department's April response \"clarified how licenses for firearms exports to Mexico should identify end users, but did not state whether this was the case for the firearms transferred in 2015 to state police in Guerrero and in 2019 to state police in Tamaulipas.\"\n\nThe lawmakers demanded to know: \"When were U.S. Embassy staff or other U.S. officials first aware that U.S. firearms were sold for use by police forces in Guerrero and Tamaulipas? What actions were taken, if any, to prevent further U.S.-exported firearms from ending up in the hands of these police forces? If no action was taken, why not? We asked these questions in our March letter, and ask them again.\"\n\nThe senators have yet to receive answers to their questions, a spokesperson for Leahy's office said in an email to The Intercept, though, he added, their inquiry continues.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "New CDC Report Downplays Role of Guns in Rising U.S. Suicide Rates\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe report doesn't delve into the body of research on the strong association between firearm access and suicide deaths.\n\nA new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that suicide rates have increased dramatically across the United States. From 1999 to 2016, 49 states saw suicides increase by 5 percent or more, and 25 of those states saw increases of a staggering 30 percent or higher. By 2016, almost 45,000 Americans were taking their own lives every year.\n\nWhile the CDC report notes that guns are the most common method for these suicides - accounting for about half of all cases - it fails to underscore the extent to which these alarming rates may be attributable to the country's utter saturation with civilian firearms.\n\n\"It's not just about firearms,\" Deborah Stone, the lead author of the study, told NPR. \"It's also about other methods of suicide, such as hanging, suffocation, poisoning, and the like.\"\n\nWhile it may be true that suicide rates are increasing across the board, research consistently points to a strong association between firearm access and suicide deaths, independent of other factors. In a country that has as many privately owned guns as it does people, this presents a unique public health problem.\n\n\"Cut it however you want,\" the Harvard School of Public Health's Deborah Azrael put it in 2013. \"In places where exposure to guns is higher, more people die of suicide.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe reason for this is relatively simple: Unlike other common methods of suicide, firing a gun is an immediate, irreversible, and reliably lethal act. And because suicide is, more often than not, impulsive - and the time between ideation and action is short - firearm access is uniquely deadly if someone thinks to kill themselves at all. Gun suicide attempts end in death about 85 percent of the time, compared to less than 5 percent for intentional drug overdoses.\n\nBecause of this, the presence of guns in over a third of U.S. households greatly enhances the aggregate risk of suicide deaths. Variation in suicide rates within the U.S. supports this conclusion. A 2008 study in the New England Journal of Medicine compared states with the lowest household gun ownership rates (15 percent) to those with the highest (47 percent). While non-firearm suicides were basically equivalent in both groups, firearm suicides were about four times more prevalent in the latter. The more firearm-saturated population experienced about twice as many suicide deaths overall.\n\nTo be fair, the CDC does issue a mild recommendation regarding guns in its press release announcing the study: \"Reduce access to lethal means - such as medications and firearms - among people at risk of suicide.\"\n\nThis recommendation, however, is only really useful if suicide is a generally predictable phenomenon. Unfortunately, it's not. The new CDC study itself found that 54 percent of suicide victims in 2015 had no known mental health conditions. And suicidal ideation can arise from a plethora of quotidian experiences that aren't commonly documented or recognized as actionable mental health issues: financial distress, relationship crises, substance abuse, and so on. In these situations, individualized interventions and safer storage methods simply cannot substitute for not having a gun nearby in the first place.\n\nBecause it relies on Congress for funding, the CDC may have good reason not to emphasize the unique role of firearms in U.S. suicide rates. In 1993, the agency supported a study that found that people with guns at home faced a risk of suicide five times greater than those without. Three years later, Congress passed what's known as the Dickey Amendment, which effectively prevented the CDC from funding targeted research into gun violence.\n\nTop photo: Handguns are seen on display at the K&W Gunworks store on Jan. 5, 2016 in Delray Beach, Fla.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Even As a Student Movement Rises, Gun Manufacturers Are Targeting Young People\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nFaced with slumping sales, gun manufacturers are going after the \"Xbox generation.\"\n\nA movement of young people, led by students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, captured the nation's attention with gun control activism following a Valentine's Day shooting at the school. But, even as the students appear in national media and flood the streets, state legislatures, and Capitol Hill, the gun industry is enjoying its own growing following of young people.\n\nFor years, gun manufacturers and industry-supported associations have focused their energy on transforming young Americans into the next generation of shooters. Using the appeal of a real-word version of the video game-style experience, the industry is pursuing young people to bolster revenue amid slumping sales. While the industry soars under Democratic governance - for fear that imminent regulations will make purchases more difficult - gun sales have been down since President Donald Trump's election.\n\nAmid this slump, older Americans present lesser opportunities for the industry to grow its revenue. Not only are elderly gun enthusiasts dying off, but they tend to buy hunting guns. Younger generations reared on first-person shooter video games, on the other hand, provide the gun industry with a lucrative market for sophisticated guns geared toward shooting range entertainment.\n\nWith the aid of advertising that draws on a video game aesthetic, gun companies and their allies, including the National Rifle Association, have increasingly shifted their efforts to target young, first-time gun buyers.\n\nOne manufacturer, American Outdoor Brands, told investors in recent months that it is working to build out its market among young consumers. Formerly known as Smith & Wesson, American Outdoor is the parent company of the gunmaker that manufactured the assault rifle, an AR-15, used in the Parkland school shooting.\n\nSpeaking to a shareholder meeting in September, James Debney, the CEO of of American Outdoor, expressed excitement about the \"change in the demographic\" of those buying the company's guns. \"Many more younger people from urban areas versus older people from rural areas, let's say, are showing a strong interest in the shooting sports,\" Debney said.\n\nDebney credits \"savvy marketing\" for American Outdoor's success in luring first-time buyers, noting that young consumers have a strong interest in self-defense and going to firing ranges that are increasingly opening in urban areas. \"Younger people,\" Debney said, describing the demographics of new customers, \"millennials coming through strongly. And then, also, many more women showing an interest in the shooting sports.\"\n\nDebney is only one of many gun executives who have been touting young gun buyers - and the market opportunities they present - to investors.\n\nThe chief executive of the gun manufacturer Sturm Ruger, Christopher Killoy, told investors in May that, although sales were down, the industry is better positioned in relation to previous downturns because of the influx of \"new shooters, fresher faces, younger faces, more diverse faces.\"\n\nAt the Bank of America Leveraged Finance Conference in November, the CFO of one of the largest companies involved in gun accessories and ammunition was explicit about the video-game appeal to young gun enthusiasts. \"It has become a recreational shooting market, partly driven by the Xbox generation coming of age,\" said Stephen Nolan of Vista Outdoor. \"And two trends which bode very well to the market long-term: significant influx of younger shooters and significant influx of female shooters into the market.\" Younger shooters, he explained, look to buy paper targets of zombies or vampires, and are more interested in buying high volumes of ammunition.\n\nThe NRA, which is funded by gun manufacturers, has long maintained youth outreach programs. The group sponsors high school gun clubs around the country, including one with the JROTC program attended by Nikolas Cruz, the Parkland shooter. The group sponsors a number of programs for high school-level shooters, including the NRA's Youth Education Summit, which has events all around the country for young gun enthusiasts.\n\nThe outreach reflects a larger marketing effort by gun companies. Junior Shooter magazine , for instance, sells a range of products geared toward bringing children and teenager shooters into the market. Companies hawk zombie-themed gun apparel and other youth-oriented gun accessories on social media. Vista Outdoors sponsors shooting events for Boy Scout troops. In 2012, EA Games partnered with a gun companies such as Magpul, McMillan, and others to sell guns and other items featured in the the game \"Medal of Honor: Warfighter\" to consumers.\n\nThere are indications that the gun industry is making inroads. In a recent Marist poll , a majority of all age groups supported stricter gun rules. But people between 18 and 39 years old, the youngest grouping surveyed, favored stricter gun rules by a smaller percentage - 64 percent versus a national average of 71 percent - than the other age groups.\n\nThe young voters were also less likely than others to make electoral decisions based on politicians' positions on guns. Asked by Marist whether they were likely to vote for or against a politician who supported banning semiautomatic assault guns, a majority of voters said they were more likely to support the politician. The younger segment of those polled, at 53 percent, were the only age grouping in which a majority said they were unlikely to support the politician.\n\nTop photo: Andrew Farris and his son Eli look over guns fitted with Crimson-Trace sights at the 146th NRA Annual Meetings & Exhibits on April 29, 2017, in Atlanta.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Un-Alarmed\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nAI Tries (and Fails) to Detect Weapons in Schools\n\nO n Halloween day last year, a 17-year-old-student walked straight through an artificial intelligence weapons detection system at Proctor High School in Utica, New York. No alert went off.\n\nThe 17-year-old then approached a fellow student, pulled a hunting-style knife out of his backpack, and repeatedly stabbed the other student in the hands and back.\n\nThe Utica City School District had installed the $4 million weapons detection system across 13 of its schools earlier that summer, mostly with public funds. The scanners, from Massachusetts-based Evolv Technology, look like metal detectors but scan for \"signatures\" for \"all the guns, all the bombs, and all the large tactical knives\" in the world, Evolv's CEO Peter George has repeatedly claimed .\n\nIn Utica, the 17-year-old's weapon wasn't the first knife, or gun, to bypass the system. Earlier that month, at a parents' night, a law enforcement officer had walked through the system twice with his service revolver and was puzzled to find it was never detected. School authorities reached out to Evolv and were subsequently told to increase the sensitivity settings to the highest level.\n\nThe detector did finally go off: It identified a 7-year-old student's lunch box as a bomb. On Halloween, however, it remained silent.\n\n\"They've tried to backtrack by saying, 'Oh no, it doesn't pick up all knives,'\" said Brian Nolan, who had been appointed acting superintendent of the Utica City School District 10 days before the stabbing. \"They don't tell you - will it pick up a machete or a Swiss army knife? We've got like really nothing back from Evolv.\"\n\nUltimately, Utica City School District removed and replaced the scanners from their high schools, costing the district another $250,000. In the elementary and middle schools, which retained Evolv scanners, three knives have been recovered from students - but not because the scanners picked them up, according to Nolan.\n\nStories about Evolv systems missing weapons have popped up nationwide. Last month, a knife fight erupted between students at Mifflin High School in Ohio. It's not clear how the knives entered the building, but it was less than three months after the school district spent $3 million installing Evolv scanners.\n\nAs school shootings proliferate across the country - there were 46 school shootings in 2022, more than in any year since at least 1999 - educators are increasingly turning to dodgy vendors who market misleading and ineffective technology. Utica City is one of dozens of school districts nationwide that have spent millions on gun detection technology with little to no track record of preventing or stopping violence.\n\nEvolv's scanners keep popping up in schools across the country. In a video produced by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg district in North Carolina about its new $16.5 million system, students spoke about how the technology reassured them. \"I know that I'm not going to be threatened with any firearms, any knives, any sort of metallic weapon at all,\" one said.\n\nOver 65 school districts have bought or tested artificial intelligence gun detection from a variety of companies since 2018, spending a total of over $45 million, much of it coming from public coffers, according to an investigation by The Intercept.\n\n\"Private companies are preying on school districts' worst fears and proposing the use of technology that's not going to work,\" said Stefanie Coyle, deputy director of the Education Policy Center at the New York Civil Liberties Union, or NYCLU, \"and may cause many more problems than it seeks to solve.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nIn December, it came out that Evolv, a publicly traded company since 2021, had doctored the results of their software testing. In 2022, the National Center for Spectator Sports Safety and Security, a government body, completed a confidential report showing that previous field tests on the scanners failed to detect knives and a handgun. When Evolv released a public version of the report, according to IPVM, a surveillance industry research publication, and underlying documents reviewed by The Intercept, the failures had been excised from the results. Though Evolv touted the report as \"fully independent,\" there was no disclosure that the company itself had paid for the research. (Evolv has said the public version of the report had information removed for security reasons.)\n\nFive law firms recently announced investigations of Evolv Technology - a partner of Motorola Solutions whose investors include Bill Gates - looking into possible violations of securities law, including claims that Evolv misrepresented its technology and its capabilities to it.\n\n\"When you start peeling back the onion on what the technology actually does and doesn't do, it's much different than the reality these companies present,\" said Donald Maye at IPVM. \"And that is absolutely the case with Evolv.\"\n\nEvolv told The Intercept it would not comment on any specific situations involving their customers and declined to comment further. (Motorola Solutions did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nThe overpromising of artificial intelligence products is an industrywide problem. The Federal Trade Commission recently released a blog post warning companies, \"Keep your AI claims in check.\" Among the questions was, \"Are you exaggerating what your AI product can do?\" An employee of Evolv Technology demonstrates the Evolv Express weapons detection system, which is showing red lights to flag a weapon, on May 25, 2022, in New York. Photo: Mary Altaffer/AP A rtificial intelligence gun detection vendors advertise themselves as the solution to the mass school shootings that plague the U.S. While various companies employ differing methods, the Evolv machines use cameras and sensors to capture people as they walk by, after which AI software compares them with object signatures that the system has created. When a weapon is present, the system is supposed to pick up the weapon's signature and sound an alarm.\n\nAn employee of Evolv Technology demonstrates the Evolv Express weapons detection system, which is showing red lights to flag a weapon, on May 25, 2022, in New York.\n\nAt an investor conference in June 2022, Evolv CEO George was asked if the company would have stopped the tragic school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, where 19 students and two teachers were killed. \"The answer is when somebody goes through our system and they have a concealed weapon or an open carry weapon, we're gonna find it, period,\" he responded. \"We won't miss it.\"\n\nIn January, the scanners caught a student trying to enter a high school with a handgun in Guilford, North Carolina. Subsequently, an Evolv spokesperson told WFMY News that their systems had uncovered 100,000 weapons in 2022. In a presentation for investors in the fourth quarter of 2022, George said the detection scanners, on average, stopped 400 guns per day.\n\nThere is little peer-reviewed research, however, showing that AI gun detection is effective at preventing shootings. And in the case of Uvalde, the shooter began firing his gun before even entering the school building - and therefore before having passed through a detector.\n\n\"The odds of that happening - someone walks in with a displayed gun - are really, really small,\" said Andrew Guthrie Ferguson, a professor of law at American University's law school and an expert on surveillance. \"It just doesn't make sense that that's what you're investing in.\"\n\nEven in airports with maximum security protocols, Evolv's technology has proved to have gaping holes. When an official at Denver International Airport expressed interest in Evolv scanners, he asked a colleague at Oakland International Airport, which uses the machines.\n\n\"It is not an explosives detection machine per se,\" wrote Douglas Mansel, the aviation security manager in Oakland, in an internal email obtained through a public records request and shared with The Intercept, \"So if an employee (or law enforcement during a test) walks through with a brick of C4\" - an explosive - \"in their hands, the Evolv will not alarm.\" (The Oakland Airport told The Intercept it does not comment on its security program.)\n\nIn a BBC interview in 2020, Evolv said the density of metal is one key indicator of a weapon's presence. But the company firmly denies that their scanners are akin to metal detectors. \"We're a weapons detector, not a metal detector,\" George said on a conference call in June 2021. (A large competitor of Evolv is CEIA, which manufactures metal detectors without AI, used in airports and schools.)\n\nYet in many cases, Evolv hasn't picked up weapons. And researchers have also highlighted how metallic objects, such as laptops, repeatedly set the system off. \"They go through great lengths to claim they are not a metal detector,\" said Maye of IPVM. \"To the extent to which AI is being used, it's open to interpretation to the consumer.\"\n\nDespite claims by George that the system can scan up to 1,000 students in 15 minutes, in the Hemet Unified School District in California, false alarms slowed ingress to school buildings. The solution, according to Evolv, was to simply encourage educators to let students proceed.\n\n\"They only need to clear the threat(s) and not figure out what alarmed the system,\" wrote Amy Ferguson, customer manager at Evolv, in an internal email to the school system obtained through a public records request and shared with The Intercept. \"I recommended not doing a loop back unless necessary. ... Many students were looping back 2 or 3 times.\" (The Hemet Unified School District did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nAcross the country in Dorchester County Public Schools in Maryland, the system had 250 false alarms for every real hit in the period from September 2021 to June 2022, according to internal records obtained by IPVM. The school district spent $1.4 million on the Evolv software, which it bought from Motorola.\n\n\"It plays an important role in our efforts to keep our School District safe,\" the district told The Intercept. \"And we plan to expand its use within the District.\"\n\nEvolv isn't the only company making bold claims about its sophisticated weapons detection system. ZeroEyes, a Philadelphia-based AI company, states in contracts that \"our proactive solution saves lives.\" Founded by Navy SEALs in 2018, the firm uses video analytics and object detection to pick up guns.\n\nZeroEyes's website lists the timeline for the Sandy Hook shooting, arguing its technology could have materially reduced the response time. When a gun is visible on camera, an alert gets sent to a \"24/7/365 ZeroEyes Operations Center Team,\" with people monitoring the feed, who in turn confirm the gun and alert the school and police. It claims to do all of this in three to five seconds.\n\nThe human team is key to the group's system, something critics say belies the weakness of the underlying AI claims. \"This is one of the fundamental challenges these companies have. Like if they could fully automate it reliably, they wouldn't need to have a human-in-the-loop,\" said Maye. \"The human-in-the-loop is because AI isn't good enough to do it itself.\"\n\n\"We have never suggested that AI alone is enough,\" Olga Shmuklyer, spokesperson for ZeroEyes, told The Intercept. \"We would never trust AI alone to determine whether a gun threat is real or fake, nor should anybody else.\"\n\nIn addition to Philadelphia, the company also has an operations center in Honolulu, Hawaii, \"to cater to different time zones.\"\n\nZeroEyes seems determined to overcome its critics and is so far faring well. The company raised $20 million in 2021. According to co-founder Rob Huberty , in a LinkedIn post, the team's mantra is \"F*** you, watch me.\"\n\n\"We are problem solvers, and this is a difficult problem,\" said Shmuklyer, the spokesperson. \"Without the mentality proposed in that post, we wouldn't have a solution to offer to school districts around the country.\"\n\nD uring the pandemic, school shootings rose in tandem with a spike in gun violence in general. The sort of panic that ensued can lead to impulsive and ineffective action, according to safety experts.\n\n\"We are seeing some school boards and administrators making knee-jerk reactions by purchasing AI weapons detection systems,\" said Kenneth Trump, president of National School Safety and Security Services. \"Unfortunately, the purchase of the systems appears to be done with little-to-no professional assessment of overall security threats and needs.\"\n\nSchools in Colorado and Texas brought weapons detection software from a now-convicted fraudster. Barry Oberholzer developed SWORD in 2018 under the startup X.Labs, registered as Royal Holdings Technologies, which he claimed to be the first mobile phone case providing gun detection software.\n\n\"I can identify you and identify if you are carrying a gun in 1.5 seconds,\" Oberholzer told WSFA 12 News in Alabama in February 2019. \"You don't even have to click. You just need to point the device at the person.\"\n\nLater that year, it was reported that Oberholzer was on the run from over two dozen fraud and forgery charges in South Africa. ( Todd Dunphy, a board member of and investor in X.Labs, denied the charges on Oberholzer's behalf and produced an unverified letter from South African authorities clearing him .)\n\nHis SWORD product was endorsed by former high-level U.S. officials.\n\nFormer FBI agent James Gagliano, who was listed as an adviser to X.Labs, praised the product as \"next generation public safety threat-detection.\" Charles Marino, a retired Secret Service special agent, was listed as the company's national security adviser.\n\nMarino said he invested in the company but has not been involved for years and did not work on the SWORD project. \"He swindled everybody,\" Marino told The Intercept, referring to the conspiracy conviction. \"Look, you kiss a lot of frogs in this world.\"\n\nGagliano said in an email that he severed ties with Oberholzer after hearing of the fraud charges. \"I was as stunned as anyone,\" he said. \"Have had no contact with him since I learned of his indictment in the Summer of 2021. I was excited about the technology he was seeking to introduce to law enforcement.\"\n\nIn June 2020, X.Labs announced the rebranding of SWORD to X1, a standing device and \"full-featured weapons detection system\" in partnership with another firm.\n\nLast month, Oberholzer and his business partner Jaromy Pittario pleaded guilty in federal court to conspiracy to defraud investors and creditors. The Department of Justice accused Oberholzer of posing as Gen. David Petraeus, the former CIA director, while pitching the product to venture capital firms.\n\n\"Instead of attracting investors honestly, Oberholzer lied continuously to make his company more appealing to investors,\" U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams said in a statement.\n\nNone of it deterred the company. Its scanners, despite problems, remain in schools - and X.Labs continues to cultivate new business. \"All of the devices that are purchased by clients are in their possession and can be used as they see fit,\" Dunphy said. \"The company, like last year, is run by the board and is working with parties to complete the last phase of development for the purpose of slowing down mass shootings globally.\"\n\nOberholzer is no longer involved with X.Labs, said Dunphy, the board member, who responded to emails addressed to Oberholzer.\n\n\"Mr Oberholzer is a professional helicopter pilot and his comings and goings has nothing to do with X.labs,\" Dunphy said, \"as he resigned from the company in February 2021.\"\n\nT here is a reason districts in New York, such as Utica, have been a target of gun detection vendors. Most of this technology is being funded by taxpayer money and, in the Empire State, there is a lot to spend.\n\nUnder the Boards of Cooperative Educational Services aid, school purchases get reimbursed based on a school district's poverty level. Utica City School District, which has a high poverty level , was reimbursed 93 cents on the dollar on the Evolv sale, according to acting superintendent Nolan.\n\nThe Boards of Cooperative Educational Services told The Intercept, \"As a coalition of the state's 37 Boards of Cooperative Educational Services, BOCES of NYS has neither authority nor oversight regarding the budgets, purchases, or reimbursement rates of any school district.\" The regional Oneida-Herkimer-Madison Counties BOCES office - which covers the Utica school district - did not respond for comment.\n\nWhile the district gets most of its money back after the disastrous purchase of the Evolv scanners, \"New York state taxpayers are still on the hook for the system,\" Nolan said.\n\nThe Smart Schools Bond Act, passed in 2014, also set aside $2 billion funding to \"finance improved educational technology and infrastructure,\" drawing the attention of vendors nationwide.\n\n\"Folks in the school security industry got wind that New York State was sitting on this big pot of money that school districts had access to,\" said Coyle of the NYCLU. \"And that kind of opened the floodgates for companies to try to convince school districts to use that state funding to buy products they don't need, they don't know how to use, and are potentially harmful.\"\n\nNew York isn't the only state ready to spend a fortune. A 2019 Texas bill allocated $100 million in grants for schools seeking to purchase new equipment.\n\nFederal Covid-19 relief dollars can also be directed to things like school security systems, through the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund. Companies, including ZeroEyes and a similar firms, advertise how schools can receive a grant for the \"development and implementation of procedures and systems to improve the preparedness and response efforts of a school district.\"\n\n\"We are targeting sales to all states,\" Shmuklyer, of Zero Eyes, said. \"A lack of funds should not be the reason why a school cannot be proactive in addressing the mass shooting problem.\"\n\nExperts argue schools are just a cheap training ground for technology vendors to test and improve their object detection software so that they can eventually sell it elsewhere.\n\n\"Part of the reason why these companies are offering schools the technologies at a relatively cheap price point is that they're using the schools as their grounds for training,\" said Ferguson, the American University professor. \"And so those schools or students become data points in a large data set that's actually improving the technology so they can sell it to other people in other places.\"\n\nActing superintendent Nolan himself was told by Evolv the system would get smarter over time with more use. \"They keep saying how the artificial intelligence system they use gets refined after more usage, because they collect more data, more information,\" he said. \"But what's it going to take, 20 years?\"\n\nThe lack of regulation leads to a lack of transparency on the use of the data itself. \"There's no protections in place,\" said Daniel Schwarz, privacy and technology strategist at NYCLU, \"And it raises all these issues around what happens with the data. ... Oftentimes, what we've caught out is that they actually worsen racial disparities and biases.\" ShotSpotter (renamed SoundThinking) equipment overlooks the intersection of South Stony Island Avenue and East 63rd Street in Chicago on Aug. 10, 2021. Photo: Charles Rex Arbogast/AP Additionally, ShotSpotter - now renamed SoundThinking - a system of microphones which claims to use \"sensors, algorithms and artificial intelligence\" to detect the sound of gunfire, has received intense criticism for being overwhelmingly deployed in communities of color. The frequent false alarms of the systems has led to more aggressive policing, as well as the distortion of gunfire statistics.\n\nShotSpotter (renamed SoundThinking) equipment overlooks the intersection of South Stony Island Avenue and East 63rd Street in Chicago on Aug. 10, 2021.\n\nAn analysis by the MacArthur Justice Center found that 89 percent of ShotSpotter alerts in Chicago from 2019-2021 turned up no gun-related crime. \"Every unfounded ShotSpotter deployment creates an extremely dangerous situation for residents in the area,\" according to the report.\n\nThere has been extensive reporting on police departments and other agencies' use of ShotSpotter nationwide - but not schools. Public records show Brockton Public Schools, in Massachusetts, for instance, bought access to the technology for three years in a row. The school system said in a statement that the public document showing its purchase of ShotSpotter was in error and referred instead to a purchase by the police department; the school spokesperson said Brockton schools received a separate donation of ShotSpotter, but never activated it. (The school system did not say who donated the system, and the police department did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\n\"Contrary to claims that the ShotSpotter product leads to over-policing, ShotSpotter alerts allow police to investigate a gunfire incident in a more precise area,\" Sara Lattman, a SoundThinking spokesperson, said in a statement to The Intercept. \"Additionally, ShotSpotter has maintained a low false positive rate, just 0.5%, across all customers in the last three years.\"\n\nF or many advocates against gun violence, particularly in schools, gun control measures like an assault weapons ban would go a long way in curtailing the deadly effects of attacks. With Congress failing to enact such policies, experts argue that schools should refrain from turning to shoddy technology to support their students.\n\n\"We advise schools to focus on human factors: people, policies, procedures, planning, training, and communications,\" said Trump, the National School Safety and Security Services head. \"Avoid security theater.\"\n\nVendors, though, continue to emphasize the risk of gun violence and rely on the steady drumbeat of attacks to generate fear in potential clients - and to make sales.\n\n\"While recent high visibility attacks at publicly and privately-owned venues and schools have increased market awareness of mass shootings,\" said Evolv's recent annual disclosure report , \"if such attacks were to decline or enterprises of governments perceived the general level of attacks has declined, our ability to attract new customers and expand our sales to existing customers could be materially and adversely affected.\"\n\nThe company even helps schools market the technology to their own communities. In an email from Evolv to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school district, a bulleted list of talking points makes suggestions for how the school system might respond to public queries about the scanners. One of the talking points said, \"Security approaches included multiple layers,\" adding that \"this approach recognizes the reality that no single layer or single technology is 100% effective.\"\n\nWhen reached for comment by The Intercept, Eddie Perez, a spokesperson for the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school district, quoted the talking point verbatim in an emailed response.\n\nThat hedged view is out of step with how people in the district itself speak about the system: as an absolute assurance of a gun-free safety. Students in the video produced by the school district said, \"You get a certain reassurance that there are no dangerous weapons on campus.\"\n\nCorrection: May 11, 2023 This story has been updated to use the correct spelling of ZeroEyes spokesperson Olga Shmuklyer's name. It has also been updated to reflect a clarification received after publication from Brockton Public Schools in Massachusetts that the ShotSpotter system donated to the schools was not received from the police.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Right-Wing Supreme Court Continues Its \"Great Fraud\" About the Second Amendment\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nAs former Chief Justice Warren Burger said: \"The Framers clearly intended to secure the right to bear arms essentially for military purposes.\"\n\nTwenty-four hours before the Supreme Court eliminated the constitutional right to an abortion on Friday, it significantly expanded gun rights with its decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen. In the Thursday ruling, the same six conservative justices who struck down Roe v. Wade voided an 111-year-old New York law that required applicants for a concealed carry permit to demonstrate that they had a special, specific need for self-defense.\n\nThis in turn will require other states with significant gun regulations - California, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Hawaii - to change their laws. Other restrictions on guns will likely fall to lawsuits.\n\nPresident Joe Biden then released a milquetoast statement : \"I am deeply disappointed by the Supreme Court's ruling ... the Second Amendment is not absolute.\" New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said , \"I'm sorry this dark day has come - that we're supposed to go back to what was in place since 1788 when the Constitution of the United States America was ratified. And I would like to point out to the Supreme Court justices that the only weapons at that time were muskets.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThese responses should drive anyone concerned about America's horrifying gun violence berserk with frustration - because they concede nearly the entire argument to the right before they begin. It is not the case that the Second Amendment was intended to grant individuals the right to carry arms, and thus present-day supporters of gun control now have to figure a way around that. On the contrary: The Second Amendment was never meant to have anything to do with individual gun rights. (It's also distressing that Hochul, who graduated from law school, does not seem to know that while the U.S. Constitution was ratified in 1788, the Bill of Rights wasn't until 1791.)\n\nThe right argument for politicians to make on this issue - what's both factually accurate and politically important - is that of Warren Burger. Burger was a Republican who was appointed chief justice of the Supreme Court by President Richard Nixon in 1969 and served for 17 years until 1986. In retirement in 1991, Burger said that the Second Amendment \"has been the subject of one of the greatest pieces of fraud, I repeat the word fraud, on the American public by special interest groups that I have ever seen in my lifetime.\"\n\n\"The very language of the Second Amendment,\" wrote Burger , \"refutes any argument that it was intended to guarantee every citizen an unfettered right to any kind of weapon he or she desires. ... The Framers clearly intended to secure the right to bear arms essentially for military purposes.\"\n\nUnderstanding this requires some knowledge of U.S. history, but not that much.\n\nThe 13 original U.S. states were first bound together by the Articles of Confederation, which were ratified in 1781 just as the American Revolution effectively ended. But the system didn't work well, with the central government so weak that the \"united\" part of the United States was largely a joke.\n\nAn effort began, led by James Madison, to create a new governing structure. This eventually became the Constitution, which was drafted in Philadelphia in 1787. But then it had to be ratified by the states.\n\nThis was by no means a sure thing. One key point of contention between the Federalists who supported the Constitution and the Anti-Federalists who opposed it were concerns over a standing army. \"Standing armies are dangerous to the liberties of a people,\" the Anti-Federalists stated . \"The truth of the position might be confirmed by the history of almost every nation in the world.\" And the Constitution gave the prospective new federal Congress the power \"to raise and support Armies.\"\n\nMadison did not claim this was not an issue. However, he argued in Federalist No. 46:\n\nThe State governments, with the people on their side, would be able to repel the danger ... citizens with arms in their hands, officered by men chosen from among themselves, fighting for their common liberties, and united and conducted by governments possessing their affections and confidence. It may well be doubted, whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops.\n\nMadison then pointed to the success of the American Revolution itself as proof of the effectiveness of militias against a regular army.\n\nTo assuage the concerns of those on the fence about the Constitution, Federalists in various states proposed that its ratification be linked to the adoption of amendments limiting the power of the federal government. This was crucial: As the National Archives explains it , \"The Constitution might never have been ratified if the framers hadn't promised to add a Bill of Rights.\"\n\nThis was the context for the writing of the Second Amendment. The Bill of Rights was partially based on the 1776 Virginia Declaration of Rights . As the Library of Congress says , the Virginia Declaration was \"uniquely influential\" and \"used by James Madison in drawing up the Bill of Rights.\" Section XIII of the Declaration read:\n\nThat a well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defense of a free state; that standing armies, in time of peace, should be avoided as dangerous to liberty; and that, in all cases, the military should be under strict subordination to, and be governed by, the civil power.\n\nThe final language of the Second Amendment was, of course, \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\"\n\nA straightforward interpretation of this history was generally observed for a long time. In a key 1939 Supreme Court case, United States v. Miller, two men had traveled across state lines with an unregistered shotgun with a shortened barrel in violation of the National Firearms Act of 1934. A lower court held that part of the Act was an unconstitutional violation of the Second Amendment. In refuting this, the court declared that the \"obvious purpose\" of the Second Amendment was \"to assure the continuation and render possible the effectiveness of [state militia] forces. ... It must be interpreted and applied with that end in view.\"\n\nIn the legal world more generally, no law review article from 1888 (when they were first indexed) through 1959 ever concluded the Second Amend­ment guar­an­teed an indi­vidual right to a gun.\n\nIt's only recently that the Supreme Court has veered toward its current view. In a key 2008 case, the court held that the meaning of \"a well regulated Militia\" was \"all able-bodied men.\" Hence it was unconstitutional for the government to prevent an individual from possessing a weapon even if it was \"unconnected with militia service.\"\n\nThis perspective clearly requires bizarre mental gymnastics and a resolute commitment to ignoring basic historical facts. But that's the bread and butter of the current Supreme Court. To get a sense of where they fall on the political spectrum, it's useful to compare their perspective to that of Jay Bybee, a judge on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In a recent decision, Bybee wrote , \"Our review of more than 700 years of English and American legal history reveals a strong theme: government has the power to regulate arms in the public square. ... Indeed, we can find no general right to carry arms into the public square for self-defense.\" Bybee is best known for signing off on the George W. Bush administration's memos authorizing torture.\n\nMeanwhile, away from the Supreme Court's dense opinions, the case for eliminating limits on gun rights is simpler. On the wall of the lobby at the National Rifle Association's headquarters in Virginia, you will read the stirring words \"... the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\" I.e., the inconvenient beginning of the Second Amendment has been edited out.\n\nSo Warren Burger was certainly right to say in 1991 that \"the American people should have a firm understanding of the true origin and purpose of the Second Amendment.\" But the unfortunate fact is that they definitely do not. The conservative faction of the Supreme Court likes it that way, and even top Democrats don't seem inclined to explain it to anyone.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have?

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nThe Second Amendment is killing us so the gun industry can rake in massive profits - we can't keep interpreting it as an absolute right for every single citizen to own a gun.\n\n(zomgitsbrian / Flickr)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIn the week following the May 24 massacre in Uvalde, Texas, the Sioux City Bandits, a professional indoor football team from western Iowa, had planned a giveaway of an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle as a \"Military Night\" promotion, as they had done a year earlier. After widespread criticism, the Sioux City Journal reported that the team's Missouri-based owner, J.R. Bond, said canceling or postponing the giveaway \"didn't even approach my radar screen.\" Bond added that \"some people's 'obsession with a piece of metal is overblown' and that the negative comments came from East Coast residents who are 'driving electric cars and eating wheat grass.'\"\n\nFor the record: One of the main critics was the local co-owner of the State Steel Supply Company in Sioux City, who said he would end his sponsorship of the Bandits because \"this promotion is beyond tone deaf and is incredibly insensitive to current affairs.\" (Also, for the record: You can buy both wheat grass and electric cars in Sioux City.)\n\nJ.R. Bond was right about one thing - that some people's \"obsession with a piece of metal is overblown.\" In fact, if lots of people did not have overblown obsessions with guns, he wouldn't have been using one as a promotion, and his team would likely be named something other than \"the Bandits.\"\n\nThe massacre in Uvalde was horrific. An eighteen-year-old man wielding an AR-15 style semiautomatic rifle on May 24 murdered twenty-one people (nineteen of them children) and wounded seventeen others. We have heard this kind of gut-punching news too many times before, and each time millions hope this time will be the event that finally changes the country's toxic relationship with guns. When will Congress do something, anything to stop the unrelenting deaths by firearms?\n\nWe are asking the wrong question. Let's go back to the beginning and ask the most elemental question: What is the Second Amendment for?\n\nIt's easy to grasp the five fundamental rights of the First Amendment: freedom of religion, speech, press, assembly, and to petition the government.\n\nAnd then the Second Amendment: every American's fundamental right to own guns. That's what the gun lobby would like us to believe.\n\nBut wait a minute. The Second Amendment is a wholly different kind of statement, speaking to a unique situation that made much more sense 231 years ago. The Second Amendment's twenty-seven words say this: \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\"\n\nThe idea of the collective right to keep and bear arms as part of a well-regulated militia makes sense only in the context of the new nationhood of the United States in 1791. Given their oppressive experience with the British colonial government, many of the Anti-Federalist founders feared maintaining a standing army in times of peace. Because armies can be dangerously oppressive in the hands of autocratic leaders, they thought \"the best antidote to them was a militia drawn from the body of the citizenry,\" Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Jack N. Rakove and his colleagues wrote.\n\nThe Constitution can be vague in its provisions. Yet the intent of the Second Amendment was better defined just a year later in the Uniform Militia Act of 1792 , which outlined federal standards for a \"well regulated militia.\"\n\nFirst, only certain people could be in the militia. The law required \"each and every free able-bodied white male citizen of the respective States, resident therein, who is or shall be of age of eighteen years, and under the age of forty-five years\" be enrolled in their militia. Second, they had to bear their own arms, which included \"a good musket or firelock, a sufficient bayonet and belt, two spare flints, and a knapsack, a pouch, with a box therein, to contain not less than twenty four cartridges.\" Third, if a member of the militia didn't follow the rules or failed to appear with his state militia when called up by the President, the member could be fined, court martialed, and even imprisoned.\n\nMilitias were devised to fend off federal oppression and be guarantors of the common defense. But they also served as a conduit of oppression themselves from the very beginning. Black people, Native Americans, and women were specifically excluded from the militia and from bearing arms. Controlled by a membership and command of white males, frontier militias massacred Native Americans and were called to quickly put down rebellions of enslaved people. Even after the end of slavery, people of color were often denied ownership of guns and membership into militias.\n\nThe tradition of white people using guns to oppress black people is the throughline of America's Second Amendment history, historian Carol Anderson explains in The Second: Race and Guns in a Fatally Unequal America - from the marauding militias that terrorized enslaved and free black people to today's stand your ground laws (first written by the National Rifle Association [NRA]) that almost always result in \"justifiable\" homicides when the shooter is white and victim is black.\n\nBy the twentieth century, the need and purpose of militias had evolved. The Militia Act of 1903 divided the militia into two classes: a new National Guard, which would be the uniformed and active militia of the United States. It also retained a Reserve Militia, which would draw upon \"every able-bodied male citizen\" as needed. By this point, with the establishment of a National Guard, and the tradition of a massive standing US Army, what was the point of a citizen militia?\n\nFounded in 1871 by Union army veterans of the Civil War, the NRA's purpose was to educate members on marksmanship and firearm safety. The group made a dramatic pivot after its annual meeting in Cincinnati in 1977, when those opposed to the NRA's support of the Gun Control Act of 1968 (which strictly regulated guns and was passed in light of the Kennedy and King assassinations that year) seized the organization.\n\nThe new NRA worked on behalf of the gun industry to sell firearms - tens of millions of them - and quickly chose political sides, allying itself with the Republican Party and rewarding it with millions of dollars in candidate contributions in a quid pro quo for favorable legislation and tamping down any efforts for gun regulations. It's a lot of money. Gun rights organizations spent $190.4 million on federal lobbying between 1998 and the first half of 2022, more than six times the $28.9 million spent by gun control groups during the same period, according to Open Sources , the group that tracks money in US politics.\n\nThe goal was to make guns a coveted consumer product, to convince millions of Americans to have an overblown obsession with a piece of metal. It has worked. The National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) reported earlier this year that \"the total economic impact of the firearm and ammunition industry in the United States increased from $19.1 billion in 2008 to $70.52 billion in 2021.\" That's roughly the value of the global sneaker industry.\n\nTo make guns a consumer obsession, the industry engaged in a decades-long effort to change how Americans interpreted the Second Amendment. Instead of a well-regulated collective right, with responsibilities of gun owners to society, guns were deemed an individual right, for citizens with a perceived need for self-defense (or just a need to feel masculine and powerful). The gun industry knows what it's doing.\n\nIt's no coincidence that a long-term marketing campaign beginning in 2010 for the Bushmaster .223-calibre semiautomatic rifle showed an image of the rifle with the tagline: \" Consider Your Man Card Reissued .\" The Bushmaster was the same civilian assault rifle used in the Newtown Elementary School massacre of twenty-eight people in 2012, most of them children.\n\n\"Perhaps the greatest trick individual-rights scholars have pulled off is convincing the courts that an amendment that begins 'A well-regulated militia' actually has little to do with the militia,\" historian Nathan Kozuskanich wrote in The Second Amendment on Trial: Critical Essays on District of Columbia v. Heller . The Heller case, a 2008 US Supreme Court 5-4 decision written by Justice Antonin Scalia, reinterpreted the Second Amendment as securing an individual right of gun ownership for self-defense, and kicked off the massive gun sales boom of the past fourteen years.\n\nHistorians Kozuskanich and Saul Cornell identified \"a shadow realm of ideological think tanks that nurtured and supported much of the revisionist scholarship used by the Heller majority.\" The NRA was one of the biggest funders, endowing a chair at the George Mason Law School \"devoted to advancing the individual rights view of the Second Amendment\" and paying the three leading gun rights advocates to write several dozen academic articles in the 1990s. Their work is heavily cited in Scalia's decision. Incidentally, the George Mason Law School was renamed the Antonin Scalia Law School in 2016, with a $20 million contribution from an anonymous donor and $10 million from the Koch Foundation.\n\nThere are now more than 393 million guns in the hands of people in the US (likely more with the upswing in gun purchases during the pandemic and the regular surges in sales after mass shootings and Democratic presidential administrations). That's 120 guns for every hundred people, far more than any other country in the world.\n\nIn the Heller decision, Scalia called handguns \"the quintessential self-defense weapon\" and imagined the gun owner as a heroic defender of justice. A handgun \"can be pointed at a burglar with one hand while the other hand dials the police,\" he wrote, sounding like both a commercial for the gun industry and a jurist who wanted his own man card reissued.\n\nScalia's decision never once considered suicides by firearm ( the leading cause of all gun-related deaths , at 24,292 in 2020) and the additional carnage that year: unintentional deaths (small by percentage, only about 1 percent of gun-related murders, but 535 such deaths in 2020, enough to be a national tragedy in its own right), 611 gun-related deaths involving law enforcement, four hundred of undetermined circumstances, and, of course, 19,384 gun-related murders.\n\nSo what is the Second Amendment for? Created in 1791, it was for well-regulated militias of white males to purportedly check federal power, and unofficially to put down rebelling slaves and push Native Americans off their land. Now, to boost an industry and Republican politics of fear, the Second Amendment has been redefined as an individual right for anyone to own guns. Gun owners - white owners still preferred - have become unregulated.\n\nHistorians estimate that 6,800 Americans were killed in combat in the Revolutionary War, less than one-sixth of the 45,222 that died from gun-related injuries in the US in the single year of 2020. The Second Amendment is literally killing us so the gun industry can make bank. It's time to rethink how we protect ourselves from tyranny.\n\nChristopher R.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIn the week following the May 24 massacre in Uvalde, Texas, the Sioux City Bandits, a professional indoor football team from western Iowa, had planned a giveaway of an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle as a \"Military Night\" promotion, as they had done a year earlier. After widespread criticism, the Sioux City Journal reported that the team's Missouri-based owner, J.R. Bond, said canceling or postponing the giveaway \"didn't even approach my radar screen.\" Bond added that \"some people's 'obsession with a piece of metal is overblown' and that the negative comments came from East Coast residents who are 'driving electric cars and eating wheat grass.'\"\n\nFor the record: One of the main critics was the local co-owner of the State Steel Supply Company in Sioux City, who said he would end his sponsorship of the Bandits because \"this promotion is beyond tone deaf and is incredibly insensitive to current affairs.\" (Also, for the record: You can buy both wheat grass and electric cars in Sioux City.)\n\nJ.R. Bond was right about one thing - that some people's \"obsession with a piece of metal is overblown.\" In fact, if lots of people did not have overblown obsessions with guns, he wouldn't have been using one as a promotion, and his team would likely be named something other than \"the Bandits.\"\n\nThe massacre in Uvalde was horrific. An eighteen-year-old man wielding an AR-15 style semiautomatic rifle on May 24 murdered twenty-one people (nineteen of them children) and wounded seventeen others. We have heard this kind of gut-punching news too many times before, and each time millions hope this time will be the event that finally changes the country's toxic relationship with guns. When will Congress do something, anything to stop the unrelenting deaths by firearms?\n\nWe are asking the wrong question. Let's go back to the beginning and ask the most elemental question: What is the Second Amendment for?\n\nIt's easy to grasp the five fundamental rights of the First Amendment: freedom of religion, speech, press, assembly, and to petition the government.\n\nAnd then the Second Amendment: every American's fundamental right to own guns. That's what the gun lobby would like us to believe.\n\nBut wait a minute. The Second Amendment is a wholly different kind of statement, speaking to a unique situation that made much more sense 231 years ago. The Second Amendment's twenty-seven words say this: \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\"\n\nThe idea of the collective right to keep and bear arms as part of a well-regulated militia makes sense only in the context of the new nationhood of the United States in 1791. Given their oppressive experience with the British colonial government, many of the Anti-Federalist founders feared maintaining a standing army in times of peace. Because armies can be dangerously oppressive in the hands of autocratic leaders, they thought \"the best antidote to them was a militia drawn from the body of the citizenry,\" Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Jack N. Rakove and his colleagues wrote.\n\nThe Constitution can be vague in its provisions. Yet the intent of the Second Amendment was better defined just a year later in the Uniform Militia Act of 1792 , which outlined federal standards for a \"well regulated militia.\"\n\nFirst, only certain people could be in the militia. The law required \"each and every free able-bodied white male citizen of the respective States, resident therein, who is or shall be of age of eighteen years, and under the age of forty-five years\" be enrolled in their militia. Second, they had to bear their own arms, which included \"a good musket or firelock, a sufficient bayonet and belt, two spare flints, and a knapsack, a pouch, with a box therein, to contain not less than twenty four cartridges.\" Third, if a member of the militia didn't follow the rules or failed to appear with his state militia when called up by the President, the member could be fined, court martialed, and even imprisoned.\n\nMilitias were devised to fend off federal oppression and be guarantors of the common defense. But they also served as a conduit of oppression themselves from the very beginning. Black people, Native Americans, and women were specifically excluded from the militia and from bearing arms. Controlled by a membership and command of white males, frontier militias massacred Native Americans and were called to quickly put down rebellions of enslaved people. Even after the end of slavery, people of color were often denied ownership of guns and membership into militias.\n\nThe tradition of white people using guns to oppress black people is the throughline of America's Second Amendment history, historian Carol Anderson explains in The Second: Race and Guns in a Fatally Unequal America - from the marauding militias that terrorized enslaved and free black people to today's stand your ground laws (first written by the National Rifle Association [NRA]) that almost always result in \"justifiable\" homicides when the shooter is white and victim is black.\n\nBy the twentieth century, the need and purpose of militias had evolved. The Militia Act of 1903 divided the militia into two classes: a new National Guard, which would be the uniformed and active militia of the United States. It also retained a Reserve Militia, which would draw upon \"every able-bodied male citizen\" as needed. By this point, with the establishment of a National Guard, and the tradition of a massive standing US Army, what was the point of a citizen militia?\n\nFounded in 1871 by Union army veterans of the Civil War, the NRA's purpose was to educate members on marksmanship and firearm safety. The group made a dramatic pivot after its annual meeting in Cincinnati in 1977, when those opposed to the NRA's support of the Gun Control Act of 1968 (which strictly regulated guns and was passed in light of the Kennedy and King assassinations that year) seized the organization.\n\nThe new NRA worked on behalf of the gun industry to sell firearms - tens of millions of them - and quickly chose political sides, allying itself with the Republican Party and rewarding it with millions of dollars in candidate contributions in a quid pro quo for favorable legislation and tamping down any efforts for gun regulations. It's a lot of money. Gun rights organizations spent $190.4 million on federal lobbying between 1998 and the first half of 2022, more than six times the $28.9 million spent by gun control groups during the same period, according to Open Sources , the group that tracks money in US politics.\n\nThe goal was to make guns a coveted consumer product, to convince millions of Americans to have an overblown obsession with a piece of metal. It has worked. The National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) reported earlier this year that \"the total economic impact of the firearm and ammunition industry in the United States increased from $19.1 billion in 2008 to $70.52 billion in 2021.\" That's roughly the value of the global sneaker industry.\n\nTo make guns a consumer obsession, the industry engaged in a decades-long effort to change how Americans interpreted the Second Amendment. Instead of a well-regulated collective right, with responsibilities of gun owners to society, guns were deemed an individual right, for citizens with a perceived need for self-defense (or just a need to feel masculine and powerful). The gun industry knows what it's doing.\n\nIt's no coincidence that a long-term marketing campaign beginning in 2010 for the Bushmaster .223-calibre semiautomatic rifle showed an image of the rifle with the tagline: \" Consider Your Man Card Reissued .\" The Bushmaster was the same civilian assault rifle used in the Newtown Elementary School massacre of twenty-eight people in 2012, most of them children.\n\n\"Perhaps the greatest trick individual-rights scholars have pulled off is convincing the courts that an amendment that begins 'A well-regulated militia' actually has little to do with the militia,\" historian Nathan Kozuskanich wrote in The Second Amendment on Trial: Critical Essays on District of Columbia v. Heller . The Heller case, a 2008 US Supreme Court 5-4 decision written by Justice Antonin Scalia, reinterpreted the Second Amendment as securing an individual right of gun ownership for self-defense, and kicked off the massive gun sales boom of the past fourteen years.\n\nHistorians Kozuskanich and Saul Cornell identified \"a shadow realm of ideological think tanks that nurtured and supported much of the revisionist scholarship used by the Heller majority.\" The NRA was one of the biggest funders, endowing a chair at the George Mason Law School \"devoted to advancing the individual rights view of the Second Amendment\" and paying the three leading gun rights advocates to write several dozen academic articles in the 1990s. Their work is heavily cited in Scalia's decision. Incidentally, the George Mason Law School was renamed the Antonin Scalia Law School in 2016, with a $20 million contribution from an anonymous donor and $10 million from the Koch Foundation.\n\nThere are now more than 393 million guns in the hands of people in the US (likely more with the upswing in gun purchases during the pandemic and the regular surges in sales after mass shootings and Democratic presidential administrations). That's 120 guns for every hundred people, far more than any other country in the world.\n\nIn the Heller decision, Scalia called handguns \"the quintessential self-defense weapon\" and imagined the gun owner as a heroic defender of justice. A handgun \"can be pointed at a burglar with one hand while the other hand dials the police,\" he wrote, sounding like both a commercial for the gun industry and a jurist who wanted his own man card reissued.\n\nScalia's decision never once considered suicides by firearm ( the leading cause of all gun-related deaths , at 24,292 in 2020) and the additional carnage that year: unintentional deaths (small by percentage, only about 1 percent of gun-related murders, but 535 such deaths in 2020, enough to be a national tragedy in its own right), 611 gun-related deaths involving law enforcement, four hundred of undetermined circumstances, and, of course, 19,384 gun-related murders.\n\nSo what is the Second Amendment for?

Now, to boost an industry and Republican politics of fear, the Second Amendment has been redefined as an individual right for anyone to own guns. Gun owners - white owners still preferred - have become unregulated.\n\nHistorians estimate that 6,800 Americans were killed in combat in the Revolutionary War, less than one-sixth of the 45,222 that died from gun-related injuries in the US in the single year of 2020. The Second Amendment is literally killing us so the gun industry can make bank. It's time to rethink how we protect ourselves from tyranny.\n\nChristopher R.

Why? For one, Rizzo's Firearms is stuck in a strip mall on the farthest outskirts of Phoenix, Arizona. To steer customers toward it, he uses landmarks such as a distinctive saguaro and a \"splayed quail corpse.\" Additionally, Rizzo, a white man pushing sixty, has not kept up with the times. He is fumbling and well-intentioned, a gun-selling Homer Simpson, and customers, when they come into the store at all, trust online reviews and message-board posts more than the schlubby charms of the man behind the counter.\n\nHope appears in the form of David's adult son, Nick, with his skills in \"SEO, SEM, CRM drips,\" and other twenty-first-century dark arts. Together they hatch a plan to exploit Nick's ongoing recovery from opioid addiction as part of a store rebranding. On camera, Nick describes his near-fatal heroin overdose before executing the company's pivot to \"shooting opioid addiction dead,\" which includes a promise to donate a percentage of all sales to such causes. The video goes viral, and business booms. At the cash register, without fail, people tell the Rizzos stories of those they knew whose lives were changed - or ended - by excessive opioid use. \"They wanted to do good,\" the narrator says, of these people who saw the commercial and came to buy bullets, \"but settled for what was better than nothing.\"\n\nThis inciting incident deftly winds together so many threads comprising the present moment in the United States: continually radicalizing gun culture, the bleakness of the opioid epidemic, economic precarity, consumption as the center of politics, virality and online confession as necessities for success. With its roving narrator and a contingency-soaked plot cataloging ever-changing fortunes, Last Acts attempts to metabolize as much confusion and suffering in southwestern exurbia as it can. The novelist Dan Chaon, in a recent New York Times book review, wrote that Sammartino's satire had \"cracked the code\" in writing about the contemporary United States. The ambition is stimulating - and the ways the novel falls short are worth analyzing.\n\nOne way Sammartino fills out his vision is in his readiness to pause the Rizzos' story at a moment's notice and focus on minor characters, whether for a sentence or two or for the length of a full chapter. Log-line summations of minor lives populate Arizona with drifting, forlorn people not unlike the Rizzos. A reader infers a US citizenry on the edge of total immiseration: \"Marcus Lintel, the college football star, now a car washer on the weekends, got so high that he passed out on top of his newborn daughter.\" Lintel is never mentioned outside this sentence, but there he is, one example of the variety of tragedy that inhabits America today.\n\nSimilarly, after the twin successes of Nick's recovery and the viral boost to Rizzo's Firearms, the plot zigzags from one type of catastrophe to the next, with barely a moment of respite for anyone. Even the local real estate magnate ends up at rock bottom twice. Jail sentences, relapses, poorly planned follow-up social media campaigns, a business partner who gives away his computer passwords, and falls from the roof are just some obstacles that derail father and son. The down-up-down-down-down of fortunes becomes grimly slapstick.\n\nThis omnivorous attention to the details and design of everyday US gloom makes more apparent what does not attract scrutiny in Last Acts . Much about the gun store, for instance, remains opaque. Rizzo's Firearms is described as looking like any other retail outlet, except for the guns. The weapons fill David, whenever he enters, with \"terror mixed with awe.\"\n\nYet readers are not invited to feel such feelings in scenes where guns are used in developing action. Mostly, talk of guns and the moral, ethical, and political dimensions of selling them resides in the abstract. Only once is a gun drawn or displayed in a way that implies potential violence or intimidation: during a school shooting directly attributable to David's negligence as a seller. Yet even then, Sammartino lets the reader know, after three paragraphs of description of the attack at Sunnyside High School, that \"in a first for the short but prolific history of American school shootings,\" no one is injured or killed. Soon the event is dubbed \"the Mass Survival.\" Later, more of \"the Mass Survival\" is constructed from a student's point of view, showing Sammartino's interest in the event's psychological effects, physical harm or not, but the known outcome reduces the stakes. Another writer interested in many of Sammartino's themes, Nico Walker , put guns into action frequently in Cherry , his novel of opioids, military life, and crime, and he gets satirical mileage from the shock of their sudden use in his newest short story, \" Ricks & Hern .\"\n\nThe is-it-absurd appellation of \"the Mass Survival\" sounds like something from a George Saunders story - and Saunders, who blurbed the novel and is thanked in the acknowledgments, was a teacher of Sammartino's at the Syracuse University MFA program. Yet Saunders's characters, when they are decent but stuck in satirically callous consumer hells, as the Rizzos arguably are, commit and abet great harm. Saunders, at his best, finds emotional and narrative ends by confronting this complicity head-on.\n\nWhen David sells the .50-caliber assault rifle to the seventeen-year-old who attempts to kill his schoolmates, in contrast, it's explained by the desperate need to make a sale. Nick's response to the event does generate more action: he tries to make good by setting up a foundation providing therapy to those who have been part of mass shootings. Sammartino deftly mimics fundraise-ese in Nick's emails, and the empty words - \"receive a free DON'T SHOOT (GIVE!) bumper sticker by using the code generous1\" - cruelly perform a poverty of imagination endemic to our national culture: the only way to solve a problem is to ask for money online. But \"the Mass Survival\" still seems like a missed opportunity, something recognizable as fiction because it pales in comparison to the macabre creativity of reality.\n\nElsewhere, Rizzo's Firearms is denuded of much of its satirical resonance because of the Rizzos' aloofness from the guns as carriers of political meaning. David sells guns to make money and keep his house - the mortgage of which he refinanced to afford the store in the first place. His strategy is to \"stay amorphous\" and focus on the sale. Nick, though more morally itchy from the enterprise, sees it as a way to help his father and as a routine to support his recovery. In real life, independent gun stores across the nation are sites of political onboarding and fellowship. When Nick says his father \"has made it his mission to be the first gun shop in America that aims for a social good,\" one might reply by pointing out that his customers already see the business as such.\n\nBesides supplying the weapons themselves, gun stores provide conservative culture-building, as Arizona State University sociologist Jennifer Carlson observes in her recent Merchants of the Right: Gun Sellers and the Crisis of American Democracy , a study of independent gun sellers reacting to the pandemic and the George Floyd protests in 2020. \"Politics appears as part of the 'package deal' of running a gun store,\" Carlson writes of the owners she interviewed, the vast majority of whom identified as conservative - \"something that gun sellers provide and gun buyers expect.\"\n\nCustomers in Last Acts often demonstrate that expectation. They attempt to spark political conversations with David and Nick - one invites Nick to stay in his bunker when the civil war starts - but the protagonists give noncommittal responses as they swipe the credit cards. When a friend begins protesting outside the store, yelling \"murderers!\" and worse at anyone entering to buy a gun, David is distraught, but Nick soothes him by explaining that gun owners \"want to have an enemy.\" Why would David need his customers to be explained to him, after five years of running the business?\n\nHis reasons for opening the store five years before are hazily rendered, with little explanation for why he chose a gun store over another type of retail outlet. The motivation has something to do with a romantic attachment to a Ruger left for him by his uncle; despair brought on by his wife leaving him for his boss at Mesa Mitsubishi; and fear of continued humiliation as a low-level sales employee. The store is \"his chance to be more than another guy whose life came up soul-crushingly short.\" This is familiarly sympathetic. Nick's struggles with drug addiction are likewise sensitively drawn.\n\nThe text's bent toward sympathetic renderings of the Rizzos and their motivations makes it all the more intriguing that Sammartino devastates father and son with the contingencies of life, while refusing to fully connect David and Nick to the \"terror mixed with awe\" their store's wares promise. Sympathy can be made, often quite easily, of difficult circumstances. But how, and in what form, could sympathy for these men survive their own straightforward ideological engagement with their business, and the confrontation with sudden death and injury that such commodities makes predictable? A satire that really speaks to the contemporary moment would have an interesting answer.\n\nMatt Weir is a writer from Naperville, Illinois.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Sammartino deftly mimics fundraise-ese in Nick's emails, and the empty words - \"receive a free DON'T SHOOT (GIVE!) bumper sticker by using the code generous1\" - cruelly perform a poverty of imagination endemic to our national culture: the only way to solve a problem is to ask for money online. But \"the Mass Survival\" still seems like a missed opportunity, something recognizable as fiction because it pales in comparison to the macabre creativity of reality.\n\nElsewhere, Rizzo's Firearms is denuded of much of its satirical resonance because of the Rizzos' aloofness from the guns as carriers of political meaning. David sells guns to make money and keep his house - the mortgage of which he refinanced to afford the store in the first place. His strategy is to \"stay amorphous\" and focus on the sale. Nick, though more morally itchy from the enterprise, sees it as a way to help his father and as a routine to support his recovery. In real life, independent gun stores across the nation are sites of political onboarding and fellowship. When Nick says his father \"has made it his mission to be the first gun shop in America that aims for a social good,\" one might reply by pointing out that his customers already see the business as such.\n\nBesides supplying the weapons themselves, gun stores provide conservative culture-building, as Arizona State University sociologist Jennifer Carlson observes in her recent Merchants of the Right: Gun Sellers and the Crisis of American Democracy , a study of independent gun sellers reacting to the pandemic and the George Floyd protests in 2020. \"Politics appears as part of the 'package deal' of running a gun store,\" Carlson writes of the owners she interviewed, the vast majority of whom identified as conservative - \"something that gun sellers provide and gun buyers expect.\"\n\nCustomers in Last Acts often demonstrate that expectation. They attempt to spark political conversations with David and Nick - one invites Nick to stay in his bunker when the civil war starts - but the protagonists give noncommittal responses as they swipe the credit cards. When a friend begins protesting outside the store, yelling \"murderers!\" and worse at anyone entering to buy a gun, David is distraught, but Nick soothes him by explaining that gun owners \"want to have an enemy.\" Why would David need his customers to be explained to him, after five years of running the business?\n\nHis reasons for opening the store five years before are hazily rendered, with little explanation for why he chose a gun store over another type of retail outlet. The motivation has something to do with a romantic attachment to a Ruger left for him by his uncle; despair brought on by his wife leaving him for his boss at Mesa Mitsubishi; and fear of continued humiliation as a low-level sales employee. The store is \"his chance to be more than another guy whose life came up soul-crushingly short.\" This is familiarly sympathetic. Nick's struggles with drug addiction are likewise sensitively drawn.\n\nThe text's bent toward sympathetic renderings of the Rizzos and their motivations makes it all the more intriguing that Sammartino devastates father and son with the contingencies of life, while refusing to fully connect David and Nick to the \"terror mixed with awe\" their store's wares promise. Sympathy can be made, often quite easily, of difficult circumstances. But how, and in what form, could sympathy for these men survive their own straightforward ideological engagement with their business, and the confrontation with sudden death and injury that such commodities makes predictable? A satire that really speaks to the contemporary moment would have an interesting answer.\n\nMatt Weir is a writer from Naperville, Illinois.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

The court doesn't care about mass death.\n\nA protester holds up a sign during a rally against gun violence outside the US Capitol on June 6, 2022 in Washington, DC.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Thursday struck down a New York state law limiting who can carry concealed handguns in public, a ruling that could invalidate most gun control laws throughout the country.\n\nCritics say the court's decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v. Bruen will likely increase gun violence , and comes one month after a mass shooting in Buffalo, New York, in which a white supremacist drove two hundred miles to specifically kill black people in a grocery store.\n\nAuthored by Justice Clarence Thomas, the ruling creates an onerous new standard for whether gun control measures are constitutional.\n\n\"To justify its regulation, the government may not simply posit that the regulation promotes an important interest,\" Thomas wrote. \"Rather, the government must demonstrate that the regulation is consistent with this nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation. Only if a firearm regulation is consistent with this nation's historical tradition may a court conclude that the individual's conduct falls outside the Second Amendment's 'unqualified command.'\"\n\nAccording to UCLA law professor Adam Winkler, one of the country's top experts on gun laws, the ruling could affect a new bipartisan gun safety bill that the Senate passed on Thursday. That bill would encourage states to implement so-called \"red flag\" laws, which allow firearms to be temporarily confiscated from those who are deemed to be a risk to themselves or others. It would also close the so-called \"boyfriend loophole,\" a gap in federal law that allows some domestic abusers to keep their weapons.\n\n\"The Court's Second Amendment ruling calls into question key parts of the Senate gun bill,\" Winkler tweeted after the decision came down. \"Thomas says only gun regulations consistent with historical regulation of guns are permissible. Red flag laws, however, are a modern invention. So too bans on domestic abusers.\"\n\nEarlier this week, the Lever 's David Sirota spoke with Winkler, author of Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America , about the New York State Rifle case and the state of US gun laws. Below is an abridged version of their discussion; stay tuned for next week's Lever Time podcast episode to hear the entire conversation.\n\nBefore we get to the current Supreme Court case, just lay out for us where we are at this moment when it comes to how the current Supreme Court looks at gun laws in America.\n\nWell, it's significant that the Second Amendment had never been authoritatively interpreted by the Supreme Court to protect an individual's right to have a firearm until 2008. In fact, for most of that time, when the court did rule on Second Amendment cases, the Court said it was only about protecting a well-regulated militia from federal interference.\n\nBut in 2008, in a case called DC v. Heller , the Supreme Court said that the Second Amendment does protect an individual right to bear arms, and struck down a law banning handguns in Washington, DC. But the court didn't provide much other guidance as to the scope of the right to bear arms, such as whether it allowed people to have military-style assault rifles or whether states could restrict concealed carry.\n\nIn the fourteen years since Heller , there's been just a tidal wave of litigation in the federal courts challenging any number of federal gun laws and the court seemed to stay out of it, until Donald Trump had his three appointees to the Supreme Court. And that changed everything.\n\nThe court now has a big case out of New York [ New York State Rifle ] on concealed carry. And we're expecting a ruling any day now. In that case, most people predict that the court is going to broadly interpret the Second Amendment to say you have a right to carry guns in public, and I think it may make it harder to defend almost any kind of gun law.\n\nWhat's the explanation for how much the court itself has shifted? Is it just individual appointees, or was there a movement specifically to put judges on the court that had a different view of guns?\n\nThe truth is, the Second Amendment is like every other constitutional provision we have, which means it is a reflection of an evolving and living society and the impact of social movements. And there's been a real movement to change how the Second Amendment is interpreted in the courts and elsewhere. Donald Trump got elected in part by promising to elect judges that were going to broadly read the Second Amendment. That worked for him, he got elected, and then he appointed those justices. And now they're going to do that work.\n\nSo constitutional law does not exist in a vacuum. It exists in a political environment. And we the people in America have decided we want gun rights. The Supreme Court's reflecting that, I think.\n\nCan you talk about how gun politics have shifted, and why and how it changed into a partisan issue?\n\nWell, I think gun politics in America were transformed overnight. And I don't say that to be hyperbolic.\n\nThere was a rising movement for gun owners who wanted to have guns for personal protection in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It was, like our own era, a time of social disruption and the feeling that maybe people were insecure. And there were very high crime rates at the time as well.\n\nThe leadership of the NRA [National Rifle Association] at the time was pretty moderate. They were opposed to a lot of gun control laws, but the leadership hatched a plan to move to Colorado Springs to refocus the organization away from political activity and toward recreational sports, hunting, and conservation.\n\nThis really angered a group of hardliners in the membership. And at the annual membership meeting in 1977 in Cincinnati, these hardliners staged a coup of the NRA, where they used the rules of order to elect a whole new board of directors.\n\nLiterally when the sun rose the next day, the NRA had been transformed. And the new directors were all committed to political advocacy, fighting gun control, and being much more politically assertive. And that group became an active part of the coalition that led to Ronald Reagan being elected president in 1980, and has since become an even stronger part of the Republican conservative coalition.\n\nTell us what the New York State Rifle case really is about, and explain how the Supreme Court gets to deregulate guns under the banner of a Second Amendment that says that arms effectively are supposed to be well-regulated.\n\nMost states allow you to carry a concealed firearm if you have a permit - and a growing number of states don't even require a permit. New York is one of eight states that say you can only carry a gun with a permit. And to get a permit, you have to show that you have some unusual and particularly strong reasons to carry a gun, like you're being stalked, you've been threatened, or you carry a tremendous amount of cash or jewelry with you.\n\nWhat this case does is question whether that's a violation of the Second Amendment to so heavily restrict access to concealed carry permits. And the Supreme Court seems almost certain, based on the oral arguments, to say that, yes, the Second Amendment is violated by New York's rule. The court is probably going to say you can have some training and objective requirements before you let people carry a gun on the street, but you have to provide some mechanism for people to be able to defend themselves.\n\nThis will be a great expansion of the Second Amendment. In over two hundred years of history, the Supreme Court has never said that. We've had restrictions on concealed carry, like New York's, for well over one hundred years. In fact, up until the 1980s, most states had exactly the law that New York has today.\n\nBut again, that political movement to change America's gun laws has been affected by the NRA, since they have led a nationwide effort, going state by state, to loosen gun laws. And now they're going to go after the few remaining holdouts with this Supreme Court case.\n\nI think that spells trouble for the gun safety movement's agenda on a lot of issues. I think bans on military-style rifles and on high-capacity magazines will likely be called into question in the coming years.\n\nAre we going to get to a place where the court is basically going to say that there is no line, that you can't regulate weapons or guns based on how powerful they are? I mean, is that a legitimate thing that may actually happen?\n\nI think what the court is going to say is that only those arms that are in common use for lawful purposes by the citizenry already are constitutionally protected. I think the court would easily say that things like shoulder-launch missiles or nuclear weapons or hand grenades, or even machine guns, are not in common use, they're not commonly owned by law-abiding people.\n\nThe difficulty about this test is it means that if there is a political stalemate, and you can't get regulation for some amount of years, gun owners can just go out and buy all those weapons, and then all of a sudden they become in common use. That's basically what's happening with military-style assault rifles. The gun owners have just gone out and bought tens of millions of these firearms since the end of the federal assault weapons ban in 2004, and now they're in common use.\n\nAnd we might see this with 3D-printed guns. It may be that if 3D-printed guns are something that Congress were to regulate or prohibit today, then they wouldn't be in common use. But if we wait twenty years, then maybe they are in common use, and then they're constitutionally protected.\n\nAs somebody who's studied this so much, do you really legitimately think that there is a future in America being as heavily armed a country as we are? Can we be this heavily armed, and also have a \"normal\" rate of gun deaths, as it relates to other countries?\n\nI don't think we can get down to the levels of gun violence that they have in England or Japan or other countries that don't have such ready access to guns. That's just not realistic. But we can reduce our numbers. And that should be our goal in the meantime.\n\nThe guns are here to stay. There's just too many of them, the political movement in favor of them is too strong. The NRA is always talking about people coming in and confiscating your guns. We could never get all the guns if we wanted to. So I think we have to focus on reducing gun violence and doing what we can in a bad situation.\n\nAdam Winkler is a professor of constitutional law at the UCLA School of Law.

That's thanks to the gun lobby, which fought for a state law that prohibits cities from restricting guns on public property.\n\nA Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) bomb technician and a law-enforcement official from the Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office patrol ahead of the Republican National Convention (RNC) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on Sunday, July 14, 2024. (Al Drago / Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nEven in the wake of an assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump that left two dead on Saturday, guns are still being allowed just outside the Republican National Convention this week in Milwaukee, Wisconsin - all thanks to the powerful gun lobby and its Republican allies, which have fought to make sure there's no way for the city to ban firearms.\n\nWisconsin state law prohibits cities from passing any ordinances restricting guns on public property - whether handguns or AR-15s. Republican-dominated legislatures have helped proliferate such \"preemption\" laws nationwide, preventing cities from making their own rules about firearms in gun-friendly states - as well as limiting the ability to pass antidiscrimination laws and protect rights like paid leave and minimum wage.\n\nThis means the city of Milwaukee is prohibited from banning guns from the so-called soft security zone that surrounds the Republican National Convention (RNC), which is bringing fifty thousand people to the city this week. Within this area, the Secret Service controls a smaller \"hard zone\" immediately around the convention center, where credentials are required to gain access and firearms aren't permitted. Most guns will still be allowed in areas directly outside this perimeter, even though commonplace objects like glass bottles and tennis balls are prohibited.\n\nThe arrangement remains even after the assassination attempt on Trump this weekend, noted Audrey Gibson-Cicchino, the RNC coordinator for the Secret Service, who said on Sunday that operational security plans would not be changing.\n\nJust last month, Milwaukee alderman Robert Bauman tried to force a city amendment to ban guns in the security zone for the convention. But the city's lawyers advised that any restriction on guns - apart from automatic weapons, like machine guns, that are already illegal in the state - would violate Wisconsin law.\n\n\"I wanted us to go ahead and pass the ban anyway,\" Bauman told the Lever , saying that as an attorney, he believed the city could make its case in court that lawmakers hadn't intended to prevent cities from imposing basic safety requirements during a major political event. But his colleagues refused, citing concern about potential litigation.\n\n\"We would garner a lawsuit, probably from a gun lobby group,\" one city attorney complained at a special meeting of the city's Public Safety and Health Committee in June. The gun lobby, including the National Rifle Association (NRA), the Second Amendment Foundation , and Gun Owners of America , have fought hard to enact and preserve these state preemption laws in Wisconsin and across the country.\n\nNow as tens of thousands flood to Milwaukee in the wake of several years of unprecedented high-profile cases of political violence , participants are legally allowed to bring \"all the ammunition you need,\" into the security footprint directly adjacent to the Republican National Convention, Bauman said.\n\n\"I would argue that the state legislature did not intend or envision a situation where you would be allowing firearms at a national security event,\" he added.\n\nPreemption laws generally allow higher levels of government to override lower levels of government: the federal government can preempt state governments, while states can preempt city ordinances.\n\nFor much of the country's history, local officials have kept the authority to determine their own firearm regulations. Yet over the past several decades, gun-rights lobbyists and Republican lawmakers have pushed to remove this power, relaxing gun laws nationwide.\n\nIn the 1980s, the small town of Morton Grove, Illinois, passed regulations prohibiting the sale or possession of handguns . In the months leading up to its vote, the village trustees for its 23,000 residents found themselves in the crosshairs of groups like the NRA, which sent out flyers protesting the ban. Another pro-gun-rights group, the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, wrote to each trustee, some of whom started receiving death threats. The NRA capitalized on the controversy to develop a new national strategy: overturning local regulations in court.\n\nAs a result, today \"state-level preemption laws keep more gun regulations off the books than the Constitution does,\" Joseph Blocher, a professor at Duke Law School, told the Lever .\n\nWisconsin, for example, passed a state gun-control law in 1995 that prevented local authorities from adopting potentially more restrictive firearm measures. Known as Act 72 , it prohibited stricter laws on the sale, ownership, or permitting of guns. \"[Gun lobbyists] lobbied heavily to get that state statute passed in the first place,\" Bauman said.\n\nSince then, some Wisconsin lawmakers have attempted to repeal this restriction but faced robust pushback from the gun lobby and the state GOP, which controls both legislative chambers. In 2017, the local gun-rights advocates group Wisconsin Carry brought a lawsuit against Madison's City of Transit and Parking Commission to get rid of a local ban on guns on public buses.\n\nWisconsin Carry argued that it violated Act 72, which had intended to make a uniform standard for firearm requirements across the state. In 2017, the state's Supreme Court agreed.\n\nThe NRA has filed briefs of support in previous Wisconsin lawsuits supporting the state's preemption laws, including in a case in 2006 over whether a bar owner could be prosecuted for carrying a gun in his car. It argues that preemption laws prevent a confusing patchwork of regulations.\n\nIn March, a group of Democratic Wisconsin lawmakers introduced a bill to end the preemption law for firearms, as they did in the previous legislative session . But like in years prior, the bill failed in the Republican-controlled legislature. Gun advocacy groups, including Wisconsin Firearm Owners , registered to lobby on the bill.\n\nIt's no coincidence that the majority of states now use preemption as a tool to support gun rights.\n\nNationally, forty-three states now have preemption laws restricting local governments' attempts to rein in gun violence. States like Colorado preempt regulations around particular conditions such as having guns in private vehicles, while others, like Texas, prohibit local authorities from weighing in on everything from transportation to licensing to discharging weapons. A few even punish local lawmakers: officials in Florida can be fined $5,000 for violating the state's preemption laws, and in Kentucky, they can face criminal charges .\n\nIncreasingly, it's not just guns that fall under preemption laws. Just as the NRA has recently expanded its lobbying efforts beyond gun rights, preemption regulations are now being wielded as a tool for other popular conservative issues. Wisconsin now has preemptions against everything from inclusionary zoning and rent control to banning plastic bags.\n\n\"Particularly in an era when we've seen a growing divide between the legislatures of red states and the preferences of blue cities within those states,\" said Blocher at Duke Law School, \"there's been a real push for preemption laws.\"\n\nThe Wisconsin legislature passed a bill in 2018 to prevent local authorities from developing their own employment law, including on matters like minimum wage. It's the latest setback in a string of efforts to improve labor protections. Milwaukee tried to require paid sick leave back in 2008, for instance. But in 2011, the state passed a ban prohibiting local governments from requiring employers to compensate ill workers.\n\n\"These types of legislature blockages have had a disproportionately severe effect on urban areas, where many of the state's residents of color live,\" found the Wisconsin Budget Project, an advocacy group focused on children.\n\nA recent report by the Economic Policy Institute, a nonprofit think tank, found that Southern and Midwestern states are more likely to misuse preemptions to interfere with labor standards. They write that state preemption laws are \"intertwined with a history of segregation and other policy choices that have reinforced anti-Black racism and white supremacy.\"\n\nThese laws have also been increasingly used to support the interests of deep-pocketed corporations. Pro-business groups like the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), for instance, have backed preemption efforts on a variety of issues. ALEC lobbied to prohibit the expansion of public broadband access ; its members have ties to major telecommunications companies. In states like Wisconsin, model language drafted by the group to block municipalities from competing with corporate providers of broadband services was passed in 2004.\n\nAs legislation efforts continue to hamper local governments from pursuing public-safety regulations, this week in Milwaukee, officials like Bauman will be holding their breath. Nor will the threat abate after the RNC wraps up - gun violence in Milwaukee will continue to be a problem even after the convention is over.\n\nBauman doesn't see much chance of that changing until the state's preemption laws do.\n\n\"I said, if there's one area where we can take some charge of this, it's this event,\" Bauman said. But it's \"not to be.\"\n\nYou can subscribe to David Sirota's investigative journalism project, the Lever , here .\n\nKatya Schwenk is a journalist based in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nLois Parshley is an award-winning investigative journalist.

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nWe're thankfully beginning to see mass organizing and protest against the epidemic of gun violence in the United States. But we can't let billionaires like Michael Bloomberg and solutions that further criminalize the poor and increase police power dominate the debate - we need a socialist approach to ending gun violence.\n\nOver 10,000 people marched through St. Paul, Minnesota, demanding lawmakers take action on gun law reform, on March 24, 2018. (Fibonacci Blue / Flickr)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nGun violence in the United States has long been a major crisis. Rates of firearm deaths are nine times greater here than they are in Canada and over seventy times the rate of Great Britain. (And with heavily armed soldiers operating in nearly 150 countries each year , Americans are disproportionately even more likely to kill with a bullet than they are to be killed by one.) This is a country so violent that its police officers, the people supposedly employed to protect us from things like gun violence, kill more of us each year than the total number of homicide victims in England and Wales .\n\nIn recent years, this emergency has finally started receiving the widespread attention it deserves. The urgency is driven by mass shootings, which understandably receive outsized media attention. But two-thirds of gun fatalities are suicides, and even among homicides, mass shootings account for fewer gun deaths than domestic violence or police killings . And while the number of mass shootings is accelerating at a terrifying pace, the overall gun fatality rate remains far below what it was in the 1970s or the early 1990s - although it's been rising in recent years.\n\nNone of these clarifications should lessen the sense of emergency around gun violence. In fact, while mass shootings may be statistically unrepresentative, they also convey a message that is both accurate and deeply moral: none of us should feel safe from gun violence. The impotent government responses that follow each public massacre give us a sense of existential dread at being trapped in a broken political system hijacked by a far-right minority.\n\nThe good news is that this crisis has created a novel political development: for the first time in generations, the push to \"do something\" about gun violence isn't being primarily driven by the reactionary law-and-order politics of the Right. Instead, the growing movement against gun violence has been fueled by revulsion at the impunity of weapons manufacturers and at the outsized political influence wielded by the racist vigilantism of the National Rifle Association (NRA).\n\nAt the national March for Our Lives rally organized after the Parkland school massacre, many speakers powerfully connected their experiences of losing loved ones to gun violence with the broader social justice themes of their generation's growing left. Edna Chavez talked about how the trauma of her brother's death was only worsened by police in her Los Angeles school who make students feel less safe. Trevon Bosley traced his own brother's death in Chicago to \"a city that feels it's more important to fund a college's sports complex than fund schools in impoverished communities.\"\n\nBut there's a notable gap between the radical sentiments expressed by Chavez, Bosley, and many others who have marched against gun violence and the moderate solutions that are still largely on offer from gun control organizations and Democratic politicians.\n\nThe movement against gun violence remains largely shaped by the centrist agenda of urban police chiefs and mayors - above all by Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York City mayor, current presidential candidate, and founder and funder of Everytown for Gun Safety . These groups are uninterested in the role powerful institutional forces like poverty and militarism play in our gun crisis. Instead, they exclusively focus on questions of which types of guns and gun users are the problem, an approach that pushes an agenda of expanded criminalization and helps lead to policies such as the \"stop-and-frisk\" policing for which Bloomberg recently gave an entirely unconvincing apology .\n\nThe revived American socialist movement, which has transformed the debates around health care and climate change with bold new demands, has been largely hesitant to enter the gun debate. We are horrified by gun violence but wary of supporting measures that will add to the already vast powers of the criminal justice system. We appreciate that oppressed and colonized people need the right to arm themselves but recognize that these days, the radicals on armed patrol are more likely to be border vigilantes and white supremacists.\n\nWhat follows is a proposed framework for how socialists can help build a movement against gun violence that is geared toward liberation instead of criminalization. It's not an all-encompassing vision like the Green New Deal, and it doesn't contain a signature policy like Medicare for All. It's also far from complete - important policy proposals like mandatory gun buybacks and \"red flag\" laws raise complicated issues that require more discussion than this space allows. But the hope is that a framework like this can help develop a distinct and popular left-wing approach to an issue that isn't going anywhere.\n\nFor decades, Republicans and Democrats have shared a neoliberal approach to government that transfers funding and power away from the government agencies that don't use guns, and toward the ones that do. Socialists want to reverse that process.\n\nWe need more anti-poverty and health care programs that address the causes and effects of gun violence, and we need more regulations on the gun industry - there's no reason why firearms should not be subject to at least as many health and safety rules as cars and pharmaceuticals. We need fewer carceral solutions like increased jail sentences for gun possession, aggressive policing strategies to \"get guns off the streets,\" and security measures like metal detectors and not quite \"random\" searches that make schools feel like prisons.\n\nA key starting point for a socialist approach to gun violence is that police and prisons are not solutions to gun violence but are in fact major contributors. Researchers with the Human Rights Data Analysis Group estimate that police account for a third of stranger homicides - and almost 10 percent of total murder victims. These are astonishing figures - almost as astonishing as their complete absence from most discussions about gun violence.\n\nWe need demands that target the absurd immunity and privileges that our gun culture bestows upon both gun manufacturers and law enforcement:\n\nAfter Nathaniel Berhow shot five of his Santa Clarita classmates before killing himself on November 14, there was justified fury at Senate Republicans who were at that very moment blocking legislation to end the so-called gun show loophole and require all gun buyers to go through the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). In fact, as in the case in many mass shootings, it's unclear whether background checks could have prevented Berhow's massacre. But that's typical of the gun control narrative that steers justified anger at American violence toward the narrow solution of background checks, which as currently constituted are both ineffective and reactionary.\n\nBackground checks are by far the most popular gun control proposal . They offer a false solution to what is self-evident after any mass shooting: that guy shouldn't have had a gun. In fact, the available evidence (limited thanks to the Dickey Amendment) is unclear about the effectiveness of background checks. Perhaps that's because most of the criteria used by the NICS - with the important exceptions of domestic violence and stalking - have little to do with higher rates of gun violence. Instead, the feds use categories straight from J. Edgar Hoover's \"enemies\" list, such as drug users and (actual NICS language) \"mental defectives.\"\n\nWhen socialists argue for policies like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal, we have the enjoyable task of raising expectations and making the case that a government not run by plutocrats can provide health care access and slow down climate change. With gun violence, however, we have to sympathetically but soberly rebut the false promises of safety offered by gun control groups who push to \"keep guns out of the wrong hands,\" warn against the destructive panic of bills like Vermont's stunningly broad \"domestic terrorism\" law , and give no quarter to the craven opportunism of proposals like tying gun ownership to the Islamophobic No Fly List .\n\nInstead, we have to put forward a very different public health framework for regulating gun ownership, one that rejects ignorant profiling and recognizes that there are no \"good guys\" and \"bad guys\" with guns, and that any of us are capable of turning at some point to violence and self-harm in a society already awash in guns and seething with hatred and trauma.\n\nWe should push for:\n\nThousands of ordinary people have organized for years against gun violence, but they have largely not been able to shape a movement dominated by the likes of Bloomberg and former Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel . The school walkouts and marches that broke out after Parkland offered a glimpse of a potentially very different movement. Over the past year and a half, March for Our Lives has become a youth organization with chapters around the country, worked through internal debates about racial inclusivity , held a national convention, and created an ambitious peace plan .\n\nThese are inspiring developments, but there is much more work to be done to develop a vibrant democratic movement that gets to the root of American gun violence. We need to hear from a range of voices with gun experiences beyond student survivors of mass shootings, including antiwar veterans, domestic violence survivors, indigenous water protectors, and mosque security volunteers. Collaborations among abuse survivors, mental health self-advocates, and police accountability activists are needed to develop proposals for addressing threatening domestic situations that don't further empower police. Forums should be created for ongoing discussions about the effectiveness of guns for collective and individual self-defense, led by those who have good reason not to trust the police to protect them.\n\nAbove all, we need to find ways to organize with the most numerous victims of the violence of American weaponry: those who have been invaded and occupied by our military and the proxy forces we arm. It's a travesty to hear Democrats propose banning assault weapons because they \"belong on the battlefield\" - as if modern American warfare looks like a Game of Thrones battle scene, with opposing armies meeting on empty fields. Today's \"battles\" take place in the same schools, public plazas, and workplaces where mass shootings take place back home. When Adam Lanza dressed up in military camouflage to murder the children at Sandy Hook , he sent a clear message that politicians can't stop people from deciding the geography of their own personal battlefields.\n\nThe era of mass shootings coincides with the era of endless war. Socialists should internationalize the gun violence movement with events that bring together victims of gun violence from Chicago to Iraq to help make that vital connection.\n\nMichael Bloomberg is a celebrated public health philanthropist - that's how he sees his work for gun control legislation. Yet during his time as mayor, nineteen hospitals closed in New York City. But the billionaire who was celebrated for aggressively challenging the smoking and soda-drinking habits of his working-class constituents was strangely passive about taking on this crisis created by a for-profit health care system. \"The reality is you can't have a hospital on every corner,\" he once said in response to protests against closing the only hospital within three miles of its Brooklyn location.\n\nLast year, the Trace , a gun violence news outlet funded by Bloomberg, reported that southern Queens neighborhoods that lost two hospitals and their only trauma center have seen their gunshot fatality rate rise almost 50 percent. That the widely prominent anti-gun figure saw no need to stop the closure of trauma centers that serve gunshot victims is a perfect illustration of the absurd degree to which centrists have steered the gun debate into a safe space tucked away from larger questions of social inequality.\n\nGun violence is deeply connected to health care, poverty, war, unemployment, domestic violence, migration, school and workplace alienation, and dozens of other factors. Any solution has to connect with broader demands for peace and justice, from Medicare for All to slashing the Pentagon budget to winning accountability for the crimes of police and ICE agents.\n\nThis approach goes against all the instincts of anti-gun violence organizations whose strategies rest on appealing to the \"common sense\" of a broad moderate majority against the irrational extremism of the NRA. We don't need to accuse the NRA of having an excess of intelligence to see that this is the wrong approach.\n\nThe NRA preaches a gun-fundamentalist gospel of cynicism, individualism, and paranoia that Trump has only made more popular. According to their Bad News gospel, the only thing you can count on is your ability to arm yourself to protect what's yours, and the day you let the government start to infringe on that right is the beginning of the end. It's a powerful message that connects this country's settler-colonial origins to our declining superpower present and our possible climate-apocalyptic future - with white nationalism as the constant.\n\nWe're not going to defeat that fire and brimstone with status-quo pragmatism, but with our own compelling vision: not more policing but a fighting peace and justice movement that fights climate change, pickets against hospital closures, and demands that power and resources be taken from the corporations and government agencies flooding us with weapons for killing and redirected toward the health, education, and environmental projects that can help us start living.\n\nFor non-billionaires, our most valuable property is what we own collectively - our schools, hospitals, and communities, our political rights and privacy, our planet. There are no stand-your-ground laws to help us secure this public ownership - we have to organize with one another in our workplaces and communities.\n\nThat's what West Virginia educators have done for the past two years with job actions that successfully resisted anti-teacher laws. In a state run by reactionaries who tout open carry laws as \"freedom \" even as they restrict basic rights on the job , these mostly women teachers have demonstrated an ability to protect their families and communities that no gun could ever provide.\n\nFor all the seeming intransigence on both sides of the gun debate, almost everyone agrees that the epidemic of mass shootings is a signal that something has gone very wrong in this society. Socialists can address that feeling in a way that Bloomberg can't. We can draw the obvious links between mass shootings at home and the push for mass bombings and shootings in Iran, and talk about the more nuanced connections to the atomization produced by closing neighborhood schools, hospitals, and factories, and a lifestyle of consumer solitude where most social interactions are mediated through Amazon or Instagram.\n\nMost importantly, we have an inspiring alternative to the dismal worldview held in common by the NRA and many gun control groups, which sees the high levels of US violence as inevitable and debates only whether the best good guys to protect us from bad guys are armed police or armed private citizens. If socialists can effectively enter the gun debate, we can win millions over to the idea that a more equal and just society will also be a more peaceful one.\n\nDanny Katch is the author of Socialism . . .

Confronting this bloodlust will require more than just gun control.\n\nThe term \"gun control\" has become an organizing principle for a fundamentally vicious, self-perpetuating dialectic between jingositic reactionaries and technocratic, carceral liberals. (Tom Def / Unsplash)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe United States was built on guns - and on the power to control them. During the colonial period, settlers banned indigenous and enslaved people from owning weaponry while distributing guns to marginalized groups who allied and traded with them. More recently, pro-police politicians from both parties have cracked down on gun possession among felons and in ghettoized neighborhoods while keeping it simple for angry young men, such as the Uvalde shooter, to purchase AR-15s.\n\nPatrick Blanchfield is the author of Gunpower: The Structure of American Violence , forthcoming from Verso Books. In his book and in articles for n+1 , the New Republic , the Nation , and other publications, Blanchfield uses the insights of psychoanalysis and deep history to understand the United States' addiction to violence. For Blanchfield, it is \"chronically fucked\" to frame the issue of mass shootings solely in terms of consumer-side gun control, which too often becomes a vehicle for right-wing reaction and the expansion of policing. Instead, we need to take on our country's militaristic arms industry and our culture's insatiable death drive.\n\nEarlier this month, Daniel Denvir interviewed Blanchfield for The Dig , a Jacobin Radio podcast. In their discussion, Blanchfield and Denvir attempt to find a new way to think about guns in a country whose history is deeply saturated with resentment, dispossession, and violence.\n\nRecent mass shootings have punctuated a generalized panic over crime that has been fomented and weaponized by Republicans with, of course, the eager acquiescence of centrist Democrats who never miss an opportunity to declare how much they support funding, not defunding, the police. It's true there has been a major uptick in Americans killing other Americans since the pandemic, but it's deluded to think that this has anything to do with the police being defunded, because, unfortunately, that did not happen. What's more, only murders and other sorts of violent attacks are on the rise. What accounts for this surge in violence, and what accounts for it then being mystified in political discourse as the consequence of a nonexistent reduction in funding for state violence workers?\n\nThere are a bunch of ways to unpack this fundamental question of our moment. Some of them are more glib than others, but that glibness is not necessarily reductive. There's a tragicomic way in which the Democrats are caught in this folly - this perverse dialectic with Republicans - where they're like, \"Don't worry, we're going to be tough on crime too,\" as if the people who they're trying to convince are somehow not going to attribute that toughness to the Republicans. It sounds like one of those old jokes about the masochist in having found the perfect partner in the sadist, and together they just make each other worse. Meanwhile, the rest of the world goes to shit.\n\nBut I do think we can take a step back from the empirics of crime, or even the exceptional fact of high-profile mass shootings, as opposed to other types of quotidian violence. And we can look at sort of a what you might call the libidinal economy of the United States in the contemporary moment: these interesting configurations of fear and anxiety and blame-making, and these constant shifts of position and projection, which ultimately boil down to the production of a status quo that changes only insofar as it gets more brutal and crueler.\n\nIt seems like the mass and nonmass shootings are all part of a larger American infrastructure and culture of armed violence that is not curtailed by police. Rather, it extends from the police, military, and border patrol through the gun shows selling AR15s to the weapons companies with stocks that rise after every mass shooting and to Republican campaign ads that feature candidates ready to open fire against a coming woke apocalypse of open borders and child groomers. What is the relationship between the long history of official state violence and today's increasingly terroristic forms of civilian violence?\n\nAs a thought exercise that underwrites my work in my book and my perspective, I think it's helpful to think about the deep history of settler colonization in North America and the multiple iterations of settlement and legitimacy and the development of various institutions. We should think about this in a way that doesn't involve any type of commitment to the terms of the state or the binary of the private sector versus the public sector. I know that sounds very abstract, but I think that if you de-link the conversational circuits that gun talk generally follows - if you step away from debating the right to bear arms or court determinations about self-defense - and instead look at the material political economy of guns in North America from before the United States was the United States up through its present state, certain things become clearer. You see certain patterns of political economy in the distribution of arms, the manufacture of arms, and the use of arms to form alliances between competing groups; you also see the way in which the distribution of arms is intimately tied to negotiations of race and jockeying for hierarchical positions within various long-standing and new antagonisms.\n\nBy trying to explain institutions like the Republic of Texas alongside the Confederate States of America alongside the federal entity of the United States alongside various other entities like breakaway Mormon settlers, you can sense the commonalities in the way this continent was flooded with guns. It proceeded to manufacture ever more guns and distribute the prerogative to use guns, in a kind of paradoxical inclusion-exclusion logic of universal access, combined with a universal fact that life is cheap.\n\nThe circumstances that we have now - we're the leading producer and exporter of small arms on the planet; we are an imperial hegemon but also a settler colonial state - differ in degree, rather than kind, from that originary brew, in which questions of legitimacy, authority, or even sovereignty are always explanations that are put on conflicts after victory has been declared and the bodies have been cleared. This is encapsulated by the paradoxical rhetoric of \"Stand Your Ground.\" As Roxane Dunbar-Ortiz and others have noted, what does it mean to invoke the principle of standing your ground in a country where the territory itself is stolen? If you're willing to think about contemporary US politics against the backdrop of a more broadly uncanny and estranged history, in which the given terms of periodization and of political institutions are secondary to these deeper structures, you can gain a lot of clarity.\n\nThis is the basic history of westward expansion, which made the United States the continent-striding empire that we now take for granted. But is all of this gun ownership and violence specifically an American phenomenon? We're talking about this fulcrum of American settler colonialism, where violence is or at least appears omnidirectional, where the outer reaches of a frontier state are extended by self-deputized individuals, mostly men, who are tasked with defending themselves and their property in the absence of a strong state. But do we see this sort of violence in other Anglo settler colonies such as New Zealand, Canada, and Australia, or in former British settler colonies in Africa, like Rhodesia? There are without a doubt more guns in this country than any other, and a certain violence follows from that. But does America really stand alone?\n\nI am truly grateful to you for asking that question and encouraging me to think about things in comparative terms, because the easy discourse of US exceptionalism does obscure some striking commonalities. This is one of these things that I find myself disambiguating very frequently with European journalists and scholars, who oftentimes want a monocausal explanation for why the United States is the way it is. Is it about arms manufacturers in the twentieth century? Is it about the frontier, by which they usually mean the Old West? Is it about the Civil War and slavery? In fact, it's about all these things layered on top of one another. Once you can view the present situation as a complex output of cumulative developments - stacked over time, competing with one another, or producing certain types of synchronicity - you get a lot more clarity. A crucial part of that involves looking at cases outside the United States.\n\nThroughout the history of European colonizers - whether they be trade ventures operating in a corporate model, whether they be Dutch or British or French or Spanish - there is the through-line idea of individuals being able to bear arms as a part of their participation in enterprises that we could call corporate. There are historical differences between the way, say, the French approached the parts of North America that later become French Canada and the way the Spanish and the Portuguese would divvy up colonial spaces as part of a logic of royalty - but we don't need to get too far into that. It's striking that, for example, the first British precedent for a right to bear arms in North America is not in the Constitution or even in British law but in the corporate guidelines of the Massachusetts Bay Company. Puritan settlers had a right and even an obligation, stipulated under corporate contract, to be armed, to protect themselves and the broader enterprise of trade, developing territory, and so on. The right to bear arms in this sense was understood as a feature of a corporate enterprise. So let's just put that out there, right from the beginning, as something that's decidedly underacknowledged. And in some ways, the text of this corporate guideline is eerily reminiscent of what was later inscribed in the Second Amendment.\n\nIf we bracket our commitment to understanding issues of sovereignty - what Max Weber would call the state's monopoly on legitimate violence - we can think about options for ratifying violence by nonstate or parastate actors, or delegates of the state. In the transatlantic context of the sixteenth century onward, you arrive at all of these interesting formations like letters of marque for pirates. Freebooters were given a specific contract that allowed them - in a sort of extension of the king's sovereign right to kill and let die - to fly the flag, use cannons and guns, board other ships, steal, plunder, and loot. They could do so as an extension of a prerogative that would otherwise extend only over the coastal waters of the European metropole in question. There are some interesting conceptual articulations of this extension that emerged in this period. For example, there's a lot of talk about the idea of \"hydrarchy,\" as in the hydra, the many-headed beast; there are discussions about how these pirates formed a hydrarchy, and they had this distributed sort of sovereignty.\n\nIt's also interesting to think about the seventeenth-century arms trade in a thoroughly transatlantic context. Doing so has a bunch of ramifications. The first is that, in the context of what various historians will call revolution in the development of the fiscal-military state in Europe, there was a bootstrapping process by which state centralization is fueled by industrial, early industrial, or proto-industrial centralization of the ability to manufacture arms and trade them. As the militaries of nations centralize, so do their arms industries. Another point to bear in mind here is that even while colonizers in North America had all sorts of rules preventing indigenous people and slaves from having access to weapons and the technology for making bullets, there was widespread dissemination of weapons as tools for cultivating trade, partnership, and alliances with local groups, for everything from raiding other groups for slaves to ensuring trade of furs or other natural resources.\n\nFrom the sixteenth to the seventeenth century and onward, the British flooded North America with guns for indigenous people to use, and the French did this as well, with weapons that would travel to the far west via indigenous trade networks. The cross-Atlantic perspective is absolutely vital for understanding this history, because these powers did much the same on the other side of the Atlantic, in Western Africa. There was this idea of giving weapons to local partners both as trade goods of value in their own right and as tools to facilitate slave raids further into the African colony: this sort of divide-and-conquer model was used both on the African side of the Atlantic and on the Eastern Seaboard. There is new and interesting research about European trade of firearms into the Indian Ocean states as well. All of this is to say that state formation, both on the European continent and in the settler colonial periphery, was intimately linked up with a wide circulation of arms and legitimacy beyond the traditional European boundaries of sovereignty.\n\nOutside the United States, does gun ownership correlate with gun violence in the way that it does here? What about New Zealand, Canada, and Australia? What accounts for this seeming American exceptionalism?\n\n\"The structure of American violence\" is the subtitle of my book. The substance of it is an attempt, as a thought exercise, to narrativize this history but also to describe a theoretical model for the state in question: a society or civilization where guns and the right to distribute them are widely available, but differentially, in order to perpetuate hierarchies and processes of racialization. I call this model \"gunpower.\" And the question is: how exceptional is this model in a global perspective?\n\nIt's very helpful to think about other Anglo settler states, but also about more contemporary examples in South America and Southern Africa. To get more specific, one thing that I would argue makes the American example singular, is that unlike other members of the British Commonwealth, the Americans seceded from the British Empire and got away with it successfully. In no small part, this was because they had their own weapons as well as vast influxes of weapons from the French. We can talk more about how they then immediately and rapidly built up their own armory system. But the US secessionists, the US revolutionaries, broke from Great Britain using a whole apparatus of formal army and irregular warfare.\n\nPut simply, the British Empire learned from that experience and implemented its lessons elsewhere in the Anglosphere. It's not a coincidence, for example, that after formalizing British surrender at Yorktown, General Charles Cornwallis wound up in India, where his task was to prevent the settler-elite class of Anglo-Indians from developing a power base that could potentially threaten British hegemony there. Likewise, it's worth noting that in the case of New Zealand there was a extensive effort to arm certain Maori proxies; later, in Australia, there is a an interesting parallel problem involving the large population of exogenous others, i.e., British convicts. Those are situations where, to put it grimly, the work of ethnic cleansing was carried out over a smaller population than in North America and in a much shorter period of time.\n\nThere are some differences between Australia and New Zealand that are worth talking about. For one, while the Maori are absolutely racialized as others, they had distinctive agricultural practices and forts, and they waged a series of wars from the 1840s onward against settlers. A kind of grudging relationship vis-à-vis the Maori produces a social formation that is of course highly inegalitarian, and involves tons of confinement, but ends up in a position of settlement and some degree of stability by the twentieth century. In Australia, however, you have a model, much as in India, of colonial policing, and a systematic but subsequently disavowed effort to eradicate Aboriginal peoples: Aboriginal peoples were racialized as barbarous and savage precisely because they didn't have farms and they were highly mobile. And over the course of the nineteenth century, what that leads to is parties of settlers, in a way that does resemble the American model, forming ad hoc posses alongside colonial police - namely Aborigines who were drawn from other parts of the continent - waiting until nighttime to find campfires of Aborigines and then just killing them. That's a history that at least white Australian historians are only now fully turning to.\n\nIn the Australian archives, there's an interesting vocabulary of \"dispersal.\" You find texts like \"the Royal Police and the colonial police and sundry citizens came across a group of Aborigines and then dispersed them.\" What \"dispersed\" means is \"shot them all.\" But there's a twofold similarity and difference there with the American model. The similarity is that, yes, there is widespread ethnic cleansing, albeit understood as part of a colonial project and a logic of policing; that project is not the same as the US one, in that it doesn't have the federalist US model or the state US model. But the other thing that happened is that when, in the mid-nineteenth century, Australian gold was discovered in New South Wales and elsewhere and a bunch of Americans showed up with a ton of guns, the response of Australian authorities was to flood mining camps with police officers. The idea of Americans toting guns the way that they had been doing on the North American continent carried unacceptable risks, whether they were international crime or a repetition of what happened in the eighteenth century with the Revolutionary War.\n\nSo the state reverted to a stricter monopoly on violence after the acute period of settler colonial genocide in Australia.\n\nYes, it did. So there was this combination of a relatively sparse population of Aboriginal peoples, separated by many different languages over a large period of time, but also a campaign of ecocide and an act of enclosure. There was also a logic that in some ways resembles what happened in parts of the United States, in which colonizers who are lower on the social ladder, such as convicts, enter respectable society through killing Aboriginal peoples. They do a very efficient job of killing Aborigines, more so than in North America.\n\nNow, this brings us to the other examples of Southern Africa and Brazil, which are very important to my inquiry and which represent key examples of gunpower. First, let's talk about Southern Africa. It's striking that the experience of Southern African colonization resembles the colonization of North America: it was led first by Dutch and then by French Calvinists, transitioning into a brief British holding because of complexities involving the war with Napoleon. Basically, you have a hardy group of settlers who are gripped by an austere Calvinist vision and want to pursue herding and farming and produce large families and who also are at continual war with and practice slavery of Khoekhoe and other indigenous African groups. As the nineteenth century proceeds, British control grows; the Southern African coast becomes a more important spot for refueling and trade, especially once mineral resources are discovered. The Boer farmers resist these developments, seceding from settled coastal areas, moving inward in these great treks, and perpetuating slavery under the name of the orphan trade.\n\nTwo things are striking about the polities that the Boers form. First, those polities are strongly republican in a classic Jeffersonian way. In fact, many Boer leaders will invoke Thomas Jefferson and his idea of freeholding farmers making the land productive. The second thing to note is that what these polities run on are not formal armies but a militia-based structure, what the Boer call \"kommando.\" These are essentially a cadre of men who are obligated to form armed groups - providing their own ammunition, rifles, and horses - that work through a decentralized structure to defend homesteads and to do ethnic cleansing. By the end of the nineteenth century, with the discovery of diamonds, gold, and other mineral resources, the Boers, like the Americans, mounted a successful war against British occupation and then proceeded to get entangled in further conflicts such as the Second Boer War, which didn't go as well. But here again, the British learn from their mistakes, grant certain degrees of sovereignty to the Boers, and put them on a path toward membership in the Commonwealth and then independence. As a result of this history, both Rhodesia and South Africa, even against international pressure and boycotts, become remarkably prolific manufacturers of arms and small arms in particular. South Africa arms a great deal of the rest of Southern Africa for a long period of time.\n\nJust as the apartheid South African Defense Force is the most powerful military in Southern Africa, if not all of Africa, for quite a long time.\n\nPrecisely. And what this produces in our contemporary situation is a state that is analogous in many respects to the United States with regard to gunpower: the stark realities of gun violence impact everything from domestic violence to suicide, from criminalized violence to racial violence, from intragroup violence among the poor to gated communities that protect the rich with an enormous apparatus of private security. This violence bleeds through between military and police elements. That's why South Africa is, to me, the most striking peer state the US has when we think about the political economy of guns. The comparison is one that a lot of Americans refuse to even consider. When British scholars and journalists ask me questions about why the United States is so terrible, they will only ever suggest New Zealand, Australia, and Canada as counterexamples. If you mention either the phrase \"settler colonialism\" or the example of South Africa, generally those interviewers don't answer well.\n\nAnd yet Brazil, I think, is increasingly a point of comparison for the United States.\n\nThat's the other one, which is really striking, because the story of Brazil is very complicated. In some ways, it resembles the corporate settlement patterns that you see in the United States. But it also has a different sort of geographical logic, wherein major urban centers are founded on the coast, but the interior is extremely inaccessible for long periods of time. Some of these coastal cities have more direct communication with the Portuguese mainland than they do with one another. But over time, you do have this development of slave-raiding parties and of a clear racialized hierarchy, which is fundamentally antiblack, even though Brazilian whiteness isn't quite the same thing as what we have here.\n\nHowever, the key point is that formal, nationally sanctioned arms manufacturing on an industrial scale is basically a mid-twentieth-century phenomenon in Brazil; those guns are also exported throughout South America. And I don't think it's a coincidence either that there's a massive private security apparatus in Brazil and that the Brazilian right, particularly under Jair Bolsonaro, is sort of like a family. Several of Bolsonaro's sons are clamoring for, in their own words, a Second Amendment for Brazilians. So here we have a parallel case of a highly inegalitarian, highly racialized, extremely violent polity, in which arms are also being manufactured on a vast military scale. Police are heavily militarized, and individual civilians of a reactionary type are trying to emulate the US model - and in the case of Bolsonaro's sons, actually cultivating ongoing relationships with the National Rifle Association (NRA).\n\nIs there a relationship between the longer duration of these violent processes in the United States and the fact that the expansionist American empire always imagined itself to have a sort of limitless frontier? Of course, as Greg Grandin reminds us, that frontier is not limitless, and we may be finding those limits today.\n\nYeah, we may be hitting a point where our universe starts to contract and go back to our original big bang in some ways. But I do think that, in the case of the United States, various shifts in labor organization and systems of production were able to rapidly produce new configurations of armed legitimacy to straddle the gap and to buy time for formal state capacity. For example, you have entities like the Pinkertons, who emerge to protect railroads and clamp down on industrial uprisings during the Second Industrial Revolution. The Pinkertons simultaneously operate with the blessing of the federal government in a sort of para-secret-service role; they cross borders and are delegated as rangers by states like Texas in order to track down bank robbers.\n\nYou also have groups like Citizens' Councils or the White League that arise to impose the Ku Klux Klan's racialized hierarchy. Really, the Klan is the other key example of this. The first Klan is a reaction to the fact that nearly a quarter million black troops return home with their service weapons after the Civil War, and the priority of the white caste system is to disarm them. This violence has a sort of fungibility - I've been using this term in lieu of sovereignty for five years, but now, unfortunately, it has other digital associations. It's helpful to think about American violence and legitimacy, not in terms of sovereignty, but in terms of fungibility: it can be cashed in and cashed out, it's fundamentally liquid, and it's a competitive commodity, much like whiteness itself. As the political-economic system changes, the US state is very welcoming to adaptive modes of distributed violence. That's a recurrent feature, one that takes all sorts of new forms going both forward and backward.\n\nI want to talk about some of those newer forms that have emerged since the summer of 2020. Blue Lives Matter has become core to MAGA ideology. On its flag, the thin blue line is the police. Everything above it is meant to represent civil society, and everything below is the criminal elements of chaos that threaten the order and security of the good citizenry. What accounts for this extreme identification with the forces of repression among large segments of the civilian population at this particular moment in American history?\n\nBlue Lives Matter is an interesting phenomenon to see people embrace after years of critiquing the shallowness of \"identity politics.\" Jeff Sharlet has written about the origins of the Blue Lives Matter Flag in Harper's : it came from a small business guy on Etsy. And it's become an identity, a form of police identitarianism. People identify with the police as a show of support. It's a job that has become an identity category, which is also taken to be the praetorian class of people on whose shoulders hangs the possibility of protecting civilization against barbarism. It's sort of goofy, but it's also uncanny how there are several states, such as Louisiana, where the police are legally a protected class. Spraying \"All Cops Are Bastards\" on a police car is treated as a hate crime against Police Americans. It's amazing to think that a profession is granted the same, or even a superior, degree of protection as, say, sexual orientation or religious belief or ethnic background. It's simply bonkers.\n\nWe can put this issue in a comparative perspective through the work of the security studies scholar and sociologist Paul Amar. There are other countries - Omar's work takes the examples of Brazil and Egypt as key - where police forces facing public crises of legitimacy embark on processes of moral vigilantism, at once top-down and ersatz. These include grassroots movements of police identitarianism that center around protecting the family and the children, that leverage themes of evangelical or fundamentalist religiosity, and that are about defending Brazil or Egypt against quintessentially sexual minorities, against supposed sex traffickers of children, against supposed sexual deviants, i.e., trans people. And these are canny, successful ways for police to consolidate their power, court legitimacy, and get full-throated support from people, even as their brutality and the representation of that brutality in the media remains unchanged.\n\nFor decades, pro-gun control liberals have worked with the Right to intensify gun laws that target gun crimes: the mere fact that a felon has a gun is itself a felony. And those measures, of course, do a lot to spur mass incarceration but nothing to control the entirely legal production and distribution of guns. Indeed, the NRA's image of the honorable, law-abiding gun owner requires the specter of the armed criminal as its constitutive other. The discussion of guns often assumes that we don't have any gun control in this country and that there is a totally laissez-faire system at work. But you've written that gun control is, in fact, a central feature of the landscape of American violence. What sort of gun control do we have in this country? And how does it shape the sorts of violence that we see unfolding today?\n\nI think we can pull back and go for a deep historical perspective here. At that point, we observe that the regulation and distribution - the control, in those terms, of firearms - has been a constitutive if not quite constitutional feature of the North American civilizational settler enterprise. Since the get-go, there has been a perennial concern with who can have guns and what those guns can be used for, and a profusion of situations where people can choose to arm themselves but may be legally killed. So that's the deep structure here, from my perspective.\n\nThroughout the British colonial era and the antebellum era, what is anathema to elites and to the majority power structure is the idea of bad guys getting guns. And because the bad guys are always going to get the guns, they say that the good guys need yet more guns. But of course, then the bad guys are able to get those guns, and so on and so forth. Now, what's interesting for our purposes in the twentieth century - and the reason I'm using this sort of abstract language about the \"distribution and regulation\" of guns - is that the term \"gun control,\" much like legal fixation on the Second Amendment, only really starts to be used in the mid-1950s. \"Gun control\" is not a given, naturalized term of American politics, and it never has been. It's obviously not used in the Constitution, but more importantly, if you look through newspaper headlines prior to around 1955, gun control will come up in the context of, \"Well, we're putting machine guns on planes that are made of balsa wood and paper, so how do they control those guns?\"\n\nThe term \"gun control\" enters US discourse when then senator John F. Kennedy proposes a gun control act, a piece of legislation that fails in the Senate. But his act is a protectionist measure designed to safeguard the interests of New England firearms manufacturers, like Remington and Smith & Wesson. Another poetic irony of this is that prior uses of the word \"control\" in the congressional record are all about import-export regulations. And indeed, the guns Kennedy wants to control are cheap, imported World War II surplus. Right after every American war, there is the problem of a tremendous amount of surplus guns that spread out to the population, whether they be the guns that black Union soldiers go back home with or the case of World War II. In the case of World War I, it's all these tommy guns that never got into the trenches, because the idea came too late, that produced gun control acts in the '30s.\n\nIn the 1950s and onward, the problem is these large stockpiles of Italian-, German-, and French-made firearms that can be bought very cheaply. The Kennedy plan is to prevent import of those weapons so as to drive up sales of classic American guns - and that's what gun control initially means. Now, again, talk about the brutal ironies of history: it is precisely by an Italian-made World War II rifle that Kennedy is killed. A bunch of Democratic senators, including Senator Thomas Dodd Sr, attempt to seize upon the assassination of JFK by one of these scary foreign weapons. This is another theme that goes all the way back to the founding. The Dutch are giving Mohawks scary flintlocks; the Sioux are getting their hands on scary Winchester rifles. And \"Marxists\" like Lee Harvey Oswald, if you want to believe that story, are killing presidents with these scary European guns.\n\nThe push for a gun control act in Congress fails repeatedly, but it has both an immediate and a longer-term series of profound repercussions. The first is that when a federal gun control law happens under the Lyndon B. Johnson administration in '68, it is paired with an enormous omnibus crime bill that arms police with military weapons, puts them in schools, and helps proliferate militarized responses through 911 systems. So keep in mind that from the get-go gun control is always about the restriction of bad evil weapons and is always wedded with giving additional funds to the police. Johnson, for instance, has several press conferences where he talks about how our streets are being flooded with \"Soviet guns.\" Nevertheless, Johnson's Gun Control Act is an uphill battle because the NRA fights it, and it only really kicks in when Martin Luther King Jr is assassinated and cities around the country erupt in protest. The Gun Control Act then is brought in because the uprisings are too frightening.\n\nThe NRA is an organization that came up in the nineteenth century. It was a private charity organization like the YMCA, but it was also about training people in the use of weapons and literally distributing guns from the War Department. It was heavily involved in the arms trade more generally and has always had, even in the 1920s, a strongly xenophobic, anti-Bolshevik tinge. In the 1950s and '60s, the NRA was in an interesting position, where a lot of its traditional membership were former high-level military brass, but the organization was contemplating a move from DC to the West, to turn toward hunting and outdoorsmanship.\n\nIt was during the 1960s and '70s that the NRA, always a right-wing organization, became deeply involved in the culture war. However, if you look back at NRA magazines from the 1920s, they were already concerned about filthy southeastern European immigrants and their Bolshevik leanings and the fact that people need to stockpile guns to fight off a Bolshevik takeover of the country. There were also a lot of blue-blooded NRA members and naturalists, like James Audubon in the nineteenth century, who wanted to exclude Italian immigrants from having Second Amendment rights.\n\nA lot of the Teddy Roosevelt-era conservationists were ardent eugenicists and nativists as well.\n\nYes. And it's interesting that their line was something like \"the Second Amendment should not apply to Italians because they are savage bird killers.\"\n\nAnyway, in the '60s, the NRA had a kind of old guard-new guard dynamic. The NRA is considering moving out west and abandoning a lot of the self-defense rhetoric, or at least downplaying that, even though it's always been part of its deal.\n\nAnd downplaying the lobbying aspect.\n\nYes, precisely. Essentially, there is a coup within the NRA led by a figure discussed in Greg Grandin's work: former border patrol czar and killer of a young Mexican boy Harlan Carter. The coup also involved Byron Engle, whom you may be familiar with from the history of counterinsurgency policing and Stewart Schrader's work Badges Without Borders . Engle was a huge gun nut and a member of the NRA who ended up committing suicide with a gun, but that's neither here nor there. He helps bring in Carter and all these right-wing members of what you could call a \"deep state,\" in the sense that they do intelligence and counterinsurgency work together, to engineer a takeover of the NRA and a hard push toward self-defense, culture war issues, and a reprise of this frontier discourse of defense. But now it's defending suburbia against uprisings of savage \"Negroes\" who were storming Fort Apache.\n\nA central organizing feature of the NRA during this transition, which allows reactionaries like Carter and Byron Engle to consolidate their power, is the reaction to the Gun Control Act. So in a very perverse way but in a way that is absolutely legible, gun control - which, again, only means import bans of guns - becomes the thing around which a right-wing NRA right consolidates itself, in a kind of dialectic. And it's the NRA's opposition to gun control that in turn leads a liberal tough-on-crime movement, also tethered to the intelligence and policing community, to define itself against the NRA. So the term \"gun control\" becomes an organizing principle for a fundamentally vicious, self-perpetuating dialectic between reactionaries - who are tethered to the arms industry, a decentralized vision of violence, and red-blooded, jingoistic patriotism - and administrative, technocratic, carceral liberals. \"Gun control\" is the term through which they can understand one another and fundraise.\n\nAre there forms of gun control that do not rely on the state's own claim to a monopoly on legitimate violence? Bans enforced by armed cops would not only provide a pretext for further policing but could also lead to Ruby Ridge-type situations. Other strategies, like gun buyback programs, seem pretty anemic to me. The proposal to sanction gun manufacturers seems more promising but might be politically impossible, like so many things we want to do. What are the meaningful alternatives to the gun control status quo?\n\nThe phrase \"gun control\" is chronically fucked. As an organizing frame, it allows for a carceral liberal model to proceed and for a reactionary, ghoulish model to follow it. Every time Joe Biden mentions the phrase \"gun control,\" the NRA becomes more powerful. A perverse legacy of a gun control push from the liberal establishment might be that the NRA is resuscitated from its current position of financial abjection and corruption as a right-wing grifter organization. I think gun control itself is pretty much fucked, both because it's always been about protectionist measures for US arms manufacturers and because it's almost always been tethered to massive arming of police.\n\nGun buyback programs work in some cases, but they don't work in others. What are we supposed to make of the fact that there are gun buyback programs in some municipalities, but there are also municipalities where police departments are obliged by law to resell guns seized from crime scenes for profit? It's sort of a Dutch-boy problem - there are too many holes to plug. And also, don't get me started about these fantasies of very masculine visions of gunpower on the part of radical organizations, who try to declare things like \"temporary autonomous zones.\" I'm not knocking that as a venture in the abstract, but doing that within this messy state results in the usual suspects getting shot. That's part of the tragedy of the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ) in Seattle. However, I'm not in a position to gainsay independent self-defense or community defense actions, since one thinks here of Frantz Fanon: a lot of things that are revolutionary involve an acceptance of the death of the revolutionaries themselves.\n\nBut I do think that there are tons of non-gun-control options that could make gun violence less of a problem. For instance, in Chicago - whose gun violence people tend to bring up in a trollish way, to minimize massacres - local activists were able to produce a trauma center. So on a triage level, if you have trauma centers, and if you have expanded medical care, people are less likely to die of gunshot wounds. They'll simply get to the hospital faster. It doesn't satisfy the perverse impulse of a liberal who wants jackboots with guns to kick down the doors of white people with guns, as if that's a solution to gun violence; from my perspective, there's a difference in intensity rather than a difference in kind between liberals who will sneer at the idea of personally carrying a gun but are happy to call the armed police, and people who want to own guns themselves. I don't see much moral differentiation between those two.\n\nCertain types of gun violence are just the tip of the iceberg of other kinds of violence. Gun violence is uniquely lethal, to be sure, and the consequences of gun wounding are horrible - but gun violence tracks to other types of immiseration, desperation, and denial of opportunities. If you interview youth who carry illegally in various urban centers around the country and you ask what would get them to stop doing that, the answer is generally that they would like to not have to walk through open-air drug markets, and they would like to not have to join a set and get involved in retaliatory violence or otherwise be killed. Of course, the solution to these problems is not to double down on policing; it's probably some kind of drug legalization. If you ask people, \"Why are you carrying a gun as you work in this underground economy?\" the answer is, \"Because I can't get a job with dignity that pays enough to live.\" These are very basic solutions.\n\nWe should also consider gun suicide as a kind of gun violence. If you look at the demographics of who commits suicide that way, the overwhelming majority is white, middle-aged men. The numbers are crazy: I've come across United Nations data showing that white, middle-aged, American men are something like 75 percent to 80 percent of gun suicides on the planet, which is really saying something. Any actuary can tell you that when men hit middle age and they face a difficult medical diagnosis, a chronic episode of depression, a divorce, a bankruptcy, a layoff, or the loss of a home, the chances of their shooting themselves get exponentially higher.\n\nNow, hear me out: I'm not saying we need to protect marriage or some bullshit like that. Divorces happen for a reason, and often it's a very good reason. But on another level, you have to wonder, if life were less miserable, if someone's losing a job wasn't all that stood between them and being homeless, if a medical diagnosis wasn't a ticket to bankruptcy, if you didn't have to contemplate losing your family farm to some horrible agribusiness, then probably you wouldn't be as likely to kill yourself - which is all to say that people don't people generally don't commit murder and self-harm out of exuberance and joy and a plentitude of options. It happens because of immiseration and desperation and a limited set of possibilities. Part of what I think is so sick about our current situation is that a lot of right-wing figures, like J.D. Vance or Ted Cruz, like to invoke \"mental health\" as a problem. But they do it in a way that is totally disingenuous.\n\nThey do it just to deflect from the guns.\n\nYeah, exactly. And never mind that people with mental health issues are dramatically more likely to be victims of gun violence, particularly by the police, than they are to be violent themselves. But the truth of the matter is that if we were to have universal health care, single-payer or free, and we were to diminish the stigma of psychiatric care or simply produce networks of social care where people could check in with one another, then people might feel a little less atomized and a little less likely to off themselves.\n\nThere is some interesting criminological literature about this, focusing on California, where there's a lot of suburbanization and immigration from other states. In situations where people don't know one another, people tend to lose it: California has a disproportionate number of serial killers. It's not because they listen to the Red Hot Chili Peppers constantly - it has to do with the fact that there are a lot of transplants, a lot of people who don't have organic communities. If you have neighbors, if you have institutions of care, if you have a functioning society rather than a hollowed-out neoliberal hell, then people are more liable to check up on you before you reach the level of harming someone or yourself.\n\nIt seems like it cannot be a coincidence that the age of mass shootings is also an era of anomie driven by late-stage suburbanization and terminal onlineness.\n\nYeah. Some other factors are pervasive militarization, a hyperconcentration of the burdens of forever war on the poorest members of society, an unequal distribution of exposure to risk, and fantasies about guns as a source of power and as things that solve problems. Despite my psychoanalytic commitments, I'm oftentimes drawn to the thinking of William James, the quintessential American philosopher and psychologist. He has this idea of things being \"live options.\" For a lot of people, turning to a gun to kill their family or kill themselves is a live option; it's socially imaginable, it's psychically available, and it's at hand.\n\nAlthough American rates of gun ownership have no real analogue elsewhere on the planet, there are countries with very high rates of gun possession that don't have the same problem with suicide, femicide, or mass shootings. And those happen to be countries with less social inequality, better health care systems, and more social connection in general. Suppose gun control talk is a trap: it produces more types of gun violence, because I do think mass incarceration is gun violence, or is certainly made possible by it. Then maybe making people less miserable and desperate could go a long way toward fixing this problem.\n\nI agree with everything that you've said there, but aren't the guns themselves still a big part of the problem? Don't guns kill people alongside people killing people? Even if it's not politically possible right now, shouldn't we try to target the gun industry's production of guns?\n\nLet me be clear: we can disambiguate between demand-side elements - which include both making it less socially imaginable to use guns and the worse option of regulating guns through policing - and supply-side elements. There is potential on the supply side, but decades of commitment to the false horizon of gun control and an exceptionalist way of thinking about the United States as an isolated domestic space have made things really, really difficult.\n\nEvery time you hear Democratic politicians talk about how absolutely horrible it is that kids in our schools and on \"our streets\" are killed by weapons of war, you have to wonder, why is it that so many of these weapons of war are made here to begin with? The flip side of that statement is that these killings are okay if they're on someone else's street. And in fact, figures like Pete Buttigieg have explicitly said things like, \"Weapons like the one I carried in Afghanistan have no place on our streets or in our schools.\" The answer is not to appeal to this elsewhere where those guns belong but rather to recognize that if we're committed to diminishing gun violence at home, that also means diminishing our apparent lust for committing and perpetuating gun violence abroad.\n\nSmall arms are the largest generator of fatalities worldwide because they're durable and cheap, but they are only a tiny part of a gargantuan military-industrial arms lobbying apparatus. It is terrifying and bizarre that defunding, nationalizing, or eliminating the US arms industry in toto, from F-35s to MRAPs to land mines to M4s, is just not something that people talk about in the mainstream.\n\nI think the real sense of futility that people feel is typically expressed in frustrations with the power of the NRA. That's real, but something deeper, I think, is that Americans know that the country is armed to the hilt, from the military to the police to the home. A generalized disarmament of this country is very hard to imagine, because the people won't disarm as long as the police are armed and the police won't disarm as long as the people are armed.\n\nIt's an arms race, a logic of mutually assured destruction on the micro level. And I think you don't have to be a psychoanalyst to see that the mantra of \"From my cold, dead hands\" is basically a suicide vow, right? It doesn't feel like \"defiant until the end\"; it's more like, \"I'm going to kill myself.\" I'd rather have this gun and cling to this power than let an alternative world happen. On the macro level, there are a lot of people who similarly seem to think that the end of the world is better than a diminution of American hegemony. And the macro-level logic is even more depressing, because if you think life is cheap when it comes to guns, the cheapness of life when it comes to $100 million planes and missiles is unimaginable.\n\nThere were brief moments in American history, specifically following World War I and in the '20s and '30s, where there was talk of ending the \"merchants of death\" industry. This effort was largely destroyed, thanks in no small part to red-baiting and persecution by Jay Edgar Hoover's FBI, which led to the suicide of more than a few activists and politicians. But the effort was also undone by the turn toward military Keynesianism, which has been our model since the 1930s.\n\nThere is no analogy, even when it comes to the police, to the bipartisan consensus around lavishing funds on arms manufacturers, even when branches of the military say they don't need these new weapons: \"We need to we need to slow down on the F-35s\"; \"No, we don't want the Osprey\"; \"No, these MRAPs are a mess.\" We simply throw more and more money at the manufacturers. We need to talk about the fundamental illogic of constantly doubling down on violence on the macro scale because only then can we deal with the relatively piddling manufacture of small arms.\n\nIt's a two-way street, because the state buys all these arms and then arms manufacturers and gun rights advocates really emphasize this relationship to military service. And then, as you mentioned, liberals emphasize that too, but they do so by insisting that murderous weapons should only be deployed on dangerous others beyond our borders. What is going on with the Right wanting to bring the war home and liberals wanting to keep the war confined to foreign realms?\n\nThis is the point where some psychoanalysis is helpful, because we're dealing with people trying to maintain a hygienic distinction between violence that happens over there and that can't happen here. That's not how violence works. It's the folly of being like, \"Well, what if we just repressed the repressed better, then it won't return.\" But no - there's a reason violence workers, such as the police, are more likely to be violent to other people outside of their jobs. There's a reason why the military has a pervasive sexual assault and suicide problem. You can't leave things outside the home or the homeland, particularly when these weapons materially come back to the home to be used against other civilians.\n\nIn the wake of a mass shooting, I think another Democratic politician tweeted (then deleted) something like, \"If you want to use an assault rifle to shoot people, you should deploy to Afghanistan.\" This was a remarkably accurate statement of the logic that many people wouldn't reveal so baldly. I'm not praising it, but I'm saying it's clarifying.\n\nFor example, I believe it was Parkland, where the shooter used a Smith & Wesson M&P 15. The \"M&P\" stands for military and police, and it's a semiautomatic civilian version of AR-15 carbine that mimics the one that the military and police use. That's the one the shooter wanted to use, and it's one, by the way, that you can play in various video games. I'm not blaming video games, because violence is not monocausal, but it's thinkable, and it's a thing you could turn to.\n\nYou may recall that one Parkland victim saved other students from being shot by holding a door open to allow them to flee. There are all these media reports about how this young man was ROTC, and he embodied the selfless sacrifice of the US military, this sort of patriotic logic. I'm not belittling him at all - I can't belittle that boy's death. But it was also the case that the shooter himself joined ROTC and may even have been kicked out.\n\nSo this is a case where we want to have things two ways: we want to believe that militarization is good and carrying guns elsewhere is good, but when that violence happens here, that's an entirely unrelated and bad thing. And I think that's splitting, that's schizoid. That's not a coherent way to think about the world. But people seem to want to have their cake and eat it too.\n\nAnd the Right, then, is reconciling that contradiction by bringing the war home.\n\nYeah. And the Right is freer in some ways because it fully embraced the postmodern slippage of the signifier. It can say whatever the fuck it wants, and it doesn't have to be coherent; it just has to be half a thought and tap into a certain sadness or desperation, for which they serve up scapegoats. You can see the more constrained mentality of the Democrats when they respond to situations like Uvalde, in which ordinary people of all political persuasions were shocked by a scene of police beating and tasing parents as their children were being murdered. The Joe Biden administration immediately issued a knee-jerk, hagiographic statement about how much it appreciates the sacrifice and service of America's law enforcement.\n\nWe may never know what really happened with the police in Uvalde. Perhaps we should have some faith in the Department of Justice investigation, but we also need to be realistic. The way in which the Uvalde police covered up their failures was standard practice - a kettle logic of misdirection, lies, and saying weird things like \"earlier reports were incorrect.\" Of course, the police were the source of those earlier reports. It's all about disavowal and not taking responsibility. What falls out there is that people seem to be unwilling to ask important questions. I have yet to see people ask the police, \"Can they confirm that they did not fire into the room where there were children? Can they confirm that they did not shoot any teachers or any children? Can they confirm that they did not choose to isolate the shooter in that room no matter who may have been in there alive or bleeding out?\"\n\nThose are legitimate questions, all the more legitimate given the police's inability to answer anything honestly. All those questions should be thinkable, even though they're horrible. But instead, it appears that there is an attachment to some type of fantasy image of the \"good guy with a gun\" and the police. In fact, for a lot of liberals, the police exemplify the figure of the \"good guy with a gun.\" I think about that completely disgusting David Axelrod line from two or three days ago, which was like, \"The inexplicable, heart-wrenching display in Uvalde underscores the indispensable role of the police.\" This is political theology, lobotomized; it is perverse beyond perversion.\n\nI do want to talk about video games and whether we should indeed blame them a little. Maybe blame is not the right frame, but there seems to be a point of intersection between video games, particularly Call of Duty , arms manufacturers, and the military. In Call of Duty , characters are troops firing real-life branded guns, and then gun manufacturers use Call of Duty and military imagery in their advertising. I read in the Atlantic :\n\nFans of the most popular first person shooter games - Fortnite , Apex Legends , Call of Duty , PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds - have created dozens of \"guns in real life\" videos, dedicated to explaining all the similarities between real guns and their virtual counterparts: their weight, their rate of fire, the physical stamina needed to carry and fire them in real life, and their efficacy in each corresponding game. Brownells, a real-world gun and gun-accessory manufacturer, has done the same.\n\nIndeed, until these companies were freed from copyright restrictions by a 2011 Supreme Court ruling, video game companies actually signed licensing agreements with firearms companies. Of course, there's a long history of people I hold in serious disrepute blaming video games for violence. But is there something going on here?\n\nSo this is the point at which we need to talk about overdetermination: this idea that events can have multiple causes, reflect multiple precipitating realities, and produce multiple results, but in ways that are not monocausal or not predictive.\n\nPeople who are attempting to attribute violence to entertainment products are also very quick to then argue for profiling mechanisms, by which we can determine that so-and-so did this in much the same way as, in the 1990s, people thought that kids who wear clothing featuring Tupac are more likely to be violent. In other words, it's a false dream of prediction. Whether crude or algorithmic, it's nonsense, because violence is multifactorial and if entertainment products did generate violence in their own right, we'd have a lot more of it. Many of these arguments are also in bad faith: the NRA will blame liberal Hollywood for fetishizing guns, but if you go to the NRA museum in Virginia, they have an entire hall of guns featured in famous movies. Again, it's wanting to have things both ways at once, which is a ubiquitous problem under capitalism, but Americans are really gonzo about it.\n\nI'll also admit that I play a ton of violent video games. In fact, I have very good friends, like veterans who are leftist anarcho-socialists, who I play games with. And I think it's worth saying, too, that that's the way a lot of people work through trauma, and it's a way that people build communities. However, in the video game industry, it's not just the parts with guns that are subsidized by the US military: a lot of video game physics architecture comes from labs in California, which are university-based but are taking money from the military to work on physics engines. So let's just stipulate that the military is all over this digital stuff.\n\nThe thing that is hardest to talk about has to do with the interface between the imaginary and the real: between the domains of libidinal economy and the imagination of what makes a person a hero, what makes a person agential, and what are they materially able to do. Take the recent manifesto of the Buffalo shooter, for example. He has pages and pages of object-fetishism about his gun loadout. It's what you'd see on a forum post, but also what you'd see in a Tom Clancy novel - all this talk about which kind of scope he has, whatever.\n\nConspiratorial or not, I think it's worth thinking about the fact that we don't have a mandatory draft, and we don't have a widespread civilian military training program, but we do have a lively virtual world for training people to handle small arms. There are certain limits, of course - like in Call of Duty you can pick up ammunition, and it works universally in different weapons, which is not real. But even though that's cartoonish, there are people of certain persuasions who will see these games as murder simulators. However, overinvestment in these games is not the primary red flag that we need to focus on, insofar as red flags that are much more probative of violence get ignored all the time.\n\nLike the fact that these games are being played in places without actual embodied neighborhood communities, such that when people log off of Call of Duty , they move on to 4chan.\n\nYes, that alienation is real. But also, physical and emotional abuse of women is a much bigger predictor of this type of violence. Abuse is almost ubiquitous among young men who go on to be mass shooters, and there's very little accountability for it. The young man who was the shooter at Uvalde apparently had a long history of threatening to rape young girls - and nothing was done about it - which seems to me more dispositive and more of an urgent problem.\n\nI'll give another example: Adam Lanza. He was drawing guns in school, and he loved to play violent video games and design Doom levels. But literally, according to an FBI document dump, a friend of his mother told the police, years before the shooting, that Adam Lanza has access to an assault rifle and is going to use it to attack Sandy Hook Elementary School. The police did nothing because the guns belonged to his mother, whom he killed. So what I'm saying is that, sure, guns in games are part of the imaginative surround - but there's actual physical harm that is so much more obvious and ignored.\n\nWhat do you make of mass shootings having taken on a meme-like quality? It seems like shooters are following a script - a script that gets rewritten over time, but a script that was first written at Columbine.\n\nHere's one way to think about it, which I was talking about with a student and a veteran friend as well. It was striking how, in the early era of the \"war on terror,\" you would come across these explanations for suicide bombing as a pathological act of nihilism. Oftentimes, it would be explained in terms of these half-baked reading of Hadith, claiming that, under Islam, there's the world of peace, or the Ummah, and then there's the world of war. These two worlds are forever in opposition to one another, and the Gazi is the holy warrior who crosses that boundary and wages war. Arabists and scholars of Islam would say, first of all, that's bullshit - but second of all, it is a pretty canny projection of fascist \"war on terror\" ideology and the thin blue line stuff.\n\nOn the topic of suicide bombings and specifically nihilist activity, there was the statement that these are people who have no purpose other than to sow chaos. They have no purpose other than to destroy themselves. It was claimed that suicide bombing was an act driven only by hate, and hate, as a concept, can liquefy all sorts of complex political or material forces. However, from research about the ethnography of suicide bombers and their psychological profiles, one learns that actually they hold plentiful social motivations. Now I'm not endorsing any of this activity, but there is a social safety net for families of bombers, and even a lot of social pressure to become a bomber, particularly in the case of Palestine, where suicide bombing can be a way of expiating family guilt or perceived family stigma. For example, let's say you have an uncle who has been accused of collaborating with the Israel Defense Forces, or you're an unmarriageable young man or a widow - this provides a social logic for what is often seen as just an act of horrific violence and political desperation. There are material and ideological factors that appear to sanction suicide bombing and make it thinkable and make it a thing. You get to pose for the martyrdom photographs and so on.\n\nOne thing I have noticed about mass shooters, whether they be of the white supremacist bent or the incel bent, is that the communities they seek to impress do meme and worship the shooters but are also incredibly contemptuous assholes about them. Within minutes after Uvalde, on 4chan and Discord chats, people who had egged him on or knew of his plans were calling him a loser. Or in the case of Buffalo, people were like, \"Why didn't he attack an abortion clinic instead?\" In other words, there's a pervasive type of negativity that feels profoundly nihilistic, because it provides no social insurance mechanism. The act of committing a mass shooting appears to have a kind of solitude or solipsism to it: not only is there no afterlife, but even the people who you might think would celebrate you or benefit from your act are pissing on your grave. And that, to me, is inexplicable and also indexes certain types of alienation that are really disturbing.\n\nIt's hard to neatly classify or distinguish these mass shooting events. Both the Buffalo and the Uvalde massacres fit into the gun problem category. While massacres like the one in Buffalo fall into the political category of far-right racism, the Uvalde one does not, because the shooter did not have a properly political motivation. But does that distinction hold up if both are linked to the same sick currents running through American society right now? Are they not all fundamentally political? Beyond the ideas in a particular shooter's head, the whole logic of these shootings tends to have a reactionary and antisocial direction, particularly when their targets are schools, one of the more democratic institutions in American society.\n\nI think we can productively think about this in two ways at once. On the one hand, there are obviously mass murderers who describe themselves as part of a political program: the Buffalo shooter self-identified as a white supremacist and wore Aryan symbolism.\n\nThe model is the far-right guy in New Zealand, who himself was modeled off of Anders Breivik.\n\nYeah, exactly - inspired by the great replacement, neo-crusader, imagined community stuff. And yes, they clearly state their motivation. However, this ideology is political in the sense that it describes itself as political, but also it's an eighteen-year-old pissant kid's manifesto, talking about demographics and physiognomy and a whole bunch of memes, written at the level of a shitty freshman paper that would get an F. Half of their writing is plagiarized. It's political in the sense that it has certain political tropes, but it's not a manifesto in the way that the Communist Manifesto or something by Friedrich Schiller is. It's not a manifesto in that sense of it having any literary or political depth. I've read so many of these things, and they're all the same regurgitated, tired, pastiche shit.\n\nBut we should also stipulate that it's hard to imagine anything more political than going into a public space and killing people of a particular type: that's obviously political. It's part of a broader political gestalt that includes more polite people with blood on their hands at a remove, advocating political programs that are normalized in American society. Here, I think about the El Paso shooting and how in 2019, just a couple of months before it, none other than David Frum had an Atlantic cover article with the question of how much immigration is too much. And the heading was, \"If liberals don't enforce borders, fascists will.\" Not to draw a monocausal line from this sort of thought to that asshole who shot up the Walmart in El Paso, but the shooter's ideas were fetid reflections of stuff that was happening in more mainstream spaces.\n\nMore broadly, though, whether or not these shootings are abstractly political, judged by us observers on the outside, they have concrete political impacts. In El Paso, Latino people who were wounded quite possibly didn't seek medical care; in Buffalo, black people might now be scared to go to the store in the middle of a food desert. They felt the raw political statement of ethnic eliminationism. This also gets at your question of the politics of nihilism: if murdering another human being isn't a fundamentally politically salient act, I have no idea what else could be. It's tied to the precipitating structures of political economy, libidinal economy, or what we could call necropolitics, that perpetuate and underwrite all these shootings.\n\nYoung men or men in crisis picking up weapons and seeking to vindicate their grievances by doing murder in public strikes at the socius and erodes confidence in public space, but it is also an expression of an entitlement to dispose of other human beings as objects and to express power and satisfy grievances through violence that is also present in a whole suite of other behaviors, above all in femicide, domestic abuse, and sexual abuse. In the broader structure of what theorists might call kyriarchy, it is a whole system of domination.\n\nSo we can think about these high profile shootings as expressing in a public and statistically exceptional way a broader calculus of hierarchical human disposability that is baked into our political system and normalized. This logic is not always treated as newsworthy, but it is at work every day.\n\nWhat many people think of as military-style weapons became mainstream like never before after the 2004 expiration of the assault weapons ban. So this liberal gun ban made these guns all the more alluring. And then similarly, there's this pattern of gun purchases surging after mass shootings, and that's ostensibly about gun enthusiasts panicking that any given mass shooting might be followed by some sort of restriction on guns, which never happens.\n\nBut I feel like this trend might reflect something deeper. There's this identity of \"gun owner\" that has emerged in recent decades and is complicated because, as we've discussed, Americans have been armed and dangerous from the get-go, from even before they were Americans. And yet gun owners have really undergone a dramatic process of radicalization against any form of gun regulation whatsoever, combined with a process of radicalization in terms of what kind of firearms they want to shoot and own. The overall worldview entailed by being a gun owner has become more extreme, and this process of identity formation has resulted in gun owners becoming a class in itself. What is this identity? How did it come about, and what is its role today on the American right?\n\nIf people self-identify as \"gun owners,\" then you know, statistically speaking, they're going to be voting on the right. They're going to be conservative; they're going to be registered Republicans or independents who lean right. And they're more likely than not to be white and male. There is data on this. Recent decades, the past two in particular, have seen this trajectory, such that ownership of guns or, more specifically, the willingness to identify as a gun owner is leading predictor of rightward orientation. I do think that \"gun owner\" is one of the few identities that you can buy. Purchasing something makes you something. \"Jet ski owners\" or \"sex swing owners\" are not legible, immediately given identity categories where you say things like, \"As an X owner, I. . . .\"\n\nYou could perhaps identify as a classic car enthusiast, but in a way the term \"gun owner\" suggests \"gun enthusiast.\"\n\nYeah, it definitely suggests some sort of a response or a relation to it. Early in our conversation we talked about Blue Lives Matter-type ideology, and I think that's a similar type of formation. Police officer or first responder is a job that you choose to have, which enjoys protected status in some states; the same is true for gun owners, since guns are something you choose to buy that then stand in for a whole assemblage of other politics.\n\nIn other words, people self-identify as gun owners as a means of identifying themselves with right-wing social and political America and as adjacent to or in alliance with the armed forces of the state.\n\nIf there is a monolithic bloc of gun owners, one whose ideology we want to make sense of in that phrase and from a left perspective, we can see that identity as an entire politics: a politics of the gun. And this politics of the gun is paradoxical, in the same way the thin blue line is paradoxical, where it's both the limit case but also the thing that makes possible the whole system. In a lot of accounts, the gun is something you need when the state fails - when there's a burglar coming through your window, when the police are always twenty minutes too late - but the gun is also something that the state has to protect. A whole series of contradictions reside in this, and they all come down to building a politics around the limit case of the failure of politics or around the politics of a basic act of exclusion and violence.\n\nAt the same time, of course, the martial culture of paramilitary politics is not just the domain of a white supremacist right wing, although I think that is the majority of that culture at the moment. Paramilitary politics have also been taken up by many in the black freedom struggle, from the American Civil War and Reconstruction to various efforts at self-defense to organized political militias at the height of the Black Power movement. And small arms violence has both been used to repress rural labor struggles and to defend them. What should we think about gun culture on the Left? It has a rich history, but there are no doubt costs to adopting a martial political stance, even in self-defense.\n\nHistorically speaking, mounting insurgent violence against a hegemonic order comes with risks and can end in revolutionary suicide or being killed. People are very honest about that, and I think it's worth bearing in mind. And I think it's also worth saying, too, that armed resistance groups are a consistent target of state subversion. One of the ways that J. Edgar Hoover's FBI went after the Panthers was by going after militant groups for arms sales, for getting unlicensed weapons, for having weapons that they shouldn't have had. Particularly if you're an insurgent group trying to acquire weapons of a legally restricted category without records of those weapons being bought, you come into contact with a criminal underworld and a potential world of informants: people who are working for the police or who are police themselves. There's also the actuarial risk of the fact that in any place with tons of guns, gun death becomes a nonzero possibility. This is as simple as saying that you're not going to die in a car accident unless there's a car around; the gun being there is something that can potentiate events.\n\nThere's a reason that the gun on the mantelpiece is a textbook example of foreshadowing in a play.\n\nYeah, it's a Chekhov's gun principle. By my lights, whatever those are worth, one thing that's striking about the history of left-wing and insurrectionary separatist movements is that, on the one hand, a lot of them do end terribly. A lot of them are also targeted by the state. But it's worth saying that at the point where the gun becomes the primary object around which your politics are built, you're not only courting baptism by fire - living by the gun, dying by the gun - but also neglecting other aspects of what makes any insurgent revolutionary left-wing program worth contemplating, namely an ethos of community care and uplift and other ways of relating that are not just about guns, that are not just about the limit case of being attacked by the state. I'm thinking about food programs - plowshares, if we want to be Biblical about it.\n\nI've encountered leftists who seem to think that going into the woods with a bunch of people and shooting guns is the entirety of the ministry. I take that as tragic in some ways, because it risks mirroring the hegemonic logic of politics as just you and the gun making things happen. There's a reason a lot of those movements fall apart because of femicide or suicide or infiltration. You need a community to defend in addition to organizing around a purely reactive notion of defense.\n\nThese are risks that need to be taken all the more seriously if there is no practical path for armed revolution succeeding in the United States, which I would contend is obvious.\n\nIt is obvious, but there's also the tragedy in which a holistic alternative to the state is not as at hand as breaking things, killing things, or buying a gun. Here I think about people who may not be very political or who don't identify as gun owners but who have to deal with abusive partners of whom they're terrified; maybe one of them is a cop, and they can't count on the state to protect them. And they know the risks, but they're going to buy a gun anyway because that's their choice.\n\nPeople also buy guns because they're afraid of their neighbors and where they live. On some level, those gestures bespeak a desperation and a lack of other options, combined with an ease of access to guns and a facilitation of violent options as being imaginable. A cohesive mutual aid system is a lot less sexy and a lot less at hand. It's a lot less commodifiable and like easily put on Instagram profiles or badass posters than just toting some gun.\n\nOne way to reframe this is that negativity is much easier to both imagine and enact than doing something constructive or positive - which isn't to say that those two things are necessarily opposed. I mentioned the example of lunch programs in particular because that's a legacy of the Panthers, one that existed alongside their other advocacy. But it's worth noting that a lot of them got shot to death and not just by the police.\n\nBut the negative vibes are indeed really powerful ones right now. A lot of people are invoking this notion that the United States is attempting to commit suicide: in more straightforwardly Freudian terms, America has a strong death drive, all amid its commitment to doing next to nothing to forestall climate catastrophe or the pandemic. I feel like these recent shootings have just punctuated a long-standing sense, particularly strong since the beginning of the pandemic, that this country is dedicated to self-destruction.\n\nYou've written a lot about this. What did Sigmund Freud mean by the death drive? How might that concept help us understand this country's increasingly bleak social and political reality and the state's commitment to doubling down on that bleak social and political reality?\n\nThere are a lot of interpretations of what Freud meant when he talked about the death drive; it's not entirely clear what he meant, and he is very contradictory about it. Part of what makes this such a recurrent and generative concept for a lot of subsequent theories, psychoanalytic and otherwise, is that the death drive is a concept that can do a lot of work and that can mean a lot of things. Some of them are ugly and scary, and others are possibly liberatory and weird in a different way.\n\nTo historicize and define the term within the context of the Freudian output, it's a concept Freud articulates around the end of World War I. He does so in a strange little book called Beyond the Pleasure Principle , which is really two books at once. The first bit is an account of him clinically and therapeutically encountering people who are suffering from what we would today call PTSD, people who appear to be haunted by these repetitive, unbidden memories. \"Memory\" isn't quite the right word because it's a disassociated memory - memory sometimes implies a cohesion - of events that are near death, for the sufferer themselves or for those around them. These dissociated memories keep coming back.\n\nThese are people who are \"shell-shocked\" from World War I, right?\n\nYeah. And these are people who challenge Freud's theories of both pathology and of psychology more generally - of how the human mind is built - insofar as they appear to be stuck on this one episode. Their symptoms resemble what Freud had seen in people suffering from what he would have called a \"hysterical neurosis\" and what we now describe as a conversion disorder: they're having fainting spells, they're seeing things that aren't there, they're losing the ability to speak, or they're developing blindness, even without any damage to their optic nerves. But in the context of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Prussian state in 1918, you don't get like ushered to the fainting couch and accommodated; you have an officer telling you to pick up a gun and to throw a grenade if you don't want to get shot. And these people do get shot. They're not faking it, and they're not malingering. Their problem, which is psychic in nature, to the extent that it doesn't have a clearly defined organic cause, nonetheless is real enough that it causes them to be killed, or it causes them to have remarkably tragic life trajectories thereafter.\n\nWhere Freud goes from this is basically to produce a very complicated and contradictory vision of how the mind relates to overwhelming negative stimuli. He mythologizes this by starting to think about a countervailing principle to the desire to create, to build, to reproduce - what would be called a libido theory. Freud's inquiry starts in a clinical space, but it goes towards philosophical, existential, almost theological stakes; this is as close as psychoanalysis gets to what you would an \"apophasis,\" which is a language for talking about things where languages all fail. Freud argues for a complicated idea that events can befall the human person that cause it to become stuck, continually returning in this movement toward the past; this continual return of the repressed past is destructive, and also produces a destruction of the future and a kind of stasis in the present. People use this conceptual constellation to talk about things like social inertia, the appeal of suicide under certain conditions, and fetishes for violence.\n\nI think it's useful for thinking about trajectories of continually maintaining borders, conceptual or otherwise, to the point at which things within those borders are actually destroyed: the way in which projections of self or desires to exert power ultimately turn back into a destruction of the self. You can think about this in terms of an autoimmunity function. Guns are super cool prostheses for extending our power, but also they inevitably end up being used on the people who initially used them for the purposes of exerting force and projecting power.\n\nWhether we're describing something as granular as gun violence or the behavior of our entire society, I think the little organism of the death drive explains a lot. We are late-capitalist humans in the center of a gerontocratic petrocracy, driving around in cars fueled by the liquid remains of previous mass extinctions; in so doing, we are crashing into one another, dying really quickly, boiling the world, and producing the next great extinction. There is a tragic drama and a legibility to what you could call a thanatotelic trajectory: i.e., a driven-ness toward death in the way in which the nonnegotiability of our comfort and the desire to maintain a nostalgic past produces not just death in the present but increasingly commits us to a self-destruction that's also a destruction of the other.\n\nOne way to understand this - and this is one of Freud's basic definitions of the death drive - is a situation in which the organism will seek nothing more centrally than the prerogative to die on its own terms. That captures of everything from \"my cold dead hands\" rhetoric, which is both a threat and a suicide valve, to the Donald Rumsfeld- and George W. Bush-era rhetoric of \"the American way of life is not negotiable.\" We're wedded to comfort, and the idea of doing things that might disrupt that comfort is experienced as more existentially threatening than the widely understood fact that if we don't change, we're all going to die.\n\nThere's this intense focus on comfort, but it's almost comfort within quotations because we don't really enjoy it. We never get to enjoy the Club Med or the cruise ship all-you-can-drink bracelet, because we're always already hungover. We hate it, but we're committed to the misery. Can we see the death drive operating not only on the frothing far right but also among the shell-shocked \"This is not normal, follow the science\" center left? And if it does indeed pervade the broader body politic beyond the Right, why is it that the MAGA-fied Republican Party has been so talented at tapping into these sick and violent vibes coursing through the country?\n\nTo move from the latter question to the former one, the Right is Walt Whitman-esque in its ability to contain multitudes and to traverse contradiction. The way in which self-destruction and aggression toward others are fungible and interchangeable is very much present in that dialectic of negativity. At some of the Donald Trump rallies I've covered, people are miserable, and there's a guy up on the podium literally making fun of how they look and telling them that they're all toilets and stuff - but at least he makes these other people even more mad, and his audience can get off on their misery. So it's like a negative collective effervescence of \"At least we can say, 'Fuck them.'\"\n\nOne of the cruelest things about the \"comfortable\" American situation is that everyone seems to think that there's this basic truth that someone else is getting away with something. You've been denied something because of someone else, and at least you can die knowing that they were more miserable than you. I've talked to people like this, whose vision of their self-assertion, as their world constricts and health care fails them, is, \"At least I can shoot someone before they burglarize my house.\" The Right manages to tap into this pure negativity. It both can tap the libidinal landscape of that, and it has internalized the postmodern maxim of the floating signifier such that it can say anything: it's about power, and language comes afterward.\n\nThe relationship of the liberal center to this is a little more complicated because it involves a sort of self-abnegating relation to pleasure. The pleasure comes from saying, \"Well, we're not them. The cruelty is the point for them, but for us the process is the point - even though it's cruel, and even though we hate the process.\"\n\nThe center wants to will the superego back into being in American politics.\n\nYeah. In Freudian thought, the superego is this internalized conscience or authority figure: it's the dad at the head of the table, it's the teacher at the head of the class, it's the judges of history. It's some sort of reverenced authority who you identify with through your own self-abnegation. For the center, this way of thinking comes out when they say:\n\nAll these Trump-ites, they're gross clowns, look at the ways they contradict themselves, look how horribly they revel in cruelty. But us, we talk about what's realistically possible. That's why we need to make deals with these people, because we need to hold the center.\n\nA lot of this involves a logic of passivity and a type of satisfaction. Stating one's beliefs or voting is taken to stand in for an entire politics because of a sense that if we do these \"right\" things - as opposed to practicing any type of structural engagement or even seeing our opponents for what they are - then the world will get better somehow. Our purity of heart will combine with our purity of intention to make things turn out okay, as long as we're able to regulate our misguided neighbors on the Left.\n\nThink about those signs that say, \"We believe in science, Black Lives Matter, love is love,\" and so on. Yes, those signs are less offensive than the ones that read \"Trump 2024\" and \"Let's Go Brandon.\" It's a much more colorful, pretty sign. But what does it mean? At the end of the day, a lot of these liberals are still voting to maintain the character of the neighborhood and the facades that they're building; they're doing all that NIMBY shit, and they don't want high-density housing. But also, what does it mean to say that you believe in science?\n\nThese platitudes reflect a tremendous energy devoted to forgetting, a tremendous energy devoted to how great Nancy Pelosi is and how nice it would be to have decent Republicans. This is what the liberal commentariat does every couple of years, when they elevate some ghoul, whether it be Rod Dreher or Ben Shapiro, as the face of conservative intellectualism. They write, \"These are the beautiful plangent cries of Rod Dreher\" or \"J.D. Vance is such a whisperer for the forgotten voices of the heartland.\" When you read this, you're like, who is this for? Why are you doing this? But then a couple of years later, you go back, and those same liberal commentators are shocked that J.D. Vance has started basically repeating the fourteen words over and over again or Rod Dreher has recently said bigoted things about trans people or Ben Shapiro is running racist cartoons on his website. And the answer is always: motherfuckers, they were like that the whole time!\n\nWho are they elevating these people for? The center is doing it for themselves, because if there's no reasonable right, then its own centrist politics don't make any sense.\n\nThat's exactly right. It betrays the fact that ultimately it has a common vocabulary and shared material interests with these right-wing figures. But also what it's getting out of this is the satisfaction of being the gatekeeper, of being the ones who are looking over the deck chairs being arranged on the deck of the Titanic and saying, \"This is fine, this is the process, it'll sort itself out.\"\n\nFranz Kafka has a parable, a parable about parables. In it, someone comes to an old man and says, \"What's the deal with parables?\" And someone else says, \"Well, if we just become parables, then we will be rid of all our daily cares.\" Of course, you can't become a parable, but these commentators are attempting something similar: if they just continue to anoint the faces of right-wing respectability, if they're continually maintaining the machine of this nonexistent center, then they'll always be there. They will live forever in the realm of takes. They can become takes themselves.\n\nThe one cost is, of course, vulnerable people: \"We'll just have to cede ground on culture-war issues,\" they say. \"If we just give them trans kids, then they won't come for Roe .\" Well, guess what: they're going to take the trans kids, and they're going to go for Roe . But the centrists also seem to think that they are floating above these transactions of power. Cynically or not, they seem to believe that if they just hold onto the pure formalism of yore, if we just publicly deny pleasure to ourselves for the sake of this principle - even as we have no principles - then at least we'll survive this. And that's how democracies die too.\n\nWhat's the political economy of this death drive? Do people sense, even if they can't quite articulate it, that we're in this period where capitalism seemingly can't or won't make anything new and useful and that all the new frontiers of profit are in ever more abstract financial maneuvers, which have reached their apotheosis in crypto, even as we head inexorably toward climate catastrophe? Is there a material foundation for these bad vibes?\n\nFor me, a Marxist political-economic perspective is completely compatible with the psychoanalytic perspective. You can't have a libidinal economy without political economy, for the simple reason that people are attached to the circumstances of their own oppression. We can think about that old phrase of Thomas Frank's: \"What's the matter with Kansas?\" Like, what's up with this false consciousness? And the answer is that there's pleasure in false consciousness. W.E.B. Du Bois said this too: there's a pleasure in racism for racists. It's worth thinking about how libidinal satisfaction can drive people's material decisions.\n\nRegarding completely fictitious financial products, I recently saw that they're putting Bitcoin mining facilities directly on top of oil wells. They're just burning the fuel as it comes out of the ground. It's absurd; I do think it reflects a feature of capitalism in its contemporary form but also in its earlier mercantilist and transatlantic intonations. It's both that death is incredibly monetizable and life is so cheap, and that the capitalist imaginary, with its constant desire to expand, encourages people not to think about their own deaths. Capital, like Cthulhu, lives forever. And it's deathless in the way that only the undead can be.\n\nThink about what passes for the fantasies or the life projects of some of our supposedly greatest innovators and most successful people - think about Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk types. Their fantasies are primal-father stuff: I'm going to go to space with my winnings, I'm going to live forever, I'm going to freeze my brain. We're going to have unlimited pleasure beyond the vale of tears, which at the end of the day is just primitive accumulation, primal-father shit. What kind of system generates so much riches while leaving even its most successful people so morally, intellectually, and imaginatively impoverished? People are always so shocked when the person who has everything and has all the power in the world also turns out to be a serial sexual harasser or whatever. It's like, wow, you can't sublimate shit: you're at the top of the pyramid, and there's no transformation of the human, no heightened degree of relationality. There's no depth or empathy that might come from being aware that you are a finite being who's going to die. Instead, it's immortality projects and a ton of rape.\n\nAnd it's crazy, right? I don't mean crazy in a stigmatizing way. I mean, it's madness. And it's madness as an output of a particular type of reason; it's a madness of economic reason, but it's also the madness of primitive accumulation in this neo-techno-feudal mode. It's heartbreaking. I don't know how to deal with it, though Freud does have some parables about how the primal father gets dealt with. But there is a way in which this madness is so clearly terminal and its products are so derivative. We ask: What are these people making? And the answer is, well, they're making either notional abstractions or things that will allow you to Hyperloop away from other people with the car on autopilot, protecting a type of monadized false self-idea. Their whole job is to launder ever increasing misery into abstraction and into baubles of cheap pleasure, to mystify widespread precarity into something that is good.\n\nAnd I feel like this is also a dark mirror of what we were talking about with the \"lanyard class\" earlier. It promotes the idea that our democracy is good because you have more choices than ever, albeit for things that you can't afford; you have to affirm those choices, even though the people you're voting for don't give a shit if you live or die. And also, capitalism is great because you could buy even more things that are built for planned obsolescence than ever; flat-screen TVs are cheaper than ever.\n\nAnd so, is this the political-economic architecture of the American death drive?\n\nI think so. I'm with Freud and his hatred of America as a quintessence of a type of capitalism: this odd combination of righteousness with sleaziness; this mix of religious pieties and the worship of money; this perverse fixation on a family romance of Manifest Destiny, combined with a complete indifference to anything of long-term social value. But we can also think about the death drive in a liberatory way, as Jacque Lacan and others do.\n\nIn my work on gunpower, I'm trying to read the United States as a giant machine for producing guns and bodies. Considering the death drive in political, economic, and libidinal terms allows us to see this waste as production: the destruction of people and the creation of all this garbage are actually outputs of energy that serve some sort of purpose. If you look at the situation this way, you get a sense that all this stuff is radically contingent. The tradition of past generations may weigh on us, but right now there is a whole lot of cultural production that's being squandered, that's being wasted in repetition, that's being all deployed toward the naturalization of its own contingency as inevitable, even if that kills us all. Even if you don't adopt these theories beyond their ability to reveal this contingency, appreciating it might open up new possibilities. Maybe you can ask for more, or maybe you can envision things being otherwise. The very desperation and impoverishment of what passes for our political imaginary and libidinal economy may point to the fact that things could go differently. It's like when policymakers brag about how \"the foundations of our economy are strong,\" and that's really a signal that the economy is built on nothing.\n\nThe liberatory vision of the death drive is one in which it enables a total severing from what came previously and a rejection of all this falsely naturalized stuff. There is no reason why people who have more money than God should exist, or why they should be viewed as apexes of human perfection. There is no reason why having an economy should require the sacrifice of vast categories of workers. There is no reason why owning a gun should be seen as granting you security, when in the end you might get owned by the gun itself. There's no reason for any of that shit. Thinking about the diminishing returns of pleasure, but also the sheer desperation of the system, can open up new possibilities.\n\nLow-carbon leisure could make us so much happier, but we're committed to the consumption of certain manufactured petroleum products that we buy and quickly throw away.\n\nA broadly Freudian vision of civilization might be helpful here. Freud suggests that we need some amount of rules and hierarchy: for example, we tell kids not to torture animals or to randomly drop their pants in public. Because we're not Cartesian cogitos, because we're all differently abled and only abled temporarily at best, and because we're dependent upon one another and these things called families, we need some structuring principles to protect people; we need to encourage certain types of behavior and discourage other types of behavior. I think there's a place for that.\n\nBut the corollary is that a lot of what is normalized as behavior - naturalized relations to yourself, to your own body, to the bodies of others, to the idea of difference - comes back in this suppurative way, as what other theorists might call a \"surplus repression.\" I'll go back to that example that Freud gives of the regulation of infantile sexuality. You might tell your kid not to expose themselves in public, and that may be necessary because you don't want your kid growing up to be Louis C.K. But a suppurated element grows off of this basic prohibition, in which we then have to talk about whether our teachers are groomers and we have to protect our kids from shadowy predators.\n\nIn other words, the constitutive bonds of civilization have trade-offs, where we take a necessary bit of repression too far and end up with new conditions of suffering. Much like every artifact of civilization is also a sign of transformed barbarism, certain types of repression always give rise to this awful surplus. To give another example, we have the amazing technological developments of soap and hygiene. But we also eventually have, as one negative symptom of this norm, people who wash their hands until they bleed; as another, we have people who reject basic hygiene measures, like masks. One has to wonder whether we can normalize our relationship to hygiene, or to contagion, in ways that both ensure the public good and individual flowering but don't produce these morbid symptoms that are so horrible and cruel and demented.\n\nIn rare cases, such as Parkland, waves of activism have emerged after shootings. What sort of advice would you like your work to impart to young activists concerned with reducing gun violence? What sort of horizon do you think they should be fighting for?\n\nI would ask them to resist the received terms in which we deal with these issues. It seems like the problem of social violence has to be segmented into gun violence and gun control, which means cops. Discussions of happiness and well-being seem to always become conversations only about mental illness and stigmatization. A lot of these pitfalls are discursive, and they're not real in the world, in the sense of being eternal, essential things.\n\nWe talked earlier about how the phrase \"gun control\" isn't in the Constitution, and it doesn't really matter until the '50s or '60s. Second Amendment scholarship also does not really show up until the '50s or '60s. And yet now millions of Americans understand themselves in relation to these concepts and terms. On the one hand, that's depressing and sad. But on the other hand, that points to a Gramscian hegemony of common sense, which can change. Certain terms become - through political activism, through being rejected, through being interrogated, through being tested against emergent and changing political realities - no longer the terms by which people describe situations, by which people intervene in situations, and by which people understand themselves.\n\nAnd so, if I would ask anything, it's just to not get exhausted by the terms that you're given or to see them as the only way of looking at things. Develop multiple vocabularies for talking about the same problems. You don't lose anything by being ambivalent, by being able to think two ways about the same concept or the same term, by using multiple terms for the same concept, or even by thinking that maybe a concept is actually multiple concepts. It's worth resisting the immediate need for action in favor of doing a little bit of reflection and considering that maybe you could produce your own vocabulary; you can take what you need and leave what you don't, continually revising, leaning into the ambivalence of creation.\n\nThat sort of reflection seems to me to be the sine qua non for any type of organizing or thinking. And I think there are people leaning into that one way or another, whether it be abolitionists or people who are thinking about gender in new ways. But that refusal to accept received terms simply because they're received - and the willingness to create new ones and to test them - seems absolutely essential for conceiving and making a new future.\n\nPatrick Blanchfield is a freelance writer and associate faculty at the Brooklyn Institute for Social Research.

It's lunacy that these guns are on the streets - and that you can buy them at only 18.\n\nFormer president Donald Trump takes cover after an assassination attempt during his rally on July 13, 2024 in Butler, Pennsylvania.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIn the months before Saturday's assassination attempt on former president Donald Trump in Pennsylvania, the state's legislature blocked a bill banning the sale of the type of assault rifle allegedly used in the attack.\n\nPrior to that, at the federal level, nearly all of Pennsylvania's Republican congressional delegation voted against a bill to reinstate a nationwide assault weapons ban, and the US Senate GOP blocked the legislation.\n\nIn January, a Democratic-controlled Pennsylvania House committee passed a bill banning the sale of assault weapons - against the unanimous opposition of Republicans on the panel. That legislation, however, was then tabled in the Pennsylvania assembly, facing stiff opposition from the state's Republican lawmakers and the National Rifle Association (NRA).\n\nOn Saturday, Trump was wounded in the ear in a shooting at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The suspected shooter, killed by Secret Service snipers, was identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks, twenty, from nearby Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, and an AR-15-type semiautomatic assault rifle was recovered at the scene. The gun was reportedly purchased by and registered to the shooter's father .\n\nWhen Republican state lawmakers in Pennsylvania opposed the assault weapons ban legislation earlier this year, they cited constitutional concerns as one of their reasons.\n\nYet even as the GOP made that legal argument, the Trump-packed US Supreme Court - the final arbiter on constitutional interpretation - was simultaneously allowing a similar ban to continue in a neighboring state.\n\n\"If we had banned assault weapons, this might have ended differently,\" said a Pennsylvania lawmaker who asked for anonymity, citing safety concerns. \"Whether or not you support Donald Trump is irrelevant in this conversation.\"\n\nIn Pennsylvania, the minimum age for purchasing a rifle like the AR-15 that was apparently used in the attempted assassination of Trump is eighteen years old . The age requirement for purchasing a handgun is twenty-one.\n\nAfter Democrats won control of Pennsylvania's state assembly in 2023, they advanced an ambitious package of gun control legislation, including the proposed ban on future sales of assault weapons like the gun reportedly used in the assassination attempt. This legislation mirrored the 1994 federal assault weapons ban and would have prohibited semiautomatic and automatic guns with specific features like military-style grips and those capable of accepting large-capacity magazines. This legislation expired a decade later in 2004 .\n\nWhen the bill passed the House committee, the National Rifle Association (NRA) blasted it, declaring that \"this bill would represent the most widespread gun ban in state history and almost certainly trigger its own legal challenge.\"\n\nWeeks later, the bill was tabled.\n\n\"Inside the capital there is zero political will to do anything on guns,\" said the Pennsylvania lawmaker.\n\nA 2016 study from University of Massachusetts researcher Louis Klarevas found that gun massacres fell 37 percent when the 1994 federal assault weapons ban was active and rose 183 percent after it expired in 2004.\n\nThe AR-15 is a common weapon of choice for mass shooters in the United States: the 2016 anti-LGBT Pulse nightclub shooting , the 2017 shooting on the Las Vegas Strip , and the mass shooting at the 2017 Sutherland Springs church massacre all involved this semiautomatic rifle.\n\nYet along with blocking the assembly bill that would ban assault weapons, the Pennsylvania legislature shot down two other gun safety bills by a razor-thin margin that would have banned future sales of accelerated trigger activators, which increase the rate of fire, and streamlined the process of filing records of gun sales with the Pennsylvania State Police.\n\n\"There are all of these people on all sides of the aisle that say they care about this stuff that's gun related, and nobody does anything,\" said the Pennsylvania lawmaker who requested anonymity. \"It's become a political talking point that's leveraged to gain momentum and then nothing happens.\"\n\nOutside of Pennsylvania, other states have successfully passed bans on assault weapons like automatic rifles. However, they have faced legal challenges while trying to maintain such laws. In Maryland, for example, a 2013 law limiting possession of weapons like machine guns enacted after the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Connecticut survived a legal threat after the US Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the law from gun rights activists.\n\nBefore his first presidential run, Trump wrote: \"I support the ban on assault weapons and I also support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun.\"\n\nHowever, as president, he and his party did not push to reinstate the nationwide ban on civilian use of certain semiautomatic weapons. Additionally, when an assault weapons ban passed the Democratic-controlled US House in 2022, eight of Pennsylvania's Republican representatives voted against it , and the Senate GOP refused to allow it to come to a vote.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump assured the NRA that \"no one will lay a finger on your firearms\" if he is elected president in 2024.\n\nIn 2018, Trump urged lawmakers to pass gun control reforms, including raising the age to buy rifles to twenty-one, referencing the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.\n\n\"People aren't bringing it up because they're afraid to bring it up,\" Trump told lawmakers  \"You can't buy a handgun at eighteen, nineteen, or twenty. You have to wait until you're twenty-one. You could buy the weapon used in this horrible shooting at eighteen.\"\n\nAccording to the New York Times , the statements \"prompted a frantic series of calls from [National Rifle Association] lobbyists to their allies on Capitol Hill.\"\n\nThe following month Trump changed his tune.\n\n\"On 18 to 21 Age Limits, watching court cases and rulings before acting. States are making this decision. Things are moving rapidly on this, but not much political support (to put it mildly),\" Trump wrote on Twitter , now X, that March.\n\nThat same year, the National Rifle Association directly appealed to Trump to not raise the firearm age limit . Two years prior, in 2016, when Trump was elected, the NRA's spending surged by more than $100 million , according to an audit filed with the state of North Carolina. This brought the association's spending to more than $419 million, compared to $261 million in the 2012 election and $204 million in 2008.\n\nIn 2022, Trump-appointed judges struck down restrictions to limit firearm sales to young adults .\n\n\"America would not exist without the heroism of the young adults who fought and died in our revolutionary army,\" wrote Trump-appointed judge Ryan Nelson, alongside another Trump appointee , Judge Kenneth Lee, in a decision by the Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals. \"Today we reaffirm that our Constitution still protects the right that enabled their sacrifice: the right of young adults to keep and bear arms.\"\n\nFurthermore, Trump's three Supreme Court appointees have continued to shift the high court to the right on firearm issues after he left office. In 2022, the Court vastly expanded gun rights after a series of mass shootings that year, including ruling that Americans have a right to carry firearms in public for self-defense, invalidating many states' tighter gun restrictions.\n\nJust last month, the Supreme Court struck down a Trump-era ban on rapid-fire bump stocks, allowing semiautomatic guns to fire even more rapidly, even as they upheld a Maryland law banning assault weapons like AR-15s.\n\nLast year, a federal judge in Virginia ruled that a law banning dealers from selling handguns to adults under twenty-one violates the Second Amendment.\n\nAnd in Pennsylvania, where Saturday's assassination attempt took place, a circuit court earlier this year lowered the age to carry a firearm in public in certain circumstances from twenty-one to eighteen, relying on the Supreme Court's previous 2022 decision on this issue. The ruling relaxed open-carry laws around the country.\n\nConsequently, any future effort to raise the minimum age for firearm purchase - even by Trump - could run up against significant legal barriers.\n\nThese legal decisions are happening amid an increased risk of violence during the 2024 election, according to a report by the Department of Homeland Security . The report noted Americans \"motivated by conspiracy theories and anti-government or partisan grievances\" could try to disrupt the election, which may include violence or threats aimed at voters, election workers, and government officials.\n\nYou can subscribe to David Sirota's investigative journalism project, the Lever , here .\n\nHelen Santoro is a journalist based in Colorado.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

To stop the epidemic, we need a truly democratic transformation of our country's political institutions.\n\nSigns and flowers by the fence surrounding Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, after the shooting in 2018.\n(Giles Clarke / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nAt the gleaming new Fruitport High School in Michigan, the entrance opens to a spacious atrium, with floating rows of lockers arrayed diagonally from the front door. They are noticeably short so students can peer over them. Overlooking the atrium is a walkway fenced with metal sheets and pockmarked with slits through which you can survey the space below if you were to crouch. Hallways bear \"wing walls . . . to provide barriers for school children to hide behind.\" Classrooms, meanwhile, each have a single window at the door and are designed so that exactly thirty-two students plus a teacher can be concealed from view if they huddle in the corner.\n\nThis is school design for the depressing reality of twenty-first-century America, where gun violence has become the leading cause of death for youths, and the number of mass shootings continues to soar - to more than one a day in 2023 so far. Among the most horrifying massacres are those at schools.\n\nReasonable societies would respond to these trends by curtailing access to guns and making it harder to carry them in public. We have decided instead to make it easier to access and carry guns - and use them - in public and to transform our schools into fortresses, traumatizing an entire generation in the process.\n\nGun rights advocates recommend \"hardening\" our schools: denying them windows, limiting the number of entrances, cutting down all trees, and erecting large fences. For those who deem these measures too jarring or bleak, Fruitport High is intended to soften or smooth over the defensive features. Hallways are gracefully curved; this is to \"cut off a shooter's line of sight.\" There will be large windows all around the building, especially across the atrium - so you can see the shooter approach - which will be covered in bulletproof film. The entrance features an \"educational entry panopticon\" and a \"sally port,\" common in prisons, which is essentially two sets of doors that can lock someone within. It's no surprise the school borrows features from prisons; the latter are the specialty of TowerPinkster, the firm hired to design Fruitport High School.\n\nDefense-industry firms are pivoting to address the scourge of shootings. A manufacturer of \"bomb resistant vehicle armor\" now makes bulletproof doors for schools and boasts that it incorporates \"the experience we gleaned from protecting the war fighter.\" Military consultants have helped draw up plans for how school communities should act in the event of a shooting. Teachers have been outfitted with sharpies \"to write the time they applied a tourniquet to a bleeding student,\" and trained to use litter buckets for makeshift toilets in the case of a lockdown.\n\nIn training exercises, students are instructed to crouch along the wall in perfect silence, with lights turned off and shades drawn, as someone walks the hall jostling door handles. In one case, an unannounced exercise was taken for the real thing, prompting students to call family members to say goodbye.\n\nCritics say these trainings do more harm than good, terrifying youths for incidents that are still rare. It's all performative and hardly effective. The training and protective features make it seem like schools are being proactive, which is all we are allowed to do while gun control is blocked. And most school shootings are perpetrated by members of the community, who likely know the protective measures and how to circumvent them.\n\n\"Violence has a long reach,\" sociologist Patrick Sharkey says . Its impact is felt far beyond those who bear its brunt; its effects are seen in how we change our behavior, adapt, cower, and design our world accordingly, where its damage is reinforced and repeated.\n\nIn schoolchildren, researchers note a \"constant back-of-the-mind stress,\" which peaks with training drills that increase anxiety and depression. The terror is amplified by \"media exposure to mass violence\" - a special concern for teens glued to their cell phones - which fuels a \"cycle of distress where persistent worry about future violence predicts more media consumption and more stress.\" Researchers observe a higher incidence of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder in people whose social networks have been impacted by gun violence, and they are worried by studies that report the same for people exposed to repeated media coverage of traumatic events like mass shootings.\n\nThe stress and anxiety wrought by gun violence undermines the purpose of our schools. It impairs children's ability to focus, listen, reflect, negotiate differences, collaborate, and get along. A study reports that the \"heightened worry over safety even in the absence of gun violence rewires the brain at its most sensitive periods of development\" because it compromises the prefrontal cortex, which \"coordinates higher cognitive functions including working memory, attention shifting and executive skills . . . [and] also mediates empathy and self-regulation.\"\n\nWith kids forced to contemplate the worst at any moment, mapping out their escape, or pondering death and final goodbyes, this is no way to liberate young minds. It is a surer way to crush them. Free and boundless thought is the seed and staple of autonomy. Our culture of mass shootings is rooting this out of future generations, who are left instead to think of mere survival.\n\nThe radical gun rights agenda enabling all of this is not the product of popular will; it is ascendent because its proponents are successfully subverting democracy. Majorities of voters favor stronger gun control measures; upward of 70 percent from both parties want universal background checks, for instance. But Congress ignores their views. It is in thrall to the powerful gun lobby, which commands a small but impassioned army of supporters who go to great lengths to advance their cause, even marching in public with assault rifles to intimidate opponents.\n\nMany politicians are reliant on the National Rifle Association (NRA)'s financial generosity. The NRA was the biggest donor to Donald Trump's presidential campaign in 2016, and it reaped the rewards, including three Supreme Court justices who would faithfully advance the gun lobby's cause. In its landmark decision New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen , the Supreme Court majority declared concealed carry restrictions enacted by New York State unconstitutional.\n\nMore alarming, the justices asserted a new originalist standard that threatens what gun control regulations remain. The court now says we must look to the period between 1791 and 1868 (the years that the Second and Fourteenth Amendments were ratified respectively) to determine if gun regulations are constitutional - a period when there were basically none. A Texas judge subsequently determined on that basis that \"red flag\" laws, which many voters support and have approved across the country, and which prohibit domestic abusers from accessing guns, are unconstitutional .\n\nIn short, when it comes to guns, the Supreme Court doesn't care what voters want. (This diverges notably from its position on abortion and environmental regulations, which, the justices say, should be up to the will of voters in each state.)\n\nThe ascendant gun rights movement is symptomatic of the problems with American democracy, in which anti-majoritarian institutions like the Supreme Court and the Senate allow the will of the few to be foisted on the many. To have a chance at stemming our runaway gun culture, we must organize to dismantle these institutions and build a genuinely democratic state.\n\nThis task is urgent because our hyperarmed society, enabled by our antidemocratic Constitution, undermines the basis for what little democracy we do have. Terror is an inherently undemocratic emotion and outlook. It does not dispose people to work together, communicate, collaborate, and compromise, as democratic deliberation demands. Thanks to the trauma of our armed culture, we are raising a generation of children to be instinctively mistrustful. They will be less inclined to reach out to neighbors and fellow citizens and more likely to retreat inward into private, fortified lairs.\n\nThe paranoia to which our children are being reduced sounds similar to the mindset Hannah Arendt described under totalitarian regimes. Authoritarian governments that aim for total domination, she writes, cannot suffer human freedom; they cannot tolerate citizens that are autonomous and unpredictable. They must be made uniform, as if part of a single body, immediately responsive to government demands. Reduce people to worrying over survival and you greatly limit the scope of their aspirations and expectations. You also make them easy to manipulate, prod, and shape at will.\n\nOur armed society is nurturing an \"authoritarian predisposition,\" as political psychologist Karen Stenner puts it . This predisposition is \"stable and enduring but normally latent - [and] is activated and expressed when triggered by perceived political and social disorder.\" Future generations, weaned on trauma and buffeted by anxiety, will crave security. They will be unsympathetic to difference and intolerant of indecision when terror might strike. There is no shortage of \"American carnage\" for authoritarians like Donald Trump to cite to justify dispensing with the democratic traditions and institutions that we do have. If society becomes a war zone, we can hardly sit around while voters and elected officials dither and debate.\n\nReversing these trends will require challenging the individualism, atomization, and passivity that the culture of violence encourages. It will require collectively organizing and mobilizing en masse to demand a transformation of our government's institutions, so that the majority's preference for reasonable gun control laws may prevail over the preferences of the NRA, gun rights fanatics, and unelected judges. We can take inspiration from large-scale protests like the 2018 March for Our Lives, led by teenagers who survived the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, or the tentative moves toward gun control in deep-red Texas, provoked by popular outrage over the recent school shooting in Uvalde.\n\nThe task is not easy. But ending the epidemic of mass death, and the threat to democracy it poses, demands a radical, collective response, one that fights to make our country's political institutions truly democratic - more than they were before.\n\nFirmin DeBrabander is professor of philosophy at the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore.

      "text": "More Guns Won't Make Us Safer. Here's What Might.\n\nsiiixth/Getty Images\n\nThis article first appeared on TomDispatch.com .\n\nGuns. In a country with more than 300 million of them, a country that's recently been swept up in a round of protests over the endless killing sprees they permit, you'd think I might have had more experience with them.\n\nAs it happens, I've held a gun only once in my life. I even fired it. I was in perhaps tenth grade and enamored with an Eagle Scout who loved war reenactments. On weekends, he and his friends camped out, took off their watches to get into the spirit of the War of 1812 , and dressed in homemade muslin underclothes and itchy uniforms. I was there just one weekend. Somehow my pacifist parents signed off on letting their daughter spend the day with war reenactors. Someone lent me a period gown, brown and itchy and ill-fitting. We women and girls spent an hour twisting black gunpowder into newspaper scraps. I joked that the newspaper was anachronistic-the previous week's Baltimore Sun -but no one laughed.\n\nA man came by with a long gun, an antique, resting on the shoulder of his jerkin to collect our \"bullets\" and he must have read the gun terror written on my face.\n\n\"Wanna give it a try?\" he asked.\n\n\"Sure,\" I said, stumbling to my feet, pushing my gown out of the way, and trying to act like I didn't have broken-rifle patches, symbols of the pacifist War Resisters League , all over my real clothes. I felt a surge of adrenaline as I took the heavy weapon in my way-too-small hands. He showed me how to wrestle it into position, aim it, and fire. There were no bullets, just one of my twists of powder, but it made a terrifying noise. I shrieked and came close to dropping the weapon.\n\nAnd there it was: the beginning, middle, and end of my love affair with guns-less than a minute long. Still, my hands seemed to tingle for the rest of the afternoon and the smell of gunpowder lingered in my hair for days.\n\nOne in four Americans now owns a gun or lives in a household with guns. So how strange that, on that day in the late 1980s, I saw a real gun for the first and last time. I grew up in inner-city Baltimore. I've worked at soup kitchens and homeless shelters all over the East Coast and stayed at dozens of Catholic Worker Houses around the country-Providence, Camden, Syracuse, Detroit, Chicago, Los Angeles-every one in a \"tough\" neighborhood. I lived in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the mid-1990s, before you could get a $4 coffee or a zucchini scone on Van Brunt Street, before there was an Ikea or a Fairway in the neighborhood. All those tough communities, those places where President Trump imagines scenes of continual \" American carnage ,\" and I've never again seen a gun.\n\nStill, people obviously own them and use them in staggering numbers and in all sorts of destructive ways. Sensing that they're widespread beyond my imagination, my husband and I have started asking the parents of our kids' school friends if they own guns when we arrange play dates or sleepovers. We learned this from the father of a classmate of my 11-year-old stepdaughter, Rosena. The dad called to make the arrangements for his son to come over after school. We talked logistics and food allergies and then he paused. \"Now, I am sorry if this is intrusive,\" he said, \" but I do ask everyone : Do you keep guns in your house?\" He sounded both uncomfortable and resolute.\n\nI almost choked on my urge to say, \"Don't you know who I am?\" In certain odd corners at least, my last name, Berrigan , is still synonymous with muscular pacifism and principled opposition to violence and weaponry of just about any kind, right up to the nuclear kind . But that dad probably didn't even know my last name and it probably wouldn't have meant a thing to him if he had. He just wanted to make sure his son was going to be safe and I was grateful that he asked-rather than just assuming, based on our Volvo-driving, thrift-shop-dressing, bumper-sticker-sporting lifestyle, that we didn't.\n\n\"You know how kids are,\" he said after I assured him that we were a gun-free household. \"They'll be into everything.\"\n\nAnd right he is. Kids are \"into everything,\" which is undoubtedly why so many of them end up with guns in their hands or bullets in their bodies.\n\n\"Do you question everyone about their guns?\" I asked the dad. He replied that he did and, if they answered yes, then he'd ask whether those weapons were locked away, whether the ammunition was stored separately, and so on. \"Thank you so much. I think we need to start doing that too,\" I added as our conversation was ending, and indeed I have ever since.\n\nIt's a subject worth raising, however awkward the conversation that follows may be, because two million kids in this country live in homes where guns are not stored safely and securely. So far this year, 59 kids have been hurt in gun accidents of one sort or another. On average, every 34 hours in our great nation a child is involved in an unintentional shooting incident, often with tragic consequences .\n\nThe National Rifle Association's classic argument, \"guns don't kill people, people kill people,\" takes on a far harsher edge when you're talking about a seven-year-old accidentally killing his nine-year-old brother with a gun they found while playing in an empty neighboring house in Arboles, Colorado.\n\nTwo weeks after we learn this new parenting life skill in this oh-so-new century of ours, my husband Patrick is on the phone with a mom arranging a sleepover for Rosena. I hear him fumble his way through the gun question. From his responses, I assume the mom is acknowledging that they do have guns. Then there's the sort of long, awkward silence that seems part and parcel of such conversations before Patrick finally says, \"Well, okay, thanks for being so honest. I appreciate that.\"\n\nHe hangs up and looks at me. \"They do keep guns for hunting and protection, but they're locked up and out of sight,\" he tells me. \"The mom says that the kids have never tried to get at the guns, but she understands the dangers.\" (He had heard in her voice apology, embarrassment, and worry that the guns might mean no sleepover.)\n\nI grimaced in a way that said: I don't think Rosena should go, and he responded that he thought she should. The two of them then had a long conversation about what she should do and say if she sees a gun. She slept over and had a great time. A lesson in navigating difference, trusting our kid, and phew-no guns made an appearance. And now we know more about our neighbors and our community.\n\nMy son Seamus, five, received an Easter basket from a family friend. He was happy about the candy of course and immediately smitten with the stuffed bunny, but he was over the moon about what he called his new \"carrot gun.\" It wasn't a toy gun at all, but a little basket that popped out a light ball when you pressed a button.\n\nThe idea was that you'd catch the ball, put it back in, and do it again. But that wasn't the game my kids played. They promptly began popping it at each other. His little sister Madeline, four, was in tattle mode almost immediately. \"Mom, Seamus is shooting me with his carrot gun!\"\n\n\"Mom, Mom, Mom,\" he responded quickly, \"it's a pretend play gun, not a real play gun. It's okay.\" He made popping noises with his mouth and held his hand as if he were grasping a genuine forbidden toy gun. It was an important distinction for him. He'd been a full-throated participant in the March for Our Lives in Boston on March 24, chanting with the rest of us \"What do we want? Gun control! When do we want it? NOW!\" for four hours straight.\n\nAt the march, he pointed out that all the police officers managing traffic and the flow of people were wearing guns on their belts. \"I see a gun, Mom,\" he kept saying, or \"That police officer has a gun, Mom.\"\n\nRepeatedly, he noticed the means to kill-and then four days after that huge outpouring of youth-led activism for gun security, Stephon Clark was gunned down in his grandmother's backyard in Sacramento, California. The police officers who shot him were looking for someone who had been breaking car windows in the neighborhood and they fired 20 shots into the dark in his direction. The independent autopsy found that he had been hit eight times, mostly in his back. Clark turned out to be holding only a cellphone, though the police evidently mistook it for a tool bar, which could have done them no harm from that distance, even if wielded as a weapon.\n\nMaybe the police saw a weapon the same way my five-year-old son sees one. He can make a stick or just about anything else, including that little basket, into a \"gun\" and so evidently can the police. Police officers have killed black men and boys holding pipes , water hose nozzles , knives , and toy guns , too.\n\nParkland (17 killed, 14 wounded). Newtown (28 killed, 2 wounded). Columbine (15 killed, 21 injured). School shootings are now treated as a structural part of our lives. They have become a factor in school architecture, administrator training, city and state funding, and security plans. The expectation that something terrible will happen at school shapes the way that three- and four-year-olds are introduced to its culture. Part of their orientation now involves regular \"shelter in place\" and \"secure-school\" drills.\n\nAt my daughter's preschool, the kids are told that they're hiding from rabid raccoons, those animals standing in for marauding, disaffected white boys or men roaming the halls armed. As parents, we need to do more than blindly accept that these traumatic exercises are preparing our kids for the worst and helping them survive . Kids are vulnerable little beings and there are countless dangers out there, but they have a 1-in-600 million chance of dying in a school shooting. We endanger them so much more by texting while driving them home from school.\n\nAfter every episode of violence at a school-or in the adult world at a church , night club , concert , movie theater , or workplace like San Bernardino's Inland Regional Center or the YouTube headquarters -there's always a huge chorus of \"why?\" Pundits look at the shooter's history, his (it's almost always a guy) trauma, and whatever might be known about his mental health. They speculate on his (or, in the rare case of those YouTube shootings, her) political leanings, racial hatreds, and ethnic background. The search for whys can lead to hand-wringing about hard- rock music or nihilistic video games or endemic bullying -which could indeed be factors in the drive to kill significant numbers of unsuspecting people-but never go far enough or deep enough.\n\nTwo questions are answered far too infrequently: Where do the guns come from? Where does violence come from?\n\nGuns of all sizes and description are manufactured and sold in this country in remarkable numbers, far more than can be legally absorbed in our already gun-saturated land, so thousands of them move instead into the gray and black markets. Evidence of this trend shows up repeatedly in Mexico, where 70 percent of the weapons seized in crimes between 2009 and 2014 turned out to be made in e l norte . We have an estimated 300 million guns in this country, making us, by far, first in the world in gun ownership-and some of those guns couldn't conceivably be used for \"hunting.\" They are military-style weapons meant to tear human flesh and nothing but-like the AR-15 that 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz bought legally and used in his grim Parkland spree.\n\nThis country, in other words, is a cornucopia of guns, which-honestly, folks-doesn't have a damn thing to do with the Second Amendment.\n\nWhere does the violence come from? I've already shared my inexperience with guns. Now, let me add to it my inexperience with violence. I don't know what it's like to have to react in a split second to, or flee from, an advancing perpetrator. No one has ever come at me with a gun or a knife or a pipe, or anything else. And I count myself lucky for that. In a nation in which, in 2016 alone, 14,925 people were killed by gun violence and another 22,938 used a gun to kill themselves , it's a significant thing to be able to say.\n\nAnd yet, I know that I'm the product of violence (as well as the urge, in my own family, to protest and stop it): the violence of white privilege, the violence of American colonialism, the violence of American superpowerdom on a global scale. And that's no small thing. It's a lot easier to blame active-shooter scenarios on poor mental-health screening than on growing up in a world layered with the threat of pervasive violence.\n\nPower is about never having to say you're sorry, never being held accountable. And that's hardly just a matter of police officers shooting black men and boys; it's about the way in which this country is insulated from international opprobrium by its trillion-dollar national security state, a military that doesn't hesitate to divide the world into seven US \"commands,\" and a massive, planet-obliterating nuclear arsenal.\n\nAnd don't think that any of that's just a reflection of Trumpian bombast and brutality. That same sense of never having to say you're sorry at a global level undergirded Barack Obama's urbane dispassion, George Bush Junior's silver-spoon cluelessness, Bill Clinton's folksy accessibility, George Bush Senior's patrician poshness, Ronald Reagan's aura of Hollywood charm, and Jimmy Carter's southern version of the same. We're talking about weapons systems designed to rain down a magnitude of terror unimaginable to the Nikolas Cruzes, Dylann Roofs, and Adam Lanzas of the world.\n\nAnd it doesn't even make us safe! All that money, all that knowledge, all that power put into the designing and displaying of weapons of mass destruction and we remain remarkably vulnerable as a nation. After all, in schools, homes, offices, neighborhoods across the country, we are being killed by our kids, our friends, our lovers, our police officers, our crumbling roads and bridges, our derailing trains. And then, of course, there are all those guns. Guns meant to destroy. Guns beyond counting.\n\nSo what might actually make us safer? After all, people theoretically buy the kind of firepower you might otherwise use only in war and pledge allegiance to the US war machine in search of some chimera of safety. And yet, despite that other classic NRA line -\"The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun\"-are we truly safer in a nation awash in such weaponry, with so many scrambling in a state of incipient panic to buy yet more? Are my kids truly on the way to a better life as they practice cowering in their cubbies in darkened classrooms for fear of invading rabid \"raccoons\"?\n\nDon't you think that true security lies not in our arming ourselves to the teeth against other people-that is, in our disconnection from them-but in our connection to them, to the web of mutuality that has bound societies, small and large, for millennia? Don't you think that we would be more secure and so much less terrified if we found ways to acknowledge and share our relative abundance to meet the needs of others? In a world awash in guns and fears, doesn't our security have to involve trust and courage and always be (at best) a work in progress?\n\nAs for me, I'm tackling that work in progress in whatever ways I can-with my neighbors, my town, my husband, and most of all my children, educating them in the ways violence scars and all those weapons just increase our journey into hell, never delivering the security they promise.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "More Guns Won't Make Us Safer. Here's What Might.\n\nsiiixth/Getty Images\n\nThis article first appeared on TomDispatch.com .\n\nGuns. In a country with more than 300 million of them, a country that's recently been swept up in a round of protests over the endless killing sprees they permit, you'd think I might have had more experience with them.\n\nAs it happens, I've held a gun only once in my life. I even fired it. I was in perhaps tenth grade and enamored with an Eagle Scout who loved war reenactments. On weekends, he and his friends camped out, took off their watches to get into the spirit of the War of 1812 , and dressed in homemade muslin underclothes and itchy uniforms. I was there just one weekend. Somehow my pacifist parents signed off on letting their daughter spend the day with war reenactors. Someone lent me a period gown, brown and itchy and ill-fitting. We women and girls spent an hour twisting black gunpowder into newspaper scraps. I joked that the newspaper was anachronistic-the previous week's Baltimore Sun -but no one laughed.\n\nA man came by with a long gun, an antique, resting on the shoulder of his jerkin to collect our \"bullets\" and he must have read the gun terror written on my face.\n\n\"Wanna give it a try?\" he asked.\n\n\"Sure,\" I said, stumbling to my feet, pushing my gown out of the way, and trying to act like I didn't have broken-rifle patches, symbols of the pacifist War Resisters League , all over my real clothes. I felt a surge of adrenaline as I took the heavy weapon in my way-too-small hands. He showed me how to wrestle it into position, aim it, and fire. There were no bullets, just one of my twists of powder, but it made a terrifying noise. I shrieked and came close to dropping the weapon.\n\nAnd there it was: the beginning, middle, and end of my love affair with guns-less than a minute long. Still, my hands seemed to tingle for the rest of the afternoon and the smell of gunpowder lingered in my hair for days.\n\nOne in four Americans now owns a gun or lives in a household with guns. So how strange that, on that day in the late 1980s, I saw a real gun for the first and last time. I grew up in inner-city Baltimore. I've worked at soup kitchens and homeless shelters all over the East Coast and stayed at dozens of Catholic Worker Houses around the country-Providence, Camden, Syracuse, Detroit, Chicago, Los Angeles-every one in a \"tough\" neighborhood. I lived in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the mid-1990s, before you could get a $4 coffee or a zucchini scone on Van Brunt Street, before there was an Ikea or a Fairway in the neighborhood. All those tough communities, those places where President Trump imagines scenes of continual \" American carnage ,\" and I've never again seen a gun.\n\nStill, people obviously own them and use them in staggering numbers and in all sorts of destructive ways. Sensing that they're widespread beyond my imagination, my husband and I have started asking the parents of our kids' school friends if they own guns when we arrange play dates or sleepovers. We learned this from the father of a classmate of my 11-year-old stepdaughter, Rosena. The dad called to make the arrangements for his son to come over after school. We talked logistics and food allergies and then he paused. \"Now, I am sorry if this is intrusive,\" he said, \" but I do ask everyone : Do you keep guns in your house?\" He sounded both uncomfortable and resolute.\n\nI almost choked on my urge to say, \"Don't you know who I am?\" In certain odd corners at least, my last name, Berrigan , is still synonymous with muscular pacifism and principled opposition to violence and weaponry of just about any kind, right up to the nuclear kind . But that dad probably didn't even know my last name and it probably wouldn't have meant a thing to him if he had. He just wanted to make sure his son was going to be safe and I was grateful that he asked-rather than just assuming, based on our Volvo-driving, thrift-shop-dressing, bumper-sticker-sporting lifestyle, that we didn't.\n\n\"You know how kids are,\" he said after I assured him that we were a gun-free household. \"They'll be into everything.\"\n\nAnd right he is. Kids are \"into everything,\" which is undoubtedly why so many of them end up with guns in their hands or bullets in their bodies.\n\n\"Do you question everyone about their guns?\" I asked the dad. He replied that he did and, if they answered yes, then he'd ask whether those weapons were locked away, whether the ammunition was stored separately, and so on. \"Thank you so much. I think we need to start doing that too,\" I added as our conversation was ending, and indeed I have ever since.\n\nIt's a subject worth raising, however awkward the conversation that follows may be, because two million kids in this country live in homes where guns are not stored safely and securely. So far this year, 59 kids have been hurt in gun accidents of one sort or another. On average, every 34 hours in our great nation a child is involved in an unintentional shooting incident, often with tragic consequences .\n\nThe National Rifle Association's classic argument, \"guns don't kill people, people kill people,\" takes on a far harsher edge when you're talking about a seven-year-old accidentally killing his nine-year-old brother with a gun they found while playing in an empty neighboring house in Arboles, Colorado.\n\nTwo weeks after we learn this new parenting life skill in this oh-so-new century of ours, my husband Patrick is on the phone with a mom arranging a sleepover for Rosena. I hear him fumble his way through the gun question. From his responses, I assume the mom is acknowledging that they do have guns. Then there's the sort of long, awkward silence that seems part and parcel of such conversations before Patrick finally says, \"Well, okay, thanks for being so honest. I appreciate that.\"\n\nHe hangs up and looks at me. \"They do keep guns for hunting and protection, but they're locked up and out of sight,\" he tells me. \"The mom says that the kids have never tried to get at the guns, but she understands the dangers.\" (He had heard in her voice apology, embarrassment, and worry that the guns might mean no sleepover.)\n\nI grimaced in a way that said: I don't think Rosena should go, and he responded that he thought she should. The two of them then had a long conversation about what she should do and say if she sees a gun. She slept over and had a great time. A lesson in navigating difference, trusting our kid, and phew-no guns made an appearance. And now we know more about our neighbors and our community.\n\nMy son Seamus, five, received an Easter basket from a family friend.

      "text": "Guns Were a Huge Part of My Life Growing Up. Should We Talk About Them Differently Now?\n\nMother Jones; mgkaya/Getty\n\n\"Treat every gun like it's loaded.\"\n\nI remember clearly the first time my father said this to me in the living room of our Tennessee home, where we always had important \"family talks\"-his jaw was set, and his eyes searched mine for a promise to heed his warning before he fixed my sister with a similar gaze. I was 15 years old, my sister was 14. In the years after, he would repeat the refrain over and over, quizzing us at random so he could hear us say the words and feel assured that we would be safe.\n\nI've always regarded my father as a serious man. He has a heart of gold and a howling laugh, but when I lived under his roof, I also knew him to be someone who was not to be challenged. He is also deeply thoughtful-the kind of person who is constantly thinking through his perceptions of the world around him and the potential consequences of his actions, so it should not have surprised me to discover that guns did not simply appear in our home.\n\nIf you grow up in the rural South, gun culture feels very entrenched in the regional identity. A lot of my classmates were dedicated hunters; I remember a boy who was suspended because he drove to school with his guns still in the back of his truck-he simply forgot, he said, to put them away after a hunting trip. One of my uncles used to keep a gun around to shoot at the armadillos that came out at night to upset his cows. A great-aunt of mine was notorious for calling her dog in for supper by firing a shot off her back porch in the middle-of-nowhere, Mississippi. Guns have also represented a family legacy for us in some ways-when my grandmother's father's pistol (affectionately known as Big Daddy) was passed between my uncle and my father, it seemed to carry an emotional weight for them that I don't see often. I found myself feeling a strange reverence toward it as well, like it was some long-lost familial talisman that binds me to a generation I never got to meet, but I've heard stories of all my life.\n\nThat said, my father didn't have a real conversation with us until we were teenagers, when he decided it was safe to have guns in our home. When I told him I was writing this, he said that he waited until we were mature enough to fully understand the stakes. \"Even if you're sure the gun is not loaded, treat it like it is anyway,\" he would say. My father is ex-military; when he issues an order, you follow it. We were never to touch a gun without him present (they were locked away in a safe anyhow) and we were never, ever to point a gun at anything other than the ground or a target on the range (or, once, a piece of sheetrock in someone's backyard, because why would you pass that up?).\n\nAt the time of that first conversation, I was kind of a pain in the ass. My teenage self was angry, headstrong, and terrified of joining the ranks of those in her tiny town that never, ever left. I was worried about things like my grades, band practice, my relationship with my high school boyfriend. I had a lot of stupid fights with my dad that I'm horrified by now, but somehow, guns presented an opportunity for us to do something together that didn't end in conflict. We cleaned our guns together, went to the range and gun shows on weekends, and even restored an old World War II Carbine rifle as a project.\n\nI feel grateful now that my father always spoke to me frankly and carefully about guns and the kind of damage that can be wrought by people who are irresponsible and do not respect the power behind their weapons. But I honestly never really gave a second thought to real gun violence or the possibility of a school shooting. When I was a little girl, he used to warn me about two-legged monsters; it's really only now as an adult that I know two-legged monsters are all too real-and some of them wield firearms.\n\nNow, I am still young enough to recall these conversations with my father, but also old enough to be able to imagine trying to have these discussions with a child of my own, should I decide to have one someday. A few weeks ago, I was at a neighborhood bar in San Francisco, catching up with other female journalists, several of whom have children. The topic turned to having the \"sex talk\" with kids, and then someone brought up a consequence of life in post-Parkland America as needing to have the guns talk, too: specifically, what to do in the event of a school shooting. I was struck by that idea: taking the gun talk one step further by teaching kids how to react if a shooter were to enter their classroom. Of all the ways my father talked to me and my sister about firearms, that possibility never entered our discourse. It made me reflect more on his position as a gun owner and a parent, and it made me wonder how other families talk about guns across the country.\n\nHow is your family talking about guns?

      "text": "Trump Prepares to Wipe Out Years of Progress on Gun Violence\n\nFlag displayed along the route of a \"Take Our Border Back\" convoy on Feb. 2, 2024 in Uvalde, Texas Michael Nigro/Sipa/AP\n\nBy the time Joe Biden became president in January 2021, guns were the top killer of children and teens in America, overtaking car crashes and cancer as the leading cause of death. As that trend continued , the Biden White House responded with gun safety policies to enforce existing laws and bolster gun-violence prevention programs. In June 2022, following mass shootings at a grocery store in Buffalo, NY, and an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, Congress passed gun legislation for the first time in three decades. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act strengthened background checks for some gun buyers and prohibitions for domestic abusers, and it dedicated about $15 billion for states to build mental health and violence intervention programs. The Biden White House later established the Office of Gun Violence Prevention and an initiative to help states implement \"red flag\" laws that allow for removing guns from troubled people who pose a danger to themselves or others.\n\nThese policies at a broad level have coincided with a reduction in gun violence nationally: By 2024, shooting homicides overall were in steady decline throughout the country. Mass shootings also declined, both by conservative and broader measures of the problem.\n\nNow, President Donald Trump has moved quickly to undo the progress made with gun safety policies. He shut down the Office of Gun Violence Prevention immediately after taking office. And on Feb. 7, he signed an executive order directing US Attorney General Pam Bondi to \"examine all orders, regulations, guidance, plans, international agreements, and other actions of executive departments and agencies\" from Biden's term, to assess whether those \"infringe on the Second Amendment rights\" of Americans. Within 30 days, Bondi is to give Trump \"a plan of action.\"\n\nTrump made clear during his 2024 campaign what that plan is likely to do. At the National Rifle Association's annual convention in Dallas last May, he vowed to \"roll back every Biden attack on the Second Amendment.\"\n\nAreas at risk could include efforts to combat the emerging danger from untraceable firearms that are made from kits or using 3-D printers, known as \"ghost guns.\" Trump has a history from his first term in office of undermining regulation of these weapons. When Biden became president, crime involving ghost guns was skyrocketing. Biden moved to make such firearms subject to serial numbers and background checks, and later established an ATF task force to focus on the problem. (A gun industry-backed challenge to Biden's ghost gun policy is currently at the Supreme Court .) By 2023, crimes using ghost guns began declining nationally.\n\nThe problem of ghost guns came back into stark view in December, when a disgruntled 26-year-old man allegedly used one to execute UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on a street in New York City. That attack apparently was the first time a ghost gun was used for a high-profile assassination.\n\nTrump's supporters in the gun industry now anticipate a big political payoff.\n\nRed flag laws, which have strong bipartisan support among voters and spread to nearly half of all states in recent years, are also vulnerable under Trump. In early 2024, then-Vice President Kamala Harris announced a new center based at Johns Hopkins University to provide technical and training support to states implementing the laws, an initiative funded with a grant from the US Justice Department. Studies in California and elsewhere have shown that these laws- which allow a civil court judge to remove guns temporarily based on evidence that a person poses a threat-are effective for preventing suicide and mass shootings .\n\nTrump in fact openly supported red flag laws following a spate of gun massacres in summer 2019. But in 2022, he blasted the bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which provided states with funding for red flag laws, painting it as a nefarious gun grab by \"Radical Left Democrats\" and \"RINO\" senators including Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn.\n\nDemagoguery from Trump and the firearms industry about government \"gun grabs\" is disconnected from the reality in the United States. There are more than 400 million guns in circulation today, far surpassing the total population. Americans buy more than a million guns every month, and in many states there are few restrictions on doing so. The number of civilian-owned AR-15s-a popular rifle that was designed for maximum killing in war and became a profit center for the industry-has ballooned to well over 20 million. In recent years those became the weapon of choice for mass shooters , too.\n\nTrump's supporters in the gun industry now anticipate a big political payoff.\n\n\"NRA members were instrumental, turning out in record numbers to secure his victory, and he is proving worthy of their votes, faith, and confidence in his first days in office,\" NRA CEO Doug Hamlin said in a statement after Trump's executive order.\n\nThe number of civilian-owned AR-15s-a rifle that was designed for maximum killing in war -has ballooned to well over 20 million.\n\n\"Gun owners fought hard to elect a president who would take a sledgehammer to Biden's unconstitutional gun control policies, and today, President Trump proved he's serious about that fight,\" Aidan Johnston, a director for Gun Owners of America, said in a statement. \"We hope that this executive order is just the first of many victories reestablishing our Second Amendment rights during the Trump administration.\"\n\nGun safety advocates are sounding the alarm, including those galvanized by the devastating high school massacre that took place seven years ago Friday in Parkland, Florida.\n\n\"Trump's priorities couldn't be more clear. Spoiler: it's not protecting kids. Gun deaths finally went down last year, and Trump just moved to undo the rules and laws that helped make that happen,\" said Natalie Fall, Executive Director of March For Our Lives, in a statement. \"He is going to get Americans killed in his thirst for vengeance and eagerness to please the gun lobby and rally armed extremists. Remember the next time that a mass shooting happens, Trump did everything in his power to enable it, not prevent it.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Why It Took Seven Years to Get One Statistic About Guns\n\nMother Jones illustration; Getty\n\nIt took seven long years to pry one staggering number from the hands of the federal government: that 52,529 weapons once owned by police were recovered at crime scenes across the country from 2006 to 2021. In that period, an average of nine cop guns were recovered each day. The public didn't know it.\n\nThis statistic was the missing piece in a yearslong reporting effort by Reveal , the Trace , and CBS News into how weapons sold by police departments were getting into the hands of criminals . Reveal first sought this information through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)-the keystone law centered on government transparency. But it wouldn't be that easy. As Reveal 's court battles demonstrate, there is resistance to such transparency.\n\nThese types of legal battles over FOIA requests are becoming more commonplace. According to a 2020 study by the FOIA Project, a Syracuse University-based research effort, media outlets filed more FOIA lawsuits to disclose government records during Donald Trump's four-year presidential term than in the 16 years spanning Barack Obama and George W. Bush's administrations.\n\nThe origins of the police weapons FOIA case date back to 2008, when Alain Stephens, then a police recruit, purchased a Glock handgun in a Texas parking lot that turned out to have come from a New Jersey police department. It got him thinking: How often do police guns end up in the hands of criminals? This question grew into a larger project once Stephens became a reporter and started the fight for this number as a fellow at Reveal . After his FOIA request was denied based on an argument that firearms trace data is confidential, the Reveal legal team sued-but it took seven years to claim victory.\n\nFive of those years were court battles that rose all the way to the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals. The case stalled further after another federal court interpreted the exemption differently and generated an opposing precedent, creating uncertainty.\n\nThe last two years were spent waiting for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to cough up that one statistic. Armed with that number-52,529 former law enforcement weapons recovered at crime scenes-teams at the Trace, CBS News, and Reveal found that many of these guns had been traded in or sold back to gun manufacturers, a cost-saving measure that has sent thousands of guns back onto the streets to be used in violent crimes.\n\nI spoke with D. Victoria Baranetsky-general counsel for the Center for Investigative Reporting (CIR), which houses Mother Jones and Reveal -about the battle over transparency on cop guns and the state of FOIA today. She's led several other FOIA lawsuits for Reveal that have forced more transparency from the federal government: The rate of worker injuries at Amazon warehouses and most other American employers is no longer confidential , and the government now has to disclose the diversity of contractors it hires . She recently filed a case against OpenAI and Microsoft for using CIR's content without permission or compensation.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and condensed.\n\nHow did this case with the ATF start?\n\nIt started with Alain [Stephens] calling me up and being like, \"Does this law say what I think it says?\"\n\nAlain was explaining to me that he was trying to get data from the ATF, but he was denied. There was this statute called the Tiahrt Amendment that did not allow for gun data to be disclosed. But there were exceptions-and the third exception under the law was for statistical aggregate data.\n\nAnd he said, \"I'm asking for just the number of guns that law enforcement have given back and put back into the marketplace.\" And I said, \"Yeah, I think that's statistical aggregate data.\"\n\nSo we sued.\n\nWhat arguments did the ATF give for withholding data about police guns used in crimes?\n\nThey were saying that that exception was not meant for reporters. It was meant for only law enforcement and other folks that were supposed to be getting access to this data, not the general public.\n\nAnd then there was a whole new issue entirely. They said that making them search for this number through their database would be the creation of a new record, and agencies are not required to create new records. They're only required to produce what they have. And so they said, \"Listen, you make us plug in this analysis and spew out a number for you, that's going to be a new record that wouldn't have existed prior, and so we're not obligated to disclose this.\"\n\nThe court shut that down immediately.\n\nThat kind of analysis would essentially destroy all kinds of data searches that governments have in their capacity today, because we're living in the modern world and databases are the way that information is held. So if you limited searching a database as the creation of a new record, you'd essentially cut off access to tons of information that the public should have the right to know.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not the only case where we have come across that argument.\n\nSo has that become a new tactic of how the government tries to restrict access to data?\n\nYes, it has worked in some locations. There's a smattering of cases across the country leaning in either direction, but there's no prevailing outcome yet as this is still being deliberated on across the country.\n\nI think there's also an even more disturbing reason for transparency today, which is more and more information is being created than ever before-and more is being collected than ever before by large corporate and government powers. There's a massive imbalance as to who has access to that data; it's all corporations and governments.\n\nThat is one of the reasons why this case was actually a huge win completely outside the realm of the ATF...this was something that would apply to all cases involving databases.\n\nWhat does a seven-year FOIA legal battle look like?\n\nA lot of emails.\n\nThis was actually the longest case I dealt with while I've been at this job. It's just stages of a lot of intense work and then waiting. So writing the brief, which takes, like, three months, and you're kind of in this tunnel vision of how to perfectly describe this argument to the court, and you submit it, you file it at midnight, and then you wait. You just wait for months and months and then get an argument date, and you prep for that for months and months. And then you wait.\n\nWhy is data transparency important for democracy?\n\nIn the United States, FOIA is actually one of the very few laws committed to transparency. And constitutionally, there are actually fewer and fewer protections for transparency.\n\nThere has been a sharp rise in the number of Exemption 3 statutes. Those are the statutes that Congress has been lobbied to pass to stop information from being disclosed under FOIA.\n\nIn fact, the Tiahrt Amendment, and the center of this case with Alain, was one of those statutes. The NRA [National Rifle Association] lobbied for that law to be passed, and I think they very intelligently did so, because I think its impact was actually huge. When you don't have access to information, the public doesn't really know what it thinks about an issue, because it can't really get to the facts of the matter. So, I think, in general, facts help people make choices that can help them then make choices about who they elect into power.\n\nBut I think there's also an even more disturbing reason for transparency today, which is more and more information is being created than ever before-and more is being collected than ever before by large corporate and government powers. There's a massive imbalance as to who has access to that data; it's all corporations and governments. For the public to not have a countervailing pressure or countervailing force to have access to that is deeply problematic. More and more decisions are having an impact in our life that corporations and governments are involved in, and they're making those decisions based on data that we have no access to. If you have no access to that, there's no accountability as to how those decisions are being made.\n\nReveal faced a SLAPP lawsuit in 2016 from Planet Aid that was eventually thrown out by a federal court in 2021. What does the legal battle with Planet Aid have in common with the lawsuit for gun trace data?\n\nA SLAPP is a strategic lawsuit against public participation, something that's supposed to quash First Amendment free speech activity. And anti-SLAPP statutes were created to quickly go into court. It's not, theoretically, supposed to take more than a year or so at most. That [SLAPP] case went on for years-this incredible process of delay, delay, delay, eat up your resources, eat up your resources, eat up your resources, for something that was especially made to be answered quickly and efficiently. It dragged out for so long that it almost bankrupted our organization. You see tactics of this being used all over our system.\n\nI think that's the greatest parallel to this case with Alain. There's no end in sight, right? Like, you filed a lawsuit. You go through seven years. You win. And then you still have to file another lawsuit to actually enforce it. To get to finality, it just takes too long now, much longer than it ever should have taken.\n\nAnd there's an added problem with FOIA where at some point, that information is stale. It doesn't matter in the same way it would have mattered if it had been disclosed years prior.\n\nMost smaller newsrooms and freelance journalists don't have the luxury of legal support on staff like Mother Jones and Reveal do. Knowing that, what does this mean for journalism?\n\nMost newsrooms, most journalists, most academics, protesters, citizens just don't have the legal support to execute this. And that is really unfortunate and depressing. There was a paper written more than five years ago about how corporations are actually the ones that use FOIA the most to find out information about their competitors. So FOIA, drafted for the public and reporters, is not really being used by that sect of people. It's being used often by corporate stakeholders who want to find information and that'll give them a competitive advantage.\n\nI still think [FOIA] does a lot, but I think the problem is how agencies choose to comply. The pressure put on them to comply is very minimal, and I think that greatly impacts journalism, because you know that if you actually did have access to this information, it would be helpful.\n\nIn looking at FOIAs, does the presidential administration make a difference in how they're treated? Did you see differences between our fights under Trump and Biden's administrations?\n\nHonestly, I don't think any administration is ever forthright in giving information. I think if you ask most people who live in the land of FOIA lawsuits, they'll tell you that every administration kind of acts with a similarly hostile manner. The truth is power wants to hide problems. Power chooses to evade accountability, and that's the whole point of FOIA. I think anyone who's really in that position doesn't necessarily want to share information. And our government, especially since 9/11, has just become a secrecy-obsessed state.\n\nThinking forward, what do you think the future holds for FOIA requests?\n\nThere are all these specific areas that are going under a lot of different splits or interpretations. One of them is about whether data searching a database is the production of a new record. That's like one little spot. I think that there are a few other hot-button areas. One is like the exemption \" Glomar ,\" where an agency gives the response, \"Can't confirm or deny that the records even exist.\" Now we're seeing that Glomar is applied even in cases where Glomar can't be applied, or just the expansion of Glomar.\n\nThere was a decision that came out in 2019 that changed the test for what was confidential business information, which is exempt. And the Supreme Court changed it to be more friendly toward corporations. Previously, confidential business information was things that only would substantially hurt a corporation if disclosed-like you have an ingredient list for Coca-Cola. But the court changed it to whatever a company says is customarily or actually secret. As long as they give it a rubber stamp and say it's so, it is so. I think that area of law already has had a lot of litigation, but that'll be really interesting.\n\nTransparency has actually always been a bipartisan issue. In some ways, all administrations hate it and all administrations love it because it equally hurts both sides or helps both sides. So that's why legislation on FOIA has been able to pass over the past decade. That being said, the courts have been much more pro-corporate and pro-law enforcement in a way that I do worry will further stifle the charge of FOIA.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Why It Took Seven Years to Get One Statistic About Guns\n\nMother Jones illustration; Getty\n\nIt took seven long years to pry one staggering number from the hands of the federal government: that 52,529 weapons once owned by police were recovered at crime scenes across the country from 2006 to 2021. In that period, an average of nine cop guns were recovered each day. The public didn't know it.\n\nThis statistic was the missing piece in a yearslong reporting effort by Reveal , the Trace , and CBS News into how weapons sold by police departments were getting into the hands of criminals . Reveal first sought this information through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)-the keystone law centered on government transparency. But it wouldn't be that easy. As Reveal 's court battles demonstrate, there is resistance to such transparency.\n\nThese types of legal battles over FOIA requests are becoming more commonplace. According to a 2020 study by the FOIA Project, a Syracuse University-based research effort, media outlets filed more FOIA lawsuits to disclose government records during Donald Trump's four-year presidential term than in the 16 years spanning Barack Obama and George W. Bush's administrations.\n\nThe origins of the police weapons FOIA case date back to 2008, when Alain Stephens, then a police recruit, purchased a Glock handgun in a Texas parking lot that turned out to have come from a New Jersey police department. It got him thinking: How often do police guns end up in the hands of criminals? This question grew into a larger project once Stephens became a reporter and started the fight for this number as a fellow at Reveal . After his FOIA request was denied based on an argument that firearms trace data is confidential, the Reveal legal team sued-but it took seven years to claim victory.\n\nFive of those years were court battles that rose all the way to the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals. The case stalled further after another federal court interpreted the exemption differently and generated an opposing precedent, creating uncertainty.\n\nThe last two years were spent waiting for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to cough up that one statistic. Armed with that number-52,529 former law enforcement weapons recovered at crime scenes-teams at the Trace, CBS News, and Reveal found that many of these guns had been traded in or sold back to gun manufacturers, a cost-saving measure that has sent thousands of guns back onto the streets to be used in violent crimes.\n\nI spoke with D. Victoria Baranetsky-general counsel for the Center for Investigative Reporting (CIR), which houses Mother Jones and Reveal -about the battle over transparency on cop guns and the state of FOIA today. She's led several other FOIA lawsuits for Reveal that have forced more transparency from the federal government: The rate of worker injuries at Amazon warehouses and most other American employers is no longer confidential , and the government now has to disclose the diversity of contractors it hires . She recently filed a case against OpenAI and Microsoft for using CIR's content without permission or compensation.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and condensed.\n\nHow did this case with the ATF start?\n\nIt started with Alain [Stephens] calling me up and being like, \"Does this law say what I think it says?\"\n\nAlain was explaining to me that he was trying to get data from the ATF, but he was denied. There was this statute called the Tiahrt Amendment that did not allow for gun data to be disclosed. But there were exceptions-and the third exception under the law was for statistical aggregate data.\n\nAnd he said, \"I'm asking for just the number of guns that law enforcement have given back and put back into the marketplace.\" And I said, \"Yeah, I think that's statistical aggregate data.\"\n\nSo we sued.\n\nWhat arguments did the ATF give for withholding data about police guns used in crimes?\n\nThey were saying that that exception was not meant for reporters. It was meant for only law enforcement and other folks that were supposed to be getting access to this data, not the general public.\n\nAnd then there was a whole new issue entirely. They said that making them search for this number through their database would be the creation of a new record, and agencies are not required to create new records. They're only required to produce what they have. And so they said, \"Listen, you make us plug in this analysis and spew out a number for you, that's going to be a new record that wouldn't have existed prior, and so we're not obligated to disclose this.\"\n\nThe court shut that down immediately.\n\nThat kind of analysis would essentially destroy all kinds of data searches that governments have in their capacity today, because we're living in the modern world and databases are the way that information is held. So if you limited searching a database as the creation of a new record, you'd essentially cut off access to tons of information that the public should have the right to know.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not the only case where we have come across that argument.\n\nSo has that become a new tactic of how the government tries to restrict access to data?\n\nYes, it has worked in some locations. There's a smattering of cases across the country leaning in either direction, but there's no prevailing outcome yet as this is still being deliberated on across the country.\n\nI think there's also an even more disturbing reason for transparency today, which is more and more information is being created than ever before-and more is being collected than ever before by large corporate and government powers. There's a massive imbalance as to who has access to that data; it's all corporations and governments.\n\nThat is one of the reasons why this case was actually a huge win completely outside the realm of the ATF...this was something that would apply to all cases involving databases.\n\nWhat does a seven-year FOIA legal battle look like?\n\nA lot of emails.\n\nThis was actually the longest case I dealt with while I've been at this job. It's just stages of a lot of intense work and then waiting. So writing the brief, which takes, like, three months, and you're kind of in this tunnel vision of how to perfectly describe this argument to the court, and you submit it, you file it at midnight, and then you wait. You just wait for months and months and then get an argument date, and you prep for that for months and months. And then you wait.\n\nWhy is data transparency important for democracy?\n\nIn the United States, FOIA is actually one of the very few laws committed to transparency. And constitutionally, there are actually fewer and fewer protections for transparency.\n\nThere has been a sharp rise in the number of Exemption 3 statutes. Those are the statutes that Congress has been lobbied to pass to stop information from being disclosed under FOIA.\n\nIn fact, the Tiahrt Amendment, and the center of this case with Alain, was one of those statutes. The NRA [National Rifle Association] lobbied for that law to be passed, and I think they very intelligently did so, because I think its impact was actually huge. When you don't have access to information, the public doesn't really know what it thinks about an issue, because it can't really get to the facts of the matter. So, I think, in general, facts help people make choices that can help them then make choices about who they elect into power.\n\nBut I think there's also an even more disturbing reason for transparency today, which is more and more information is being created than ever before-and more is being collected than ever before by large corporate and government powers. There's a massive imbalance as to who has access to that data; it's all corporations and governments.

      "text": "The Supreme Court Basically Legalizes Machine Guns\n\nMother Jones; Eric Lee/POOL/CNP/ZUMA; Charles Krupa/Getty\n\nIn 2017 , it took a shooter 10 minutes to spray more than 1,000 rounds into a crowd watching a Las Vegas concert. He murdered 58 people and injured 500 more in America's deadliest mass shooting. He did this with a bump stock, an accessory that, for all intents and purposes, transforms semi-automatic rifles into machine guns. Today, the Supreme Court's GOP-appointed justices legalized bump stocks. Any gun owner can now possess this weapon of mass carnage.\n\nAfter the Las Vegas shooting, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, under President Donald Trump, and with bipartisan support , reclassified bump stocks as machine guns, which have been banned for decades. But in a 6-3 decision issued on Friday and written by Justice Clarence Thomas, the court ruled that bump stocks are not machine guns and that ATF lacks the authority to prohibit them.\n\nThe conservative justices adopt a new definition of machine gun that ignores the statute.\n\nA machine gun is defined under federal law as \"any weapon which shoots, or is designed to shoot, automatically . . . more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.\" Crucially, this includes \"any part designed and intended...for use in converting a weapon into a machinegun.\" Equipped with a bump stock, a semi-automatic rifle can fire an equivalent number of rounds as a machine gun without the shooter pulling their trigger finger multiple times. It does this by harnessing each shot's recoil to bump the trigger automatically, rather than relying on the manual pull of the shooter, discharging bullets much faster than if a shooter had to use their finger.\n\nThomas' argument, adopted by the court's other Republican appointees, is that this functionality does not meet the definition of a machine gun under federal law because the trigger mechanism is reengaged for each shot-even if not by a manual pull of the trigger. In doing so, he essentially adopts a new definition of machine gun that ignores the text of the statute, which includes components that convert a firearm-like a bump stock.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, in a dissent joined by the other two Democratic-appointed justices, notes that Thomas is creating a distinction without a difference. \"When I see a bird that walks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck,\" Sotomayor writes.\n\nThomas' opinion reads as if the majority's hands are tied-that they simply cannot square a bump stock ban with the language of the law. Justice Samuel Alito wrote a concurrence to this effect. Sotomayor finds the notion hollow, accusing her colleagues of abandoning their usual textualist approach: \"Every Member of the majority has previously emphasized that the best way to respect congressional intent is to adhere to the ordinary understanding of the terms Congress uses,\" she writes. \"Today, the majority forgets that principle and substitutes its own view of what constitutes a 'machinegun' for Congress's.\"\n\nThomas' decision argues that because ATF previously allowed bump stocks, it's about-face after the Las Vegas massacre makes the regulation suspect. It also cites a prediction made by the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) that the ATF's regulation of bump stocks would be overturned in court.\n\nBut such justifications elide the fact that the ATF reasonably interpreted the law in order to make Americans safer. Agencies may change their minds; there is no rule that once an agency decides something, it must stick to it forever. Notably, in the next few weeks, the court is likely to overrule its own longstanding practice of deferring to reasonable agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes, a principle known as Chevron Deference.\n\nThis case does not cite Chevron ; neither the majority or the dissenters argued the gun statute's language is ambiguous. But it clearly is operating in a post- Chevron world , one in which decisions about Americans' safety are determined not by Congress or the agencies, but by nine justices who don't even have a binding code of ethics.\n\nCongress tried to ban machine guns, and ATF decided after America's deadliest massacre that bump stocks created machine guns. Six Supreme Court justices just overruled them. That's not how the law or democracy are supposed to work. Civilians toting firearms with machine gun capabilities is not the makings of a healthy society-or democracy-either.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "The Supreme Court Basically Legalizes Machine Guns\n\nMother Jones; Eric Lee/POOL/CNP/ZUMA; Charles Krupa/Getty\n\nIn 2017 , it took a shooter 10 minutes to spray more than 1,000 rounds into a crowd watching a Las Vegas concert. He murdered 58 people and injured 500 more in America's deadliest mass shooting. He did this with a bump stock, an accessory that, for all intents and purposes, transforms semi-automatic rifles into machine guns. Today, the Supreme Court's GOP-appointed justices legalized bump stocks. Any gun owner can now possess this weapon of mass carnage.\n\nAfter the Las Vegas shooting, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, under President Donald Trump, and with bipartisan support , reclassified bump stocks as machine guns, which have been banned for decades. But in a 6-3 decision issued on Friday and written by Justice Clarence Thomas, the court ruled that bump stocks are not machine guns and that ATF lacks the authority to prohibit them.\n\nThe conservative justices adopt a new definition of machine gun that ignores the statute.\n\nA machine gun is defined under federal law as \"any weapon which shoots, or is designed to shoot, automatically . . . more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.\" Crucially, this includes \"any part designed and intended...for use in converting a weapon into a machinegun.\" Equipped with a bump stock, a semi-automatic rifle can fire an equivalent number of rounds as a machine gun without the shooter pulling their trigger finger multiple times. It does this by harnessing each shot's recoil to bump the trigger automatically, rather than relying on the manual pull of the shooter, discharging bullets much faster than if a shooter had to use their finger.\n\nThomas' argument, adopted by the court's other Republican appointees, is that this functionality does not meet the definition of a machine gun under federal law because the trigger mechanism is reengaged for each shot-even if not by a manual pull of the trigger. In doing so, he essentially adopts a new definition of machine gun that ignores the text of the statute, which includes components that convert a firearm-like a bump stock.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, in a dissent joined by the other two Democratic-appointed justices, notes that Thomas is creating a distinction without a difference. \"When I see a bird that walks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck,\" Sotomayor writes.\n\nThomas' opinion reads as if the majority's hands are tied-that they simply cannot square a bump stock ban with the language of the law. Justice Samuel Alito wrote a concurrence to this effect. Sotomayor finds the notion hollow, accusing her colleagues of abandoning their usual textualist approach: \"Every Member of the majority has previously emphasized that the best way to respect congressional intent is to adhere to the ordinary understanding of the terms Congress uses,\" she writes. \"Today, the majority forgets that principle and substitutes its own view of what constitutes a 'machinegun' for Congress's.\"\n\nThomas' decision argues that because ATF previously allowed bump stocks, it's about-face after the Las Vegas massacre makes the regulation suspect. It also cites a prediction made by the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) that the ATF's regulation of bump stocks would be overturned in court.\n\nBut such justifications elide the fact that the ATF reasonably interpreted the law in order to make Americans safer. Agencies may change their minds; there is no rule that once an agency decides something, it must stick to it forever. Notably, in the next few weeks, the court is likely to overrule its own longstanding practice of deferring to reasonable agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes, a principle known as Chevron Deference.\n\nThis case does not cite Chevron ; neither the majority or the dissenters argued the gun statute's language is ambiguous. But it clearly is operating in a post- Chevron world , one in which decisions about Americans' safety are determined not by Congress or the agencies, but by nine justices who don't even have a binding code of ethics.\n\nCongress tried to ban machine guns, and ATF decided after America's deadliest massacre that bump stocks created machine guns. Six Supreme Court justices just overruled them. That's not how the law or democracy are supposed to work. Civilians toting firearms with machine gun capabilities is not the makings of a healthy society-or democracy-either.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Will it work?\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nThis article is part of \"Under the Gun,\" a series on why the deadliest product on the market is also one of the least regulated.\n\nThe company behind America's first biometric \"smart gun\" - one that fires only when gripped by authorized users - will face a crucial test in the coming weeks.\n\nAfter decades of failed attempts by other manufacturers to bring a reliable smart gun to market, Biofire, a Colorado-based startup, says it's shipping its first batch of 9 mm handguns equipped with fingerprint and facial-recognition technology by the end of the month. The company's smart gun is designed to serve a very specific purpose: a weapon that can be quickly accessed to defend against a home intruder, but that can't be used by anyone unauthorized, particularly children.\n\nAs Biofire markets its gun to firearm enthusiasts and skeptics alike, the company is walking a careful line to avoid the massive blowback from the gun-rights movement that derailed previous iterations of smart guns.\n\nGun control advocates have long seen biometric technology as a game changer for reducing gun violence, and Biofire has drawn their praise by emphasizing safety and the need to prevent children from accessing guns. At the same time, the company has built ties with the gun industry and opposes any government mandates to require biometric features in guns, trying to head off fears that the technology is a Trojan horse for gun control.\n\nSo far, Biofire's approach has been received with a mix of cautious optimism, curiosity and distrust. But the most important question won't be fully answered until the gun is in people's hands: Does it really work?\n\n\"I don't want to be the first guy to find out,\" said Pierre Salomon, who runs a firearms training company in Massachusetts. \"I don't think the technology is there for me to be putting my life on the line - and my family's life on the line.\"\n\nKai Kloepfer, the company's CEO and founder, says its $1,499 gun is reliable and thoroughly tested. More than twice as expensive as a typical handgun, it isn't just a standard firearm with biomechanical sensors affixed. When an authorized user pulls the trigger, it sends an electric signal to fire the bullet, rather than rely on a physical trigger mechanism - the first gun ever designed to fire that way, the company says.\n\n\"It's just a very, very different approach and one that has involved rigorous testing and validation of every single piece of the system,\" said Kloepfer, who compares the complexity of his product to a \"small satellite.\"\n\nKloepfer began trying to develop a smart gun as a high school student who had been rattled by the 2012 Aurora, Colorado, theater shooting. He dropped out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to focus on the product, ultimately raising more than $37 million in venture capital and private funds.\n\nBiofire says its first batch of smart guns will go to investors, friends and others in the firm's inner circle this month. In the following months, Biofire's first paid customers - who number in the \"thousands,\" the company said, declining to be more specific - will be receiving their orders. Biofire said roughly a third of them are first-time gun owners.\n\nThe gun is designed to allow up to five authorized people to fire the weapon instantly upon gripping it, and to disable the trigger mechanism the moment it leaves their hand. That should help prevent unintentional shootings by children, as well as teen suicides, theft and criminal use of the weapons, Kloepfer said.\n\n\"It's unfortunately common that a kid finds a gun in a purse, or a kid finds a gun in a drawer and plays with it,\" Kloepfer said.\n\nThe biometric technology won't work if users' faces and hands are completely covered, but Biofire says that shouldn't be a problem, since it's meant to be used at home. The company's website shows the gun stored on a bookshelf behind a family watching TV and above a kitchen counter with kids nearby.\n\nThere are no federal product safety regulations for any firearms, including Biofire's gun, due to a carveout in the 1972 consumer protection law, and there are no industry standards for testing biometric weapons. Biofire's smart gun meets safety requirements for consumer electronics, as well as handgun safety standards that some states have established, the company said.\n\nKloepfer added that Biofire's fingerprint and facial-recognition sensors are designed to be far more reliable than a smartphone; people typically grip a weapon in a more consistent position that makes it easier to unlock accurately through fingerprints or facial capture. The product has undergone rigorous testing under conditions including a wide range of temperatures and sweaty palms, and has a battery that can last months on a single charge, he said.\n\nThe promise of this technology has led many safety advocates to champion the development of smart guns as a critical breakthrough for reducing gun injuries and deaths .\n\nAt a primary debate in 2019, Joe Biden declared that \"no gun should be able to be sold unless your biometric measure could pull that trigger.\" The website for his 2020 presidential campaign included a call to \"put America on the path to ensuring that 100% of firearms sold in America are smart guns,\" without specifying how that would be achieved. In a statement, the White House said Biden \"has not proposed a specific requirement for smart gun tech,\" but supports accelerating the market for smart guns.\n\nNick Suplina, senior vice president for law and policy at Everytown, a gun control advocacy group, sees Biofire as a potential step in that direction.\n\n\"This could be the beginning of everybody opting in on safer firearms,\" Suplina said. \"As Biofire enters the marketplace, there is going to be pressure on other manufacturers to create similar products.\"\n\nLeading gun-rights advocates have not embraced Biofire's smart gun with the same enthusiasm. Instead, they have stressed that they do not oppose smart gun technology itself, but rather any government plan to use it as a means to control which types of guns can be sold.\n\nSome have also raised the concern that smart guns could be disabled remotely, including by the government. Biofire says remote access to its gun is not possible.\n\nAidan Johnston, director of federal affairs for Gun Owners of America, a gun rights group, said these and other concerns will lead a lot of gun owners to be \"extremely skeptical\" about smart guns. \"What these so-called smart guns do is lock your firearm so it's inaccessible in certain situations when you're going to want it - like a life-or-death situation,\" he said.\n\nGun-rights activists helped shut down the last major attempt to sell a smart gun in the U.S. in 2014, when a German company called Armatix introduced a gun equipped with radio-frequency technology that used a specialized wristband to authorize users. The NRA and others tested the weapon and criticized it for technical flaws including misfires and unlocking without authorization; Armatix denied that there were any problems. After a Maryland gun store announced that it would stock the product, the store's owner faced protests and death threats .\n\nThe backlash was linked, in part, to a New Jersey law that required all of the state's gun dealers to switch their entire handgun inventory to smart guns after they became commercially available anywhere in the U.S. Retailers scrapped their plans to sell the Armatix weapon, which never became available for sale in U.S. gun stores, and the company later filed for bankruptcy.\n\nNew Jersey eliminated its requirement for smart-gun-only inventories in 2019, after state lawmakers acknowledged the effort had unintentionally backfired . The state replaced it with a new requirement for all dealers to stock smart guns as an option for customers when they become available.\n\nBiofire has gone out of its way to avoid Armatix's fate, joining with every major gun-rights group in opposing New Jersey's new requirement, arguing that the choice should be up to individual retailers. The company has not submitted paperwork for its product to be evaluated by the state, as Biofire doesn't want New Jersey gun shops to be required to sell its weapon. For now, all sales go through Biofire's website.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether there's a broad market for Biofire's product - or any smart gun. Kloepfer believes there's a large appetite for a \"home defense handgun\" and wants to provide more affordable offerings over time.\n\nWhile noting Biofire's steep price tag, KiOwana Phillips, an active-duty Army sergeant major who also runs a firearms training business in North Carolina, said she can see the appeal of biometric security features to help protect her 10-year-old at home. The Biofire gun could be more immediately accessible for emergencies while remaining secure, she said, compared to her traditional gun safe and cable locks that would take more time to open.\n\n\"I would like to know - and test it for myself to see if it actually works,\" Phillips said. \"I would personally like to try it.\"\n\nI am a national reporter for NBC News based in Washington, D.C., covering federal agencies and the impact of policy on ordinary people.

Challengers to the regulation, including gun rights groups and companies, claimed the government action exceeded the authority of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\n\nThe regulation didn't seek to ban ghost guns but rather to regulate them like regular firearms, meaning that they need serial numbers, licensed dealers and background checks.\n\nAnd though it's a gun-related case, it didn't call for interpreting the Second Amendment.\n\nExplaining the issue, Gorsuch noted that the federal Gun Control Act regulates firearms sales, and this case posed the question of whether the act also applies to people who make and sell the kits at issue. In reaching the majority ruling, the Trump appointee wrote that the relevant ATF rule isn't \"facially inconsistent\" with the act.\n\nThree of the justices who joined Gorsuch's opinion - Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Brett Kavanaugh and Ketanji Brown Jackson - each wrote concurring opinions. Alito and Thomas each wrote their own dissents, with Thomas writing that the majority \"blesses the Government's overreach based on a series of errors regarding both the standard of review and the interpretation of the statute.\"\n\nDuring an earlier phase of the litigation, the court split 5-4 in allowing the regulation pending a final resolution, with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett in the majority alongside the court's three Democratic appointees, over the dissent of the remaining four Republican appointees.\n\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in Donald Trump's legal cases.\n\nJordan Rubin is the Deadline: Legal Blog writer.

The court pointed to the Militia Act of 1792 as evidence for its reasoning.\n\n\"Ultimately, the text of the Second Amendment includes eighteen-to-twenty-year-old individuals among 'the people' whose right to keep and bear arms is protected,\" the judges wrote. \"The federal government has presented scant evidence that eighteen-to-twenty-year-olds' firearm rights during the founding-era were restricted in a similar manner to the contemporary federal handgun purchase ban, and its 19th century evidence 'cannot provide much insight into the meaning of the Second Amendment when it contradicts earlier evidence.'\"\n\nThe ruling does not mean that licensed firearms dealers can now begin selling handguns to those in the age range at issue. The court did not issue a temporary injunction on the ban, instead punting the case back to a lower court for consideration. But its decision means it's more likely that the issue of older teenagers buying handguns will make its way to the Supreme Court .\n\nFirearm deaths are the leading cause of death for those between ages 18-25, according to KFF , a nonprofit that focuses on health policy. Federal law currently restricts handgun purchases from a licensed seller to those 21 and older, and long gun purchases to those 18 and older, according to gun safety advocacy group Everytown For Gun Safety . But 18-year-olds can buy handguns from unlicensed dealers, and there is no age limit on such purchases for long guns.\n\nClarissa-Jan Lim is a breaking/trending news blogger for MSNBC Digital.

But what about the area outside the arena?\n\nThe inner perimeter will have similar gun restrictions, though as my MSNBC colleague Clarissa-Jan Lim noted last month , \"Open and concealed carry will be permitted up to within a few blocks of the event space, per Wisconsin state law.\"\n\nIn the wake of the attempted assassination targeting Donald Trump on Saturday, Wisconsin's governor believes it's time to change that policy. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported :\n\nWisconsin Gov. Tony Evers has requested that the decision to allow firearms within the soft perimeter of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee be reconsidered \"immediately\" following the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, a source with knowledge of the discussion shared with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. The request was made to the U.S. Secret Service, which would relay the governor's concerns to the Republican National Committee, the source said.\n\nIn theory, the Democratic governor's request seems entirely sensible. In practice, it's unlikely to go anywhere.\n\nAs the local report added, \"The power to ban firearms in the security 'footprint' outside the credentials-only 'hard' security zone seems to rest with the state, not the Secret Service, the RNC or the City of Milwaukee.\"\n\nA New York Times report noted that some local officials tried to change the policy months ago - long before a gunman targeted the former president - pushing a city ordinance that would've banned firearms near the convention site. It failed.\n\nAs the Times' article noted, \" The city is prevented from regulating firearms beyond state law, officials said.\"\n\nWhat we're left with is a situation in which the Secret Service doesn't have the authority to expand the existing security footprint. The governor can't do it, either. Neither can Republican National Committee organizers. Even local officials can't act, despite wanting to.\n\nUnder Wisconsin's current state law, local communities can't approve gun policies that go further than state law - and since state law allows open and concealed carry, Milwaukee's hands are tied.\n\nIdeally, the Republicans' gerrymandered majority in the state legislature could've taken steps along these lines, but there wasn't any such appetite among GOP lawmakers.\n\nThat said, it'd be an overstatement to suggest that the area outside the venue will have zero restrictions. The Journal Sentinel reported in May : \"Those looking to cross into the area immediately outside the Republican National Convention perimeter will likely have to leave behind non-plastic containers, tennis balls and other typically innocuous items. What won't be prohibited: Guns.\"\n\nAlderman Robert Bauman told the newspaper at the time, \"I find that totally absurd. Literally, you can't have tennis balls, but you can have an AR-15 assault rifle.\"\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

The guns were used in 368 shooting cases, which are harder to investigate because unlicensed dealers aren't required to keep records of their sales that could allow federal agents to trace the weapon back to the original buyer, said ATF Director Steve Dettelbach.\n\nThe report ordered by Attorney General Merrick Garland is the first in-depth analysis of firearm trafficking investigations in more than 20 years. It examined more than 9,700 closed ATF firearm trafficking investigations that began between 2017 and 2021. Firearms trafficking is when guns are purposely moved into the illegal market for a criminal purpose or possession.\n\nThe second-highest share of firearm-trafficking cases investigated by ATF was straw purchases, when someone buys a gun for a person who can't get it legally themselves.\n\nThe report also shows that the recipients of trafficked firearms were people who had previously been convicted of a felony in almost 60 percent of the cases in which investigators were able to identify the background of the recipient. Furthermore, trafficked firearms were used to commit additional crimes in almost 25 percent of the cases, Dettelbach said. That includes more than 260 murders and more than 220 attempted murders, according to the report.\n\n\"The data shows, therefore, that those who illegally traffic firearms whether its out of a trunk, at a gun show or online are responsible for real violence in this nation,\" Dettelbach said. \"In short, you can't illegally help to arm violent people and not be responsible for the violence that follows,\" he said.\n\nThe report found the average number of guns trafficked per case was 16. People who got them through unlicensed dealers bought 20 weapons on average, compared to 11 guns for straw buyers, according to the report.\n\nThe Biden administration has separately proposed a rule that would require thousands more gun sellers to get licensed and run background checks. The Justice Department says it's aimed at sellers who are in the business of firearm sales, but the proposal quickly drew protest from gun-rights groups who contend it could ensnare regular people who sometimes sell their own guns.\n\nThe rule, which has not yet been finalized, is estimated to affect 24,500 to 328,000 sellers. During the five years documented in the report, 3,400 unlicensed dealers were investigated by the ATF.\n\nThe Associated Press\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Activate your online access\n\nTrump is currently prohibited from buying guns because he's under criminal indictment. But two big court cases could change that.\n\nDonald Trump poses for a picture at a South Carolina gun store.\n\nWhile making a campaign stop at a South Carolina gun store on Monday, former president Donald Trump, who is currently facing 91 federal and state indictments, apparently bought a Glock handgun with his face emblazoned on it.\n\nI say \"apparently\" because video of him at the store only shows Trump making an offhand inquiry about buying the gun. Adding to the confusion, while the video was initially posted by Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung with the caption \"President Trump purchases a @GlockINC in South Carolina!\" Cheung later deleted his tweet and the campaign told reporters that no gun had actually been bought.\n\nFrom a political perspective, one can see why Trump's team would want to suggest that Trump is packing, regardless of whether or not he actually bought the gaudy hand-cannon (or whether the campaign is telling journalists he didn't, since the MAGA mob never believes journalists anyway). But I'm skeptical that Trump bought the gun because... he can't. Trump is under numerous federal indictments, and current federal law prohibits such individuals from purchasing firearms.\n\nHowever, that law is under direct attack by Republican judges through the federal judiciary, and the conservative legal-industrial complex. Trump can't buy a gun today without catching (yet another) criminal indictment, but if he waits until next June, he, and every indicted person in the country, might well have an opportunity to arm themselves for whatever reasons they deem fit.\n\nThe case that puts this prohibition into question is called US v. Quiroz . The defendant in the case, Jose Gomez Quiroz, purchased an M1911 .22 caliber semiautomatic handgun while he was under federal indictment for burglary. He was convicted for the illegal purchase but challenged the verdict, saying that it violated his Second Amendment rights. US District Judge David Counts, a Trump appointee, ruled in favor of Quiroz. Counts said that in light of the Supreme Court's decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen (which ruled that even gun registration was a violation of the Second Amendment), the federal government no longer had the authority to restrict gun sales to those under indictment.\n\nThe Quiroz case is up for appeal at the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the most rabidly conservative court in the country. The Fifth Circuit could easily uphold Counts's ruling. If it does, that case will almost certainly be appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\nBut Trump likely won't even have to wait that long if he desperately wants to get his tiny hands on a compensation device. That's because the Supreme Court is already scheduled to hear a separate case called US v. Rahimi , on November 7 of this year. That case is slightly different from the Quiroz case. There, the defendant, Zachary Rahimi, was under a restraining order for domestic abuse. Federal law also prohibits people under restraining orders from buying guns. Rahimi challenged the law, again under the Second Amendment. The Fifth Circuit ruled in his favor, and now the Supreme Court will weigh in.\n\nThe progressive in me is contractually obligated to tell you that Quiroz-and, if he wants to test these laws, Donald Trump-has a stronger case than Rahimi. A restraining order is not a mere accusation: It is a ruling issued by a judge and comes with all the due process rights associated with a legal adjudication. In contrast, an indictment is just a charge. I could argue that people shouldn't have fundamental rights taken away from them based on a mere accusation from the government.\n\nOf course, when I think of \"fundamental rights,\" I think of the right to vote and participate in democracy. I don't think of the right to murder people who are bothering you as one of our most critical rights, and I do not think that the Constitution is a murder-suicide pact. Keeping guns out of the hands of felons or potential felons is a wise and safe policy goal that would be easy to achieve in a less violent country than ours. But I'm not a Republican. For conservatives, the Constitution consists of the sacrosanct Second Amendment and then a bunch of suggestions.\n\nThe Supreme Court could well uphold Rahimi's right to bear arms to menace his ex-girlfriends. And if the court rules for him in a sweeping fashion, it will likely do so in a way that benefits Quiroz as well. The next phase of the conservative plan to turn America into a post-apocalyptic hellscape seems to be to rearm anybody who has had their guns taken away because of their actions or crimes.\n\nThe upshot is this: If Trump did buy a gun in South Carolina, it's just another crime he will likely get away with.

Activate your online access\n\nTrump is currently prohibited from buying guns because he's under criminal indictment. But two big court cases could change that.\n\nDonald Trump poses for a picture at a South Carolina gun store.\n\nWhile making a campaign stop at a South Carolina gun store on Monday, former president Donald Trump, who is currently facing 91 federal and state indictments, apparently bought a Glock handgun with his face emblazoned on it.\n\nI say \"apparently\" because video of him at the store only shows Trump making an offhand inquiry about buying the gun. Adding to the confusion, while the video was initially posted by Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung with the caption \"President Trump purchases a @GlockINC in South Carolina!\" Cheung later deleted his tweet and the campaign told reporters that no gun had actually been bought.\n\nFrom a political perspective, one can see why Trump's team would want to suggest that Trump is packing, regardless of whether or not he actually bought the gaudy hand-cannon (or whether the campaign is telling journalists he didn't, since the MAGA mob never believes journalists anyway). But I'm skeptical that Trump bought the gun because... he can't. Trump is under numerous federal indictments, and current federal law prohibits such individuals from purchasing firearms.\n\nHowever, that law is under direct attack by Republican judges through the federal judiciary, and the conservative legal-industrial complex. Trump can't buy a gun today without catching (yet another) criminal indictment, but if he waits until next June, he, and every indicted person in the country, might well have an opportunity to arm themselves for whatever reasons they deem fit.\n\nThe case that puts this prohibition into question is called US v. Quiroz . The defendant in the case, Jose Gomez Quiroz, purchased an M1911 .22 caliber semiautomatic handgun while he was under federal indictment for burglary. He was convicted for the illegal purchase but challenged the verdict, saying that it violated his Second Amendment rights. US District Judge David Counts, a Trump appointee, ruled in favor of Quiroz. Counts said that in light of the Supreme Court's decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen (which ruled that even gun registration was a violation of the Second Amendment), the federal government no longer had the authority to restrict gun sales to those under indictment.\n\nThe Quiroz case is up for appeal at the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the most rabidly conservative court in the country. The Fifth Circuit could easily uphold Counts's ruling. If it does, that case will almost certainly be appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\nBut Trump likely won't even have to wait that long if he desperately wants to get his tiny hands on a compensation device. That's because the Supreme Court is already scheduled to hear a separate case called US v. Rahimi , on November 7 of this year. That case is slightly different from the Quiroz case. There, the defendant, Zachary Rahimi, was under a restraining order for domestic abuse. Federal law also prohibits people under restraining orders from buying guns. Rahimi challenged the law, again under the Second Amendment. The Fifth Circuit ruled in his favor, and now the Supreme Court will weigh in.\n\nThe progressive in me is contractually obligated to tell you that Quiroz-and, if he wants to test these laws, Donald Trump-has a stronger case than Rahimi. A restraining order is not a mere accusation: It is a ruling issued by a judge and comes with all the due process rights associated with a legal adjudication. In contrast, an indictment is just a charge. I could argue that people shouldn't have fundamental rights taken away from them based on a mere accusation from the government.\n\nOf course, when I think of \"fundamental rights,\" I think of the right to vote and participate in democracy. I don't think of the right to murder people who are bothering you as one of our most critical rights, and I do not think that the Constitution is a murder-suicide pact. Keeping guns out of the hands of felons or potential felons is a wise and safe policy goal that would be easy to achieve in a less violent country than ours. But I'm not a Republican. For conservatives, the Constitution consists of the sacrosanct Second Amendment and then a bunch of suggestions.\n\nThe Supreme Court could well uphold Rahimi's right to bear arms to menace his ex-girlfriends. And if the court rules for him in a sweeping fashion, it will likely do so in a way that benefits Quiroz as well. The next phase of the conservative plan to turn America into a post-apocalyptic hellscape seems to be to rearm anybody who has had their guns taken away because of their actions or crimes.\n\nThe upshot is this: If Trump did buy a gun in South Carolina, it's just another crime he will likely get away with. I guess I would encourage people to wear bulletproof vests on Fifth Avenue next summer, because the Supreme Court could soon make it a whole lot easier for Trump to test out his theories about whom he can shoot without consequences.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

You can read our Privacy Policy here.\n\nIn the aftermath of mass shootings, a now familiar pattern emerges: tragedy, accusations, pledges to do better, and eventual silence. Laudable desires to enact effective gun control tend to lie at the center of these fleeting public discussions. With some 250-350 million guns in circulation , firearms regulation is an issue of mammoth proportions, and it should be debated. But, unfortunately, attempts to identify the factors that lead to gun violence often take on a stigmatizing and inaccurate bent. That was exemplified by the president's comment that the man who killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, in February was \" mentally disturbed .\" Later, he suggested that the lack of \" mental hospitals \" was to blame for the incident, and even suggested incarcerating innocent people in mental-health facilities because \"he hasn't committed the crime, but he may very well.\" Meanwhile, NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch suggested \" crazy \" people should be barred from gun ownership at a CNN town-hall meeting on Wednesday, while Wayne LaPierre told a packed house at CPAC that the \" failure of the mental health system \" is to blame for gun violence. With sentiments like these, it's easy to see why \"not guilty by reason of insanity\" can still result in a lifetime of incarceration . The president, like much of the rest of the country, is having the wrong conversation about mental health, guns, and violence. There's a popular myth that mass shootings are the work of \"madmen,\" and that keeping guns out of the hands of mentally ill people via discriminatory policy decisions will resolve the ongoing epidemic of gun violence in the United States. This misconception persists despite the fact that it's blatantly inaccurate: Mass shootings account for less than 1 percent of gun deaths in the United States (by the FBI's definition of four or more deaths in one incident). Moreover, a 2015 analysis of 235 mass murders, including shootings, found just 46 mentally ill perpetrators ; factors like \"rage,\" \"hostility,\" and being \"disgruntled\" were more common than mental-health conditions. Mentally ill people are not inherently more violent than anybody else. Issues like substance abuse and situational factors can increase violent behavior , but the same is true of people without mental-health conditions. Evidence suggests mentally ill people are actually less likely to kill someone with a firearm , overall, than their sane counterparts. Related Article Out of Bloodshed, Hope for Gun Control Gary Younge But when they do, they're usually killing themselves . This cuts to the crux of the problem with the way we talk about guns and mental health: Rather than taking on the very real and horrific toll of suicide in the United States, pundits and members of the public focus on the very tiny fraction of mentally ill people who commit heinous crimes and extrapolate wild conclusions . According to the Brady Campaign , approximately two-thirds of gun fatalities in the United States are suicides-that's 50 people every day dying by gun, accounting for half of all suicides. Suicide, commonly an act of extreme desperation, is highly impulsive in nature; people make decisions about suicide in less than an hour . And of those who attempt suicide and survive, only around 10 percent try again and succeed. The ready availability of an extremely lethal device is a recipe for disaster for people in crisis: Guns account for a small fraction of methods used to attempt suicide, but they are the most successful.

There's evidence to support this : Efforts like changing the formulation of domestic gas, adding suicide barriers at popular jumping sites, and regulating poisons have resulted in reductions in suicide. When a method isn't available, it gives suicidal people time to stop, think, and seek help. Current Issue View our current issue If the United States is deeply worried about gun deaths-and it should be-identifying an easy point of intervention should be highly appealing. Yet suicide rarely comes up in conversations about gun violence. A few simple measures would save lives, without stigmatizing mental illness or creating discriminatory legislation that might violate privacy, civil rights, and the autonomy of the mentally ill community. There's no reason for suicide to be the 10th leading cause of death in the United States overall, and the second for people aged 10-34. Background checks should keep guns out of the hands of people with a history of violence who clearly shouldn't be owning them-as for example in the case of the man who gunned down 26 people in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in November 2017. A mental-health condition alone isn't sufficient cause to blacklist someone. Neither is relying on a representative payee for Social Security . This program appoints people to manage finances for Social Security beneficiaries who can't handle them on their own, and applies primarily to people with significant cognitive, intellectual, and developmental disabilities, not mentally ill people. Yet it was namechecked in Obama-era regulations that the GOP voted to roll back in 2017 , leading to widespread outcry that Republicans were handing guns to \" people too mentally ill to cash a check .\" That said, self-exclusion is certainly an option for people who worry that they can't handle weapons responsibly. Research in 2016 found that many mentally ill people would be interested in the opportunity to add themselves to a \" do not sell \" list, fearing they might try to buy a gun in a moment of desperation and use it to commit suicide. Of 200 survey respondents receiving inpatient or outpatient psychiatric care, 46 percent said they'd like to be able to add their name to such a list, voluntarily flagging themselves so they'd fail a background check. Requiring people to secure their firearms could also make a huge difference. Yet there's no federal gun-storage or -locking law, leaving this issue up to the states. Proper storage keeps children from playing with guns-Everytown for Gun Safety identified nearly 300 \" accidents \" involving minors in 2017-but it can also prevent an impulsive decision on the part of someone who lives in a home with guns. Waiting periods could be another powerful tool for reducing the availability of firearms for use in homicides as well as for people in crisis, as evidenced by a 2017 study that explored 45 years of data across 16 states and the District of Columbia. The researchers found drops in both homicide and suicide rates in states with waiting periods. To the dismay of gun proponents, the Supreme Court just refused to hear a challenge to California's 10-day waiting period. There are few, if any, settings in which someone needs to obtain a gun instantaneously. Enacting a waiting period might create a brief inconvenience for someone purchasing a gun for a legitimate purpose, like hunting, but it could also save a life: A suicidal person should not be able to walk into a gun shop, buy a weapon, and leave. Some states are already exploring experimental programs to get suicide-prevention training and materials into gun shops and ranges, creating another point of intervention, but blocking instant purchases could be highly effective. It's undeniable that the United States needs to take meaningful steps to prevent gun deaths. Rampage killings capture the bulk of the attention, but the use of guns in intimate-partner violence, unrelated homicides, and suicides should be cause for grave concern. While Congress continues to limit the ability of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to research gun violence thanks to the Dickey Amendment, there is enough information from other sources to understand that the guns/mental health narrative advanced in the media in the wake of mass shootings is wrong , stigmatizing , and ultimately unhelpful . To meaningfully address gun violence, we need to reduce the number of weapons in circulation overall , and cut down on weapons sales to people likely to harm themselves or others. The trinity of universal background checks backed by better databases, waiting periods, and gun-storage laws could radically reduce gun violence in the United States. These are basic lifesaving measures akin to requiring people to wear seatbelts, and they're not dependent on broadly stigmatizing 20 percent of the population. Rather than demonizing mentally ill people for mass shootings, the United States should be talking about the real risk with guns and mental health: That it's too easy for suicidal people to obtain guns to shoot themselves, leading to nearly 22,00 preventable deaths every year. Until the conversation about gun violence can be reframed onto actual, rather than mythological, risks, needless gun deaths will continue.\n\nThe president, like much of the rest of the country, is having the wrong conversation about mental health, guns, and violence.

Enacting a waiting period might create a brief inconvenience for someone purchasing a gun for a legitimate purpose, like hunting, but it could also save a life: A suicidal person should not be able to walk into a gun shop, buy a weapon, and leave. Some states are already exploring experimental programs to get suicide-prevention training and materials into gun shops and ranges, creating another point of intervention, but blocking instant purchases could be highly effective. It's undeniable that the United States needs to take meaningful steps to prevent gun deaths. Rampage killings capture the bulk of the attention, but the use of guns in intimate-partner violence, unrelated homicides, and suicides should be cause for grave concern. While Congress continues to limit the ability of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to research gun violence thanks to the Dickey Amendment, there is enough information from other sources to understand that the guns/mental health narrative advanced in the media in the wake of mass shootings is wrong , stigmatizing , and ultimately unhelpful . To meaningfully address gun violence, we need to reduce the number of weapons in circulation overall , and cut down on weapons sales to people likely to harm themselves or others. The trinity of universal background checks backed by better databases, waiting periods, and gun-storage laws could radically reduce gun violence in the United States. These are basic lifesaving measures akin to requiring people to wear seatbelts, and they're not dependent on broadly stigmatizing 20 percent of the population. Rather than demonizing mentally ill people for mass shootings, the United States should be talking about the real risk with guns and mental health: That it's too easy for suicidal people to obtain guns to shoot themselves, leading to nearly 22,00 preventable deaths every year. Until the conversation about gun violence can be reframed onto actual, rather than mythological, risks, needless gun deaths will continue.\n\nThere's a popular myth that mass shootings are the work of \"madmen,\" and that keeping guns out of the hands of mentally ill people via discriminatory policy decisions will resolve the ongoing epidemic of gun violence in the United States. This misconception persists despite the fact that it's blatantly inaccurate: Mass shootings account for less than 1 percent of gun deaths in the United States (by the FBI's definition of four or more deaths in one incident). Moreover, a 2015 analysis of 235 mass murders, including shootings, found just 46 mentally ill perpetrators ; factors like \"rage,\" \"hostility,\" and being \"disgruntled\" were more common than mental-health conditions. Mentally ill people are not inherently more violent than anybody else. Issues like substance abuse and situational factors can increase violent behavior , but the same is true of people without mental-health conditions. Evidence suggests mentally ill people are actually less likely to kill someone with a firearm , overall, than their sane counterparts. Related Article Out of Bloodshed, Hope for Gun Control Gary Younge But when they do, they're usually killing themselves . This cuts to the crux of the problem with the way we talk about guns and mental health: Rather than taking on the very real and horrific toll of suicide in the United States, pundits and members of the public focus on the very tiny fraction of mentally ill people who commit heinous crimes and extrapolate wild conclusions . According to the Brady Campaign , approximately two-thirds of gun fatalities in the United States are suicides-that's 50 people every day dying by gun, accounting for half of all suicides. Suicide, commonly an act of extreme desperation, is highly impulsive in nature; people make decisions about suicide in less than an hour . And of those who attempt suicide and survive, only around 10 percent try again and succeed. The ready availability of an extremely lethal device is a recipe for disaster for people in crisis: Guns account for a small fraction of methods used to attempt suicide, but they are the most successful.

Yet suicide rarely comes up in conversations about gun violence. A few simple measures would save lives, without stigmatizing mental illness or creating discriminatory legislation that might violate privacy, civil rights, and the autonomy of the mentally ill community. There's no reason for suicide to be the 10th leading cause of death in the United States overall, and the second for people aged 10-34. Background checks should keep guns out of the hands of people with a history of violence who clearly shouldn't be owning them-as for example in the case of the man who gunned down 26 people in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in November 2017. A mental-health condition alone isn't sufficient cause to blacklist someone. Neither is relying on a representative payee for Social Security . This program appoints people to manage finances for Social Security beneficiaries who can't handle them on their own, and applies primarily to people with significant cognitive, intellectual, and developmental disabilities, not mentally ill people. Yet it was namechecked in Obama-era regulations that the GOP voted to roll back in 2017 , leading to widespread outcry that Republicans were handing guns to \" people too mentally ill to cash a check .\" That said, self-exclusion is certainly an option for people who worry that they can't handle weapons responsibly. Research in 2016 found that many mentally ill people would be interested in the opportunity to add themselves to a \" do not sell \" list, fearing they might try to buy a gun in a moment of desperation and use it to commit suicide. Of 200 survey respondents receiving inpatient or outpatient psychiatric care, 46 percent said they'd like to be able to add their name to such a list, voluntarily flagging themselves so they'd fail a background check. Requiring people to secure their firearms could also make a huge difference. Yet there's no federal gun-storage or -locking law, leaving this issue up to the states. Proper storage keeps children from playing with guns-Everytown for Gun Safety identified nearly 300 \" accidents \" involving minors in 2017-but it can also prevent an impulsive decision on the part of someone who lives in a home with guns. Waiting periods could be another powerful tool for reducing the availability of firearms for use in homicides as well as for people in crisis, as evidenced by a 2017 study that explored 45 years of data across 16 states and the District of Columbia.

Until the conversation about gun violence can be reframed onto actual, rather than mythological, risks, needless gun deaths will continue.\n\nIf the United States is deeply worried about gun deaths-and it should be-identifying an easy point of intervention should be highly appealing. Yet suicide rarely comes up in conversations about gun violence. A few simple measures would save lives, without stigmatizing mental illness or creating discriminatory legislation that might violate privacy, civil rights, and the autonomy of the mentally ill community. There's no reason for suicide to be the 10th leading cause of death in the United States overall, and the second for people aged 10-34. Background checks should keep guns out of the hands of people with a history of violence who clearly shouldn't be owning them-as for example in the case of the man who gunned down 26 people in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in November 2017. A mental-health condition alone isn't sufficient cause to blacklist someone. Neither is relying on a representative payee for Social Security . This program appoints people to manage finances for Social Security beneficiaries who can't handle them on their own, and applies primarily to people with significant cognitive, intellectual, and developmental disabilities, not mentally ill people. Yet it was namechecked in Obama-era regulations that the GOP voted to roll back in 2017 , leading to widespread outcry that Republicans were handing guns to \" people too mentally ill to cash a check .\" That said, self-exclusion is certainly an option for people who worry that they can't handle weapons responsibly. Research in 2016 found that many mentally ill people would be interested in the opportunity to add themselves to a \" do not sell \" list, fearing they might try to buy a gun in a moment of desperation and use it to commit suicide. Of 200 survey respondents receiving inpatient or outpatient psychiatric care, 46 percent said they'd like to be able to add their name to such a list, voluntarily flagging themselves so they'd fail a background check. Requiring people to secure their firearms could also make a huge difference. Yet there's no federal gun-storage or -locking law, leaving this issue up to the states. Proper storage keeps children from playing with guns-Everytown for Gun Safety identified nearly 300 \" accidents \" involving minors in 2017-but it can also prevent an impulsive decision on the part of someone who lives in a home with guns. Waiting periods could be another powerful tool for reducing the availability of firearms for use in homicides as well as for people in crisis, as evidenced by a 2017 study that explored 45 years of data across 16 states and the District of Columbia. The researchers found drops in both homicide and suicide rates in states with waiting periods. To the dismay of gun proponents, the Supreme Court just refused to hear a challenge to California's 10-day waiting period. There are few, if any, settings in which someone needs to obtain a gun instantaneously. Enacting a waiting period might create a brief inconvenience for someone purchasing a gun for a legitimate purpose, like hunting, but it could also save a life: A suicidal person should not be able to walk into a gun shop, buy a weapon, and leave. Some states are already exploring experimental programs to get suicide-prevention training and materials into gun shops and ranges, creating another point of intervention, but blocking instant purchases could be highly effective. It's undeniable that the United States needs to take meaningful steps to prevent gun deaths. Rampage killings capture the bulk of the attention, but the use of guns in intimate-partner violence, unrelated homicides, and suicides should be cause for grave concern. While Congress continues to limit the ability of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to research gun violence thanks to the Dickey Amendment, there is enough information from other sources to understand that the guns/mental health narrative advanced in the media in the wake of mass shootings is wrong , stigmatizing , and ultimately unhelpful . To meaningfully address gun violence, we need to reduce the number of weapons in circulation overall , and cut down on weapons sales to people likely to harm themselves or others. The trinity of universal background checks backed by better databases, waiting periods, and gun-storage laws could radically reduce gun violence in the United States.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

We are the only wealthy country in the world that refuses to protect ourselves or our children from gun violence, and the year of pandemic-induced isolation did not make us any less barbaric. In the wake of two high-profile mass shootings in a week-and numerous other instances of gun violence that didn't even make the evening news-all of the typical arguments are back on the table. As usual, Democrats promise to advance overwhelmingly popular if tepid gun regulations. As usual, Republicans promise to obstruct those efforts. As usual, many more Americans will die while Joe Manchin tries to figure out which gun loopholes must be kept open to preserve the right of his constituents to kill each other with minimal hassle. The debate about what to do in the wake of these mass shootings seems more pointless to me than usual, and not just because I'm desensitized to mass death or cynical about political compromise (though I am those things, as I must be, as I watch numerous politicians shrug off half a million deaths while rushing to reopen the beaches for spring break). The debate is pointless because, regardless of the outcome in Congress, the conservative-controlled Supreme Court will not allow us to have commonsense gun regulation, let alone any ambitious, progressive legislation to get guns off the streets, like they do in other countries that don't have mass shootings every other day. Democrats (and Americans who don't want to be shot to death) lost the gun battle when Mitch McConnell stole a seat on the court in 2016. They lost the war when Ruth Bader Ginsburg, may her memory be a blessing, didn't live until January 20, 2021. There is no new gun regulation or reform that can survive six bloodthirsty conservatives on the Supreme Court, just like there is no way to \"win\" a game of Russian roulette when there are six bullets in the revolver. In fact, far from upholding whatever newly passed law that's ineffectual enough to survive a filibuster (you know, the same filibuster Democrats refuse to kill), the Supreme Court is poised to go in the other direction and dismantle what gun regulations we already have. This Friday, the justices will meet to decide whether to take a case called New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v. Corlett . It's a test case brought by ammosexuals, argued by former George W. Bush solicitor general and Republican super lawyer Paul Clement, that is designed to create a brand new constitutional right to carry firearms outside the home, whenever a person wants to.

In Texas, you can walk around packing like Rambo to overcompensate for... not packing like Rambo, no questions asked, no permit required. In California, not so much. There is a lot of inconsistency between the different states on this issue. For instance, in New York you can carry \"long guns\" outside without a permit but not \"handguns.\" In New Jersey, it's just the opposite: There you can carry handguns but not long guns without a permit. Conservatives want the Supreme Court to resolve part of this conflict in laws by getting rid of the permitting process for handguns (or liberalizing them to the point where functionally anybody can get a permit), effectively inventing a new unequivocal right to bear these weapons outside the home. That's different from the last gun right they invented in 2008: the right to bear arms for self-defense . The astute reader will remember that the original constitutional right was merely to bear arms to form militias and kill Black people who didn't want to be held in bondage. A new carrying right might not seem like a huge change in the already homicidal, conservative interpretation of the Second Amendment. But consider the specifics of the case: New York, like a number of states, has a permitting process through which people who can demonstrate a \"proper cause\" can get a license to carry their hand cannons outside their homes. What's at issue in this case are people who were denied a permit because they couldn't show the state licensing board a good reason to need their guns all the time. Restricting gun access to those who can show \"cause\" is the linchpin of every gun regulation. It's the reason background checks are constitutional: Our society thinks there are some people who should be allowed to have guns, and others who should not. But conservatives are trying to undermine the very theory on which any gun can be restricted for any person, at any time. I shouldn't have to explain why that's dangerous. I don't know how many people have to die before conservatives realize their legal theories are killing us. But I know the answer to that equation is always \"more.\" Conservatives always demand that more blood be sacrificed to their pet theories. And the ones on the Supreme Court will demand more here. It only takes four justices to grant certiorari and force the court to take up a case. Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch are locks to want to invent this right. Alleged attempted rapist Brett Kavanaugh asked for a gun case last year, when he was complaining that another case brought by the New York State Rifle & Pistol Association (this one trying to overturn New York's restrictions on gun transportation ) was dismissed because New York changed its laws to avoid a bad Supreme Court ruling. More from Mystal The Massacre in Atlanta Was As Predictable as White Supremacy Elie Mystal It's Time to Repeal-and Replace-the Second Amendment Elie Mystal So that gets us to certiorari. After that, once the case is heard, conservatives only need one more vote to turn the whole country into a crossfire. Enter Amy Coney Barrett, the justice confirmed after the presidential election had already started. Based on her previous cases, Barrett appears to have an expansive view of gun rights . In one case she heard in 2019, while still a circuit court judge, she wrote (in dissent) that \"virtue based restrictions\" could not be placed on gun rights. Thus she determined that people with felony convictions could not be denied gun rights (though she was open to the possibility of denying them voting rights, because of course conservatives think it should be easier to kill than to vote). It's the kind of dissent that pleases pissed-off ex-boyfriends everywhere. It's likely that New York's requirement that people have a better reason than \"nighttime is scary without my 9mm woobie\" is too much of a restriction for a judge like Barrett. Any restriction is likely too much regulation for Barrett and her four new ammosexual friends. That's the problem with the political and social debate that will follow whatever mass shooting has happened by the time you read this. We can't have \"common sense gun safety\" if we don't have judges willing to apply common sense. Democrats are always bringing the proverbial \"knife to a gunfight\" on this issue. Gun reform is no longer merely a question of legislation or even popular will. It's a question of constitutional law. As long as conservatives are allowed to control how the Constitution is interpreted, the Constitution will remain a license to kill.\n\nIn the wake of two high-profile mass shootings in a week-and numerous other instances of gun violence that didn't even make the evening news-all of the typical arguments are back on the table.

In Texas, you can walk around packing like Rambo to overcompensate for... not packing like Rambo, no questions asked, no permit required. In California, not so much. There is a lot of inconsistency between the different states on this issue. For instance, in New York you can carry \"long guns\" outside without a permit but not \"handguns.\" In New Jersey, it's just the opposite: There you can carry handguns but not long guns without a permit. Conservatives want the Supreme Court to resolve part of this conflict in laws by getting rid of the permitting process for handguns (or liberalizing them to the point where functionally anybody can get a permit), effectively inventing a new unequivocal right to bear these weapons outside the home. That's different from the last gun right they invented in 2008: the right to bear arms for self-defense . The astute reader will remember that the original constitutional right was merely to bear arms to form militias and kill Black people who didn't want to be held in bondage. A new carrying right might not seem like a huge change in the already homicidal, conservative interpretation of the Second Amendment. But consider the specifics of the case: New York, like a number of states, has a permitting process through which people who can demonstrate a \"proper cause\" can get a license to carry their hand cannons outside their homes. What's at issue in this case are people who were denied a permit because they couldn't show the state licensing board a good reason to need their guns all the time. Restricting gun access to those who can show \"cause\" is the linchpin of every gun regulation. It's the reason background checks are constitutional: Our society thinks there are some people who should be allowed to have guns, and others who should not. But conservatives are trying to undermine the very theory on which any gun can be restricted for any person, at any time. I shouldn't have to explain why that's dangerous. I don't know how many people have to die before conservatives realize their legal theories are killing us. But I know the answer to that equation is always \"more.\" Conservatives always demand that more blood be sacrificed to their pet theories. And the ones on the Supreme Court will demand more here. It only takes four justices to grant certiorari and force the court to take up a case. Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch are locks to want to invent this right. Alleged attempted rapist Brett Kavanaugh asked for a gun case last year, when he was complaining that another case brought by the New York State Rifle & Pistol Association (this one trying to overturn New York's restrictions on gun transportation ) was dismissed because New York changed its laws to avoid a bad Supreme Court ruling. More from Mystal The Massacre in Atlanta Was As Predictable as White Supremacy Elie Mystal It's Time to Repeal-and Replace-the Second Amendment Elie Mystal So that gets us to certiorari. After that, once the case is heard, conservatives only need one more vote to turn the whole country into a crossfire. Enter Amy Coney Barrett, the justice confirmed after the presidential election had already started. Based on her previous cases, Barrett appears to have an expansive view of gun rights . In one case she heard in 2019, while still a circuit court judge, she wrote (in dissent) that \"virtue based restrictions\" could not be placed on gun rights. Thus she determined that people with felony convictions could not be denied gun rights (though she was open to the possibility of denying them voting rights, because of course conservatives think it should be easier to kill than to vote). It's the kind of dissent that pleases pissed-off ex-boyfriends everywhere. It's likely that New York's requirement that people have a better reason than \"nighttime is scary without my 9mm woobie\" is too much of a restriction for a judge like Barrett. Any restriction is likely too much regulation for Barrett and her four new ammosexual friends. That's the problem with the political and social debate that will follow whatever mass shooting has happened by the time you read this. We can't have \"common sense gun safety\" if we don't have judges willing to apply common sense. Democrats are always bringing the proverbial \"knife to a gunfight\" on this issue. Gun reform is no longer merely a question of legislation or even popular will. It's a question of constitutional law. As long as conservatives are allowed to control how the Constitution is interpreted, the Constitution will remain a license to kill.\n\nThe debate about what to do in the wake of these mass shootings seems more pointless to me than usual, and not just because I'm desensitized to mass death or cynical about political compromise (though I am those things, as I must be, as I watch numerous politicians shrug off half a million deaths while rushing to reopen the beaches for spring break). The debate is pointless because, regardless of the outcome in Congress, the conservative-controlled Supreme Court will not allow us to have commonsense gun regulation, let alone any ambitious, progressive legislation to get guns off the streets, like they do in other countries that don't have mass shootings every other day. Democrats (and Americans who don't want to be shot to death) lost the gun battle when Mitch McConnell stole a seat on the court in 2016. They lost the war when Ruth Bader Ginsburg, may her memory be a blessing, didn't live until January 20, 2021. There is no new gun regulation or reform that can survive six bloodthirsty conservatives on the Supreme Court, just like there is no way to \"win\" a game of Russian roulette when there are six bullets in the revolver. In fact, far from upholding whatever newly passed law that's ineffectual enough to survive a filibuster (you know, the same filibuster Democrats refuse to kill), the Supreme Court is poised to go in the other direction and dismantle what gun regulations we already have. This Friday, the justices will meet to decide whether to take a case called New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v. Corlett .

After that, once the case is heard, conservatives only need one more vote to turn the whole country into a crossfire. Enter Amy Coney Barrett, the justice confirmed after the presidential election had already started. Based on her previous cases, Barrett appears to have an expansive view of gun rights . In one case she heard in 2019, while still a circuit court judge, she wrote (in dissent) that \"virtue based restrictions\" could not be placed on gun rights. Thus she determined that people with felony convictions could not be denied gun rights (though she was open to the possibility of denying them voting rights, because of course conservatives think it should be easier to kill than to vote). It's the kind of dissent that pleases pissed-off ex-boyfriends everywhere. It's likely that New York's requirement that people have a better reason than \"nighttime is scary without my 9mm woobie\" is too much of a restriction for a judge like Barrett. Any restriction is likely too much regulation for Barrett and her four new ammosexual friends. That's the problem with the political and social debate that will follow whatever mass shooting has happened by the time you read this. We can't have \"common sense gun safety\" if we don't have judges willing to apply common sense. Democrats are always bringing the proverbial \"knife to a gunfight\" on this issue. Gun reform is no longer merely a question of legislation or even popular will. It's a question of constitutional law. As long as conservatives are allowed to control how the Constitution is interpreted, the Constitution will remain a license to kill.\n\nThere is a lot of inconsistency between the different states on this issue. For instance, in New York you can carry \"long guns\" outside without a permit but not \"handguns.\" In New Jersey, it's just the opposite: There you can carry handguns but not long guns without a permit. Conservatives want the Supreme Court to resolve part of this conflict in laws by getting rid of the permitting process for handguns (or liberalizing them to the point where functionally anybody can get a permit), effectively inventing a new unequivocal right to bear these weapons outside the home. That's different from the last gun right they invented in 2008: the right to bear arms for self-defense . The astute reader will remember that the original constitutional right was merely to bear arms to form militias and kill Black people who didn't want to be held in bondage. A new carrying right might not seem like a huge change in the already homicidal, conservative interpretation of the Second Amendment. But consider the specifics of the case: New York, like a number of states, has a permitting process through which people who can demonstrate a \"proper cause\" can get a license to carry their hand cannons outside their homes. What's at issue in this case are people who were denied a permit because they couldn't show the state licensing board a good reason to need their guns all the time. Restricting gun access to those who can show \"cause\" is the linchpin of every gun regulation. It's the reason background checks are constitutional: Our society thinks there are some people who should be allowed to have guns, and others who should not. But conservatives are trying to undermine the very theory on which any gun can be restricted for any person, at any time. I shouldn't have to explain why that's dangerous. I don't know how many people have to die before conservatives realize their legal theories are killing us. But I know the answer to that equation is always \"more.\" Conservatives always demand that more blood be sacrificed to their pet theories. And the ones on the Supreme Court will demand more here.

Seamus pointed his rainbow flag with the feather handle at his sisters and \"pow-powed\" them, calling out, \"Yous are dead now, guys. I shot yous.\" This article originally appeared at TomDispatch.com . To stay on top of important articles like these, sign up to receive the latest updates from TomDispatch.com. Madeline and Rosena laughed and just kept on running, with Seamus at their heels. I hid my face in my hands. It wasn't just that he was playing guns, but that he was using a Pride flag as his gun at a vigil to mourn those killed at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. My pacifist husband Patrick ran to redirect their activities, replacing the flag with a ball and glove and beginning a game of catch. Vigil organizers were taking turns reading the names of those killed into a microphone. \"... Juan Ramon Guerrero, 22 Eric Ivan Ortiz-Rivera, 36 Luis S. Vielma, 22...\" Those three men and 46 others were massacred on June 12. Another 50 people were wounded. Omar Mateen, who killed them, was armed with a Sig Sauer MCX assault rifle and a Glock 17 9mm semi-automatic pistol . He bought those two weapons legally in the days leading up to the attack. The carnage brought politicians and pundits out in force, using all the usual arguments for and against guns. Because the victims were mostly gay and mostly Latino, and because the attack was carried out by an American citizen with an ethnic last name who may have been enthralled by Islamic terrorism, or a closeted, self-hating homosexual (or both), the commentary quickly became muddled. Was it a hate crime, Islamic terrorism, or a strange double-bonus hit for the haters? Mateen was killed in a shootout with police and so can't speak to his motives. Investigators were left to sift through the material evidence and a dizzying compilation of online comments, Facebook likes, and recollections from old coworkers, family members, and possible lovers in their search for answers. The most essential facts are, however, not that complicated: Mateen had a license to carry a gun, training as a private security guard, and hatreds to act upon. He armed himself and he killed.

Montrell Jackson, 32 Matthew Gerald, 41 Brad Garafola, 45...\" And the killing continues. Using the Gun Violence Archive , I counted another 306 deaths by guns throughout the United States in the first eight days of July alone. Most of them weren't high-profile police shootings or mass tragedies, but in a small-scale and localized way, the grief and outrage of Baton Rouge, St. Paul, and Dallas were replicated in every corner of this country, including Ticfaw, Louisiana; Woodland, California; Tabernacle, New Jersey; and Harvey, Illinois. More than 300 deaths by gun in just eight days. \"Stabbin' My Bunny\": Teaching Kids About Guns and Violence And then, of course, there were my kids, my husband, and those \"guns.\" As a boy, Patrick wasn't allowed to play with toy guns. Instead, he, his parents, and their friends would go to the mall during the Christmas buying spree to put \" Stop War Toys \" stickers on Rambo and G.I. Joe action figures. When he went to his friends' houses, he had to tell them that war toys were verboten . LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS Email I grew up in a similar family of activists. We, too, were forbidden toy guns and other war toys. My brother and I were more likely to play games like \"protester at the Pentagon\" than cops and robbers. I've been thinking recently about why toy guns didn't have a grip on our imaginations as kids. I suspect it was because we understood-were made to understand-what the big gun of US militarism had done in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Indochina, and throughout Central America. Our dad had seen the big gun of war up close and personal. His finger-the same one he pointed at us when we were in trouble-had pulled the trigger again and again in France during World War II. He was decorated there, but had zero nostalgia for the experience. He was, in fact, deeply ashamed of the dashing figure he had once cut when home from the front. And so, Dad screwed up a new kind of courage to say no to war and violence, to killing of any kind. His knowledge of war imbued his nonviolent peace activist mission with a genuine, badass, superhero style swagger. Our parents-our community of ragtag, countercultural Catholic peace activists-made that no-violence, no-killing, no-matter-what point again and again. In fact, my early experience of guns was the chilling fear of knowing that, in protest , my father, mother, and their friends were walking into what they called \"free-fire zones\" on military bases, where well-armed, well-trained soldiers were licensed to kill intruders. So we didn't point toy guns at each other. We didn't pow-pow with our fingers or sticks. We crossed those fingers and hoped that the people we loved would be safe. Our inner city Baltimore neighborhood, where crack cocaine madness was just taking hold, drove that point home on a micro level. Our house was robbed at gunpoint more than once-and we had so little worth taking. We watched a man across the street bleed to death after being stabbed repeatedly in a fight over nothing. People from our house ran to help and were there for far too long before an ambulance even arrived. We knew as little kids that violence was no laughing matter, nor child's play. It was serious business and was to be resisted. As parents tend to do, Patrick and I are passing this tradition on to our kids, hopefully without the emotional scarring that went with our childhoods of resistance. They don't have guns or action figures or any other toy implements of death. Still, we've been watching Seamus, our Team Elsa (from the Disney blockbuster Frozen ) son, as he's recently begun turning every stick into an imaginary gun. This is, of course, happening just as, in the headlines of the moment, actual guns are turning so many previously real people into statistics. Under the circumstances, how could I not find myself thinking about toy guns, real guns, the nature of play, the role of imagination, the place of parents, and how to (or whether to) police (ha!) that imaginary play? When my stepdaughter Rosena was about four, she found a toy dagger at the playground, somehow smuggled it home, and was stabbing one of her beloved stuffed animals, a bunny, repeatedly with it. In the other room, I could hear the thumps on the bedroom floor and called out, \"What are you doing?\" \"Stabbin' my bunny. I kilt her,\" she responded matter-of-factly. Seizing a \"teaching moment\" and undoubtedly gripped by my own childhood experiences and memories of my parents, I blustered into the bedroom with a shoebox. \"Now, your bunny is dead,\" I announced in my version of over-the-top momism. \"You know what happens when living things die, right? It's forever, right? Now, we have to bury her.\" Rosena and I then \"buried\" the doll on a high shelf in her closet. I told her that we cannot hurt or kill the things (or people) we love. I told her that, because she had \"killed\" that bunny, she could never play with it again. About a week later, I slipped it back into her toy basket and, when she asked why, assured her that I thought she wouldn't hurt her toys like that again. She agreed. I recall that episode now with a certain embarrassment, but when I recently heard Rosena explaining death and loss to her little brother and sister, I thought: Oh, maybe the drama of the shoebox burial was actually helpful in some fashion. Toys matter. We've put a fair amount of thought into what might be called toy curation in our household. We've bought nothing new and little used. Mostly, we've accepted shipments of hand-me-downs from friends who just wanted \"this crap\" out of their houses. No guns came with them, thankfully. After all, even toy guns can mean death under the wrong circumstances. A year ago, I visited the Cuddell Recreation Center in Cleveland with my daughter Madeline and a group of friends. That broad stretch of ball fields and paths, anchored by a gazebo and a playground, was where 12-year-old Tamir Rice was fatally shot by Officer Timothy Loehmann in November 2014. Rice, an African American, was playing with an Airsoft pellet gun that a friend's dad had bought at Walmart . A replica of an actual Colt pistol, it shot plastic pellets and looked pretty real, since the orange tip signifying \"toy\" was missing. However, Officer Loehmann, investigating a report that a man was carrying a gun in the park, was moving too fast to notice much. He sped up and began shooting even before his squad car stopped moving. Rice's hands were still reportedly in his pockets. Though Loehmann was not indicted, the city of Cleveland paid a $6 million settlement to the Rice family and demolished the gazebo where the boy was shot. In the park that day, local activists described the shooting and its aftermath to our group. Half listening, I followed Madeline as she toddled into the playground. I tried to imagine Samaria Rice's pain in this unremarkable place made part shrine, part soapbox by a police officer's quick trigger finger, racism, and her son's blood. I thought about that toy gun in Tamir Rice's hand and what might have been going through his head as he pointed it and played with it. Despite the age difference, it couldn't have been that far from what regularly goes through my son's head when he picks up a stick and points it: pop, boom, wow! The difference, of course, is that Seamus, blond and freckled and unmistakably white, would run little risk of being shot down by a policeman, even eight years from now with a replica toy gun in his hands. Blasters, Blasters, Everywhere Toys are a big business in this country, raking in $19.4 billion in 2015, according to the retail tracking firm NPD Group . Our family is not responsible for even a dime of this. Not surprisingly, then, my announcement that we were all going to spend a rainy afternoon at a local Toys \"R\" Us store came like a bolt from the blue for the kids. I wanted to see what kind of toy weaponry was for sale there. I was curious, among other things, about whether the boys at school who had taught Seamus about superheroes, bad guys, and Star Wars had ignited in my son a love of weaponry; I was curious, that is, as to how he would react to the walls of guns I imagined Toys \"R\" Us displaying. We got into our car as if it were Christmas Eve, Seamus beside himself with excitement, Madeline on a contact high from her brother. I was experiencing my own contact high, taking my kids on their first research trip. What we found was not exactly what I expected-on many levels. Seamus was quickly overwhelmed by the glut of everything-lots of pictures of toys on boxes, but not a lot to pick up. (It was, in that sense, the very opposite of our visits to the Goodwill store, where you can sit on the floor and play with all those second-hand toys as long as you put them back afterwards.) Not so surprisingly, in retrospect, he went straight for what was familiar, what he could grab in his hand and actually look at: the books. It took some effort to wrestle him away from Five Stories About Princesses and enlist him in my quest for bad toys. (Madeline had, by then, fallen asleep.) I had finally found the Nerf \"blasters,\" but he wasn't interested. \"Let's not go down this aisle, okay, Mom?\" I was, of course, looking for the worst of the worst when it came to weaponry, but it proved remarkably hard to find. The aisle did, admittedly, have the Nerf Zombie Strike Doominator and the Nerf Modulus Recon MKII for $34.99 each. Those certainly sounded grim, given the eternal war against the undead, but the bright orange, cartoonish, completely unrealistic \"blasters\" on display and marketed to kids \"eight and up\" seemed distant indeed from American gun carnage (and our wars in distant lands), nor was there anything on the packaging that even hinted at real people getting shot in real encounters or real wars. I must admit that I don't like the idea of Seamus shooting anything at anyone-even a brain-hungry zombie-but as it turned out, I needn't have worried, not this time around anyway. Zombie-killing wasn't in his wheelhouse. Still, I kept looking for the real gun aisle, and I did come across more blasters, dart shooters, and the like, none with the word \"gun\" on them. Of course, we do live in Connecticut, less than 100 miles from Newtown where, in 2012, Adam Lanza, a devotee of violent video games who grew up in a gun-filled house , killed 20 kids just a little older than Seamus along with six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. So maybe our local toy outlet was being sensitive, but I doubt it. There was the Halo UNSC SMG Blaster (the initials make it sound extra tough but stand for nothing) for $19.99, and the NERF Star Wars Episode VII First Order Stormtrooper Deluxe Blaster , which fires 12 darts up to 65 feet without reloading, for $41.99. The worst thing I could find was the Xploderz Mayhem , with \"more distance, more ammo,\" which shoots easy-to-wash off mini-water pellets. It was on clearance for $18.89. By then, Seamus was pulling me frantically toward the aisle with the full Frozen franchise on display. Madeline was now awake and in heaven. So I left them there briefly and snuck off to do a last check for \"real\" toy guns. No such luck. I didn't find the kind of Airsoft gun Tamir Rice was playing with when he was killed. I didn't find an ersatz Sig Sauer either. It turns out that most brick-and-mortar toy stores don't seem to offer realistic-looking toy weaponry anymore, nor is there the toy store equivalent of the curtained-off area in the old neighborhood video rental shop where the porn was available. For such toys, you have to turn to an online world of websites like Kids-Army.com , where you can indeed buy realistic-looking toy rifles, shotguns, and pistols, or even to Amazon, where you can find an Airsoft version of the Sig Sauer rifle for $249.99. \"Start Them Young\" The National Rifle Association (NRA) would undoubtedly have been disappointed by my local Toys \"R\" Us outlet-just as its officials undoubtedly are by the way most big toy merchants seem to have left their more realistic guns for the online world. This happened, in part, in response to the sort of social pressure that my husband engaged in when in high school and-more critically-the almost routine horror of the blurred line between toy guns and real ones. You know we're a quirky, gun-crazy nation when Cleveland could ban toy guns and umbrellas with pointy tips from the area around the Republican Convention in the name of security, but couldn't keep out the real guns in open-carry Ohio. The NRA wants kids to play with realistic toy guns and BB guns, since they believe that such toys are part of a child's initiation into the future ownership of perfectly real guns. At the moment, the gun lobby is concerned that not enough people have guns-even though the 270 million to 310 million of them already amassed around this country (according to the Pew Research Center ) could arm just about every man, woman, transgendered person, and child around. Still, despite the fact that Americans can now carry guns in all 50 states and the NRA continues to win most of the big political fights, the number of households with guns is actually down from its peak in the late 1960s (though those that are armed have more and deadlier weapons than ever before). No wonder the gun industry and the gun lobby are fighting to produce an army of toddlers. \" Start Them Young ,\" a February 2016 report from the Violence Policy Center, details how gun manufacturers and the NRA are eager to market real guns to younger and younger consumers. The report starts with a selection of quotes from the industry, including this gem from Craig Cushman, marketing director for T h ompson/Center Arms , about their Hot Shot rifle for kids: \"[We're] talking about a tiny gun intended for the very youngest shooters-the ultimate first gun. We're targeting the six- to 12-year-old range.\" In other words, kids are literally in their sights. It's a strange world we live in. The toy industry has puffed up and candy-colored its play guns, turned up the volume on the violence online and in video games, and wrapped everything in plastic and safety warnings. At the same time, the gun industry is making its guns smaller and cuter for kids, while putting its energy into the all-important junior market. Can we be safe-any of us-in a nation awash in guns? The gun-and-ammo industry boasted $16 billion in revenue for 2015. Gun stores-from brick-and-mortar shops to online retailers-had $3.1 billion in revenue that same year. The industry as a whole claimed responsibility for nearly $50 billion in \"economic activity\" in 2015 alone. That represents a fair number of jobs, but here is the number that really goes boom: $229 billion. That's the annual cost of fatal and non-fatal gun violence in this country, according to Mother Jones and analyst Ted Miller of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, who teamed up to crunch the numbers. That figure includes both the direct costs of gun injuries and deaths-police investigations, emergency personnel, hospital bills, long-term care for the injured, funeral expenses for the dead, and the costs of prosecuting and imprisoning the perpetrators. As the report concludes: \"Even before accounting for the more intangible costs of the violence... the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America is nearly $400,000. And we pay for 32 of them every single day.\" We are awash in guns. Where does it end? Gun violence is embedded in our national mythology, our foreign policy, our notions of masculinity, our entertainment industry, and our children's play. We see violence solving problems on every screen-from the zombie apocalypse to the rise of ISIS. Russian playwright Anton Chekhov's maxim still applies: \"One should not put a loaded rifle onto the stage if no one is thinking of firing it.\" Sooner or later, that rifle is sure to go off. It might be an accident; it might be terrorism; it might be hate. But it will go off. Somewhere, as you read this, it's going off right now. I don't want to police my kids' imagination. And there is a whole strain of parenting literature that assures me that I don't have to. It says don't interfere with your kid's play, even if it includes guns and shooting and killing. Imagination is imagination and the violence isn't real. It might even, so this line of thinking goes, be a healthy way for them to process feelings of aggression. I get what they're saying, but it seems like a cop-out to me. To my mind, nonintervention is often a missed opportunity to be a parent. Sure, the violence isn't real. The pow-pows don't actually rip skin and tendon or stop hearts from beating, but the United States, which has been fighting distant wars nonstop for 15 years now, does have a violence problem and a man problem and a gun problem. We know where that problem ends, but it starts somewhere, too. One place to begin to look, at least, is at how our kids-particularly our boys-play, and how they are nurtured (or not), and taught to express their emotions (or not). It is, at least in part, up to us, their parents, to decide whether they are going to be the ones who help repair our society and reorient us (or not). And it begins with the kinds of care and love they receive, the kinds of conversations they are invited into, the kinds of expectations they are given about behavior and relationships. I don't want to raise Seamus, Madeline, or Rosena in the austere, ripped from the headlines of horror, polemical atmosphere that was the essence of my own childhood. But I don't want them to get comfortable with killing either. I want so much more for, and from, my little boy than \"Pow, pow, yous are dead now!\" And that starts with taking the gun or the stick or the rainbow flag out of his hands, sitting him down, and having a hard conversation about what guns actually do to people-and how much killing hurts us all.\n\nThis article originally appeared at TomDispatch.com .

I hid my face in my hands. It wasn't just that he was playing guns, but that he was using a Pride flag as his gun at a vigil to mourn those killed at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. My pacifist husband Patrick ran to redirect their activities, replacing the flag with a ball and glove and beginning a game of catch. Vigil organizers were taking turns reading the names of those killed into a microphone. \"... Juan Ramon Guerrero, 22 Eric Ivan Ortiz-Rivera, 36 Luis S. Vielma, 22...\" Those three men and 46 others were massacred on June 12. Another 50 people were wounded. Omar Mateen, who killed them, was armed with a Sig Sauer MCX assault rifle and a Glock 17 9mm semi-automatic pistol . He bought those two weapons legally in the days leading up to the attack. The carnage brought politicians and pundits out in force, using all the usual arguments for and against guns. Because the victims were mostly gay and mostly Latino, and because the attack was carried out by an American citizen with an ethnic last name who may have been enthralled by Islamic terrorism, or a closeted, self-hating homosexual (or both), the commentary quickly became muddled. Was it a hate crime, Islamic terrorism, or a strange double-bonus hit for the haters? Mateen was killed in a shootout with police and so can't speak to his motives. Investigators were left to sift through the material evidence and a dizzying compilation of online comments, Facebook likes, and recollections from old coworkers, family members, and possible lovers in their search for answers. The most essential facts are, however, not that complicated: Mateen had a license to carry a gun, training as a private security guard, and hatreds to act upon. He armed himself and he killed.

Montrell Jackson, 32 Matthew Gerald, 41 Brad Garafola, 45...\" And the killing continues. Using the Gun Violence Archive , I counted another 306 deaths by guns throughout the United States in the first eight days of July alone. Most of them weren't high-profile police shootings or mass tragedies, but in a small-scale and localized way, the grief and outrage of Baton Rouge, St. Paul, and Dallas were replicated in every corner of this country, including Ticfaw, Louisiana; Woodland, California; Tabernacle, New Jersey; and Harvey, Illinois. More than 300 deaths by gun in just eight days. \"Stabbin' My Bunny\": Teaching Kids About Guns and Violence And then, of course, there were my kids, my husband, and those \"guns.\" As a boy, Patrick wasn't allowed to play with toy guns. Instead, he, his parents, and their friends would go to the mall during the Christmas buying spree to put \" Stop War Toys \" stickers on Rambo and G.I. Joe action figures. When he went to his friends' houses, he had to tell them that war toys were verboten . LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS Email I grew up in a similar family of activists. We, too, were forbidden toy guns and other war toys. My brother and I were more likely to play games like \"protester at the Pentagon\" than cops and robbers. I've been thinking recently about why toy guns didn't have a grip on our imaginations as kids. I suspect it was because we understood-were made to understand-what the big gun of US militarism had done in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Indochina, and throughout Central America. Our dad had seen the big gun of war up close and personal. His finger-the same one he pointed at us when we were in trouble-had pulled the trigger again and again in France during World War II. He was decorated there, but had zero nostalgia for the experience. He was, in fact, deeply ashamed of the dashing figure he had once cut when home from the front. And so, Dad screwed up a new kind of courage to say no to war and violence, to killing of any kind. His knowledge of war imbued his nonviolent peace activist mission with a genuine, badass, superhero style swagger. Our parents-our community of ragtag, countercultural Catholic peace activists-made that no-violence, no-killing, no-matter-what point again and again. In fact, my early experience of guns was the chilling fear of knowing that, in protest , my father, mother, and their friends were walking into what they called \"free-fire zones\" on military bases, where well-armed, well-trained soldiers were licensed to kill intruders. So we didn't point toy guns at each other. We didn't pow-pow with our fingers or sticks. We crossed those fingers and hoped that the people we loved would be safe. Our inner city Baltimore neighborhood, where crack cocaine madness was just taking hold, drove that point home on a micro level. Our house was robbed at gunpoint more than once-and we had so little worth taking. We watched a man across the street bleed to death after being stabbed repeatedly in a fight over nothing. People from our house ran to help and were there for far too long before an ambulance even arrived. We knew as little kids that violence was no laughing matter, nor child's play. It was serious business and was to be resisted. As parents tend to do, Patrick and I are passing this tradition on to our kids, hopefully without the emotional scarring that went with our childhoods of resistance. They don't have guns or action figures or any other toy implements of death. Still, we've been watching Seamus, our Team Elsa (from the Disney blockbuster Frozen ) son, as he's recently begun turning every stick into an imaginary gun. This is, of course, happening just as, in the headlines of the moment, actual guns are turning so many previously real people into statistics. Under the circumstances, how could I not find myself thinking about toy guns, real guns, the nature of play, the role of imagination, the place of parents, and how to (or whether to) police (ha!) that imaginary play? When my stepdaughter Rosena was about four, she found a toy dagger at the playground, somehow smuggled it home, and was stabbing one of her beloved stuffed animals, a bunny, repeatedly with it. In the other room, I could hear the thumps on the bedroom floor and called out, \"What are you doing?\" \"Stabbin' my bunny. I kilt her,\" she responded matter-of-factly. Seizing a \"teaching moment\" and undoubtedly gripped by my own childhood experiences and memories of my parents, I blustered into the bedroom with a shoebox. \"Now, your bunny is dead,\" I announced in my version of over-the-top momism. \"You know what happens when living things die, right? It's forever, right? Now, we have to bury her.\" Rosena and I then \"buried\" the doll on a high shelf in her closet. I told her that we cannot hurt or kill the things (or people) we love. I told her that, because she had \"killed\" that bunny, she could never play with it again. About a week later, I slipped it back into her toy basket and, when she asked why, assured her that I thought she wouldn't hurt her toys like that again. She agreed. I recall that episode now with a certain embarrassment, but when I recently heard Rosena explaining death and loss to her little brother and sister, I thought: Oh, maybe the drama of the shoebox burial was actually helpful in some fashion. Toys matter. We've put a fair amount of thought into what might be called toy curation in our household. We've bought nothing new and little used. Mostly, we've accepted shipments of hand-me-downs from friends who just wanted \"this crap\" out of their houses. No guns came with them, thankfully. After all, even toy guns can mean death under the wrong circumstances. A year ago, I visited the Cuddell Recreation Center in Cleveland with my daughter Madeline and a group of friends. That broad stretch of ball fields and paths, anchored by a gazebo and a playground, was where 12-year-old Tamir Rice was fatally shot by Officer Timothy Loehmann in November 2014. Rice, an African American, was playing with an Airsoft pellet gun that a friend's dad had bought at Walmart . A replica of an actual Colt pistol, it shot plastic pellets and looked pretty real, since the orange tip signifying \"toy\" was missing. However, Officer Loehmann, investigating a report that a man was carrying a gun in the park, was moving too fast to notice much. He sped up and began shooting even before his squad car stopped moving. Rice's hands were still reportedly in his pockets. Though Loehmann was not indicted, the city of Cleveland paid a $6 million settlement to the Rice family and demolished the gazebo where the boy was shot. In the park that day, local activists described the shooting and its aftermath to our group. Half listening, I followed Madeline as she toddled into the playground. I tried to imagine Samaria Rice's pain in this unremarkable place made part shrine, part soapbox by a police officer's quick trigger finger, racism, and her son's blood. I thought about that toy gun in Tamir Rice's hand and what might have been going through his head as he pointed it and played with it. Despite the age difference, it couldn't have been that far from what regularly goes through my son's head when he picks up a stick and points it: pop, boom, wow! The difference, of course, is that Seamus, blond and freckled and unmistakably white, would run little risk of being shot down by a policeman, even eight years from now with a replica toy gun in his hands. Blasters, Blasters, Everywhere Toys are a big business in this country, raking in $19.4 billion in 2015, according to the retail tracking firm NPD Group . Our family is not responsible for even a dime of this. Not surprisingly, then, my announcement that we were all going to spend a rainy afternoon at a local Toys \"R\" Us store came like a bolt from the blue for the kids. I wanted to see what kind of toy weaponry was for sale there. I was curious, among other things, about whether the boys at school who had taught Seamus about superheroes, bad guys, and Star Wars had ignited in my son a love of weaponry; I was curious, that is, as to how he would react to the walls of guns I imagined Toys \"R\" Us displaying. We got into our car as if it were Christmas Eve, Seamus beside himself with excitement, Madeline on a contact high from her brother. I was experiencing my own contact high, taking my kids on their first research trip. What we found was not exactly what I expected-on many levels. Seamus was quickly overwhelmed by the glut of everything-lots of pictures of toys on boxes, but not a lot to pick up. (It was, in that sense, the very opposite of our visits to the Goodwill store, where you can sit on the floor and play with all those second-hand toys as long as you put them back afterwards.) Not so surprisingly, in retrospect, he went straight for what was familiar, what he could grab in his hand and actually look at: the books. It took some effort to wrestle him away from Five Stories About Princesses and enlist him in my quest for bad toys. (Madeline had, by then, fallen asleep.) I had finally found the Nerf \"blasters,\" but he wasn't interested. \"Let's not go down this aisle, okay, Mom?\" I was, of course, looking for the worst of the worst when it came to weaponry, but it proved remarkably hard to find. The aisle did, admittedly, have the Nerf Zombie Strike Doominator and the Nerf Modulus Recon MKII for $34.99 each. Those certainly sounded grim, given the eternal war against the undead, but the bright orange, cartoonish, completely unrealistic \"blasters\" on display and marketed to kids \"eight and up\" seemed distant indeed from American gun carnage (and our wars in distant lands), nor was there anything on the packaging that even hinted at real people getting shot in real encounters or real wars. I must admit that I don't like the idea of Seamus shooting anything at anyone-even a brain-hungry zombie-but as it turned out, I needn't have worried, not this time around anyway. Zombie-killing wasn't in his wheelhouse. Still, I kept looking for the real gun aisle, and I did come across more blasters, dart shooters, and the like, none with the word \"gun\" on them. Of course, we do live in Connecticut, less than 100 miles from Newtown where, in 2012, Adam Lanza, a devotee of violent video games who grew up in a gun-filled house , killed 20 kids just a little older than Seamus along with six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. So maybe our local toy outlet was being sensitive, but I doubt it. There was the Halo UNSC SMG Blaster (the initials make it sound extra tough but stand for nothing) for $19.99, and the NERF Star Wars Episode VII First Order Stormtrooper Deluxe Blaster , which fires 12 darts up to 65 feet without reloading, for $41.99. The worst thing I could find was the Xploderz Mayhem , with \"more distance, more ammo,\" which shoots easy-to-wash off mini-water pellets. It was on clearance for $18.89. By then, Seamus was pulling me frantically toward the aisle with the full Frozen franchise on display. Madeline was now awake and in heaven.

So we didn't point toy guns at each other. We didn't pow-pow with our fingers or sticks. We crossed those fingers and hoped that the people we loved would be safe. Our inner city Baltimore neighborhood, where crack cocaine madness was just taking hold, drove that point home on a micro level. Our house was robbed at gunpoint more than once-and we had so little worth taking. We watched a man across the street bleed to death after being stabbed repeatedly in a fight over nothing. People from our house ran to help and were there for far too long before an ambulance even arrived. We knew as little kids that violence was no laughing matter, nor child's play. It was serious business and was to be resisted. As parents tend to do, Patrick and I are passing this tradition on to our kids, hopefully without the emotional scarring that went with our childhoods of resistance. They don't have guns or action figures or any other toy implements of death. Still, we've been watching Seamus, our Team Elsa (from the Disney blockbuster Frozen ) son, as he's recently begun turning every stick into an imaginary gun. This is, of course, happening just as, in the headlines of the moment, actual guns are turning so many previously real people into statistics. Under the circumstances, how could I not find myself thinking about toy guns, real guns, the nature of play, the role of imagination, the place of parents, and how to (or whether to) police (ha!) that imaginary play? When my stepdaughter Rosena was about four, she found a toy dagger at the playground, somehow smuggled it home, and was stabbing one of her beloved stuffed animals, a bunny, repeatedly with it. In the other room, I could hear the thumps on the bedroom floor and called out, \"What are you doing?\" \"Stabbin' my bunny. I kilt her,\" she responded matter-of-factly. Seizing a \"teaching moment\" and undoubtedly gripped by my own childhood experiences and memories of my parents, I blustered into the bedroom with a shoebox. \"Now, your bunny is dead,\" I announced in my version of over-the-top momism. \"You know what happens when living things die, right? It's forever, right? Now, we have to bury her.\" Rosena and I then \"buried\" the doll on a high shelf in her closet. I told her that we cannot hurt or kill the things (or people) we love. I told her that, because she had \"killed\" that bunny, she could never play with it again. About a week later, I slipped it back into her toy basket and, when she asked why, assured her that I thought she wouldn't hurt her toys like that again. She agreed. I recall that episode now with a certain embarrassment, but when I recently heard Rosena explaining death and loss to her little brother and sister, I thought: Oh, maybe the drama of the shoebox burial was actually helpful in some fashion. Toys matter. We've put a fair amount of thought into what might be called toy curation in our household. We've bought nothing new and little used. Mostly, we've accepted shipments of hand-me-downs from friends who just wanted \"this crap\" out of their houses. No guns came with them, thankfully. After all, even toy guns can mean death under the wrong circumstances. A year ago, I visited the Cuddell Recreation Center in Cleveland with my daughter Madeline and a group of friends. That broad stretch of ball fields and paths, anchored by a gazebo and a playground, was where 12-year-old Tamir Rice was fatally shot by Officer Timothy Loehmann in November 2014. Rice, an African American, was playing with an Airsoft pellet gun that a friend's dad had bought at Walmart . A replica of an actual Colt pistol, it shot plastic pellets and looked pretty real, since the orange tip signifying \"toy\" was missing. However, Officer Loehmann, investigating a report that a man was carrying a gun in the park, was moving too fast to notice much. He sped up and began shooting even before his squad car stopped moving. Rice's hands were still reportedly in his pockets. Though Loehmann was not indicted, the city of Cleveland paid a $6 million settlement to the Rice family and demolished the gazebo where the boy was shot. In the park that day, local activists described the shooting and its aftermath to our group. Half listening, I followed Madeline as she toddled into the playground. I tried to imagine Samaria Rice's pain in this unremarkable place made part shrine, part soapbox by a police officer's quick trigger finger, racism, and her son's blood. I thought about that toy gun in Tamir Rice's hand and what might have been going through his head as he pointed it and played with it. Despite the age difference, it couldn't have been that far from what regularly goes through my son's head when he picks up a stick and points it: pop, boom, wow! The difference, of course, is that Seamus, blond and freckled and unmistakably white, would run little risk of being shot down by a policeman, even eight years from now with a replica toy gun in his hands. Blasters, Blasters, Everywhere Toys are a big business in this country, raking in $19.4 billion in 2015, according to the retail tracking firm NPD Group . Our family is not responsible for even a dime of this. Not surprisingly, then, my announcement that we were all going to spend a rainy afternoon at a local Toys \"R\" Us store came like a bolt from the blue for the kids. I wanted to see what kind of toy weaponry was for sale there. I was curious, among other things, about whether the boys at school who had taught Seamus about superheroes, bad guys, and Star Wars had ignited in my son a love of weaponry; I was curious, that is, as to how he would react to the walls of guns I imagined Toys \"R\" Us displaying. We got into our car as if it were Christmas Eve, Seamus beside himself with excitement, Madeline on a contact high from her brother. I was experiencing my own contact high, taking my kids on their first research trip. What we found was not exactly what I expected-on many levels. Seamus was quickly overwhelmed by the glut of everything-lots of pictures of toys on boxes, but not a lot to pick up. (It was, in that sense, the very opposite of our visits to the Goodwill store, where you can sit on the floor and play with all those second-hand toys as long as you put them back afterwards.) Not so surprisingly, in retrospect, he went straight for what was familiar, what he could grab in his hand and actually look at: the books. It took some effort to wrestle him away from Five Stories About Princesses and enlist him in my quest for bad toys. (Madeline had, by then, fallen asleep.) I had finally found the Nerf \"blasters,\" but he wasn't interested. \"Let's not go down this aisle, okay, Mom?\" I was, of course, looking for the worst of the worst when it came to weaponry, but it proved remarkably hard to find. The aisle did, admittedly, have the Nerf Zombie Strike Doominator and the Nerf Modulus Recon MKII for $34.99 each. Those certainly sounded grim, given the eternal war against the undead, but the bright orange, cartoonish, completely unrealistic \"blasters\" on display and marketed to kids \"eight and up\" seemed distant indeed from American gun carnage (and our wars in distant lands), nor was there anything on the packaging that even hinted at real people getting shot in real encounters or real wars. I must admit that I don't like the idea of Seamus shooting anything at anyone-even a brain-hungry zombie-but as it turned out, I needn't have worried, not this time around anyway. Zombie-killing wasn't in his wheelhouse. Still, I kept looking for the real gun aisle, and I did come across more blasters, dart shooters, and the like, none with the word \"gun\" on them. Of course, we do live in Connecticut, less than 100 miles from Newtown where, in 2012, Adam Lanza, a devotee of violent video games who grew up in a gun-filled house , killed 20 kids just a little older than Seamus along with six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. So maybe our local toy outlet was being sensitive, but I doubt it. There was the Halo UNSC SMG Blaster (the initials make it sound extra tough but stand for nothing) for $19.99, and the NERF Star Wars Episode VII First Order Stormtrooper Deluxe Blaster , which fires 12 darts up to 65 feet without reloading, for $41.99. The worst thing I could find was the Xploderz Mayhem , with \"more distance, more ammo,\" which shoots easy-to-wash off mini-water pellets. It was on clearance for $18.89. By then, Seamus was pulling me frantically toward the aisle with the full Frozen franchise on display. Madeline was now awake and in heaven. So I left them there briefly and snuck off to do a last check for \"real\" toy guns. No such luck. I didn't find the kind of Airsoft gun Tamir Rice was playing with when he was killed. I didn't find an ersatz Sig Sauer either. It turns out that most brick-and-mortar toy stores don't seem to offer realistic-looking toy weaponry anymore, nor is there the toy store equivalent of the curtained-off area in the old neighborhood video rental shop where the porn was available. For such toys, you have to turn to an online world of websites like Kids-Army.com , where you can indeed buy realistic-looking toy rifles, shotguns, and pistols, or even to Amazon, where you can find an Airsoft version of the Sig Sauer rifle for $249.99. \"Start Them Young\" The National Rifle Association (NRA) would undoubtedly have been disappointed by my local Toys \"R\" Us outlet-just as its officials undoubtedly are by the way most big toy merchants seem to have left their more realistic guns for the online world. This happened, in part, in response to the sort of social pressure that my husband engaged in when in high school and-more critically-the almost routine horror of the blurred line between toy guns and real ones. You know we're a quirky, gun-crazy nation when Cleveland could ban toy guns and umbrellas with pointy tips from the area around the Republican Convention in the name of security, but couldn't keep out the real guns in open-carry Ohio. The NRA wants kids to play with realistic toy guns and BB guns, since they believe that such toys are part of a child's initiation into the future ownership of perfectly real guns. At the moment, the gun lobby is concerned that not enough people have guns-even though the 270 million to 310 million of them already amassed around this country (according to the Pew Research Center ) could arm just about every man, woman, transgendered person, and child around. Still, despite the fact that Americans can now carry guns in all 50 states and the NRA continues to win most of the big political fights, the number of households with guns is actually down from its peak in the late 1960s (though those that are armed have more and deadlier weapons than ever before). No wonder the gun industry and the gun lobby are fighting to produce an army of toddlers. \" Start Them Young ,\" a February 2016 report from the Violence Policy Center, details how gun manufacturers and the NRA are eager to market real guns to younger and younger consumers. The report starts with a selection of quotes from the industry, including this gem from Craig Cushman, marketing director for T h ompson/Center Arms , about their Hot Shot rifle for kids: \"[We're] talking about a tiny gun intended for the very youngest shooters-the ultimate first gun. We're targeting the six- to 12-year-old range.\" In other words, kids are literally in their sights. It's a strange world we live in. The toy industry has puffed up and candy-colored its play guns, turned up the volume on the violence online and in video games, and wrapped everything in plastic and safety warnings. At the same time, the gun industry is making its guns smaller and cuter for kids, while putting its energy into the all-important junior market. Can we be safe-any of us-in a nation awash in guns? The gun-and-ammo industry boasted $16 billion in revenue for 2015. Gun stores-from brick-and-mortar shops to online retailers-had $3.1 billion in revenue that same year. The industry as a whole claimed responsibility for nearly $50 billion in \"economic activity\" in 2015 alone. That represents a fair number of jobs, but here is the number that really goes boom: $229 billion. That's the annual cost of fatal and non-fatal gun violence in this country, according to Mother Jones and analyst Ted Miller of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, who teamed up to crunch the numbers. That figure includes both the direct costs of gun injuries and deaths-police investigations, emergency personnel, hospital bills, long-term care for the injured, funeral expenses for the dead, and the costs of prosecuting and imprisoning the perpetrators. As the report concludes: \"Even before accounting for the more intangible costs of the violence... the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America is nearly $400,000. And we pay for 32 of them every single day.\" We are awash in guns. Where does it end? Gun violence is embedded in our national mythology, our foreign policy, our notions of masculinity, our entertainment industry, and our children's play. We see violence solving problems on every screen-from the zombie apocalypse to the rise of ISIS. Russian playwright Anton Chekhov's maxim still applies: \"One should not put a loaded rifle onto the stage if no one is thinking of firing it.\" Sooner or later, that rifle is sure to go off. It might be an accident; it might be terrorism; it might be hate. But it will go off. Somewhere, as you read this, it's going off right now. I don't want to police my kids' imagination. And there is a whole strain of parenting literature that assures me that I don't have to. It says don't interfere with your kid's play, even if it includes guns and shooting and killing. Imagination is imagination and the violence isn't real. It might even, so this line of thinking goes, be a healthy way for them to process feelings of aggression. I get what they're saying, but it seems like a cop-out to me. To my mind, nonintervention is often a missed opportunity to be a parent. Sure, the violence isn't real. The pow-pows don't actually rip skin and tendon or stop hearts from beating, but the United States, which has been fighting distant wars nonstop for 15 years now, does have a violence problem and a man problem and a gun problem. We know where that problem ends, but it starts somewhere, too. One place to begin to look, at least, is at how our kids-particularly our boys-play, and how they are nurtured (or not), and taught to express their emotions (or not). It is, at least in part, up to us, their parents, to decide whether they are going to be the ones who help repair our society and reorient us (or not). And it begins with the kinds of care and love they receive, the kinds of conversations they are invited into, the kinds of expectations they are given about behavior and relationships. I don't want to raise Seamus, Madeline, or Rosena in the austere, ripped from the headlines of horror, polemical atmosphere that was the essence of my own childhood. But I don't want them to get comfortable with killing either. I want so much more for, and from, my little boy than \"Pow, pow, yous are dead now!\" And that starts with taking the gun or the stick or the rainbow flag out of his hands, sitting him down, and having a hard conversation about what guns actually do to people-and how much killing hurts us all.\n\nThose three men and 46 others were massacred on June 12. Another 50 people were wounded. Omar Mateen, who killed them, was armed with a Sig Sauer MCX assault rifle and a Glock 17 9mm semi-automatic pistol . He bought those two weapons legally in the days leading up to the attack. The carnage brought politicians and pundits out in force, using all the usual arguments for and against guns. Because the victims were mostly gay and mostly Latino, and because the attack was carried out by an American citizen with an ethnic last name who may have been enthralled by Islamic terrorism, or a closeted, self-hating homosexual (or both), the commentary quickly became muddled. Was it a hate crime, Islamic terrorism, or a strange double-bonus hit for the haters? Mateen was killed in a shootout with police and so can't speak to his motives. Investigators were left to sift through the material evidence and a dizzying compilation of online comments, Facebook likes, and recollections from old coworkers, family members, and possible lovers in their search for answers. The most essential facts are, however, not that complicated: Mateen had a license to carry a gun, training as a private security guard, and hatreds to act upon. He armed himself and he killed.

Montrell Jackson, 32 Matthew Gerald, 41 Brad Garafola, 45...\" And the killing continues. Using the Gun Violence Archive , I counted another 306 deaths by guns throughout the United States in the first eight days of July alone. Most of them weren't high-profile police shootings or mass tragedies, but in a small-scale and localized way, the grief and outrage of Baton Rouge, St. Paul, and Dallas were replicated in every corner of this country, including Ticfaw, Louisiana; Woodland, California; Tabernacle, New Jersey; and Harvey, Illinois. More than 300 deaths by gun in just eight days. \"Stabbin' My Bunny\": Teaching Kids About Guns and Violence And then, of course, there were my kids, my husband, and those \"guns.\" As a boy, Patrick wasn't allowed to play with toy guns. Instead, he, his parents, and their friends would go to the mall during the Christmas buying spree to put \" Stop War Toys \" stickers on Rambo and G.I. Joe action figures. When he went to his friends' houses, he had to tell them that war toys were verboten . LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS Email I grew up in a similar family of activists. We, too, were forbidden toy guns and other war toys. My brother and I were more likely to play games like \"protester at the Pentagon\" than cops and robbers. I've been thinking recently about why toy guns didn't have a grip on our imaginations as kids. I suspect it was because we understood-were made to understand-what the big gun of US militarism had done in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Indochina, and throughout Central America. Our dad had seen the big gun of war up close and personal. His finger-the same one he pointed at us when we were in trouble-had pulled the trigger again and again in France during World War II. He was decorated there, but had zero nostalgia for the experience. He was, in fact, deeply ashamed of the dashing figure he had once cut when home from the front. And so, Dad screwed up a new kind of courage to say no to war and violence, to killing of any kind. His knowledge of war imbued his nonviolent peace activist mission with a genuine, badass, superhero style swagger. Our parents-our community of ragtag, countercultural Catholic peace activists-made that no-violence, no-killing, no-matter-what point again and again. In fact, my early experience of guns was the chilling fear of knowing that, in protest , my father, mother, and their friends were walking into what they called \"free-fire zones\" on military bases, where well-armed, well-trained soldiers were licensed to kill intruders. So we didn't point toy guns at each other. We didn't pow-pow with our fingers or sticks. We crossed those fingers and hoped that the people we loved would be safe.

Russian playwright Anton Chekhov's maxim still applies: \"One should not put a loaded rifle onto the stage if no one is thinking of firing it.\" Sooner or later, that rifle is sure to go off. It might be an accident; it might be terrorism; it might be hate. But it will go off. Somewhere, as you read this, it's going off right now. I don't want to police my kids' imagination. And there is a whole strain of parenting literature that assures me that I don't have to. It says don't interfere with your kid's play, even if it includes guns and shooting and killing. Imagination is imagination and the violence isn't real. It might even, so this line of thinking goes, be a healthy way for them to process feelings of aggression. I get what they're saying, but it seems like a cop-out to me. To my mind, nonintervention is often a missed opportunity to be a parent. Sure, the violence isn't real. The pow-pows don't actually rip skin and tendon or stop hearts from beating, but the United States, which has been fighting distant wars nonstop for 15 years now, does have a violence problem and a man problem and a gun problem. We know where that problem ends, but it starts somewhere, too. One place to begin to look, at least, is at how our kids-particularly our boys-play, and how they are nurtured (or not), and taught to express their emotions (or not). It is, at least in part, up to us, their parents, to decide whether they are going to be the ones who help repair our society and reorient us (or not). And it begins with the kinds of care and love they receive, the kinds of conversations they are invited into, the kinds of expectations they are given about behavior and relationships. I don't want to raise Seamus, Madeline, or Rosena in the austere, ripped from the headlines of horror, polemical atmosphere that was the essence of my own childhood. But I don't want them to get comfortable with killing either. I want so much more for, and from, my little boy than \"Pow, pow, yous are dead now!\" And that starts with taking the gun or the stick or the rainbow flag out of his hands, sitting him down, and having a hard conversation about what guns actually do to people-and how much killing hurts us all.\n\nThe carnage brought politicians and pundits out in force, using all the usual arguments for and against guns. Because the victims were mostly gay and mostly Latino, and because the attack was carried out by an American citizen with an ethnic last name who may have been enthralled by Islamic terrorism, or a closeted, self-hating homosexual (or both), the commentary quickly became muddled. Was it a hate crime, Islamic terrorism, or a strange double-bonus hit for the haters? Mateen was killed in a shootout with police and so can't speak to his motives. Investigators were left to sift through the material evidence and a dizzying compilation of online comments, Facebook likes, and recollections from old coworkers, family members, and possible lovers in their search for answers. The most essential facts are, however, not that complicated: Mateen had a license to carry a gun, training as a private security guard, and hatreds to act upon. He armed himself and he killed.

Montrell Jackson, 32 Matthew Gerald, 41 Brad Garafola, 45...\" And the killing continues. Using the Gun Violence Archive , I counted another 306 deaths by guns throughout the United States in the first eight days of July alone. Most of them weren't high-profile police shootings or mass tragedies, but in a small-scale and localized way, the grief and outrage of Baton Rouge, St. Paul, and Dallas were replicated in every corner of this country, including Ticfaw, Louisiana; Woodland, California; Tabernacle, New Jersey; and Harvey, Illinois. More than 300 deaths by gun in just eight days. \"Stabbin' My Bunny\": Teaching Kids About Guns and Violence And then, of course, there were my kids, my husband, and those \"guns.\" As a boy, Patrick wasn't allowed to play with toy guns. Instead, he, his parents, and their friends would go to the mall during the Christmas buying spree to put \" Stop War Toys \" stickers on Rambo and G.I. Joe action figures. When he went to his friends' houses, he had to tell them that war toys were verboten . LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS Email I grew up in a similar family of activists. We, too, were forbidden toy guns and other war toys. My brother and I were more likely to play games like \"protester at the Pentagon\" than cops and robbers. I've been thinking recently about why toy guns didn't have a grip on our imaginations as kids. I suspect it was because we understood-were made to understand-what the big gun of US militarism had done in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Indochina, and throughout Central America. Our dad had seen the big gun of war up close and personal. His finger-the same one he pointed at us when we were in trouble-had pulled the trigger again and again in France during World War II. He was decorated there, but had zero nostalgia for the experience. He was, in fact, deeply ashamed of the dashing figure he had once cut when home from the front. And so, Dad screwed up a new kind of courage to say no to war and violence, to killing of any kind. His knowledge of war imbued his nonviolent peace activist mission with a genuine, badass, superhero style swagger. Our parents-our community of ragtag, countercultural Catholic peace activists-made that no-violence, no-killing, no-matter-what point again and again. In fact, my early experience of guns was the chilling fear of knowing that, in protest , my father, mother, and their friends were walking into what they called \"free-fire zones\" on military bases, where well-armed, well-trained soldiers were licensed to kill intruders. So we didn't point toy guns at each other. We didn't pow-pow with our fingers or sticks. We crossed those fingers and hoped that the people we loved would be safe. Our inner city Baltimore neighborhood, where crack cocaine madness was just taking hold, drove that point home on a micro level. Our house was robbed at gunpoint more than once-and we had so little worth taking. We watched a man across the street bleed to death after being stabbed repeatedly in a fight over nothing. People from our house ran to help and were there for far too long before an ambulance even arrived. We knew as little kids that violence was no laughing matter, nor child's play. It was serious business and was to be resisted. As parents tend to do, Patrick and I are passing this tradition on to our kids, hopefully without the emotional scarring that went with our childhoods of resistance. They don't have guns or action figures or any other toy implements of death. Still, we've been watching Seamus, our Team Elsa (from the Disney blockbuster Frozen ) son, as he's recently begun turning every stick into an imaginary gun. This is, of course, happening just as, in the headlines of the moment, actual guns are turning so many previously real people into statistics. Under the circumstances, how could I not find myself thinking about toy guns, real guns, the nature of play, the role of imagination, the place of parents, and how to (or whether to) police (ha!) that imaginary play? When my stepdaughter Rosena was about four, she found a toy dagger at the playground, somehow smuggled it home, and was stabbing one of her beloved stuffed animals, a bunny, repeatedly with it. In the other room, I could hear the thumps on the bedroom floor and called out, \"What are you doing?\" \"Stabbin' my bunny. I kilt her,\" she responded matter-of-factly. Seizing a \"teaching moment\" and undoubtedly gripped by my own childhood experiences and memories of my parents, I blustered into the bedroom with a shoebox. \"Now, your bunny is dead,\" I announced in my version of over-the-top momism. \"You know what happens when living things die, right? It's forever, right? Now, we have to bury her.\" Rosena and I then \"buried\" the doll on a high shelf in her closet. I told her that we cannot hurt or kill the things (or people) we love. I told her that, because she had \"killed\" that bunny, she could never play with it again. About a week later, I slipped it back into her toy basket and, when she asked why, assured her that I thought she wouldn't hurt her toys like that again. She agreed. I recall that episode now with a certain embarrassment, but when I recently heard Rosena explaining death and loss to her little brother and sister, I thought: Oh, maybe the drama of the shoebox burial was actually helpful in some fashion. Toys matter. We've put a fair amount of thought into what might be called toy curation in our household. We've bought nothing new and little used. Mostly, we've accepted shipments of hand-me-downs from friends who just wanted \"this crap\" out of their houses. No guns came with them, thankfully. After all, even toy guns can mean death under the wrong circumstances. A year ago, I visited the Cuddell Recreation Center in Cleveland with my daughter Madeline and a group of friends. That broad stretch of ball fields and paths, anchored by a gazebo and a playground, was where 12-year-old Tamir Rice was fatally shot by Officer Timothy Loehmann in November 2014. Rice, an African American, was playing with an Airsoft pellet gun that a friend's dad had bought at Walmart . A replica of an actual Colt pistol, it shot plastic pellets and looked pretty real, since the orange tip signifying \"toy\" was missing. However, Officer Loehmann, investigating a report that a man was carrying a gun in the park, was moving too fast to notice much. He sped up and began shooting even before his squad car stopped moving. Rice's hands were still reportedly in his pockets. Though Loehmann was not indicted, the city of Cleveland paid a $6 million settlement to the Rice family and demolished the gazebo where the boy was shot. In the park that day, local activists described the shooting and its aftermath to our group. Half listening, I followed Madeline as she toddled into the playground. I tried to imagine Samaria Rice's pain in this unremarkable place made part shrine, part soapbox by a police officer's quick trigger finger, racism, and her son's blood. I thought about that toy gun in Tamir Rice's hand and what might have been going through his head as he pointed it and played with it. Despite the age difference, it couldn't have been that far from what regularly goes through my son's head when he picks up a stick and points it: pop, boom, wow! The difference, of course, is that Seamus, blond and freckled and unmistakably white, would run little risk of being shot down by a policeman, even eight years from now with a replica toy gun in his hands. Blasters, Blasters, Everywhere Toys are a big business in this country, raking in $19.4 billion in 2015, according to the retail tracking firm NPD Group . Our family is not responsible for even a dime of this. Not surprisingly, then, my announcement that we were all going to spend a rainy afternoon at a local Toys \"R\" Us store came like a bolt from the blue for the kids. I wanted to see what kind of toy weaponry was for sale there. I was curious, among other things, about whether the boys at school who had taught Seamus about superheroes, bad guys, and Star Wars had ignited in my son a love of weaponry; I was curious, that is, as to how he would react to the walls of guns I imagined Toys \"R\" Us displaying. We got into our car as if it were Christmas Eve, Seamus beside himself with excitement, Madeline on a contact high from her brother. I was experiencing my own contact high, taking my kids on their first research trip. What we found was not exactly what I expected-on many levels. Seamus was quickly overwhelmed by the glut of everything-lots of pictures of toys on boxes, but not a lot to pick up. (It was, in that sense, the very opposite of our visits to the Goodwill store, where you can sit on the floor and play with all those second-hand toys as long as you put them back afterwards.) Not so surprisingly, in retrospect, he went straight for what was familiar, what he could grab in his hand and actually look at: the books. It took some effort to wrestle him away from Five Stories About Princesses and enlist him in my quest for bad toys. (Madeline had, by then, fallen asleep.) I had finally found the Nerf \"blasters,\" but he wasn't interested. \"Let's not go down this aisle, okay, Mom?\" I was, of course, looking for the worst of the worst when it came to weaponry, but it proved remarkably hard to find. The aisle did, admittedly, have the Nerf Zombie Strike Doominator and the Nerf Modulus Recon MKII for $34.99 each. Those certainly sounded grim, given the eternal war against the undead, but the bright orange, cartoonish, completely unrealistic \"blasters\" on display and marketed to kids \"eight and up\" seemed distant indeed from American gun carnage (and our wars in distant lands), nor was there anything on the packaging that even hinted at real people getting shot in real encounters or real wars. I must admit that I don't like the idea of Seamus shooting anything at anyone-even a brain-hungry zombie-but as it turned out, I needn't have worried, not this time around anyway. Zombie-killing wasn't in his wheelhouse. Still, I kept looking for the real gun aisle, and I did come across more blasters, dart shooters, and the like, none with the word \"gun\" on them. Of course, we do live in Connecticut, less than 100 miles from Newtown where, in 2012, Adam Lanza, a devotee of violent video games who grew up in a gun-filled house , killed 20 kids just a little older than Seamus along with six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. So maybe our local toy outlet was being sensitive, but I doubt it. There was the Halo UNSC SMG Blaster (the initials make it sound extra tough but stand for nothing) for $19.99, and the NERF Star Wars Episode VII First Order Stormtrooper Deluxe Blaster , which fires 12 darts up to 65 feet without reloading, for $41.99. The worst thing I could find was the Xploderz Mayhem , with \"more distance, more ammo,\" which shoots easy-to-wash off mini-water pellets. It was on clearance for $18.89. By then, Seamus was pulling me frantically toward the aisle with the full Frozen franchise on display. Madeline was now awake and in heaven. So I left them there briefly and snuck off to do a last check for \"real\" toy guns. No such luck. I didn't find the kind of Airsoft gun Tamir Rice was playing with when he was killed. I didn't find an ersatz Sig Sauer either. It turns out that most brick-and-mortar toy stores don't seem to offer realistic-looking toy weaponry anymore, nor is there the toy store equivalent of the curtained-off area in the old neighborhood video rental shop where the porn was available. For such toys, you have to turn to an online world of websites like Kids-Army.com , where you can indeed buy realistic-looking toy rifles, shotguns, and pistols, or even to Amazon, where you can find an Airsoft version of the Sig Sauer rifle for $249.99. \"Start Them Young\" The National Rifle Association (NRA) would undoubtedly have been disappointed by my local Toys \"R\" Us outlet-just as its officials undoubtedly are by the way most big toy merchants seem to have left their more realistic guns for the online world. This happened, in part, in response to the sort of social pressure that my husband engaged in when in high school and-more critically-the almost routine horror of the blurred line between toy guns and real ones. You know we're a quirky, gun-crazy nation when Cleveland could ban toy guns and umbrellas with pointy tips from the area around the Republican Convention in the name of security, but couldn't keep out the real guns in open-carry Ohio. The NRA wants kids to play with realistic toy guns and BB guns, since they believe that such toys are part of a child's initiation into the future ownership of perfectly real guns. At the moment, the gun lobby is concerned that not enough people have guns-even though the 270 million to 310 million of them already amassed around this country (according to the Pew Research Center ) could arm just about every man, woman, transgendered person, and child around. Still, despite the fact that Americans can now carry guns in all 50 states and the NRA continues to win most of the big political fights, the number of households with guns is actually down from its peak in the late 1960s (though those that are armed have more and deadlier weapons than ever before). No wonder the gun industry and the gun lobby are fighting to produce an army of toddlers. \" Start Them Young ,\" a February 2016 report from the Violence Policy Center, details how gun manufacturers and the NRA are eager to market real guns to younger and younger consumers. The report starts with a selection of quotes from the industry, including this gem from Craig Cushman, marketing director for T h ompson/Center Arms , about their Hot Shot rifle for kids: \"[We're] talking about a tiny gun intended for the very youngest shooters-the ultimate first gun. We're targeting the six- to 12-year-old range.\" In other words, kids are literally in their sights. It's a strange world we live in. The toy industry has puffed up and candy-colored its play guns, turned up the volume on the violence online and in video games, and wrapped everything in plastic and safety warnings. At the same time, the gun industry is making its guns smaller and cuter for kids, while putting its energy into the all-important junior market. Can we be safe-any of us-in a nation awash in guns? The gun-and-ammo industry boasted $16 billion in revenue for 2015. Gun stores-from brick-and-mortar shops to online retailers-had $3.1 billion in revenue that same year. The industry as a whole claimed responsibility for nearly $50 billion in \"economic activity\" in 2015 alone. That represents a fair number of jobs, but here is the number that really goes boom: $229 billion. That's the annual cost of fatal and non-fatal gun violence in this country, according to Mother Jones and analyst Ted Miller of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, who teamed up to crunch the numbers. That figure includes both the direct costs of gun injuries and deaths-police investigations, emergency personnel, hospital bills, long-term care for the injured, funeral expenses for the dead, and the costs of prosecuting and imprisoning the perpetrators. As the report concludes: \"Even before accounting for the more intangible costs of the violence... the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America is nearly $400,000. And we pay for 32 of them every single day.\" We are awash in guns. Where does it end? Gun violence is embedded in our national mythology, our foreign policy, our notions of masculinity, our entertainment industry, and our children's play. We see violence solving problems on every screen-from the zombie apocalypse to the rise of ISIS.

Those certainly sounded grim, given the eternal war against the undead, but the bright orange, cartoonish, completely unrealistic \"blasters\" on display and marketed to kids \"eight and up\" seemed distant indeed from American gun carnage (and our wars in distant lands), nor was there anything on the packaging that even hinted at real people getting shot in real encounters or real wars. I must admit that I don't like the idea of Seamus shooting anything at anyone-even a brain-hungry zombie-but as it turned out, I needn't have worried, not this time around anyway. Zombie-killing wasn't in his wheelhouse. Still, I kept looking for the real gun aisle, and I did come across more blasters, dart shooters, and the like, none with the word \"gun\" on them. Of course, we do live in Connecticut, less than 100 miles from Newtown where, in 2012, Adam Lanza, a devotee of violent video games who grew up in a gun-filled house , killed 20 kids just a little older than Seamus along with six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. So maybe our local toy outlet was being sensitive, but I doubt it. There was the Halo UNSC SMG Blaster (the initials make it sound extra tough but stand for nothing) for $19.99, and the NERF Star Wars Episode VII First Order Stormtrooper Deluxe Blaster , which fires 12 darts up to 65 feet without reloading, for $41.99. The worst thing I could find was the Xploderz Mayhem , with \"more distance, more ammo,\" which shoots easy-to-wash off mini-water pellets. It was on clearance for $18.89. By then, Seamus was pulling me frantically toward the aisle with the full Frozen franchise on display. Madeline was now awake and in heaven. So I left them there briefly and snuck off to do a last check for \"real\" toy guns. No such luck. I didn't find the kind of Airsoft gun Tamir Rice was playing with when he was killed. I didn't find an ersatz Sig Sauer either. It turns out that most brick-and-mortar toy stores don't seem to offer realistic-looking toy weaponry anymore, nor is there the toy store equivalent of the curtained-off area in the old neighborhood video rental shop where the porn was available. For such toys, you have to turn to an online world of websites like Kids-Army.com , where you can indeed buy realistic-looking toy rifles, shotguns, and pistols, or even to Amazon, where you can find an Airsoft version of the Sig Sauer rifle for $249.99. \"Start Them Young\" The National Rifle Association (NRA) would undoubtedly have been disappointed by my local Toys \"R\" Us outlet-just as its officials undoubtedly are by the way most big toy merchants seem to have left their more realistic guns for the online world. This happened, in part, in response to the sort of social pressure that my husband engaged in when in high school and-more critically-the almost routine horror of the blurred line between toy guns and real ones. You know we're a quirky, gun-crazy nation when Cleveland could ban toy guns and umbrellas with pointy tips from the area around the Republican Convention in the name of security, but couldn't keep out the real guns in open-carry Ohio. The NRA wants kids to play with realistic toy guns and BB guns, since they believe that such toys are part of a child's initiation into the future ownership of perfectly real guns. At the moment, the gun lobby is concerned that not enough people have guns-even though the 270 million to 310 million of them already amassed around this country (according to the Pew Research Center ) could arm just about every man, woman, transgendered person, and child around. Still, despite the fact that Americans can now carry guns in all 50 states and the NRA continues to win most of the big political fights, the number of households with guns is actually down from its peak in the late 1960s (though those that are armed have more and deadlier weapons than ever before). No wonder the gun industry and the gun lobby are fighting to produce an army of toddlers. \" Start Them Young ,\" a February 2016 report from the Violence Policy Center, details how gun manufacturers and the NRA are eager to market real guns to younger and younger consumers. The report starts with a selection of quotes from the industry, including this gem from Craig Cushman, marketing director for T h ompson/Center Arms , about their Hot Shot rifle for kids: \"[We're] talking about a tiny gun intended for the very youngest shooters-the ultimate first gun. We're targeting the six- to 12-year-old range.\" In other words, kids are literally in their sights. It's a strange world we live in. The toy industry has puffed up and candy-colored its play guns, turned up the volume on the violence online and in video games, and wrapped everything in plastic and safety warnings. At the same time, the gun industry is making its guns smaller and cuter for kids, while putting its energy into the all-important junior market. Can we be safe-any of us-in a nation awash in guns? The gun-and-ammo industry boasted $16 billion in revenue for 2015. Gun stores-from brick-and-mortar shops to online retailers-had $3.1 billion in revenue that same year. The industry as a whole claimed responsibility for nearly $50 billion in \"economic activity\" in 2015 alone. That represents a fair number of jobs, but here is the number that really goes boom: $229 billion. That's the annual cost of fatal and non-fatal gun violence in this country, according to Mother Jones and analyst Ted Miller of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, who teamed up to crunch the numbers. That figure includes both the direct costs of gun injuries and deaths-police investigations, emergency personnel, hospital bills, long-term care for the injured, funeral expenses for the dead, and the costs of prosecuting and imprisoning the perpetrators. As the report concludes: \"Even before accounting for the more intangible costs of the violence... the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America is nearly $400,000. And we pay for 32 of them every single day.\" We are awash in guns. Where does it end? Gun violence is embedded in our national mythology, our foreign policy, our notions of masculinity, our entertainment industry, and our children's play. We see violence solving problems on every screen-from the zombie apocalypse to the rise of ISIS. Russian playwright Anton Chekhov's maxim still applies: \"One should not put a loaded rifle onto the stage if no one is thinking of firing it.\" Sooner or later, that rifle is sure to go off. It might be an accident; it might be terrorism; it might be hate. But it will go off. Somewhere, as you read this, it's going off right now. I don't want to police my kids' imagination. And there is a whole strain of parenting literature that assures me that I don't have to. It says don't interfere with your kid's play, even if it includes guns and shooting and killing. Imagination is imagination and the violence isn't real. It might even, so this line of thinking goes, be a healthy way for them to process feelings of aggression. I get what they're saying, but it seems like a cop-out to me. To my mind, nonintervention is often a missed opportunity to be a parent. Sure, the violence isn't real. The pow-pows don't actually rip skin and tendon or stop hearts from beating, but the United States, which has been fighting distant wars nonstop for 15 years now, does have a violence problem and a man problem and a gun problem. We know where that problem ends, but it starts somewhere, too. One place to begin to look, at least, is at how our kids-particularly our boys-play, and how they are nurtured (or not), and taught to express their emotions (or not). It is, at least in part, up to us, their parents, to decide whether they are going to be the ones who help repair our society and reorient us (or not). And it begins with the kinds of care and love they receive, the kinds of conversations they are invited into, the kinds of expectations they are given about behavior and relationships. I don't want to raise Seamus, Madeline, or Rosena in the austere, ripped from the headlines of horror, polemical atmosphere that was the essence of my own childhood. But I don't want them to get comfortable with killing either. I want so much more for, and from, my little boy than \"Pow, pow, yous are dead now!\" And that starts with taking the gun or the stick or the rainbow flag out of his hands, sitting him down, and having a hard conversation about what guns actually do to people-and how much killing hurts us all.\n\nJeet Heer\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nJeet Heer\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nAnd all over the country, since that fateful day that elicited the usual cries of \"never again,\" the killing continues: Alton Sterling and Philando Castille , by the police; Dallas Area Rapid Transit Police Officer Brent Thompson and four Dallas Police officers, Lorne Ahrens, Michael Smith, Michael Krol, and Patrick Zamarripa, by a lone sniper, Micah Johnson, who himself was then killed by an armed police robot; three more police officers in Baton Rouge on July 17. \"... Montrell Jackson, 32 Matthew Gerald, 41 Brad Garafola, 45...\" And the killing continues. Using the Gun Violence Archive , I counted another 306 deaths by guns throughout the United States in the first eight days of July alone. Most of them weren't high-profile police shootings or mass tragedies, but in a small-scale and localized way, the grief and outrage of Baton Rouge, St. Paul, and Dallas were replicated in every corner of this country, including Ticfaw, Louisiana; Woodland, California; Tabernacle, New Jersey; and Harvey, Illinois. More than 300 deaths by gun in just eight days. \"Stabbin' My Bunny\": Teaching Kids About Guns and Violence And then, of course, there were my kids, my husband, and those \"guns.\" As a boy, Patrick wasn't allowed to play with toy guns. Instead, he, his parents, and their friends would go to the mall during the Christmas buying spree to put \" Stop War Toys \" stickers on Rambo and G.I. Joe action figures. When he went to his friends' houses, he had to tell them that war toys were verboten . LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS Email I grew up in a similar family of activists. We, too, were forbidden toy guns and other war toys. My brother and I were more likely to play games like \"protester at the Pentagon\" than cops and robbers. I've been thinking recently about why toy guns didn't have a grip on our imaginations as kids. I suspect it was because we understood-were made to understand-what the big gun of US militarism had done in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Indochina, and throughout Central America. Our dad had seen the big gun of war up close and personal. His finger-the same one he pointed at us when we were in trouble-had pulled the trigger again and again in France during World War II. He was decorated there, but had zero nostalgia for the experience. He was, in fact, deeply ashamed of the dashing figure he had once cut when home from the front. And so, Dad screwed up a new kind of courage to say no to war and violence, to killing of any kind. His knowledge of war imbued his nonviolent peace activist mission with a genuine, badass, superhero style swagger. Our parents-our community of ragtag, countercultural Catholic peace activists-made that no-violence, no-killing, no-matter-what point again and again. In fact, my early experience of guns was the chilling fear of knowing that, in protest , my father, mother, and their friends were walking into what they called \"free-fire zones\" on military bases, where well-armed, well-trained soldiers were licensed to kill intruders. So we didn't point toy guns at each other. We didn't pow-pow with our fingers or sticks. We crossed those fingers and hoped that the people we loved would be safe. Our inner city Baltimore neighborhood, where crack cocaine madness was just taking hold, drove that point home on a micro level. Our house was robbed at gunpoint more than once-and we had so little worth taking. We watched a man across the street bleed to death after being stabbed repeatedly in a fight over nothing. People from our house ran to help and were there for far too long before an ambulance even arrived. We knew as little kids that violence was no laughing matter, nor child's play. It was serious business and was to be resisted. As parents tend to do, Patrick and I are passing this tradition on to our kids, hopefully without the emotional scarring that went with our childhoods of resistance. They don't have guns or action figures or any other toy implements of death. Still, we've been watching Seamus, our Team Elsa (from the Disney blockbuster Frozen ) son, as he's recently begun turning every stick into an imaginary gun. This is, of course, happening just as, in the headlines of the moment, actual guns are turning so many previously real people into statistics. Under the circumstances, how could I not find myself thinking about toy guns, real guns, the nature of play, the role of imagination, the place of parents, and how to (or whether to) police (ha!) that imaginary play? When my stepdaughter Rosena was about four, she found a toy dagger at the playground, somehow smuggled it home, and was stabbing one of her beloved stuffed animals, a bunny, repeatedly with it. In the other room, I could hear the thumps on the bedroom floor and called out, \"What are you doing?\" \"Stabbin' my bunny. I kilt her,\" she responded matter-of-factly. Seizing a \"teaching moment\" and undoubtedly gripped by my own childhood experiences and memories of my parents, I blustered into the bedroom with a shoebox. \"Now, your bunny is dead,\" I announced in my version of over-the-top momism. \"You know what happens when living things die, right? It's forever, right? Now, we have to bury her.\" Rosena and I then \"buried\" the doll on a high shelf in her closet. I told her that we cannot hurt or kill the things (or people) we love. I told her that, because she had \"killed\" that bunny, she could never play with it again. About a week later, I slipped it back into her toy basket and, when she asked why, assured her that I thought she wouldn't hurt her toys like that again. She agreed. I recall that episode now with a certain embarrassment, but when I recently heard Rosena explaining death and loss to her little brother and sister, I thought: Oh, maybe the drama of the shoebox burial was actually helpful in some fashion. Toys matter. We've put a fair amount of thought into what might be called toy curation in our household. We've bought nothing new and little used. Mostly, we've accepted shipments of hand-me-downs from friends who just wanted \"this crap\" out of their houses. No guns came with them, thankfully. After all, even toy guns can mean death under the wrong circumstances. A year ago, I visited the Cuddell Recreation Center in Cleveland with my daughter Madeline and a group of friends. That broad stretch of ball fields and paths, anchored by a gazebo and a playground, was where 12-year-old Tamir Rice was fatally shot by Officer Timothy Loehmann in November 2014. Rice, an African American, was playing with an Airsoft pellet gun that a friend's dad had bought at Walmart . A replica of an actual Colt pistol, it shot plastic pellets and looked pretty real, since the orange tip signifying \"toy\" was missing. However, Officer Loehmann, investigating a report that a man was carrying a gun in the park, was moving too fast to notice much. He sped up and began shooting even before his squad car stopped moving. Rice's hands were still reportedly in his pockets. Though Loehmann was not indicted, the city of Cleveland paid a $6 million settlement to the Rice family and demolished the gazebo where the boy was shot. In the park that day, local activists described the shooting and its aftermath to our group. Half listening, I followed Madeline as she toddled into the playground. I tried to imagine Samaria Rice's pain in this unremarkable place made part shrine, part soapbox by a police officer's quick trigger finger, racism, and her son's blood. I thought about that toy gun in Tamir Rice's hand and what might have been going through his head as he pointed it and played with it. Despite the age difference, it couldn't have been that far from what regularly goes through my son's head when he picks up a stick and points it: pop, boom, wow! The difference, of course, is that Seamus, blond and freckled and unmistakably white, would run little risk of being shot down by a policeman, even eight years from now with a replica toy gun in his hands. Blasters, Blasters, Everywhere Toys are a big business in this country, raking in $19.4 billion in 2015, according to the retail tracking firm NPD Group . Our family is not responsible for even a dime of this. Not surprisingly, then, my announcement that we were all going to spend a rainy afternoon at a local Toys \"R\" Us store came like a bolt from the blue for the kids. I wanted to see what kind of toy weaponry was for sale there. I was curious, among other things, about whether the boys at school who had taught Seamus about superheroes, bad guys, and Star Wars had ignited in my son a love of weaponry; I was curious, that is, as to how he would react to the walls of guns I imagined Toys \"R\" Us displaying. We got into our car as if it were Christmas Eve, Seamus beside himself with excitement, Madeline on a contact high from her brother. I was experiencing my own contact high, taking my kids on their first research trip. What we found was not exactly what I expected-on many levels. Seamus was quickly overwhelmed by the glut of everything-lots of pictures of toys on boxes, but not a lot to pick up. (It was, in that sense, the very opposite of our visits to the Goodwill store, where you can sit on the floor and play with all those second-hand toys as long as you put them back afterwards.) Not so surprisingly, in retrospect, he went straight for what was familiar, what he could grab in his hand and actually look at: the books. It took some effort to wrestle him away from Five Stories About Princesses and enlist him in my quest for bad toys. (Madeline had, by then, fallen asleep.) I had finally found the Nerf \"blasters,\" but he wasn't interested. \"Let's not go down this aisle, okay, Mom?\" I was, of course, looking for the worst of the worst when it came to weaponry, but it proved remarkably hard to find. The aisle did, admittedly, have the Nerf Zombie Strike Doominator and the Nerf Modulus Recon MKII for $34.99 each. Those certainly sounded grim, given the eternal war against the undead, but the bright orange, cartoonish, completely unrealistic \"blasters\" on display and marketed to kids \"eight and up\" seemed distant indeed from American gun carnage (and our wars in distant lands), nor was there anything on the packaging that even hinted at real people getting shot in real encounters or real wars. I must admit that I don't like the idea of Seamus shooting anything at anyone-even a brain-hungry zombie-but as it turned out, I needn't have worried, not this time around anyway. Zombie-killing wasn't in his wheelhouse. Still, I kept looking for the real gun aisle, and I did come across more blasters, dart shooters, and the like, none with the word \"gun\" on them. Of course, we do live in Connecticut, less than 100 miles from Newtown where, in 2012, Adam Lanza, a devotee of violent video games who grew up in a gun-filled house , killed 20 kids just a little older than Seamus along with six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. So maybe our local toy outlet was being sensitive, but I doubt it. There was the Halo UNSC SMG Blaster (the initials make it sound extra tough but stand for nothing) for $19.99, and the NERF Star Wars Episode VII First Order Stormtrooper Deluxe Blaster , which fires 12 darts up to 65 feet without reloading, for $41.99. The worst thing I could find was the Xploderz Mayhem , with \"more distance, more ammo,\" which shoots easy-to-wash off mini-water pellets. It was on clearance for $18.89. By then, Seamus was pulling me frantically toward the aisle with the full Frozen franchise on display. Madeline was now awake and in heaven.

In the park that day, local activists described the shooting and its aftermath to our group. Half listening, I followed Madeline as she toddled into the playground. I tried to imagine Samaria Rice's pain in this unremarkable place made part shrine, part soapbox by a police officer's quick trigger finger, racism, and her son's blood. I thought about that toy gun in Tamir Rice's hand and what might have been going through his head as he pointed it and played with it. Despite the age difference, it couldn't have been that far from what regularly goes through my son's head when he picks up a stick and points it: pop, boom, wow! The difference, of course, is that Seamus, blond and freckled and unmistakably white, would run little risk of being shot down by a policeman, even eight years from now with a replica toy gun in his hands. Blasters, Blasters, Everywhere Toys are a big business in this country, raking in $19.4 billion in 2015, according to the retail tracking firm NPD Group . Our family is not responsible for even a dime of this. Not surprisingly, then, my announcement that we were all going to spend a rainy afternoon at a local Toys \"R\" Us store came like a bolt from the blue for the kids. I wanted to see what kind of toy weaponry was for sale there. I was curious, among other things, about whether the boys at school who had taught Seamus about superheroes, bad guys, and Star Wars had ignited in my son a love of weaponry; I was curious, that is, as to how he would react to the walls of guns I imagined Toys \"R\" Us displaying. We got into our car as if it were Christmas Eve, Seamus beside himself with excitement, Madeline on a contact high from her brother. I was experiencing my own contact high, taking my kids on their first research trip. What we found was not exactly what I expected-on many levels. Seamus was quickly overwhelmed by the glut of everything-lots of pictures of toys on boxes, but not a lot to pick up. (It was, in that sense, the very opposite of our visits to the Goodwill store, where you can sit on the floor and play with all those second-hand toys as long as you put them back afterwards.) Not so surprisingly, in retrospect, he went straight for what was familiar, what he could grab in his hand and actually look at: the books. It took some effort to wrestle him away from Five Stories About Princesses and enlist him in my quest for bad toys. (Madeline had, by then, fallen asleep.) I had finally found the Nerf \"blasters,\" but he wasn't interested. \"Let's not go down this aisle, okay, Mom?\" I was, of course, looking for the worst of the worst when it came to weaponry, but it proved remarkably hard to find. The aisle did, admittedly, have the Nerf Zombie Strike Doominator and the Nerf Modulus Recon MKII for $34.99 each. Those certainly sounded grim, given the eternal war against the undead, but the bright orange, cartoonish, completely unrealistic \"blasters\" on display and marketed to kids \"eight and up\" seemed distant indeed from American gun carnage (and our wars in distant lands), nor was there anything on the packaging that even hinted at real people getting shot in real encounters or real wars. I must admit that I don't like the idea of Seamus shooting anything at anyone-even a brain-hungry zombie-but as it turned out, I needn't have worried, not this time around anyway. Zombie-killing wasn't in his wheelhouse. Still, I kept looking for the real gun aisle, and I did come across more blasters, dart shooters, and the like, none with the word \"gun\" on them. Of course, we do live in Connecticut, less than 100 miles from Newtown where, in 2012, Adam Lanza, a devotee of violent video games who grew up in a gun-filled house , killed 20 kids just a little older than Seamus along with six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. So maybe our local toy outlet was being sensitive, but I doubt it. There was the Halo UNSC SMG Blaster (the initials make it sound extra tough but stand for nothing) for $19.99, and the NERF Star Wars Episode VII First Order Stormtrooper Deluxe Blaster , which fires 12 darts up to 65 feet without reloading, for $41.99. The worst thing I could find was the Xploderz Mayhem , with \"more distance, more ammo,\" which shoots easy-to-wash off mini-water pellets. It was on clearance for $18.89. By then, Seamus was pulling me frantically toward the aisle with the full Frozen franchise on display. Madeline was now awake and in heaven. So I left them there briefly and snuck off to do a last check for \"real\" toy guns. No such luck. I didn't find the kind of Airsoft gun Tamir Rice was playing with when he was killed. I didn't find an ersatz Sig Sauer either. It turns out that most brick-and-mortar toy stores don't seem to offer realistic-looking toy weaponry anymore, nor is there the toy store equivalent of the curtained-off area in the old neighborhood video rental shop where the porn was available. For such toys, you have to turn to an online world of websites like Kids-Army.com , where you can indeed buy realistic-looking toy rifles, shotguns, and pistols, or even to Amazon, where you can find an Airsoft version of the Sig Sauer rifle for $249.99. \"Start Them Young\" The National Rifle Association (NRA) would undoubtedly have been disappointed by my local Toys \"R\" Us outlet-just as its officials undoubtedly are by the way most big toy merchants seem to have left their more realistic guns for the online world. This happened, in part, in response to the sort of social pressure that my husband engaged in when in high school and-more critically-the almost routine horror of the blurred line between toy guns and real ones. You know we're a quirky, gun-crazy nation when Cleveland could ban toy guns and umbrellas with pointy tips from the area around the Republican Convention in the name of security, but couldn't keep out the real guns in open-carry Ohio. The NRA wants kids to play with realistic toy guns and BB guns, since they believe that such toys are part of a child's initiation into the future ownership of perfectly real guns. At the moment, the gun lobby is concerned that not enough people have guns-even though the 270 million to 310 million of them already amassed around this country (according to the Pew Research Center ) could arm just about every man, woman, transgendered person, and child around. Still, despite the fact that Americans can now carry guns in all 50 states and the NRA continues to win most of the big political fights, the number of households with guns is actually down from its peak in the late 1960s (though those that are armed have more and deadlier weapons than ever before). No wonder the gun industry and the gun lobby are fighting to produce an army of toddlers. \" Start Them Young ,\" a February 2016 report from the Violence Policy Center, details how gun manufacturers and the NRA are eager to market real guns to younger and younger consumers. The report starts with a selection of quotes from the industry, including this gem from Craig Cushman, marketing director for T h ompson/Center Arms , about their Hot Shot rifle for kids: \"[We're] talking about a tiny gun intended for the very youngest shooters-the ultimate first gun. We're targeting the six- to 12-year-old range.\" In other words, kids are literally in their sights. It's a strange world we live in. The toy industry has puffed up and candy-colored its play guns, turned up the volume on the violence online and in video games, and wrapped everything in plastic and safety warnings. At the same time, the gun industry is making its guns smaller and cuter for kids, while putting its energy into the all-important junior market. Can we be safe-any of us-in a nation awash in guns? The gun-and-ammo industry boasted $16 billion in revenue for 2015. Gun stores-from brick-and-mortar shops to online retailers-had $3.1 billion in revenue that same year. The industry as a whole claimed responsibility for nearly $50 billion in \"economic activity\" in 2015 alone. That represents a fair number of jobs, but here is the number that really goes boom: $229 billion. That's the annual cost of fatal and non-fatal gun violence in this country, according to Mother Jones and analyst Ted Miller of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, who teamed up to crunch the numbers. That figure includes both the direct costs of gun injuries and deaths-police investigations, emergency personnel, hospital bills, long-term care for the injured, funeral expenses for the dead, and the costs of prosecuting and imprisoning the perpetrators. As the report concludes: \"Even before accounting for the more intangible costs of the violence... the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America is nearly $400,000. And we pay for 32 of them every single day.\" We are awash in guns. Where does it end? Gun violence is embedded in our national mythology, our foreign policy, our notions of masculinity, our entertainment industry, and our children's play. We see violence solving problems on every screen-from the zombie apocalypse to the rise of ISIS. Russian playwright Anton Chekhov's maxim still applies: \"One should not put a loaded rifle onto the stage if no one is thinking of firing it.\" Sooner or later, that rifle is sure to go off. It might be an accident; it might be terrorism; it might be hate. But it will go off. Somewhere, as you read this, it's going off right now. I don't want to police my kids' imagination. And there is a whole strain of parenting literature that assures me that I don't have to. It says don't interfere with your kid's play, even if it includes guns and shooting and killing. Imagination is imagination and the violence isn't real. It might even, so this line of thinking goes, be a healthy way for them to process feelings of aggression. I get what they're saying, but it seems like a cop-out to me. To my mind, nonintervention is often a missed opportunity to be a parent. Sure, the violence isn't real. The pow-pows don't actually rip skin and tendon or stop hearts from beating, but the United States, which has been fighting distant wars nonstop for 15 years now, does have a violence problem and a man problem and a gun problem. We know where that problem ends, but it starts somewhere, too. One place to begin to look, at least, is at how our kids-particularly our boys-play, and how they are nurtured (or not), and taught to express their emotions (or not). It is, at least in part, up to us, their parents, to decide whether they are going to be the ones who help repair our society and reorient us (or not). And it begins with the kinds of care and love they receive, the kinds of conversations they are invited into, the kinds of expectations they are given about behavior and relationships. I don't want to raise Seamus, Madeline, or Rosena in the austere, ripped from the headlines of horror, polemical atmosphere that was the essence of my own childhood. But I don't want them to get comfortable with killing either. I want so much more for, and from, my little boy than \"Pow, pow, yous are dead now!\" And that starts with taking the gun or the stick or the rainbow flag out of his hands, sitting him down, and having a hard conversation about what guns actually do to people-and how much killing hurts us all.\n\nAnd the killing continues. Using the Gun Violence Archive , I counted another 306 deaths by guns throughout the United States in the first eight days of July alone. Most of them weren't high-profile police shootings or mass tragedies, but in a small-scale and localized way, the grief and outrage of Baton Rouge, St. Paul, and Dallas were replicated in every corner of this country, including Ticfaw, Louisiana; Woodland, California; Tabernacle, New Jersey; and Harvey, Illinois. More than 300 deaths by gun in just eight days. \"Stabbin' My Bunny\": Teaching Kids About Guns and Violence And then, of course, there were my kids, my husband, and those \"guns.\" As a boy, Patrick wasn't allowed to play with toy guns. Instead, he, his parents, and their friends would go to the mall during the Christmas buying spree to put \" Stop War Toys \" stickers on Rambo and G.I. Joe action figures. When he went to his friends' houses, he had to tell them that war toys were verboten . LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS Email I grew up in a similar family of activists. We, too, were forbidden toy guns and other war toys. My brother and I were more likely to play games like \"protester at the Pentagon\" than cops and robbers. I've been thinking recently about why toy guns didn't have a grip on our imaginations as kids. I suspect it was because we understood-were made to understand-what the big gun of US militarism had done in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Indochina, and throughout Central America. Our dad had seen the big gun of war up close and personal. His finger-the same one he pointed at us when we were in trouble-had pulled the trigger again and again in France during World War II. He was decorated there, but had zero nostalgia for the experience. He was, in fact, deeply ashamed of the dashing figure he had once cut when home from the front. And so, Dad screwed up a new kind of courage to say no to war and violence, to killing of any kind. His knowledge of war imbued his nonviolent peace activist mission with a genuine, badass, superhero style swagger. Our parents-our community of ragtag, countercultural Catholic peace activists-made that no-violence, no-killing, no-matter-what point again and again. In fact, my early experience of guns was the chilling fear of knowing that, in protest , my father, mother, and their friends were walking into what they called \"free-fire zones\" on military bases, where well-armed, well-trained soldiers were licensed to kill intruders. So we didn't point toy guns at each other. We didn't pow-pow with our fingers or sticks. We crossed those fingers and hoped that the people we loved would be safe. Our inner city Baltimore neighborhood, where crack cocaine madness was just taking hold, drove that point home on a micro level. Our house was robbed at gunpoint more than once-and we had so little worth taking. We watched a man across the street bleed to death after being stabbed repeatedly in a fight over nothing. People from our house ran to help and were there for far too long before an ambulance even arrived. We knew as little kids that violence was no laughing matter, nor child's play. It was serious business and was to be resisted. As parents tend to do, Patrick and I are passing this tradition on to our kids, hopefully without the emotional scarring that went with our childhoods of resistance. They don't have guns or action figures or any other toy implements of death. Still, we've been watching Seamus, our Team Elsa (from the Disney blockbuster Frozen ) son, as he's recently begun turning every stick into an imaginary gun. This is, of course, happening just as, in the headlines of the moment, actual guns are turning so many previously real people into statistics. Under the circumstances, how could I not find myself thinking about toy guns, real guns, the nature of play, the role of imagination, the place of parents, and how to (or whether to) police (ha!) that imaginary play? When my stepdaughter Rosena was about four, she found a toy dagger at the playground, somehow smuggled it home, and was stabbing one of her beloved stuffed animals, a bunny, repeatedly with it. In the other room, I could hear the thumps on the bedroom floor and called out, \"What are you doing?\" \"Stabbin' my bunny. I kilt her,\" she responded matter-of-factly. Seizing a \"teaching moment\" and undoubtedly gripped by my own childhood experiences and memories of my parents, I blustered into the bedroom with a shoebox. \"Now, your bunny is dead,\" I announced in my version of over-the-top momism. \"You know what happens when living things die, right? It's forever, right? Now, we have to bury her.\" Rosena and I then \"buried\" the doll on a high shelf in her closet. I told her that we cannot hurt or kill the things (or people) we love. I told her that, because she had \"killed\" that bunny, she could never play with it again. About a week later, I slipped it back into her toy basket and, when she asked why, assured her that I thought she wouldn't hurt her toys like that again. She agreed. I recall that episode now with a certain embarrassment, but when I recently heard Rosena explaining death and loss to her little brother and sister, I thought: Oh, maybe the drama of the shoebox burial was actually helpful in some fashion. Toys matter. We've put a fair amount of thought into what might be called toy curation in our household. We've bought nothing new and little used. Mostly, we've accepted shipments of hand-me-downs from friends who just wanted \"this crap\" out of their houses. No guns came with them, thankfully. After all, even toy guns can mean death under the wrong circumstances. A year ago, I visited the Cuddell Recreation Center in Cleveland with my daughter Madeline and a group of friends. That broad stretch of ball fields and paths, anchored by a gazebo and a playground, was where 12-year-old Tamir Rice was fatally shot by Officer Timothy Loehmann in November 2014. Rice, an African American, was playing with an Airsoft pellet gun that a friend's dad had bought at Walmart . A replica of an actual Colt pistol, it shot plastic pellets and looked pretty real, since the orange tip signifying \"toy\" was missing. However, Officer Loehmann, investigating a report that a man was carrying a gun in the park, was moving too fast to notice much. He sped up and began shooting even before his squad car stopped moving. Rice's hands were still reportedly in his pockets. Though Loehmann was not indicted, the city of Cleveland paid a $6 million settlement to the Rice family and demolished the gazebo where the boy was shot. In the park that day, local activists described the shooting and its aftermath to our group. Half listening, I followed Madeline as she toddled into the playground. I tried to imagine Samaria Rice's pain in this unremarkable place made part shrine, part soapbox by a police officer's quick trigger finger, racism, and her son's blood. I thought about that toy gun in Tamir Rice's hand and what might have been going through his head as he pointed it and played with it. Despite the age difference, it couldn't have been that far from what regularly goes through my son's head when he picks up a stick and points it: pop, boom, wow! The difference, of course, is that Seamus, blond and freckled and unmistakably white, would run little risk of being shot down by a policeman, even eight years from now with a replica toy gun in his hands.

Toys matter. We've put a fair amount of thought into what might be called toy curation in our household. We've bought nothing new and little used. Mostly, we've accepted shipments of hand-me-downs from friends who just wanted \"this crap\" out of their houses. No guns came with them, thankfully. After all, even toy guns can mean death under the wrong circumstances. A year ago, I visited the Cuddell Recreation Center in Cleveland with my daughter Madeline and a group of friends. That broad stretch of ball fields and paths, anchored by a gazebo and a playground, was where 12-year-old Tamir Rice was fatally shot by Officer Timothy Loehmann in November 2014. Rice, an African American, was playing with an Airsoft pellet gun that a friend's dad had bought at Walmart . A replica of an actual Colt pistol, it shot plastic pellets and looked pretty real, since the orange tip signifying \"toy\" was missing. However, Officer Loehmann, investigating a report that a man was carrying a gun in the park, was moving too fast to notice much. He sped up and began shooting even before his squad car stopped moving. Rice's hands were still reportedly in his pockets. Though Loehmann was not indicted, the city of Cleveland paid a $6 million settlement to the Rice family and demolished the gazebo where the boy was shot. In the park that day, local activists described the shooting and its aftermath to our group. Half listening, I followed Madeline as she toddled into the playground. I tried to imagine Samaria Rice's pain in this unremarkable place made part shrine, part soapbox by a police officer's quick trigger finger, racism, and her son's blood. I thought about that toy gun in Tamir Rice's hand and what might have been going through his head as he pointed it and played with it. Despite the age difference, it couldn't have been that far from what regularly goes through my son's head when he picks up a stick and points it: pop, boom, wow! The difference, of course, is that Seamus, blond and freckled and unmistakably white, would run little risk of being shot down by a policeman, even eight years from now with a replica toy gun in his hands. Blasters, Blasters, Everywhere Toys are a big business in this country, raking in $19.4 billion in 2015, according to the retail tracking firm NPD Group . Our family is not responsible for even a dime of this. Not surprisingly, then, my announcement that we were all going to spend a rainy afternoon at a local Toys \"R\" Us store came like a bolt from the blue for the kids. I wanted to see what kind of toy weaponry was for sale there. I was curious, among other things, about whether the boys at school who had taught Seamus about superheroes, bad guys, and Star Wars had ignited in my son a love of weaponry; I was curious, that is, as to how he would react to the walls of guns I imagined Toys \"R\" Us displaying. We got into our car as if it were Christmas Eve, Seamus beside himself with excitement, Madeline on a contact high from her brother. I was experiencing my own contact high, taking my kids on their first research trip. What we found was not exactly what I expected-on many levels. Seamus was quickly overwhelmed by the glut of everything-lots of pictures of toys on boxes, but not a lot to pick up. (It was, in that sense, the very opposite of our visits to the Goodwill store, where you can sit on the floor and play with all those second-hand toys as long as you put them back afterwards.) Not so surprisingly, in retrospect, he went straight for what was familiar, what he could grab in his hand and actually look at: the books. It took some effort to wrestle him away from Five Stories About Princesses and enlist him in my quest for bad toys. (Madeline had, by then, fallen asleep.) I had finally found the Nerf \"blasters,\" but he wasn't interested. \"Let's not go down this aisle, okay, Mom?\" I was, of course, looking for the worst of the worst when it came to weaponry, but it proved remarkably hard to find. The aisle did, admittedly, have the Nerf Zombie Strike Doominator and the Nerf Modulus Recon MKII for $34.99 each. Those certainly sounded grim, given the eternal war against the undead, but the bright orange, cartoonish, completely unrealistic \"blasters\" on display and marketed to kids \"eight and up\" seemed distant indeed from American gun carnage (and our wars in distant lands), nor was there anything on the packaging that even hinted at real people getting shot in real encounters or real wars. I must admit that I don't like the idea of Seamus shooting anything at anyone-even a brain-hungry zombie-but as it turned out, I needn't have worried, not this time around anyway. Zombie-killing wasn't in his wheelhouse. Still, I kept looking for the real gun aisle, and I did come across more blasters, dart shooters, and the like, none with the word \"gun\" on them. Of course, we do live in Connecticut, less than 100 miles from Newtown where, in 2012, Adam Lanza, a devotee of violent video games who grew up in a gun-filled house , killed 20 kids just a little older than Seamus along with six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. So maybe our local toy outlet was being sensitive, but I doubt it. There was the Halo UNSC SMG Blaster (the initials make it sound extra tough but stand for nothing) for $19.99, and the NERF Star Wars Episode VII First Order Stormtrooper Deluxe Blaster , which fires 12 darts up to 65 feet without reloading, for $41.99. The worst thing I could find was the Xploderz Mayhem , with \"more distance, more ammo,\" which shoots easy-to-wash off mini-water pellets. It was on clearance for $18.89. By then, Seamus was pulling me frantically toward the aisle with the full Frozen franchise on display. Madeline was now awake and in heaven. So I left them there briefly and snuck off to do a last check for \"real\" toy guns. No such luck. I didn't find the kind of Airsoft gun Tamir Rice was playing with when he was killed. I didn't find an ersatz Sig Sauer either. It turns out that most brick-and-mortar toy stores don't seem to offer realistic-looking toy weaponry anymore, nor is there the toy store equivalent of the curtained-off area in the old neighborhood video rental shop where the porn was available. For such toys, you have to turn to an online world of websites like Kids-Army.com , where you can indeed buy realistic-looking toy rifles, shotguns, and pistols, or even to Amazon, where you can find an Airsoft version of the Sig Sauer rifle for $249.99. \"Start Them Young\" The National Rifle Association (NRA) would undoubtedly have been disappointed by my local Toys \"R\" Us outlet-just as its officials undoubtedly are by the way most big toy merchants seem to have left their more realistic guns for the online world. This happened, in part, in response to the sort of social pressure that my husband engaged in when in high school and-more critically-the almost routine horror of the blurred line between toy guns and real ones. You know we're a quirky, gun-crazy nation when Cleveland could ban toy guns and umbrellas with pointy tips from the area around the Republican Convention in the name of security, but couldn't keep out the real guns in open-carry Ohio. The NRA wants kids to play with realistic toy guns and BB guns, since they believe that such toys are part of a child's initiation into the future ownership of perfectly real guns. At the moment, the gun lobby is concerned that not enough people have guns-even though the 270 million to 310 million of them already amassed around this country (according to the Pew Research Center ) could arm just about every man, woman, transgendered person, and child around. Still, despite the fact that Americans can now carry guns in all 50 states and the NRA continues to win most of the big political fights, the number of households with guns is actually down from its peak in the late 1960s (though those that are armed have more and deadlier weapons than ever before). No wonder the gun industry and the gun lobby are fighting to produce an army of toddlers. \" Start Them Young ,\" a February 2016 report from the Violence Policy Center, details how gun manufacturers and the NRA are eager to market real guns to younger and younger consumers. The report starts with a selection of quotes from the industry, including this gem from Craig Cushman, marketing director for T h ompson/Center Arms , about their Hot Shot rifle for kids: \"[We're] talking about a tiny gun intended for the very youngest shooters-the ultimate first gun. We're targeting the six- to 12-year-old range.\" In other words, kids are literally in their sights. It's a strange world we live in. The toy industry has puffed up and candy-colored its play guns, turned up the volume on the violence online and in video games, and wrapped everything in plastic and safety warnings. At the same time, the gun industry is making its guns smaller and cuter for kids, while putting its energy into the all-important junior market. Can we be safe-any of us-in a nation awash in guns? The gun-and-ammo industry boasted $16 billion in revenue for 2015. Gun stores-from brick-and-mortar shops to online retailers-had $3.1 billion in revenue that same year. The industry as a whole claimed responsibility for nearly $50 billion in \"economic activity\" in 2015 alone. That represents a fair number of jobs, but here is the number that really goes boom: $229 billion. That's the annual cost of fatal and non-fatal gun violence in this country, according to Mother Jones and analyst Ted Miller of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, who teamed up to crunch the numbers. That figure includes both the direct costs of gun injuries and deaths-police investigations, emergency personnel, hospital bills, long-term care for the injured, funeral expenses for the dead, and the costs of prosecuting and imprisoning the perpetrators. As the report concludes: \"Even before accounting for the more intangible costs of the violence... the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America is nearly $400,000. And we pay for 32 of them every single day.\" We are awash in guns. Where does it end? Gun violence is embedded in our national mythology, our foreign policy, our notions of masculinity, our entertainment industry, and our children's play. We see violence solving problems on every screen-from the zombie apocalypse to the rise of ISIS. Russian playwright Anton Chekhov's maxim still applies: \"One should not put a loaded rifle onto the stage if no one is thinking of firing it.\" Sooner or later, that rifle is sure to go off. It might be an accident; it might be terrorism; it might be hate. But it will go off. Somewhere, as you read this, it's going off right now. I don't want to police my kids' imagination. And there is a whole strain of parenting literature that assures me that I don't have to. It says don't interfere with your kid's play, even if it includes guns and shooting and killing. Imagination is imagination and the violence isn't real. It might even, so this line of thinking goes, be a healthy way for them to process feelings of aggression. I get what they're saying, but it seems like a cop-out to me. To my mind, nonintervention is often a missed opportunity to be a parent. Sure, the violence isn't real. The pow-pows don't actually rip skin and tendon or stop hearts from beating, but the United States, which has been fighting distant wars nonstop for 15 years now, does have a violence problem and a man problem and a gun problem. We know where that problem ends, but it starts somewhere, too. One place to begin to look, at least, is at how our kids-particularly our boys-play, and how they are nurtured (or not), and taught to express their emotions (or not). It is, at least in part, up to us, their parents, to decide whether they are going to be the ones who help repair our society and reorient us (or not). And it begins with the kinds of care and love they receive, the kinds of conversations they are invited into, the kinds of expectations they are given about behavior and relationships. I don't want to raise Seamus, Madeline, or Rosena in the austere, ripped from the headlines of horror, polemical atmosphere that was the essence of my own childhood. But I don't want them to get comfortable with killing either. I want so much more for, and from, my little boy than \"Pow, pow, yous are dead now!\" And that starts with taking the gun or the stick or the rainbow flag out of his hands, sitting him down, and having a hard conversation about what guns actually do to people-and how much killing hurts us all.\n\nLIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS\n\nLIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS\n\nI grew up in a similar family of activists. We, too, were forbidden toy guns and other war toys. My brother and I were more likely to play games like \"protester at the Pentagon\" than cops and robbers. I've been thinking recently about why toy guns didn't have a grip on our imaginations as kids. I suspect it was because we understood-were made to understand-what the big gun of US militarism had done in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Indochina, and throughout Central America. Our dad had seen the big gun of war up close and personal. His finger-the same one he pointed at us when we were in trouble-had pulled the trigger again and again in France during World War II. He was decorated there, but had zero nostalgia for the experience. He was, in fact, deeply ashamed of the dashing figure he had once cut when home from the front. And so, Dad screwed up a new kind of courage to say no to war and violence, to killing of any kind. His knowledge of war imbued his nonviolent peace activist mission with a genuine, badass, superhero style swagger. Our parents-our community of ragtag, countercultural Catholic peace activists-made that no-violence, no-killing, no-matter-what point again and again. In fact, my early experience of guns was the chilling fear of knowing that, in protest , my father, mother, and their friends were walking into what they called \"free-fire zones\" on military bases, where well-armed, well-trained soldiers were licensed to kill intruders. So we didn't point toy guns at each other. We didn't pow-pow with our fingers or sticks. We crossed those fingers and hoped that the people we loved would be safe. Our inner city Baltimore neighborhood, where crack cocaine madness was just taking hold, drove that point home on a micro level. Our house was robbed at gunpoint more than once-and we had so little worth taking. We watched a man across the street bleed to death after being stabbed repeatedly in a fight over nothing. People from our house ran to help and were there for far too long before an ambulance even arrived. We knew as little kids that violence was no laughing matter, nor child's play. It was serious business and was to be resisted. As parents tend to do, Patrick and I are passing this tradition on to our kids, hopefully without the emotional scarring that went with our childhoods of resistance. They don't have guns or action figures or any other toy implements of death. Still, we've been watching Seamus, our Team Elsa (from the Disney blockbuster Frozen ) son, as he's recently begun turning every stick into an imaginary gun. This is, of course, happening just as, in the headlines of the moment, actual guns are turning so many previously real people into statistics. Under the circumstances, how could I not find myself thinking about toy guns, real guns, the nature of play, the role of imagination, the place of parents, and how to (or whether to) police (ha!) that imaginary play? When my stepdaughter Rosena was about four, she found a toy dagger at the playground, somehow smuggled it home, and was stabbing one of her beloved stuffed animals, a bunny, repeatedly with it. In the other room, I could hear the thumps on the bedroom floor and called out, \"What are you doing?\" \"Stabbin' my bunny. I kilt her,\" she responded matter-of-factly. Seizing a \"teaching moment\" and undoubtedly gripped by my own childhood experiences and memories of my parents, I blustered into the bedroom with a shoebox. \"Now, your bunny is dead,\" I announced in my version of over-the-top momism. \"You know what happens when living things die, right? It's forever, right? Now, we have to bury her.\" Rosena and I then \"buried\" the doll on a high shelf in her closet. I told her that we cannot hurt or kill the things (or people) we love. I told her that, because she had \"killed\" that bunny, she could never play with it again. About a week later, I slipped it back into her toy basket and, when she asked why, assured her that I thought she wouldn't hurt her toys like that again. She agreed. I recall that episode now with a certain embarrassment, but when I recently heard Rosena explaining death and loss to her little brother and sister, I thought: Oh, maybe the drama of the shoebox burial was actually helpful in some fashion.

He sped up and began shooting even before his squad car stopped moving. Rice's hands were still reportedly in his pockets. Though Loehmann was not indicted, the city of Cleveland paid a $6 million settlement to the Rice family and demolished the gazebo where the boy was shot. In the park that day, local activists described the shooting and its aftermath to our group. Half listening, I followed Madeline as she toddled into the playground. I tried to imagine Samaria Rice's pain in this unremarkable place made part shrine, part soapbox by a police officer's quick trigger finger, racism, and her son's blood. I thought about that toy gun in Tamir Rice's hand and what might have been going through his head as he pointed it and played with it. Despite the age difference, it couldn't have been that far from what regularly goes through my son's head when he picks up a stick and points it: pop, boom, wow! The difference, of course, is that Seamus, blond and freckled and unmistakably white, would run little risk of being shot down by a policeman, even eight years from now with a replica toy gun in his hands. Blasters, Blasters, Everywhere Toys are a big business in this country, raking in $19.4 billion in 2015, according to the retail tracking firm NPD Group . Our family is not responsible for even a dime of this. Not surprisingly, then, my announcement that we were all going to spend a rainy afternoon at a local Toys \"R\" Us store came like a bolt from the blue for the kids. I wanted to see what kind of toy weaponry was for sale there. I was curious, among other things, about whether the boys at school who had taught Seamus about superheroes, bad guys, and Star Wars had ignited in my son a love of weaponry; I was curious, that is, as to how he would react to the walls of guns I imagined Toys \"R\" Us displaying. We got into our car as if it were Christmas Eve, Seamus beside himself with excitement, Madeline on a contact high from her brother. I was experiencing my own contact high, taking my kids on their first research trip. What we found was not exactly what I expected-on many levels. Seamus was quickly overwhelmed by the glut of everything-lots of pictures of toys on boxes, but not a lot to pick up. (It was, in that sense, the very opposite of our visits to the Goodwill store, where you can sit on the floor and play with all those second-hand toys as long as you put them back afterwards.) Not so surprisingly, in retrospect, he went straight for what was familiar, what he could grab in his hand and actually look at: the books. It took some effort to wrestle him away from Five Stories About Princesses and enlist him in my quest for bad toys. (Madeline had, by then, fallen asleep.) I had finally found the Nerf \"blasters,\" but he wasn't interested. \"Let's not go down this aisle, okay, Mom?\" I was, of course, looking for the worst of the worst when it came to weaponry, but it proved remarkably hard to find. The aisle did, admittedly, have the Nerf Zombie Strike Doominator and the Nerf Modulus Recon MKII for $34.99 each. Those certainly sounded grim, given the eternal war against the undead, but the bright orange, cartoonish, completely unrealistic \"blasters\" on display and marketed to kids \"eight and up\" seemed distant indeed from American gun carnage (and our wars in distant lands), nor was there anything on the packaging that even hinted at real people getting shot in real encounters or real wars. I must admit that I don't like the idea of Seamus shooting anything at anyone-even a brain-hungry zombie-but as it turned out, I needn't have worried, not this time around anyway. Zombie-killing wasn't in his wheelhouse. Still, I kept looking for the real gun aisle, and I did come across more blasters, dart shooters, and the like, none with the word \"gun\" on them. Of course, we do live in Connecticut, less than 100 miles from Newtown where, in 2012, Adam Lanza, a devotee of violent video games who grew up in a gun-filled house , killed 20 kids just a little older than Seamus along with six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. So maybe our local toy outlet was being sensitive, but I doubt it. There was the Halo UNSC SMG Blaster (the initials make it sound extra tough but stand for nothing) for $19.99, and the NERF Star Wars Episode VII First Order Stormtrooper Deluxe Blaster , which fires 12 darts up to 65 feet without reloading, for $41.99. The worst thing I could find was the Xploderz Mayhem , with \"more distance, more ammo,\" which shoots easy-to-wash off mini-water pellets. It was on clearance for $18.89. By then, Seamus was pulling me frantically toward the aisle with the full Frozen franchise on display. Madeline was now awake and in heaven. So I left them there briefly and snuck off to do a last check for \"real\" toy guns. No such luck. I didn't find the kind of Airsoft gun Tamir Rice was playing with when he was killed. I didn't find an ersatz Sig Sauer either. It turns out that most brick-and-mortar toy stores don't seem to offer realistic-looking toy weaponry anymore, nor is there the toy store equivalent of the curtained-off area in the old neighborhood video rental shop where the porn was available. For such toys, you have to turn to an online world of websites like Kids-Army.com , where you can indeed buy realistic-looking toy rifles, shotguns, and pistols, or even to Amazon, where you can find an Airsoft version of the Sig Sauer rifle for $249.99. \"Start Them Young\" The National Rifle Association (NRA) would undoubtedly have been disappointed by my local Toys \"R\" Us outlet-just as its officials undoubtedly are by the way most big toy merchants seem to have left their more realistic guns for the online world. This happened, in part, in response to the sort of social pressure that my husband engaged in when in high school and-more critically-the almost routine horror of the blurred line between toy guns and real ones. You know we're a quirky, gun-crazy nation when Cleveland could ban toy guns and umbrellas with pointy tips from the area around the Republican Convention in the name of security, but couldn't keep out the real guns in open-carry Ohio. The NRA wants kids to play with realistic toy guns and BB guns, since they believe that such toys are part of a child's initiation into the future ownership of perfectly real guns. At the moment, the gun lobby is concerned that not enough people have guns-even though the 270 million to 310 million of them already amassed around this country (according to the Pew Research Center ) could arm just about every man, woman, transgendered person, and child around. Still, despite the fact that Americans can now carry guns in all 50 states and the NRA continues to win most of the big political fights, the number of households with guns is actually down from its peak in the late 1960s (though those that are armed have more and deadlier weapons than ever before). No wonder the gun industry and the gun lobby are fighting to produce an army of toddlers. \" Start Them Young ,\" a February 2016 report from the Violence Policy Center, details how gun manufacturers and the NRA are eager to market real guns to younger and younger consumers. The report starts with a selection of quotes from the industry, including this gem from Craig Cushman, marketing director for T h ompson/Center Arms , about their Hot Shot rifle for kids: \"[We're] talking about a tiny gun intended for the very youngest shooters-the ultimate first gun. We're targeting the six- to 12-year-old range.\" In other words, kids are literally in their sights. It's a strange world we live in. The toy industry has puffed up and candy-colored its play guns, turned up the volume on the violence online and in video games, and wrapped everything in plastic and safety warnings. At the same time, the gun industry is making its guns smaller and cuter for kids, while putting its energy into the all-important junior market. Can we be safe-any of us-in a nation awash in guns? The gun-and-ammo industry boasted $16 billion in revenue for 2015. Gun stores-from brick-and-mortar shops to online retailers-had $3.1 billion in revenue that same year. The industry as a whole claimed responsibility for nearly $50 billion in \"economic activity\" in 2015 alone. That represents a fair number of jobs, but here is the number that really goes boom: $229 billion. That's the annual cost of fatal and non-fatal gun violence in this country, according to Mother Jones and analyst Ted Miller of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, who teamed up to crunch the numbers. That figure includes both the direct costs of gun injuries and deaths-police investigations, emergency personnel, hospital bills, long-term care for the injured, funeral expenses for the dead, and the costs of prosecuting and imprisoning the perpetrators. As the report concludes: \"Even before accounting for the more intangible costs of the violence... the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America is nearly $400,000. And we pay for 32 of them every single day.\" We are awash in guns. Where does it end? Gun violence is embedded in our national mythology, our foreign policy, our notions of masculinity, our entertainment industry, and our children's play. We see violence solving problems on every screen-from the zombie apocalypse to the rise of ISIS. Russian playwright Anton Chekhov's maxim still applies: \"One should not put a loaded rifle onto the stage if no one is thinking of firing it.\" Sooner or later, that rifle is sure to go off. It might be an accident; it might be terrorism; it might be hate. But it will go off. Somewhere, as you read this, it's going off right now. I don't want to police my kids' imagination. And there is a whole strain of parenting literature that assures me that I don't have to. It says don't interfere with your kid's play, even if it includes guns and shooting and killing. Imagination is imagination and the violence isn't real. It might even, so this line of thinking goes, be a healthy way for them to process feelings of aggression. I get what they're saying, but it seems like a cop-out to me. To my mind, nonintervention is often a missed opportunity to be a parent. Sure, the violence isn't real. The pow-pows don't actually rip skin and tendon or stop hearts from beating, but the United States, which has been fighting distant wars nonstop for 15 years now, does have a violence problem and a man problem and a gun problem. We know where that problem ends, but it starts somewhere, too. One place to begin to look, at least, is at how our kids-particularly our boys-play, and how they are nurtured (or not), and taught to express their emotions (or not). It is, at least in part, up to us, their parents, to decide whether they are going to be the ones who help repair our society and reorient us (or not). And it begins with the kinds of care and love they receive, the kinds of conversations they are invited into, the kinds of expectations they are given about behavior and relationships. I don't want to raise Seamus, Madeline, or Rosena in the austere, ripped from the headlines of horror, polemical atmosphere that was the essence of my own childhood. But I don't want them to get comfortable with killing either. I want so much more for, and from, my little boy than \"Pow, pow, yous are dead now!\" And that starts with taking the gun or the stick or the rainbow flag out of his hands, sitting him down, and having a hard conversation about what guns actually do to people-and how much killing hurts us all.\n\nOur inner city Baltimore neighborhood, where crack cocaine madness was just taking hold, drove that point home on a micro level. Our house was robbed at gunpoint more than once-and we had so little worth taking. We watched a man across the street bleed to death after being stabbed repeatedly in a fight over nothing. People from our house ran to help and were there for far too long before an ambulance even arrived. We knew as little kids that violence was no laughing matter, nor child's play. It was serious business and was to be resisted. As parents tend to do, Patrick and I are passing this tradition on to our kids, hopefully without the emotional scarring that went with our childhoods of resistance. They don't have guns or action figures or any other toy implements of death. Still, we've been watching Seamus, our Team Elsa (from the Disney blockbuster Frozen ) son, as he's recently begun turning every stick into an imaginary gun. This is, of course, happening just as, in the headlines of the moment, actual guns are turning so many previously real people into statistics. Under the circumstances, how could I not find myself thinking about toy guns, real guns, the nature of play, the role of imagination, the place of parents, and how to (or whether to) police (ha!) that imaginary play? When my stepdaughter Rosena was about four, she found a toy dagger at the playground, somehow smuggled it home, and was stabbing one of her beloved stuffed animals, a bunny, repeatedly with it. In the other room, I could hear the thumps on the bedroom floor and called out, \"What are you doing?\" \"Stabbin' my bunny. I kilt her,\" she responded matter-of-factly. Seizing a \"teaching moment\" and undoubtedly gripped by my own childhood experiences and memories of my parents, I blustered into the bedroom with a shoebox. \"Now, your bunny is dead,\" I announced in my version of over-the-top momism. \"You know what happens when living things die, right? It's forever, right? Now, we have to bury her.\" Rosena and I then \"buried\" the doll on a high shelf in her closet. I told her that we cannot hurt or kill the things (or people) we love. I told her that, because she had \"killed\" that bunny, she could never play with it again. About a week later, I slipped it back into her toy basket and, when she asked why, assured her that I thought she wouldn't hurt her toys like that again. She agreed. I recall that episode now with a certain embarrassment, but when I recently heard Rosena explaining death and loss to her little brother and sister, I thought: Oh, maybe the drama of the shoebox burial was actually helpful in some fashion. Toys matter. We've put a fair amount of thought into what might be called toy curation in our household. We've bought nothing new and little used. Mostly, we've accepted shipments of hand-me-downs from friends who just wanted \"this crap\" out of their houses. No guns came with them, thankfully. After all, even toy guns can mean death under the wrong circumstances. A year ago, I visited the Cuddell Recreation Center in Cleveland with my daughter Madeline and a group of friends. That broad stretch of ball fields and paths, anchored by a gazebo and a playground, was where 12-year-old Tamir Rice was fatally shot by Officer Timothy Loehmann in November 2014. Rice, an African American, was playing with an Airsoft pellet gun that a friend's dad had bought at Walmart . A replica of an actual Colt pistol, it shot plastic pellets and looked pretty real, since the orange tip signifying \"toy\" was missing. However, Officer Loehmann, investigating a report that a man was carrying a gun in the park, was moving too fast to notice much. He sped up and began shooting even before his squad car stopped moving. Rice's hands were still reportedly in his pockets.

Despite the age difference, it couldn't have been that far from what regularly goes through my son's head when he picks up a stick and points it: pop, boom, wow! The difference, of course, is that Seamus, blond and freckled and unmistakably white, would run little risk of being shot down by a policeman, even eight years from now with a replica toy gun in his hands. Blasters, Blasters, Everywhere Toys are a big business in this country, raking in $19.4 billion in 2015, according to the retail tracking firm NPD Group . Our family is not responsible for even a dime of this. Not surprisingly, then, my announcement that we were all going to spend a rainy afternoon at a local Toys \"R\" Us store came like a bolt from the blue for the kids. I wanted to see what kind of toy weaponry was for sale there. I was curious, among other things, about whether the boys at school who had taught Seamus about superheroes, bad guys, and Star Wars had ignited in my son a love of weaponry; I was curious, that is, as to how he would react to the walls of guns I imagined Toys \"R\" Us displaying.

I had finally found the Nerf \"blasters,\" but he wasn't interested. \"Let's not go down this aisle, okay, Mom?\" I was, of course, looking for the worst of the worst when it came to weaponry, but it proved remarkably hard to find. The aisle did, admittedly, have the Nerf Zombie Strike Doominator and the Nerf Modulus Recon MKII for $34.99 each. Those certainly sounded grim, given the eternal war against the undead, but the bright orange, cartoonish, completely unrealistic \"blasters\" on display and marketed to kids \"eight and up\" seemed distant indeed from American gun carnage (and our wars in distant lands), nor was there anything on the packaging that even hinted at real people getting shot in real encounters or real wars. I must admit that I don't like the idea of Seamus shooting anything at anyone-even a brain-hungry zombie-but as it turned out, I needn't have worried, not this time around anyway. Zombie-killing wasn't in his wheelhouse. Still, I kept looking for the real gun aisle, and I did come across more blasters, dart shooters, and the like, none with the word \"gun\" on them. Of course, we do live in Connecticut, less than 100 miles from Newtown where, in 2012, Adam Lanza, a devotee of violent video games who grew up in a gun-filled house , killed 20 kids just a little older than Seamus along with six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. So maybe our local toy outlet was being sensitive, but I doubt it. There was the Halo UNSC SMG Blaster (the initials make it sound extra tough but stand for nothing) for $19.99, and the NERF Star Wars Episode VII First Order Stormtrooper Deluxe Blaster , which fires 12 darts up to 65 feet without reloading, for $41.99. The worst thing I could find was the Xploderz Mayhem , with \"more distance, more ammo,\" which shoots easy-to-wash off mini-water pellets. It was on clearance for $18.89. By then, Seamus was pulling me frantically toward the aisle with the full Frozen franchise on display. Madeline was now awake and in heaven. So I left them there briefly and snuck off to do a last check for \"real\" toy guns. No such luck. I didn't find the kind of Airsoft gun Tamir Rice was playing with when he was killed. I didn't find an ersatz Sig Sauer either. It turns out that most brick-and-mortar toy stores don't seem to offer realistic-looking toy weaponry anymore, nor is there the toy store equivalent of the curtained-off area in the old neighborhood video rental shop where the porn was available. For such toys, you have to turn to an online world of websites like Kids-Army.com , where you can indeed buy realistic-looking toy rifles, shotguns, and pistols, or even to Amazon, where you can find an Airsoft version of the Sig Sauer rifle for $249.99. \"Start Them Young\" The National Rifle Association (NRA) would undoubtedly have been disappointed by my local Toys \"R\" Us outlet-just as its officials undoubtedly are by the way most big toy merchants seem to have left their more realistic guns for the online world. This happened, in part, in response to the sort of social pressure that my husband engaged in when in high school and-more critically-the almost routine horror of the blurred line between toy guns and real ones. You know we're a quirky, gun-crazy nation when Cleveland could ban toy guns and umbrellas with pointy tips from the area around the Republican Convention in the name of security, but couldn't keep out the real guns in open-carry Ohio. The NRA wants kids to play with realistic toy guns and BB guns, since they believe that such toys are part of a child's initiation into the future ownership of perfectly real guns. At the moment, the gun lobby is concerned that not enough people have guns-even though the 270 million to 310 million of them already amassed around this country (according to the Pew Research Center ) could arm just about every man, woman, transgendered person, and child around. Still, despite the fact that Americans can now carry guns in all 50 states and the NRA continues to win most of the big political fights, the number of households with guns is actually down from its peak in the late 1960s (though those that are armed have more and deadlier weapons than ever before). No wonder the gun industry and the gun lobby are fighting to produce an army of toddlers. \" Start Them Young ,\" a February 2016 report from the Violence Policy Center, details how gun manufacturers and the NRA are eager to market real guns to younger and younger consumers. The report starts with a selection of quotes from the industry, including this gem from Craig Cushman, marketing director for T h ompson/Center Arms , about their Hot Shot rifle for kids: \"[We're] talking about a tiny gun intended for the very youngest shooters-the ultimate first gun. We're targeting the six- to 12-year-old range.\" In other words, kids are literally in their sights. It's a strange world we live in. The toy industry has puffed up and candy-colored its play guns, turned up the volume on the violence online and in video games, and wrapped everything in plastic and safety warnings. At the same time, the gun industry is making its guns smaller and cuter for kids, while putting its energy into the all-important junior market. Can we be safe-any of us-in a nation awash in guns? The gun-and-ammo industry boasted $16 billion in revenue for 2015. Gun stores-from brick-and-mortar shops to online retailers-had $3.1 billion in revenue that same year. The industry as a whole claimed responsibility for nearly $50 billion in \"economic activity\" in 2015 alone. That represents a fair number of jobs, but here is the number that really goes boom: $229 billion. That's the annual cost of fatal and non-fatal gun violence in this country, according to Mother Jones and analyst Ted Miller of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, who teamed up to crunch the numbers. That figure includes both the direct costs of gun injuries and deaths-police investigations, emergency personnel, hospital bills, long-term care for the injured, funeral expenses for the dead, and the costs of prosecuting and imprisoning the perpetrators. As the report concludes: \"Even before accounting for the more intangible costs of the violence... the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America is nearly $400,000. And we pay for 32 of them every single day.\" We are awash in guns. Where does it end? Gun violence is embedded in our national mythology, our foreign policy, our notions of masculinity, our entertainment industry, and our children's play. We see violence solving problems on every screen-from the zombie apocalypse to the rise of ISIS. Russian playwright Anton Chekhov's maxim still applies: \"One should not put a loaded rifle onto the stage if no one is thinking of firing it.\" Sooner or later, that rifle is sure to go off. It might be an accident; it might be terrorism; it might be hate. But it will go off. Somewhere, as you read this, it's going off right now. I don't want to police my kids' imagination. And there is a whole strain of parenting literature that assures me that I don't have to. It says don't interfere with your kid's play, even if it includes guns and shooting and killing. Imagination is imagination and the violence isn't real. It might even, so this line of thinking goes, be a healthy way for them to process feelings of aggression. I get what they're saying, but it seems like a cop-out to me. To my mind, nonintervention is often a missed opportunity to be a parent. Sure, the violence isn't real. The pow-pows don't actually rip skin and tendon or stop hearts from beating, but the United States, which has been fighting distant wars nonstop for 15 years now, does have a violence problem and a man problem and a gun problem. We know where that problem ends, but it starts somewhere, too. One place to begin to look, at least, is at how our kids-particularly our boys-play, and how they are nurtured (or not), and taught to express their emotions (or not). It is, at least in part, up to us, their parents, to decide whether they are going to be the ones who help repair our society and reorient us (or not). And it begins with the kinds of care and love they receive, the kinds of conversations they are invited into, the kinds of expectations they are given about behavior and relationships. I don't want to raise Seamus, Madeline, or Rosena in the austere, ripped from the headlines of horror, polemical atmosphere that was the essence of my own childhood. But I don't want them to get comfortable with killing either. I want so much more for, and from, my little boy than \"Pow, pow, yous are dead now!\" And that starts with taking the gun or the stick or the rainbow flag out of his hands, sitting him down, and having a hard conversation about what guns actually do to people-and how much killing hurts us all.\n\nWhen my stepdaughter Rosena was about four, she found a toy dagger at the playground, somehow smuggled it home, and was stabbing one of her beloved stuffed animals, a bunny, repeatedly with it. In the other room, I could hear the thumps on the bedroom floor and called out, \"What are you doing?\" \"Stabbin' my bunny. I kilt her,\" she responded matter-of-factly. Seizing a \"teaching moment\" and undoubtedly gripped by my own childhood experiences and memories of my parents, I blustered into the bedroom with a shoebox. \"Now, your bunny is dead,\" I announced in my version of over-the-top momism. \"You know what happens when living things die, right? It's forever, right? Now, we have to bury her.\" Rosena and I then \"buried\" the doll on a high shelf in her closet. I told her that we cannot hurt or kill the things (or people) we love. I told her that, because she had \"killed\" that bunny, she could never play with it again. About a week later, I slipped it back into her toy basket and, when she asked why, assured her that I thought she wouldn't hurt her toys like that again. She agreed. I recall that episode now with a certain embarrassment, but when I recently heard Rosena explaining death and loss to her little brother and sister, I thought: Oh, maybe the drama of the shoebox burial was actually helpful in some fashion. Toys matter. We've put a fair amount of thought into what might be called toy curation in our household. We've bought nothing new and little used. Mostly, we've accepted shipments of hand-me-downs from friends who just wanted \"this crap\" out of their houses. No guns came with them, thankfully. After all, even toy guns can mean death under the wrong circumstances. A year ago, I visited the Cuddell Recreation Center in Cleveland with my daughter Madeline and a group of friends. That broad stretch of ball fields and paths, anchored by a gazebo and a playground, was where 12-year-old Tamir Rice was fatally shot by Officer Timothy Loehmann in November 2014. Rice, an African American, was playing with an Airsoft pellet gun that a friend's dad had bought at Walmart . A replica of an actual Colt pistol, it shot plastic pellets and looked pretty real, since the orange tip signifying \"toy\" was missing. However, Officer Loehmann, investigating a report that a man was carrying a gun in the park, was moving too fast to notice much. He sped up and began shooting even before his squad car stopped moving. Rice's hands were still reportedly in his pockets. Though Loehmann was not indicted, the city of Cleveland paid a $6 million settlement to the Rice family and demolished the gazebo where the boy was shot. In the park that day, local activists described the shooting and its aftermath to our group. Half listening, I followed Madeline as she toddled into the playground. I tried to imagine Samaria Rice's pain in this unremarkable place made part shrine, part soapbox by a police officer's quick trigger finger, racism, and her son's blood. I thought about that toy gun in Tamir Rice's hand and what might have been going through his head as he pointed it and played with it. Despite the age difference, it couldn't have been that far from what regularly goes through my son's head when he picks up a stick and points it: pop, boom, wow! The difference, of course, is that Seamus, blond and freckled and unmistakably white, would run little risk of being shot down by a policeman, even eight years from now with a replica toy gun in his hands. Blasters, Blasters, Everywhere Toys are a big business in this country, raking in $19.4 billion in 2015, according to the retail tracking firm NPD Group . Our family is not responsible for even a dime of this. Not surprisingly, then, my announcement that we were all going to spend a rainy afternoon at a local Toys \"R\" Us store came like a bolt from the blue for the kids. I wanted to see what kind of toy weaponry was for sale there. I was curious, among other things, about whether the boys at school who had taught Seamus about superheroes, bad guys, and Star Wars had ignited in my son a love of weaponry; I was curious, that is, as to how he would react to the walls of guns I imagined Toys \"R\" Us displaying. We got into our car as if it were Christmas Eve, Seamus beside himself with excitement, Madeline on a contact high from her brother. I was experiencing my own contact high, taking my kids on their first research trip. What we found was not exactly what I expected-on many levels. Seamus was quickly overwhelmed by the glut of everything-lots of pictures of toys on boxes, but not a lot to pick up. (It was, in that sense, the very opposite of our visits to the Goodwill store, where you can sit on the floor and play with all those second-hand toys as long as you put them back afterwards.) Not so surprisingly, in retrospect, he went straight for what was familiar, what he could grab in his hand and actually look at: the books. It took some effort to wrestle him away from Five Stories About Princesses and enlist him in my quest for bad toys. (Madeline had, by then, fallen asleep.) I had finally found the Nerf \"blasters,\" but he wasn't interested. \"Let's not go down this aisle, okay, Mom?\" I was, of course, looking for the worst of the worst when it came to weaponry, but it proved remarkably hard to find. The aisle did, admittedly, have the Nerf Zombie Strike Doominator and the Nerf Modulus Recon MKII for $34.99 each. Those certainly sounded grim, given the eternal war against the undead, but the bright orange, cartoonish, completely unrealistic \"blasters\" on display and marketed to kids \"eight and up\" seemed distant indeed from American gun carnage (and our wars in distant lands), nor was there anything on the packaging that even hinted at real people getting shot in real encounters or real wars. I must admit that I don't like the idea of Seamus shooting anything at anyone-even a brain-hungry zombie-but as it turned out, I needn't have worried, not this time around anyway. Zombie-killing wasn't in his wheelhouse. Still, I kept looking for the real gun aisle, and I did come across more blasters, dart shooters, and the like, none with the word \"gun\" on them. Of course, we do live in Connecticut, less than 100 miles from Newtown where, in 2012, Adam Lanza, a devotee of violent video games who grew up in a gun-filled house , killed 20 kids just a little older than Seamus along with six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. So maybe our local toy outlet was being sensitive, but I doubt it. There was the Halo UNSC SMG Blaster (the initials make it sound extra tough but stand for nothing) for $19.99, and the NERF Star Wars Episode VII First Order Stormtrooper Deluxe Blaster , which fires 12 darts up to 65 feet without reloading, for $41.99. The worst thing I could find was the Xploderz Mayhem , with \"more distance, more ammo,\" which shoots easy-to-wash off mini-water pellets. It was on clearance for $18.89.

And there is a whole strain of parenting literature that assures me that I don't have to. It says don't interfere with your kid's play, even if it includes guns and shooting and killing. Imagination is imagination and the violence isn't real. It might even, so this line of thinking goes, be a healthy way for them to process feelings of aggression. I get what they're saying, but it seems like a cop-out to me. To my mind, nonintervention is often a missed opportunity to be a parent. Sure, the violence isn't real. The pow-pows don't actually rip skin and tendon or stop hearts from beating, but the United States, which has been fighting distant wars nonstop for 15 years now, does have a violence problem and a man problem and a gun problem. We know where that problem ends, but it starts somewhere, too. One place to begin to look, at least, is at how our kids-particularly our boys-play, and how they are nurtured (or not), and taught to express their emotions (or not). It is, at least in part, up to us, their parents, to decide whether they are going to be the ones who help repair our society and reorient us (or not). And it begins with the kinds of care and love they receive, the kinds of conversations they are invited into, the kinds of expectations they are given about behavior and relationships. I don't want to raise Seamus, Madeline, or Rosena in the austere, ripped from the headlines of horror, polemical atmosphere that was the essence of my own childhood. But I don't want them to get comfortable with killing either. I want so much more for, and from, my little boy than \"Pow, pow, yous are dead now!\" And that starts with taking the gun or the stick or the rainbow flag out of his hands, sitting him down, and having a hard conversation about what guns actually do to people-and how much killing hurts us all.\n\n\"Stabbin' my bunny. I kilt her,\" she responded matter-of-factly. Seizing a \"teaching moment\" and undoubtedly gripped by my own childhood experiences and memories of my parents, I blustered into the bedroom with a shoebox. \"Now, your bunny is dead,\" I announced in my version of over-the-top momism. \"You know what happens when living things die, right? It's forever, right? Now, we have to bury her.\" Rosena and I then \"buried\" the doll on a high shelf in her closet. I told her that we cannot hurt or kill the things (or people) we love. I told her that, because she had \"killed\" that bunny, she could never play with it again. About a week later, I slipped it back into her toy basket and, when she asked why, assured her that I thought she wouldn't hurt her toys like that again. She agreed. I recall that episode now with a certain embarrassment, but when I recently heard Rosena explaining death and loss to her little brother and sister, I thought: Oh, maybe the drama of the shoebox burial was actually helpful in some fashion. Toys matter. We've put a fair amount of thought into what might be called toy curation in our household. We've bought nothing new and little used. Mostly, we've accepted shipments of hand-me-downs from friends who just wanted \"this crap\" out of their houses. No guns came with them, thankfully. After all, even toy guns can mean death under the wrong circumstances. A year ago, I visited the Cuddell Recreation Center in Cleveland with my daughter Madeline and a group of friends. That broad stretch of ball fields and paths, anchored by a gazebo and a playground, was where 12-year-old Tamir Rice was fatally shot by Officer Timothy Loehmann in November 2014. Rice, an African American, was playing with an Airsoft pellet gun that a friend's dad had bought at Walmart . A replica of an actual Colt pistol, it shot plastic pellets and looked pretty real, since the orange tip signifying \"toy\" was missing. However, Officer Loehmann, investigating a report that a man was carrying a gun in the park, was moving too fast to notice much. He sped up and began shooting even before his squad car stopped moving. Rice's hands were still reportedly in his pockets. Though Loehmann was not indicted, the city of Cleveland paid a $6 million settlement to the Rice family and demolished the gazebo where the boy was shot. In the park that day, local activists described the shooting and its aftermath to our group. Half listening, I followed Madeline as she toddled into the playground. I tried to imagine Samaria Rice's pain in this unremarkable place made part shrine, part soapbox by a police officer's quick trigger finger, racism, and her son's blood. I thought about that toy gun in Tamir Rice's hand and what might have been going through his head as he pointed it and played with it. Despite the age difference, it couldn't have been that far from what regularly goes through my son's head when he picks up a stick and points it: pop, boom, wow! The difference, of course, is that Seamus, blond and freckled and unmistakably white, would run little risk of being shot down by a policeman, even eight years from now with a replica toy gun in his hands. Blasters, Blasters, Everywhere Toys are a big business in this country, raking in $19.4 billion in 2015, according to the retail tracking firm NPD Group . Our family is not responsible for even a dime of this. Not surprisingly, then, my announcement that we were all going to spend a rainy afternoon at a local Toys \"R\" Us store came like a bolt from the blue for the kids. I wanted to see what kind of toy weaponry was for sale there. I was curious, among other things, about whether the boys at school who had taught Seamus about superheroes, bad guys, and Star Wars had ignited in my son a love of weaponry; I was curious, that is, as to how he would react to the walls of guns I imagined Toys \"R\" Us displaying. We got into our car as if it were Christmas Eve, Seamus beside himself with excitement, Madeline on a contact high from her brother. I was experiencing my own contact high, taking my kids on their first research trip. What we found was not exactly what I expected-on many levels. Seamus was quickly overwhelmed by the glut of everything-lots of pictures of toys on boxes, but not a lot to pick up. (It was, in that sense, the very opposite of our visits to the Goodwill store, where you can sit on the floor and play with all those second-hand toys as long as you put them back afterwards.) Not so surprisingly, in retrospect, he went straight for what was familiar, what he could grab in his hand and actually look at: the books. It took some effort to wrestle him away from Five Stories About Princesses and enlist him in my quest for bad toys. (Madeline had, by then, fallen asleep.) I had finally found the Nerf \"blasters,\" but he wasn't interested. \"Let's not go down this aisle, okay, Mom?\" I was, of course, looking for the worst of the worst when it came to weaponry, but it proved remarkably hard to find. The aisle did, admittedly, have the Nerf Zombie Strike Doominator and the Nerf Modulus Recon MKII for $34.99 each. Those certainly sounded grim, given the eternal war against the undead, but the bright orange, cartoonish, completely unrealistic \"blasters\" on display and marketed to kids \"eight and up\" seemed distant indeed from American gun carnage (and our wars in distant lands), nor was there anything on the packaging that even hinted at real people getting shot in real encounters or real wars. I must admit that I don't like the idea of Seamus shooting anything at anyone-even a brain-hungry zombie-but as it turned out, I needn't have worried, not this time around anyway. Zombie-killing wasn't in his wheelhouse. Still, I kept looking for the real gun aisle, and I did come across more blasters, dart shooters, and the like, none with the word \"gun\" on them. Of course, we do live in Connecticut, less than 100 miles from Newtown where, in 2012, Adam Lanza, a devotee of violent video games who grew up in a gun-filled house , killed 20 kids just a little older than Seamus along with six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. So maybe our local toy outlet was being sensitive, but I doubt it. There was the Halo UNSC SMG Blaster (the initials make it sound extra tough but stand for nothing) for $19.99, and the NERF Star Wars Episode VII First Order Stormtrooper Deluxe Blaster , which fires 12 darts up to 65 feet without reloading, for $41.99. The worst thing I could find was the Xploderz Mayhem , with \"more distance, more ammo,\" which shoots easy-to-wash off mini-water pellets. It was on clearance for $18.89. By then, Seamus was pulling me frantically toward the aisle with the full Frozen franchise on display. Madeline was now awake and in heaven. So I left them there briefly and snuck off to do a last check for \"real\" toy guns. No such luck. I didn't find the kind of Airsoft gun Tamir Rice was playing with when he was killed. I didn't find an ersatz Sig Sauer either. It turns out that most brick-and-mortar toy stores don't seem to offer realistic-looking toy weaponry anymore, nor is there the toy store equivalent of the curtained-off area in the old neighborhood video rental shop where the porn was available. For such toys, you have to turn to an online world of websites like Kids-Army.com , where you can indeed buy realistic-looking toy rifles, shotguns, and pistols, or even to Amazon, where you can find an Airsoft version of the Sig Sauer rifle for $249.99. \"Start Them Young\" The National Rifle Association (NRA) would undoubtedly have been disappointed by my local Toys \"R\" Us outlet-just as its officials undoubtedly are by the way most big toy merchants seem to have left their more realistic guns for the online world. This happened, in part, in response to the sort of social pressure that my husband engaged in when in high school and-more critically-the almost routine horror of the blurred line between toy guns and real ones. You know we're a quirky, gun-crazy nation when Cleveland could ban toy guns and umbrellas with pointy tips from the area around the Republican Convention in the name of security, but couldn't keep out the real guns in open-carry Ohio. The NRA wants kids to play with realistic toy guns and BB guns, since they believe that such toys are part of a child's initiation into the future ownership of perfectly real guns. At the moment, the gun lobby is concerned that not enough people have guns-even though the 270 million to 310 million of them already amassed around this country (according to the Pew Research Center ) could arm just about every man, woman, transgendered person, and child around. Still, despite the fact that Americans can now carry guns in all 50 states and the NRA continues to win most of the big political fights, the number of households with guns is actually down from its peak in the late 1960s (though those that are armed have more and deadlier weapons than ever before). No wonder the gun industry and the gun lobby are fighting to produce an army of toddlers. \" Start Them Young ,\" a February 2016 report from the Violence Policy Center, details how gun manufacturers and the NRA are eager to market real guns to younger and younger consumers. The report starts with a selection of quotes from the industry, including this gem from Craig Cushman, marketing director for T h ompson/Center Arms , about their Hot Shot rifle for kids: \"[We're] talking about a tiny gun intended for the very youngest shooters-the ultimate first gun. We're targeting the six- to 12-year-old range.\" In other words, kids are literally in their sights. It's a strange world we live in. The toy industry has puffed up and candy-colored its play guns, turned up the volume on the violence online and in video games, and wrapped everything in plastic and safety warnings. At the same time, the gun industry is making its guns smaller and cuter for kids, while putting its energy into the all-important junior market. Can we be safe-any of us-in a nation awash in guns? The gun-and-ammo industry boasted $16 billion in revenue for 2015. Gun stores-from brick-and-mortar shops to online retailers-had $3.1 billion in revenue that same year. The industry as a whole claimed responsibility for nearly $50 billion in \"economic activity\" in 2015 alone. That represents a fair number of jobs, but here is the number that really goes boom: $229 billion. That's the annual cost of fatal and non-fatal gun violence in this country, according to Mother Jones and analyst Ted Miller of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, who teamed up to crunch the numbers. That figure includes both the direct costs of gun injuries and deaths-police investigations, emergency personnel, hospital bills, long-term care for the injured, funeral expenses for the dead, and the costs of prosecuting and imprisoning the perpetrators. As the report concludes: \"Even before accounting for the more intangible costs of the violence... the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America is nearly $400,000. And we pay for 32 of them every single day.\" We are awash in guns. Where does it end? Gun violence is embedded in our national mythology, our foreign policy, our notions of masculinity, our entertainment industry, and our children's play. We see violence solving problems on every screen-from the zombie apocalypse to the rise of ISIS. Russian playwright Anton Chekhov's maxim still applies: \"One should not put a loaded rifle onto the stage if no one is thinking of firing it.\" Sooner or later, that rifle is sure to go off. It might be an accident; it might be terrorism; it might be hate. But it will go off. Somewhere, as you read this, it's going off right now. I don't want to police my kids' imagination.

Those certainly sounded grim, given the eternal war against the undead, but the bright orange, cartoonish, completely unrealistic \"blasters\" on display and marketed to kids \"eight and up\" seemed distant indeed from American gun carnage (and our wars in distant lands), nor was there anything on the packaging that even hinted at real people getting shot in real encounters or real wars. I must admit that I don't like the idea of Seamus shooting anything at anyone-even a brain-hungry zombie-but as it turned out, I needn't have worried, not this time around anyway. Zombie-killing wasn't in his wheelhouse. Still, I kept looking for the real gun aisle, and I did come across more blasters, dart shooters, and the like, none with the word \"gun\" on them. Of course, we do live in Connecticut, less than 100 miles from Newtown where, in 2012, Adam Lanza, a devotee of violent video games who grew up in a gun-filled house , killed 20 kids just a little older than Seamus along with six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. So maybe our local toy outlet was being sensitive, but I doubt it. There was the Halo UNSC SMG Blaster (the initials make it sound extra tough but stand for nothing) for $19.99, and the NERF Star Wars Episode VII First Order Stormtrooper Deluxe Blaster , which fires 12 darts up to 65 feet without reloading, for $41.99. The worst thing I could find was the Xploderz Mayhem , with \"more distance, more ammo,\" which shoots easy-to-wash off mini-water pellets. It was on clearance for $18.89. By then, Seamus was pulling me frantically toward the aisle with the full Frozen franchise on display. Madeline was now awake and in heaven. So I left them there briefly and snuck off to do a last check for \"real\" toy guns. No such luck. I didn't find the kind of Airsoft gun Tamir Rice was playing with when he was killed. I didn't find an ersatz Sig Sauer either. It turns out that most brick-and-mortar toy stores don't seem to offer realistic-looking toy weaponry anymore, nor is there the toy store equivalent of the curtained-off area in the old neighborhood video rental shop where the porn was available. For such toys, you have to turn to an online world of websites like Kids-Army.com , where you can indeed buy realistic-looking toy rifles, shotguns, and pistols, or even to Amazon, where you can find an Airsoft version of the Sig Sauer rifle for $249.99. \"Start Them Young\" The National Rifle Association (NRA) would undoubtedly have been disappointed by my local Toys \"R\" Us outlet-just as its officials undoubtedly are by the way most big toy merchants seem to have left their more realistic guns for the online world. This happened, in part, in response to the sort of social pressure that my husband engaged in when in high school and-more critically-the almost routine horror of the blurred line between toy guns and real ones. You know we're a quirky, gun-crazy nation when Cleveland could ban toy guns and umbrellas with pointy tips from the area around the Republican Convention in the name of security, but couldn't keep out the real guns in open-carry Ohio. The NRA wants kids to play with realistic toy guns and BB guns, since they believe that such toys are part of a child's initiation into the future ownership of perfectly real guns. At the moment, the gun lobby is concerned that not enough people have guns-even though the 270 million to 310 million of them already amassed around this country (according to the Pew Research Center ) could arm just about every man, woman, transgendered person, and child around. Still, despite the fact that Americans can now carry guns in all 50 states and the NRA continues to win most of the big political fights, the number of households with guns is actually down from its peak in the late 1960s (though those that are armed have more and deadlier weapons than ever before). No wonder the gun industry and the gun lobby are fighting to produce an army of toddlers. \" Start Them Young ,\" a February 2016 report from the Violence Policy Center, details how gun manufacturers and the NRA are eager to market real guns to younger and younger consumers. The report starts with a selection of quotes from the industry, including this gem from Craig Cushman, marketing director for T h ompson/Center Arms , about their Hot Shot rifle for kids: \"[We're] talking about a tiny gun intended for the very youngest shooters-the ultimate first gun. We're targeting the six- to 12-year-old range.\" In other words, kids are literally in their sights. It's a strange world we live in. The toy industry has puffed up and candy-colored its play guns, turned up the volume on the violence online and in video games, and wrapped everything in plastic and safety warnings. At the same time, the gun industry is making its guns smaller and cuter for kids, while putting its energy into the all-important junior market. Can we be safe-any of us-in a nation awash in guns? The gun-and-ammo industry boasted $16 billion in revenue for 2015. Gun stores-from brick-and-mortar shops to online retailers-had $3.1 billion in revenue that same year. The industry as a whole claimed responsibility for nearly $50 billion in \"economic activity\" in 2015 alone. That represents a fair number of jobs, but here is the number that really goes boom: $229 billion. That's the annual cost of fatal and non-fatal gun violence in this country, according to Mother Jones and analyst Ted Miller of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, who teamed up to crunch the numbers. That figure includes both the direct costs of gun injuries and deaths-police investigations, emergency personnel, hospital bills, long-term care for the injured, funeral expenses for the dead, and the costs of prosecuting and imprisoning the perpetrators. As the report concludes: \"Even before accounting for the more intangible costs of the violence... the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America is nearly $400,000. And we pay for 32 of them every single day.\" We are awash in guns. Where does it end? Gun violence is embedded in our national mythology, our foreign policy, our notions of masculinity, our entertainment industry, and our children's play. We see violence solving problems on every screen-from the zombie apocalypse to the rise of ISIS. Russian playwright Anton Chekhov's maxim still applies: \"One should not put a loaded rifle onto the stage if no one is thinking of firing it.\" Sooner or later, that rifle is sure to go off. It might be an accident; it might be terrorism; it might be hate. But it will go off. Somewhere, as you read this, it's going off right now. I don't want to police my kids' imagination. And there is a whole strain of parenting literature that assures me that I don't have to. It says don't interfere with your kid's play, even if it includes guns and shooting and killing. Imagination is imagination and the violence isn't real. It might even, so this line of thinking goes, be a healthy way for them to process feelings of aggression. I get what they're saying, but it seems like a cop-out to me. To my mind, nonintervention is often a missed opportunity to be a parent. Sure, the violence isn't real. The pow-pows don't actually rip skin and tendon or stop hearts from beating, but the United States, which has been fighting distant wars nonstop for 15 years now, does have a violence problem and a man problem and a gun problem. We know where that problem ends, but it starts somewhere, too. One place to begin to look, at least, is at how our kids-particularly our boys-play, and how they are nurtured (or not), and taught to express their emotions (or not). It is, at least in part, up to us, their parents, to decide whether they are going to be the ones who help repair our society and reorient us (or not). And it begins with the kinds of care and love they receive, the kinds of conversations they are invited into, the kinds of expectations they are given about behavior and relationships. I don't want to raise Seamus, Madeline, or Rosena in the austere, ripped from the headlines of horror, polemical atmosphere that was the essence of my own childhood. But I don't want them to get comfortable with killing either. I want so much more for, and from, my little boy than \"Pow, pow, yous are dead now!\" And that starts with taking the gun or the stick or the rainbow flag out of his hands, sitting him down, and having a hard conversation about what guns actually do to people-and how much killing hurts us all.\n\nToys matter. We've put a fair amount of thought into what might be called toy curation in our household. We've bought nothing new and little used. Mostly, we've accepted shipments of hand-me-downs from friends who just wanted \"this crap\" out of their houses. No guns came with them, thankfully. After all, even toy guns can mean death under the wrong circumstances. A year ago, I visited the Cuddell Recreation Center in Cleveland with my daughter Madeline and a group of friends. That broad stretch of ball fields and paths, anchored by a gazebo and a playground, was where 12-year-old Tamir Rice was fatally shot by Officer Timothy Loehmann in November 2014. Rice, an African American, was playing with an Airsoft pellet gun that a friend's dad had bought at Walmart . A replica of an actual Colt pistol, it shot plastic pellets and looked pretty real, since the orange tip signifying \"toy\" was missing. However, Officer Loehmann, investigating a report that a man was carrying a gun in the park, was moving too fast to notice much. He sped up and began shooting even before his squad car stopped moving. Rice's hands were still reportedly in his pockets. Though Loehmann was not indicted, the city of Cleveland paid a $6 million settlement to the Rice family and demolished the gazebo where the boy was shot. In the park that day, local activists described the shooting and its aftermath to our group. Half listening, I followed Madeline as she toddled into the playground. I tried to imagine Samaria Rice's pain in this unremarkable place made part shrine, part soapbox by a police officer's quick trigger finger, racism, and her son's blood. I thought about that toy gun in Tamir Rice's hand and what might have been going through his head as he pointed it and played with it. Despite the age difference, it couldn't have been that far from what regularly goes through my son's head when he picks up a stick and points it: pop, boom, wow! The difference, of course, is that Seamus, blond and freckled and unmistakably white, would run little risk of being shot down by a policeman, even eight years from now with a replica toy gun in his hands. Blasters, Blasters, Everywhere Toys are a big business in this country, raking in $19.4 billion in 2015, according to the retail tracking firm NPD Group . Our family is not responsible for even a dime of this. Not surprisingly, then, my announcement that we were all going to spend a rainy afternoon at a local Toys \"R\" Us store came like a bolt from the blue for the kids. I wanted to see what kind of toy weaponry was for sale there. I was curious, among other things, about whether the boys at school who had taught Seamus about superheroes, bad guys, and Star Wars had ignited in my son a love of weaponry; I was curious, that is, as to how he would react to the walls of guns I imagined Toys \"R\" Us displaying. We got into our car as if it were Christmas Eve, Seamus beside himself with excitement, Madeline on a contact high from her brother. I was experiencing my own contact high, taking my kids on their first research trip. What we found was not exactly what I expected-on many levels. Seamus was quickly overwhelmed by the glut of everything-lots of pictures of toys on boxes, but not a lot to pick up. (It was, in that sense, the very opposite of our visits to the Goodwill store, where you can sit on the floor and play with all those second-hand toys as long as you put them back afterwards.) Not so surprisingly, in retrospect, he went straight for what was familiar, what he could grab in his hand and actually look at: the books. It took some effort to wrestle him away from Five Stories About Princesses and enlist him in my quest for bad toys. (Madeline had, by then, fallen asleep.) I had finally found the Nerf \"blasters,\" but he wasn't interested. \"Let's not go down this aisle, okay, Mom?\" I was, of course, looking for the worst of the worst when it came to weaponry, but it proved remarkably hard to find.

I tried to imagine Samaria Rice's pain in this unremarkable place made part shrine, part soapbox by a police officer's quick trigger finger, racism, and her son's blood. I thought about that toy gun in Tamir Rice's hand and what might have been going through his head as he pointed it and played with it. Despite the age difference, it couldn't have been that far from what regularly goes through my son's head when he picks up a stick and points it: pop, boom, wow! The difference, of course, is that Seamus, blond and freckled and unmistakably white, would run little risk of being shot down by a policeman, even eight years from now with a replica toy gun in his hands. Blasters, Blasters, Everywhere Toys are a big business in this country, raking in $19.4 billion in 2015, according to the retail tracking firm NPD Group . Our family is not responsible for even a dime of this. Not surprisingly, then, my announcement that we were all going to spend a rainy afternoon at a local Toys \"R\" Us store came like a bolt from the blue for the kids. I wanted to see what kind of toy weaponry was for sale there. I was curious, among other things, about whether the boys at school who had taught Seamus about superheroes, bad guys, and Star Wars had ignited in my son a love of weaponry; I was curious, that is, as to how he would react to the walls of guns I imagined Toys \"R\" Us displaying. We got into our car as if it were Christmas Eve, Seamus beside himself with excitement, Madeline on a contact high from her brother. I was experiencing my own contact high, taking my kids on their first research trip. What we found was not exactly what I expected-on many levels. Seamus was quickly overwhelmed by the glut of everything-lots of pictures of toys on boxes, but not a lot to pick up. (It was, in that sense, the very opposite of our visits to the Goodwill store, where you can sit on the floor and play with all those second-hand toys as long as you put them back afterwards.) Not so surprisingly, in retrospect, he went straight for what was familiar, what he could grab in his hand and actually look at: the books. It took some effort to wrestle him away from Five Stories About Princesses and enlist him in my quest for bad toys. (Madeline had, by then, fallen asleep.) I had finally found the Nerf \"blasters,\" but he wasn't interested. \"Let's not go down this aisle, okay, Mom?\" I was, of course, looking for the worst of the worst when it came to weaponry, but it proved remarkably hard to find. The aisle did, admittedly, have the Nerf Zombie Strike Doominator and the Nerf Modulus Recon MKII for $34.99 each. Those certainly sounded grim, given the eternal war against the undead, but the bright orange, cartoonish, completely unrealistic \"blasters\" on display and marketed to kids \"eight and up\" seemed distant indeed from American gun carnage (and our wars in distant lands), nor was there anything on the packaging that even hinted at real people getting shot in real encounters or real wars. I must admit that I don't like the idea of Seamus shooting anything at anyone-even a brain-hungry zombie-but as it turned out, I needn't have worried, not this time around anyway. Zombie-killing wasn't in his wheelhouse. Still, I kept looking for the real gun aisle, and I did come across more blasters, dart shooters, and the like, none with the word \"gun\" on them. Of course, we do live in Connecticut, less than 100 miles from Newtown where, in 2012, Adam Lanza, a devotee of violent video games who grew up in a gun-filled house , killed 20 kids just a little older than Seamus along with six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. So maybe our local toy outlet was being sensitive, but I doubt it. There was the Halo UNSC SMG Blaster (the initials make it sound extra tough but stand for nothing) for $19.99, and the NERF Star Wars Episode VII First Order Stormtrooper Deluxe Blaster , which fires 12 darts up to 65 feet without reloading, for $41.99. The worst thing I could find was the Xploderz Mayhem , with \"more distance, more ammo,\" which shoots easy-to-wash off mini-water pellets. It was on clearance for $18.89. By then, Seamus was pulling me frantically toward the aisle with the full Frozen franchise on display. Madeline was now awake and in heaven. So I left them there briefly and snuck off to do a last check for \"real\" toy guns. No such luck. I didn't find the kind of Airsoft gun Tamir Rice was playing with when he was killed. I didn't find an ersatz Sig Sauer either. It turns out that most brick-and-mortar toy stores don't seem to offer realistic-looking toy weaponry anymore, nor is there the toy store equivalent of the curtained-off area in the old neighborhood video rental shop where the porn was available. For such toys, you have to turn to an online world of websites like Kids-Army.com , where you can indeed buy realistic-looking toy rifles, shotguns, and pistols, or even to Amazon, where you can find an Airsoft version of the Sig Sauer rifle for $249.99. \"Start Them Young\" The National Rifle Association (NRA) would undoubtedly have been disappointed by my local Toys \"R\" Us outlet-just as its officials undoubtedly are by the way most big toy merchants seem to have left their more realistic guns for the online world. This happened, in part, in response to the sort of social pressure that my husband engaged in when in high school and-more critically-the almost routine horror of the blurred line between toy guns and real ones. You know we're a quirky, gun-crazy nation when Cleveland could ban toy guns and umbrellas with pointy tips from the area around the Republican Convention in the name of security, but couldn't keep out the real guns in open-carry Ohio. The NRA wants kids to play with realistic toy guns and BB guns, since they believe that such toys are part of a child's initiation into the future ownership of perfectly real guns. At the moment, the gun lobby is concerned that not enough people have guns-even though the 270 million to 310 million of them already amassed around this country (according to the Pew Research Center ) could arm just about every man, woman, transgendered person, and child around. Still, despite the fact that Americans can now carry guns in all 50 states and the NRA continues to win most of the big political fights, the number of households with guns is actually down from its peak in the late 1960s (though those that are armed have more and deadlier weapons than ever before). No wonder the gun industry and the gun lobby are fighting to produce an army of toddlers. \" Start Them Young ,\" a February 2016 report from the Violence Policy Center, details how gun manufacturers and the NRA are eager to market real guns to younger and younger consumers. The report starts with a selection of quotes from the industry, including this gem from Craig Cushman, marketing director for T h ompson/Center Arms , about their Hot Shot rifle for kids: \"[We're] talking about a tiny gun intended for the very youngest shooters-the ultimate first gun. We're targeting the six- to 12-year-old range.\" In other words, kids are literally in their sights. It's a strange world we live in. The toy industry has puffed up and candy-colored its play guns, turned up the volume on the violence online and in video games, and wrapped everything in plastic and safety warnings. At the same time, the gun industry is making its guns smaller and cuter for kids, while putting its energy into the all-important junior market. Can we be safe-any of us-in a nation awash in guns? The gun-and-ammo industry boasted $16 billion in revenue for 2015. Gun stores-from brick-and-mortar shops to online retailers-had $3.1 billion in revenue that same year. The industry as a whole claimed responsibility for nearly $50 billion in \"economic activity\" in 2015 alone. That represents a fair number of jobs, but here is the number that really goes boom: $229 billion. That's the annual cost of fatal and non-fatal gun violence in this country, according to Mother Jones and analyst Ted Miller of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, who teamed up to crunch the numbers. That figure includes both the direct costs of gun injuries and deaths-police investigations, emergency personnel, hospital bills, long-term care for the injured, funeral expenses for the dead, and the costs of prosecuting and imprisoning the perpetrators. As the report concludes: \"Even before accounting for the more intangible costs of the violence... the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America is nearly $400,000. And we pay for 32 of them every single day.\" We are awash in guns. Where does it end? Gun violence is embedded in our national mythology, our foreign policy, our notions of masculinity, our entertainment industry, and our children's play. We see violence solving problems on every screen-from the zombie apocalypse to the rise of ISIS. Russian playwright Anton Chekhov's maxim still applies: \"One should not put a loaded rifle onto the stage if no one is thinking of firing it.\" Sooner or later, that rifle is sure to go off. It might be an accident; it might be terrorism; it might be hate. But it will go off. Somewhere, as you read this, it's going off right now. I don't want to police my kids' imagination. And there is a whole strain of parenting literature that assures me that I don't have to. It says don't interfere with your kid's play, even if it includes guns and shooting and killing. Imagination is imagination and the violence isn't real. It might even, so this line of thinking goes, be a healthy way for them to process feelings of aggression. I get what they're saying, but it seems like a cop-out to me. To my mind, nonintervention is often a missed opportunity to be a parent. Sure, the violence isn't real. The pow-pows don't actually rip skin and tendon or stop hearts from beating, but the United States, which has been fighting distant wars nonstop for 15 years now, does have a violence problem and a man problem and a gun problem. We know where that problem ends, but it starts somewhere, too. One place to begin to look, at least, is at how our kids-particularly our boys-play, and how they are nurtured (or not), and taught to express their emotions (or not). It is, at least in part, up to us, their parents, to decide whether they are going to be the ones who help repair our society and reorient us (or not). And it begins with the kinds of care and love they receive, the kinds of conversations they are invited into, the kinds of expectations they are given about behavior and relationships. I don't want to raise Seamus, Madeline, or Rosena in the austere, ripped from the headlines of horror, polemical atmosphere that was the essence of my own childhood. But I don't want them to get comfortable with killing either. I want so much more for, and from, my little boy than \"Pow, pow, yous are dead now!\" And that starts with taking the gun or the stick or the rainbow flag out of his hands, sitting him down, and having a hard conversation about what guns actually do to people-and how much killing hurts us all.\n\nI thought about that toy gun in Tamir Rice's hand and what might have been going through his head as he pointed it and played with it.

Not so surprisingly, in retrospect, he went straight for what was familiar, what he could grab in his hand and actually look at: the books. It took some effort to wrestle him away from Five Stories About Princesses and enlist him in my quest for bad toys. (Madeline had, by then, fallen asleep.) I had finally found the Nerf \"blasters,\" but he wasn't interested. \"Let's not go down this aisle, okay, Mom?\" I was, of course, looking for the worst of the worst when it came to weaponry, but it proved remarkably hard to find. The aisle did, admittedly, have the Nerf Zombie Strike Doominator and the Nerf Modulus Recon MKII for $34.99 each. Those certainly sounded grim, given the eternal war against the undead, but the bright orange, cartoonish, completely unrealistic \"blasters\" on display and marketed to kids \"eight and up\" seemed distant indeed from American gun carnage (and our wars in distant lands), nor was there anything on the packaging that even hinted at real people getting shot in real encounters or real wars. I must admit that I don't like the idea of Seamus shooting anything at anyone-even a brain-hungry zombie-but as it turned out, I needn't have worried, not this time around anyway. Zombie-killing wasn't in his wheelhouse. Still, I kept looking for the real gun aisle, and I did come across more blasters, dart shooters, and the like, none with the word \"gun\" on them. Of course, we do live in Connecticut, less than 100 miles from Newtown where, in 2012, Adam Lanza, a devotee of violent video games who grew up in a gun-filled house , killed 20 kids just a little older than Seamus along with six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. So maybe our local toy outlet was being sensitive, but I doubt it. There was the Halo UNSC SMG Blaster (the initials make it sound extra tough but stand for nothing) for $19.99, and the NERF Star Wars Episode VII First Order Stormtrooper Deluxe Blaster , which fires 12 darts up to 65 feet without reloading, for $41.99. The worst thing I could find was the Xploderz Mayhem , with \"more distance, more ammo,\" which shoots easy-to-wash off mini-water pellets. It was on clearance for $18.89. By then, Seamus was pulling me frantically toward the aisle with the full Frozen franchise on display. Madeline was now awake and in heaven. So I left them there briefly and snuck off to do a last check for \"real\" toy guns. No such luck. I didn't find the kind of Airsoft gun Tamir Rice was playing with when he was killed. I didn't find an ersatz Sig Sauer either. It turns out that most brick-and-mortar toy stores don't seem to offer realistic-looking toy weaponry anymore, nor is there the toy store equivalent of the curtained-off area in the old neighborhood video rental shop where the porn was available. For such toys, you have to turn to an online world of websites like Kids-Army.com , where you can indeed buy realistic-looking toy rifles, shotguns, and pistols, or even to Amazon, where you can find an Airsoft version of the Sig Sauer rifle for $249.99. \"Start Them Young\" The National Rifle Association (NRA) would undoubtedly have been disappointed by my local Toys \"R\" Us outlet-just as its officials undoubtedly are by the way most big toy merchants seem to have left their more realistic guns for the online world. This happened, in part, in response to the sort of social pressure that my husband engaged in when in high school and-more critically-the almost routine horror of the blurred line between toy guns and real ones. You know we're a quirky, gun-crazy nation when Cleveland could ban toy guns and umbrellas with pointy tips from the area around the Republican Convention in the name of security, but couldn't keep out the real guns in open-carry Ohio. The NRA wants kids to play with realistic toy guns and BB guns, since they believe that such toys are part of a child's initiation into the future ownership of perfectly real guns. At the moment, the gun lobby is concerned that not enough people have guns-even though the 270 million to 310 million of them already amassed around this country (according to the Pew Research Center ) could arm just about every man, woman, transgendered person, and child around. Still, despite the fact that Americans can now carry guns in all 50 states and the NRA continues to win most of the big political fights, the number of households with guns is actually down from its peak in the late 1960s (though those that are armed have more and deadlier weapons than ever before). No wonder the gun industry and the gun lobby are fighting to produce an army of toddlers. \" Start Them Young ,\" a February 2016 report from the Violence Policy Center, details how gun manufacturers and the NRA are eager to market real guns to younger and younger consumers. The report starts with a selection of quotes from the industry, including this gem from Craig Cushman, marketing director for T h ompson/Center Arms , about their Hot Shot rifle for kids: \"[We're] talking about a tiny gun intended for the very youngest shooters-the ultimate first gun. We're targeting the six- to 12-year-old range.\" In other words, kids are literally in their sights. It's a strange world we live in. The toy industry has puffed up and candy-colored its play guns, turned up the volume on the violence online and in video games, and wrapped everything in plastic and safety warnings. At the same time, the gun industry is making its guns smaller and cuter for kids, while putting its energy into the all-important junior market. Can we be safe-any of us-in a nation awash in guns? The gun-and-ammo industry boasted $16 billion in revenue for 2015. Gun stores-from brick-and-mortar shops to online retailers-had $3.1 billion in revenue that same year. The industry as a whole claimed responsibility for nearly $50 billion in \"economic activity\" in 2015 alone. That represents a fair number of jobs, but here is the number that really goes boom: $229 billion. That's the annual cost of fatal and non-fatal gun violence in this country, according to Mother Jones and analyst Ted Miller of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, who teamed up to crunch the numbers. That figure includes both the direct costs of gun injuries and deaths-police investigations, emergency personnel, hospital bills, long-term care for the injured, funeral expenses for the dead, and the costs of prosecuting and imprisoning the perpetrators. As the report concludes: \"Even before accounting for the more intangible costs of the violence... the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America is nearly $400,000. And we pay for 32 of them every single day.\" We are awash in guns. Where does it end? Gun violence is embedded in our national mythology, our foreign policy, our notions of masculinity, our entertainment industry, and our children's play. We see violence solving problems on every screen-from the zombie apocalypse to the rise of ISIS. Russian playwright Anton Chekhov's maxim still applies: \"One should not put a loaded rifle onto the stage if no one is thinking of firing it.\" Sooner or later, that rifle is sure to go off. It might be an accident; it might be terrorism; it might be hate. But it will go off. Somewhere, as you read this, it's going off right now. I don't want to police my kids' imagination. And there is a whole strain of parenting literature that assures me that I don't have to. It says don't interfere with your kid's play, even if it includes guns and shooting and killing. Imagination is imagination and the violence isn't real. It might even, so this line of thinking goes, be a healthy way for them to process feelings of aggression. I get what they're saying, but it seems like a cop-out to me. To my mind, nonintervention is often a missed opportunity to be a parent. Sure, the violence isn't real. The pow-pows don't actually rip skin and tendon or stop hearts from beating, but the United States, which has been fighting distant wars nonstop for 15 years now, does have a violence problem and a man problem and a gun problem. We know where that problem ends, but it starts somewhere, too. One place to begin to look, at least, is at how our kids-particularly our boys-play, and how they are nurtured (or not), and taught to express their emotions (or not). It is, at least in part, up to us, their parents, to decide whether they are going to be the ones who help repair our society and reorient us (or not). And it begins with the kinds of care and love they receive, the kinds of conversations they are invited into, the kinds of expectations they are given about behavior and relationships. I don't want to raise Seamus, Madeline, or Rosena in the austere, ripped from the headlines of horror, polemical atmosphere that was the essence of my own childhood. But I don't want them to get comfortable with killing either. I want so much more for, and from, my little boy than \"Pow, pow, yous are dead now!\" And that starts with taking the gun or the stick or the rainbow flag out of his hands, sitting him down, and having a hard conversation about what guns actually do to people-and how much killing hurts us all.\n\nWe got into our car as if it were Christmas Eve, Seamus beside himself with excitement, Madeline on a contact high from her brother. I was experiencing my own contact high, taking my kids on their first research trip. What we found was not exactly what I expected-on many levels. Seamus was quickly overwhelmed by the glut of everything-lots of pictures of toys on boxes, but not a lot to pick up. (It was, in that sense, the very opposite of our visits to the Goodwill store, where you can sit on the floor and play with all those second-hand toys as long as you put them back afterwards.)

We're targeting the six- to 12-year-old range.\" In other words, kids are literally in their sights. It's a strange world we live in. The toy industry has puffed up and candy-colored its play guns, turned up the volume on the violence online and in video games, and wrapped everything in plastic and safety warnings. At the same time, the gun industry is making its guns smaller and cuter for kids, while putting its energy into the all-important junior market. Can we be safe-any of us-in a nation awash in guns? The gun-and-ammo industry boasted $16 billion in revenue for 2015. Gun stores-from brick-and-mortar shops to online retailers-had $3.1 billion in revenue that same year. The industry as a whole claimed responsibility for nearly $50 billion in \"economic activity\" in 2015 alone. That represents a fair number of jobs, but here is the number that really goes boom: $229 billion. That's the annual cost of fatal and non-fatal gun violence in this country, according to Mother Jones and analyst Ted Miller of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, who teamed up to crunch the numbers. That figure includes both the direct costs of gun injuries and deaths-police investigations, emergency personnel, hospital bills, long-term care for the injured, funeral expenses for the dead, and the costs of prosecuting and imprisoning the perpetrators. As the report concludes: \"Even before accounting for the more intangible costs of the violence... the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America is nearly $400,000. And we pay for 32 of them every single day.\" We are awash in guns. Where does it end? Gun violence is embedded in our national mythology, our foreign policy, our notions of masculinity, our entertainment industry, and our children's play. We see violence solving problems on every screen-from the zombie apocalypse to the rise of ISIS. Russian playwright Anton Chekhov's maxim still applies: \"One should not put a loaded rifle onto the stage if no one is thinking of firing it.\" Sooner or later, that rifle is sure to go off. It might be an accident; it might be terrorism; it might be hate. But it will go off. Somewhere, as you read this, it's going off right now. I don't want to police my kids' imagination. And there is a whole strain of parenting literature that assures me that I don't have to. It says don't interfere with your kid's play, even if it includes guns and shooting and killing. Imagination is imagination and the violence isn't real. It might even, so this line of thinking goes, be a healthy way for them to process feelings of aggression. I get what they're saying, but it seems like a cop-out to me. To my mind, nonintervention is often a missed opportunity to be a parent. Sure, the violence isn't real. The pow-pows don't actually rip skin and tendon or stop hearts from beating, but the United States, which has been fighting distant wars nonstop for 15 years now, does have a violence problem and a man problem and a gun problem. We know where that problem ends, but it starts somewhere, too. One place to begin to look, at least, is at how our kids-particularly our boys-play, and how they are nurtured (or not), and taught to express their emotions (or not). It is, at least in part, up to us, their parents, to decide whether they are going to be the ones who help repair our society and reorient us (or not). And it begins with the kinds of care and love they receive, the kinds of conversations they are invited into, the kinds of expectations they are given about behavior and relationships. I don't want to raise Seamus, Madeline, or Rosena in the austere, ripped from the headlines of horror, polemical atmosphere that was the essence of my own childhood. But I don't want them to get comfortable with killing either. I want so much more for, and from, my little boy than \"Pow, pow, yous are dead now!\" And that starts with taking the gun or the stick or the rainbow flag out of his hands, sitting him down, and having a hard conversation about what guns actually do to people-and how much killing hurts us all.\n\nI had finally found the Nerf \"blasters,\" but he wasn't interested. \"Let's not go down this aisle, okay, Mom?\" I was, of course, looking for the worst of the worst when it came to weaponry, but it proved remarkably hard to find. The aisle did, admittedly, have the Nerf Zombie Strike Doominator and the Nerf Modulus Recon MKII for $34.99 each. Those certainly sounded grim, given the eternal war against the undead, but the bright orange, cartoonish, completely unrealistic \"blasters\" on display and marketed to kids \"eight and up\" seemed distant indeed from American gun carnage (and our wars in distant lands), nor was there anything on the packaging that even hinted at real people getting shot in real encounters or real wars. I must admit that I don't like the idea of Seamus shooting anything at anyone-even a brain-hungry zombie-but as it turned out, I needn't have worried, not this time around anyway. Zombie-killing wasn't in his wheelhouse. Still, I kept looking for the real gun aisle, and I did come across more blasters, dart shooters, and the like, none with the word \"gun\" on them. Of course, we do live in Connecticut, less than 100 miles from Newtown where, in 2012, Adam Lanza, a devotee of violent video games who grew up in a gun-filled house , killed 20 kids just a little older than Seamus along with six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. So maybe our local toy outlet was being sensitive, but I doubt it. There was the Halo UNSC SMG Blaster (the initials make it sound extra tough but stand for nothing) for $19.99, and the NERF Star Wars Episode VII First Order Stormtrooper Deluxe Blaster , which fires 12 darts up to 65 feet without reloading, for $41.99. The worst thing I could find was the Xploderz Mayhem , with \"more distance, more ammo,\" which shoots easy-to-wash off mini-water pellets. It was on clearance for $18.89. By then, Seamus was pulling me frantically toward the aisle with the full Frozen franchise on display. Madeline was now awake and in heaven. So I left them there briefly and snuck off to do a last check for \"real\" toy guns. No such luck. I didn't find the kind of Airsoft gun Tamir Rice was playing with when he was killed. I didn't find an ersatz Sig Sauer either. It turns out that most brick-and-mortar toy stores don't seem to offer realistic-looking toy weaponry anymore, nor is there the toy store equivalent of the curtained-off area in the old neighborhood video rental shop where the porn was available. For such toys, you have to turn to an online world of websites like Kids-Army.com , where you can indeed buy realistic-looking toy rifles, shotguns, and pistols, or even to Amazon, where you can find an Airsoft version of the Sig Sauer rifle for $249.99. \"Start Them Young\" The National Rifle Association (NRA) would undoubtedly have been disappointed by my local Toys \"R\" Us outlet-just as its officials undoubtedly are by the way most big toy merchants seem to have left their more realistic guns for the online world. This happened, in part, in response to the sort of social pressure that my husband engaged in when in high school and-more critically-the almost routine horror of the blurred line between toy guns and real ones. You know we're a quirky, gun-crazy nation when Cleveland could ban toy guns and umbrellas with pointy tips from the area around the Republican Convention in the name of security, but couldn't keep out the real guns in open-carry Ohio. The NRA wants kids to play with realistic toy guns and BB guns, since they believe that such toys are part of a child's initiation into the future ownership of perfectly real guns. At the moment, the gun lobby is concerned that not enough people have guns-even though the 270 million to 310 million of them already amassed around this country (according to the Pew Research Center ) could arm just about every man, woman, transgendered person, and child around. Still, despite the fact that Americans can now carry guns in all 50 states and the NRA continues to win most of the big political fights, the number of households with guns is actually down from its peak in the late 1960s (though those that are armed have more and deadlier weapons than ever before).

That figure includes both the direct costs of gun injuries and deaths-police investigations, emergency personnel, hospital bills, long-term care for the injured, funeral expenses for the dead, and the costs of prosecuting and imprisoning the perpetrators. As the report concludes: \"Even before accounting for the more intangible costs of the violence... the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America is nearly $400,000. And we pay for 32 of them every single day.\" We are awash in guns. Where does it end? Gun violence is embedded in our national mythology, our foreign policy, our notions of masculinity, our entertainment industry, and our children's play. We see violence solving problems on every screen-from the zombie apocalypse to the rise of ISIS. Russian playwright Anton Chekhov's maxim still applies: \"One should not put a loaded rifle onto the stage if no one is thinking of firing it.\" Sooner or later, that rifle is sure to go off. It might be an accident; it might be terrorism; it might be hate. But it will go off. Somewhere, as you read this, it's going off right now. I don't want to police my kids' imagination. And there is a whole strain of parenting literature that assures me that I don't have to. It says don't interfere with your kid's play, even if it includes guns and shooting and killing. Imagination is imagination and the violence isn't real. It might even, so this line of thinking goes, be a healthy way for them to process feelings of aggression. I get what they're saying, but it seems like a cop-out to me. To my mind, nonintervention is often a missed opportunity to be a parent. Sure, the violence isn't real. The pow-pows don't actually rip skin and tendon or stop hearts from beating, but the United States, which has been fighting distant wars nonstop for 15 years now, does have a violence problem and a man problem and a gun problem. We know where that problem ends, but it starts somewhere, too. One place to begin to look, at least, is at how our kids-particularly our boys-play, and how they are nurtured (or not), and taught to express their emotions (or not). It is, at least in part, up to us, their parents, to decide whether they are going to be the ones who help repair our society and reorient us (or not). And it begins with the kinds of care and love they receive, the kinds of conversations they are invited into, the kinds of expectations they are given about behavior and relationships. I don't want to raise Seamus, Madeline, or Rosena in the austere, ripped from the headlines of horror, polemical atmosphere that was the essence of my own childhood. But I don't want them to get comfortable with killing either. I want so much more for, and from, my little boy than \"Pow, pow, yous are dead now!\" And that starts with taking the gun or the stick or the rainbow flag out of his hands, sitting him down, and having a hard conversation about what guns actually do to people-and how much killing hurts us all.\n\nSo I left them there briefly and snuck off to do a last check for \"real\" toy guns. No such luck. I didn't find the kind of Airsoft gun Tamir Rice was playing with when he was killed. I didn't find an ersatz Sig Sauer either. It turns out that most brick-and-mortar toy stores don't seem to offer realistic-looking toy weaponry anymore, nor is there the toy store equivalent of the curtained-off area in the old neighborhood video rental shop where the porn was available. For such toys, you have to turn to an online world of websites like Kids-Army.com , where you can indeed buy realistic-looking toy rifles, shotguns, and pistols, or even to Amazon, where you can find an Airsoft version of the Sig Sauer rifle for $249.99. \"Start Them Young\" The National Rifle Association (NRA) would undoubtedly have been disappointed by my local Toys \"R\" Us outlet-just as its officials undoubtedly are by the way most big toy merchants seem to have left their more realistic guns for the online world. This happened, in part, in response to the sort of social pressure that my husband engaged in when in high school and-more critically-the almost routine horror of the blurred line between toy guns and real ones. You know we're a quirky, gun-crazy nation when Cleveland could ban toy guns and umbrellas with pointy tips from the area around the Republican Convention in the name of security, but couldn't keep out the real guns in open-carry Ohio. The NRA wants kids to play with realistic toy guns and BB guns, since they believe that such toys are part of a child's initiation into the future ownership of perfectly real guns. At the moment, the gun lobby is concerned that not enough people have guns-even though the 270 million to 310 million of them already amassed around this country (according to the Pew Research Center ) could arm just about every man, woman, transgendered person, and child around. Still, despite the fact that Americans can now carry guns in all 50 states and the NRA continues to win most of the big political fights, the number of households with guns is actually down from its peak in the late 1960s (though those that are armed have more and deadlier weapons than ever before). No wonder the gun industry and the gun lobby are fighting to produce an army of toddlers. \" Start Them Young ,\" a February 2016 report from the Violence Policy Center, details how gun manufacturers and the NRA are eager to market real guns to younger and younger consumers. The report starts with a selection of quotes from the industry, including this gem from Craig Cushman, marketing director for T h ompson/Center Arms , about their Hot Shot rifle for kids: \"[We're] talking about a tiny gun intended for the very youngest shooters-the ultimate first gun. We're targeting the six- to 12-year-old range.\" In other words, kids are literally in their sights. It's a strange world we live in. The toy industry has puffed up and candy-colored its play guns, turned up the volume on the violence online and in video games, and wrapped everything in plastic and safety warnings. At the same time, the gun industry is making its guns smaller and cuter for kids, while putting its energy into the all-important junior market. Can we be safe-any of us-in a nation awash in guns? The gun-and-ammo industry boasted $16 billion in revenue for 2015. Gun stores-from brick-and-mortar shops to online retailers-had $3.1 billion in revenue that same year. The industry as a whole claimed responsibility for nearly $50 billion in \"economic activity\" in 2015 alone. That represents a fair number of jobs, but here is the number that really goes boom: $229 billion.

Russian playwright Anton Chekhov's maxim still applies: \"One should not put a loaded rifle onto the stage if no one is thinking of firing it.\" Sooner or later, that rifle is sure to go off. It might be an accident; it might be terrorism; it might be hate. But it will go off. Somewhere, as you read this, it's going off right now. I don't want to police my kids' imagination. And there is a whole strain of parenting literature that assures me that I don't have to. It says don't interfere with your kid's play, even if it includes guns and shooting and killing. Imagination is imagination and the violence isn't real. It might even, so this line of thinking goes, be a healthy way for them to process feelings of aggression. I get what they're saying, but it seems like a cop-out to me. To my mind, nonintervention is often a missed opportunity to be a parent. Sure, the violence isn't real. The pow-pows don't actually rip skin and tendon or stop hearts from beating, but the United States, which has been fighting distant wars nonstop for 15 years now, does have a violence problem and a man problem and a gun problem. We know where that problem ends, but it starts somewhere, too. One place to begin to look, at least, is at how our kids-particularly our boys-play, and how they are nurtured (or not), and taught to express their emotions (or not). It is, at least in part, up to us, their parents, to decide whether they are going to be the ones who help repair our society and reorient us (or not). And it begins with the kinds of care and love they receive, the kinds of conversations they are invited into, the kinds of expectations they are given about behavior and relationships. I don't want to raise Seamus, Madeline, or Rosena in the austere, ripped from the headlines of horror, polemical atmosphere that was the essence of my own childhood. But I don't want them to get comfortable with killing either. I want so much more for, and from, my little boy than \"Pow, pow, yous are dead now!\" And that starts with taking the gun or the stick or the rainbow flag out of his hands, sitting him down, and having a hard conversation about what guns actually do to people-and how much killing hurts us all.\n\nCan we be safe-any of us-in a nation awash in guns? The gun-and-ammo industry boasted $16 billion in revenue for 2015. Gun stores-from brick-and-mortar shops to online retailers-had $3.1 billion in revenue that same year. The industry as a whole claimed responsibility for nearly $50 billion in \"economic activity\" in 2015 alone. That represents a fair number of jobs, but here is the number that really goes boom: $229 billion. That's the annual cost of fatal and non-fatal gun violence in this country, according to Mother Jones and analyst Ted Miller of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, who teamed up to crunch the numbers. That figure includes both the direct costs of gun injuries and deaths-police investigations, emergency personnel, hospital bills, long-term care for the injured, funeral expenses for the dead, and the costs of prosecuting and imprisoning the perpetrators. As the report concludes: \"Even before accounting for the more intangible costs of the violence... the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America is nearly $400,000. And we pay for 32 of them every single day.\" We are awash in guns. Where does it end?

And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Seamus pointed his rainbow flag with the feather handle at his sisters and \"pow-powed\" them, calling out, \"Yous are dead now, guys. I shot yous.\" This article originally appeared at TomDispatch.com . To stay on top of important articles like these, sign up to receive the latest updates from TomDispatch.com. Madeline and Rosena laughed and just kept on running, with Seamus at their heels. I hid my face in my hands. It wasn't just that he was playing guns, but that he was using a Pride flag as his gun at a vigil to mourn those killed at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. My pacifist husband Patrick ran to redirect their activities, replacing the flag with a ball and glove and beginning a game of catch. Vigil organizers were taking turns reading the names of those killed into a microphone. \"... Juan Ramon Guerrero, 22 Eric Ivan Ortiz-Rivera, 36 Luis S. Vielma, 22...\" Those three men and 46 others were massacred on June 12. Another 50 people were wounded. Omar Mateen, who killed them, was armed with a Sig Sauer MCX assault rifle and a Glock 17 9mm semi-automatic pistol . He bought those two weapons legally in the days leading up to the attack. The carnage brought politicians and pundits out in force, using all the usual arguments for and against guns. Because the victims were mostly gay and mostly Latino, and because the attack was carried out by an American citizen with an ethnic last name who may have been enthralled by Islamic terrorism, or a closeted, self-hating homosexual (or both), the commentary quickly became muddled. Was it a hate crime, Islamic terrorism, or a strange double-bonus hit for the haters? Mateen was killed in a shootout with police and so can't speak to his motives. Investigators were left to sift through the material evidence and a dizzying compilation of online comments, Facebook likes, and recollections from old coworkers, family members, and possible lovers in their search for answers. The most essential facts are, however, not that complicated: Mateen had a license to carry a gun, training as a private security guard, and hatreds to act upon. He armed himself and he killed.

Montrell Jackson, 32 Matthew Gerald, 41 Brad Garafola, 45...\" And the killing continues. Using the Gun Violence Archive , I counted another 306 deaths by guns throughout the United States in the first eight days of July alone. Most of them weren't high-profile police shootings or mass tragedies, but in a small-scale and localized way, the grief and outrage of Baton Rouge, St. Paul, and Dallas were replicated in every corner of this country, including Ticfaw, Louisiana; Woodland, California; Tabernacle, New Jersey; and Harvey, Illinois. More than 300 deaths by gun in just eight days. \"Stabbin' My Bunny\": Teaching Kids About Guns and Violence And then, of course, there were my kids, my husband, and those \"guns.\" As a boy, Patrick wasn't allowed to play with toy guns. Instead, he, his parents, and their friends would go to the mall during the Christmas buying spree to put \" Stop War Toys \" stickers on Rambo and G.I. Joe action figures. When he went to his friends' houses, he had to tell them that war toys were verboten . LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS Email I grew up in a similar family of activists. We, too, were forbidden toy guns and other war toys. My brother and I were more likely to play games like \"protester at the Pentagon\" than cops and robbers. I've been thinking recently about why toy guns didn't have a grip on our imaginations as kids. I suspect it was because we understood-were made to understand-what the big gun of US militarism had done in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Indochina, and throughout Central America. Our dad had seen the big gun of war up close and personal. His finger-the same one he pointed at us when we were in trouble-had pulled the trigger again and again in France during World War II. He was decorated there, but had zero nostalgia for the experience. He was, in fact, deeply ashamed of the dashing figure he had once cut when home from the front. And so, Dad screwed up a new kind of courage to say no to war and violence, to killing of any kind. His knowledge of war imbued his nonviolent peace activist mission with a genuine, badass, superhero style swagger. Our parents-our community of ragtag, countercultural Catholic peace activists-made that no-violence, no-killing, no-matter-what point again and again. In fact, my early experience of guns was the chilling fear of knowing that, in protest , my father, mother, and their friends were walking into what they called \"free-fire zones\" on military bases, where well-armed, well-trained soldiers were licensed to kill intruders. So we didn't point toy guns at each other. We didn't pow-pow with our fingers or sticks. We crossed those fingers and hoped that the people we loved would be safe. Our inner city Baltimore neighborhood, where crack cocaine madness was just taking hold, drove that point home on a micro level. Our house was robbed at gunpoint more than once-and we had so little worth taking. We watched a man across the street bleed to death after being stabbed repeatedly in a fight over nothing. People from our house ran to help and were there for far too long before an ambulance even arrived. We knew as little kids that violence was no laughing matter, nor child's play. It was serious business and was to be resisted. As parents tend to do, Patrick and I are passing this tradition on to our kids, hopefully without the emotional scarring that went with our childhoods of resistance. They don't have guns or action figures or any other toy implements of death. Still, we've been watching Seamus, our Team Elsa (from the Disney blockbuster Frozen ) son, as he's recently begun turning every stick into an imaginary gun. This is, of course, happening just as, in the headlines of the moment, actual guns are turning so many previously real people into statistics. Under the circumstances, how could I not find myself thinking about toy guns, real guns, the nature of play, the role of imagination, the place of parents, and how to (or whether to) police (ha!) that imaginary play? When my stepdaughter Rosena was about four, she found a toy dagger at the playground, somehow smuggled it home, and was stabbing one of her beloved stuffed animals, a bunny, repeatedly with it. In the other room, I could hear the thumps on the bedroom floor and called out, \"What are you doing?\" \"Stabbin' my bunny. I kilt her,\" she responded matter-of-factly. Seizing a \"teaching moment\" and undoubtedly gripped by my own childhood experiences and memories of my parents, I blustered into the bedroom with a shoebox. \"Now, your bunny is dead,\" I announced in my version of over-the-top momism. \"You know what happens when living things die, right? It's forever, right? Now, we have to bury her.\" Rosena and I then \"buried\" the doll on a high shelf in her closet. I told her that we cannot hurt or kill the things (or people) we love. I told her that, because she had \"killed\" that bunny, she could never play with it again. About a week later, I slipped it back into her toy basket and, when she asked why, assured her that I thought she wouldn't hurt her toys like that again. She agreed. I recall that episode now with a certain embarrassment, but when I recently heard Rosena explaining death and loss to her little brother and sister, I thought: Oh, maybe the drama of the shoebox burial was actually helpful in some fashion. Toys matter. We've put a fair amount of thought into what might be called toy curation in our household. We've bought nothing new and little used. Mostly, we've accepted shipments of hand-me-downs from friends who just wanted \"this crap\" out of their houses. No guns came with them, thankfully. After all, even toy guns can mean death under the wrong circumstances. A year ago, I visited the Cuddell Recreation Center in Cleveland with my daughter Madeline and a group of friends. That broad stretch of ball fields and paths, anchored by a gazebo and a playground, was where 12-year-old Tamir Rice was fatally shot by Officer Timothy Loehmann in November 2014. Rice, an African American, was playing with an Airsoft pellet gun that a friend's dad had bought at Walmart . A replica of an actual Colt pistol, it shot plastic pellets and looked pretty real, since the orange tip signifying \"toy\" was missing. However, Officer Loehmann, investigating a report that a man was carrying a gun in the park, was moving too fast to notice much. He sped up and began shooting even before his squad car stopped moving. Rice's hands were still reportedly in his pockets. Though Loehmann was not indicted, the city of Cleveland paid a $6 million settlement to the Rice family and demolished the gazebo where the boy was shot. In the park that day, local activists described the shooting and its aftermath to our group. Half listening, I followed Madeline as she toddled into the playground. I tried to imagine Samaria Rice's pain in this unremarkable place made part shrine, part soapbox by a police officer's quick trigger finger, racism, and her son's blood. I thought about that toy gun in Tamir Rice's hand and what might have been going through his head as he pointed it and played with it. Despite the age difference, it couldn't have been that far from what regularly goes through my son's head when he picks up a stick and points it: pop, boom, wow! The difference, of course, is that Seamus, blond and freckled and unmistakably white, would run little risk of being shot down by a policeman, even eight years from now with a replica toy gun in his hands. Blasters, Blasters, Everywhere Toys are a big business in this country, raking in $19.4 billion in 2015, according to the retail tracking firm NPD Group . Our family is not responsible for even a dime of this. Not surprisingly, then, my announcement that we were all going to spend a rainy afternoon at a local Toys \"R\" Us store came like a bolt from the blue for the kids. I wanted to see what kind of toy weaponry was for sale there. I was curious, among other things, about whether the boys at school who had taught Seamus about superheroes, bad guys, and Star Wars had ignited in my son a love of weaponry; I was curious, that is, as to how he would react to the walls of guns I imagined Toys \"R\" Us displaying. We got into our car as if it were Christmas Eve, Seamus beside himself with excitement, Madeline on a contact high from her brother. I was experiencing my own contact high, taking my kids on their first research trip. What we found was not exactly what I expected-on many levels. Seamus was quickly overwhelmed by the glut of everything-lots of pictures of toys on boxes, but not a lot to pick up. (It was, in that sense, the very opposite of our visits to the Goodwill store, where you can sit on the floor and play with all those second-hand toys as long as you put them back afterwards.) Not so surprisingly, in retrospect, he went straight for what was familiar, what he could grab in his hand and actually look at: the books. It took some effort to wrestle him away from Five Stories About Princesses and enlist him in my quest for bad toys. (Madeline had, by then, fallen asleep.) I had finally found the Nerf \"blasters,\" but he wasn't interested. \"Let's not go down this aisle, okay, Mom?\" I was, of course, looking for the worst of the worst when it came to weaponry, but it proved remarkably hard to find. The aisle did, admittedly, have the Nerf Zombie Strike Doominator and the Nerf Modulus Recon MKII for $34.99 each. Those certainly sounded grim, given the eternal war against the undead, but the bright orange, cartoonish, completely unrealistic \"blasters\" on display and marketed to kids \"eight and up\" seemed distant indeed from American gun carnage (and our wars in distant lands), nor was there anything on the packaging that even hinted at real people getting shot in real encounters or real wars. I must admit that I don't like the idea of Seamus shooting anything at anyone-even a brain-hungry zombie-but as it turned out, I needn't have worried, not this time around anyway. Zombie-killing wasn't in his wheelhouse. Still, I kept looking for the real gun aisle, and I did come across more blasters, dart shooters, and the like, none with the word \"gun\" on them. Of course, we do live in Connecticut, less than 100 miles from Newtown where, in 2012, Adam Lanza, a devotee of violent video games who grew up in a gun-filled house , killed 20 kids just a little older than Seamus along with six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. So maybe our local toy outlet was being sensitive, but I doubt it. There was the Halo UNSC SMG Blaster (the initials make it sound extra tough but stand for nothing) for $19.99, and the NERF Star Wars Episode VII First Order Stormtrooper Deluxe Blaster , which fires 12 darts up to 65 feet without reloading, for $41.99. The worst thing I could find was the Xploderz Mayhem , with \"more distance, more ammo,\" which shoots easy-to-wash off mini-water pellets. It was on clearance for $18.89. By then, Seamus was pulling me frantically toward the aisle with the full Frozen franchise on display. Madeline was now awake and in heaven. So I left them there briefly and snuck off to do a last check for \"real\" toy guns. No such luck. I didn't find the kind of Airsoft gun Tamir Rice was playing with when he was killed. I didn't find an ersatz Sig Sauer either. It turns out that most brick-and-mortar toy stores don't seem to offer realistic-looking toy weaponry anymore, nor is there the toy store equivalent of the curtained-off area in the old neighborhood video rental shop where the porn was available. For such toys, you have to turn to an online world of websites like Kids-Army.com , where you can indeed buy realistic-looking toy rifles, shotguns, and pistols, or even to Amazon, where you can find an Airsoft version of the Sig Sauer rifle for $249.99. \"Start Them Young\" The National Rifle Association (NRA) would undoubtedly have been disappointed by my local Toys \"R\" Us outlet-just as its officials undoubtedly are by the way most big toy merchants seem to have left their more realistic guns for the online world. This happened, in part, in response to the sort of social pressure that my husband engaged in when in high school and-more critically-the almost routine horror of the blurred line between toy guns and real ones. You know we're a quirky, gun-crazy nation when Cleveland could ban toy guns and umbrellas with pointy tips from the area around the Republican Convention in the name of security, but couldn't keep out the real guns in open-carry Ohio. The NRA wants kids to play with realistic toy guns and BB guns, since they believe that such toys are part of a child's initiation into the future ownership of perfectly real guns. At the moment, the gun lobby is concerned that not enough people have guns-even though the 270 million to 310 million of them already amassed around this country (according to the Pew Research Center ) could arm just about every man, woman, transgendered person, and child around. Still, despite the fact that Americans can now carry guns in all 50 states and the NRA continues to win most of the big political fights, the number of households with guns is actually down from its peak in the late 1960s (though those that are armed have more and deadlier weapons than ever before). No wonder the gun industry and the gun lobby are fighting to produce an army of toddlers. \" Start Them Young ,\" a February 2016 report from the Violence Policy Center, details how gun manufacturers and the NRA are eager to market real guns to younger and younger consumers. The report starts with a selection of quotes from the industry, including this gem from Craig Cushman, marketing director for T h ompson/Center Arms , about their Hot Shot rifle for kids: \"[We're] talking about a tiny gun intended for the very youngest shooters-the ultimate first gun. We're targeting the six- to 12-year-old range.\" In other words, kids are literally in their sights. It's a strange world we live in. The toy industry has puffed up and candy-colored its play guns, turned up the volume on the violence online and in video games, and wrapped everything in plastic and safety warnings. At the same time, the gun industry is making its guns smaller and cuter for kids, while putting its energy into the all-important junior market. Can we be safe-any of us-in a nation awash in guns? The gun-and-ammo industry boasted $16 billion in revenue for 2015. Gun stores-from brick-and-mortar shops to online retailers-had $3.1 billion in revenue that same year. The industry as a whole claimed responsibility for nearly $50 billion in \"economic activity\" in 2015 alone. That represents a fair number of jobs, but here is the number that really goes boom: $229 billion. That's the annual cost of fatal and non-fatal gun violence in this country, according to Mother Jones and analyst Ted Miller of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, who teamed up to crunch the numbers. That figure includes both the direct costs of gun injuries and deaths-police investigations, emergency personnel, hospital bills, long-term care for the injured, funeral expenses for the dead, and the costs of prosecuting and imprisoning the perpetrators. As the report concludes: \"Even before accounting for the more intangible costs of the violence... the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America is nearly $400,000. And we pay for 32 of them every single day.\" We are awash in guns. Where does it end? Gun violence is embedded in our national mythology, our foreign policy, our notions of masculinity, our entertainment industry, and our children's play. We see violence solving problems on every screen-from the zombie apocalypse to the rise of ISIS. Russian playwright Anton Chekhov's maxim still applies: \"One should not put a loaded rifle onto the stage if no one is thinking of firing it.\" Sooner or later, that rifle is sure to go off. It might be an accident; it might be terrorism; it might be hate. But it will go off. Somewhere, as you read this, it's going off right now. I don't want to police my kids' imagination. And there is a whole strain of parenting literature that assures me that I don't have to. It says don't interfere with your kid's play, even if it includes guns and shooting and killing. Imagination is imagination and the violence isn't real. It might even, so this line of thinking goes, be a healthy way for them to process feelings of aggression. I get what they're saying, but it seems like a cop-out to me. To my mind, nonintervention is often a missed opportunity to be a parent. Sure, the violence isn't real. The pow-pows don't actually rip skin and tendon or stop hearts from beating, but the United States, which has been fighting distant wars nonstop for 15 years now, does have a violence problem and a man problem and a gun problem. We know where that problem ends, but it starts somewhere, too. One place to begin to look, at least, is at how our kids-particularly our boys-play, and how they are nurtured (or not), and taught to express their emotions (or not). It is, at least in part, up to us, their parents, to decide whether they are going to be the ones who help repair our society and reorient us (or not). And it begins with the kinds of care and love they receive, the kinds of conversations they are invited into, the kinds of expectations they are given about behavior and relationships. I don't want to raise Seamus, Madeline, or Rosena in the austere, ripped from the headlines of horror, polemical atmosphere that was the essence of my own childhood. But I don't want them to get comfortable with killing either. I want so much more for, and from, my little boy than \"Pow, pow, yous are dead now!\" And that starts with taking the gun or the stick or the rainbow flag out of his hands, sitting him down, and having a hard conversation about what guns actually do to people-and how much killing hurts us all.\n\nThis article originally appeared at TomDispatch.com .

I hid my face in my hands. It wasn't just that he was playing guns, but that he was using a Pride flag as his gun at a vigil to mourn those killed at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. My pacifist husband Patrick ran to redirect their activities, replacing the flag with a ball and glove and beginning a game of catch. Vigil organizers were taking turns reading the names of those killed into a microphone. \"... Juan Ramon Guerrero, 22 Eric Ivan Ortiz-Rivera, 36 Luis S. Vielma, 22...\" Those three men and 46 others were massacred on June 12. Another 50 people were wounded. Omar Mateen, who killed them, was armed with a Sig Sauer MCX assault rifle and a Glock 17 9mm semi-automatic pistol . He bought those two weapons legally in the days leading up to the attack. The carnage brought politicians and pundits out in force, using all the usual arguments for and against guns. Because the victims were mostly gay and mostly Latino, and because the attack was carried out by an American citizen with an ethnic last name who may have been enthralled by Islamic terrorism, or a closeted, self-hating homosexual (or both), the commentary quickly became muddled. Was it a hate crime, Islamic terrorism, or a strange double-bonus hit for the haters? Mateen was killed in a shootout with police and so can't speak to his motives. Investigators were left to sift through the material evidence and a dizzying compilation of online comments, Facebook likes, and recollections from old coworkers, family members, and possible lovers in their search for answers. The most essential facts are, however, not that complicated: Mateen had a license to carry a gun, training as a private security guard, and hatreds to act upon. He armed himself and he killed.

Montrell Jackson, 32 Matthew Gerald, 41 Brad Garafola, 45...\" And the killing continues. Using the Gun Violence Archive , I counted another 306 deaths by guns throughout the United States in the first eight days of July alone. Most of them weren't high-profile police shootings or mass tragedies, but in a small-scale and localized way, the grief and outrage of Baton Rouge, St. Paul, and Dallas were replicated in every corner of this country, including Ticfaw, Louisiana; Woodland, California; Tabernacle, New Jersey; and Harvey, Illinois. More than 300 deaths by gun in just eight days. \"Stabbin' My Bunny\": Teaching Kids About Guns and Violence And then, of course, there were my kids, my husband, and those \"guns.\" As a boy, Patrick wasn't allowed to play with toy guns. Instead, he, his parents, and their friends would go to the mall during the Christmas buying spree to put \" Stop War Toys \" stickers on Rambo and G.I. Joe action figures. When he went to his friends' houses, he had to tell them that war toys were verboten . LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS Email I grew up in a similar family of activists. We, too, were forbidden toy guns and other war toys. My brother and I were more likely to play games like \"protester at the Pentagon\" than cops and robbers. I've been thinking recently about why toy guns didn't have a grip on our imaginations as kids. I suspect it was because we understood-were made to understand-what the big gun of US militarism had done in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Indochina, and throughout Central America. Our dad had seen the big gun of war up close and personal. His finger-the same one he pointed at us when we were in trouble-had pulled the trigger again and again in France during World War II. He was decorated there, but had zero nostalgia for the experience. He was, in fact, deeply ashamed of the dashing figure he had once cut when home from the front. And so, Dad screwed up a new kind of courage to say no to war and violence, to killing of any kind. His knowledge of war imbued his nonviolent peace activist mission with a genuine, badass, superhero style swagger. Our parents-our community of ragtag, countercultural Catholic peace activists-made that no-violence, no-killing, no-matter-what point again and again. In fact, my early experience of guns was the chilling fear of knowing that, in protest , my father, mother, and their friends were walking into what they called \"free-fire zones\" on military bases, where well-armed, well-trained soldiers were licensed to kill intruders. So we didn't point toy guns at each other. We didn't pow-pow with our fingers or sticks. We crossed those fingers and hoped that the people we loved would be safe. Our inner city Baltimore neighborhood, where crack cocaine madness was just taking hold, drove that point home on a micro level. Our house was robbed at gunpoint more than once-and we had so little worth taking. We watched a man across the street bleed to death after being stabbed repeatedly in a fight over nothing. People from our house ran to help and were there for far too long before an ambulance even arrived. We knew as little kids that violence was no laughing matter, nor child's play. It was serious business and was to be resisted. As parents tend to do, Patrick and I are passing this tradition on to our kids, hopefully without the emotional scarring that went with our childhoods of resistance. They don't have guns or action figures or any other toy implements of death. Still, we've been watching Seamus, our Team Elsa (from the Disney blockbuster Frozen ) son, as he's recently begun turning every stick into an imaginary gun. This is, of course, happening just as, in the headlines of the moment, actual guns are turning so many previously real people into statistics. Under the circumstances, how could I not find myself thinking about toy guns, real guns, the nature of play, the role of imagination, the place of parents, and how to (or whether to) police (ha!) that imaginary play? When my stepdaughter Rosena was about four, she found a toy dagger at the playground, somehow smuggled it home, and was stabbing one of her beloved stuffed animals, a bunny, repeatedly with it. In the other room, I could hear the thumps on the bedroom floor and called out, \"What are you doing?\" \"Stabbin' my bunny. I kilt her,\" she responded matter-of-factly. Seizing a \"teaching moment\" and undoubtedly gripped by my own childhood experiences and memories of my parents, I blustered into the bedroom with a shoebox. \"Now, your bunny is dead,\" I announced in my version of over-the-top momism. \"You know what happens when living things die, right? It's forever, right? Now, we have to bury her.\" Rosena and I then \"buried\" the doll on a high shelf in her closet. I told her that we cannot hurt or kill the things (or people) we love. I told her that, because she had \"killed\" that bunny, she could never play with it again. About a week later, I slipped it back into her toy basket and, when she asked why, assured her that I thought she wouldn't hurt her toys like that again. She agreed. I recall that episode now with a certain embarrassment, but when I recently heard Rosena explaining death and loss to her little brother and sister, I thought: Oh, maybe the drama of the shoebox burial was actually helpful in some fashion. Toys matter. We've put a fair amount of thought into what might be called toy curation in our household. We've bought nothing new and little used. Mostly, we've accepted shipments of hand-me-downs from friends who just wanted \"this crap\" out of their houses. No guns came with them, thankfully. After all, even toy guns can mean death under the wrong circumstances. A year ago, I visited the Cuddell Recreation Center in Cleveland with my daughter Madeline and a group of friends. That broad stretch of ball fields and paths, anchored by a gazebo and a playground, was where 12-year-old Tamir Rice was fatally shot by Officer Timothy Loehmann in November 2014. Rice, an African American, was playing with an Airsoft pellet gun that a friend's dad had bought at Walmart . A replica of an actual Colt pistol, it shot plastic pellets and looked pretty real, since the orange tip signifying \"toy\" was missing. However, Officer Loehmann, investigating a report that a man was carrying a gun in the park, was moving too fast to notice much. He sped up and began shooting even before his squad car stopped moving. Rice's hands were still reportedly in his pockets. Though Loehmann was not indicted, the city of Cleveland paid a $6 million settlement to the Rice family and demolished the gazebo where the boy was shot. In the park that day, local activists described the shooting and its aftermath to our group. Half listening, I followed Madeline as she toddled into the playground. I tried to imagine Samaria Rice's pain in this unremarkable place made part shrine, part soapbox by a police officer's quick trigger finger, racism, and her son's blood. I thought about that toy gun in Tamir Rice's hand and what might have been going through his head as he pointed it and played with it. Despite the age difference, it couldn't have been that far from what regularly goes through my son's head when he picks up a stick and points it: pop, boom, wow! The difference, of course, is that Seamus, blond and freckled and unmistakably white, would run little risk of being shot down by a policeman, even eight years from now with a replica toy gun in his hands. Blasters, Blasters, Everywhere Toys are a big business in this country, raking in $19.4 billion in 2015, according to the retail tracking firm NPD Group . Our family is not responsible for even a dime of this. Not surprisingly, then, my announcement that we were all going to spend a rainy afternoon at a local Toys \"R\" Us store came like a bolt from the blue for the kids. I wanted to see what kind of toy weaponry was for sale there. I was curious, among other things, about whether the boys at school who had taught Seamus about superheroes, bad guys, and Star Wars had ignited in my son a love of weaponry; I was curious, that is, as to how he would react to the walls of guns I imagined Toys \"R\" Us displaying. We got into our car as if it were Christmas Eve, Seamus beside himself with excitement, Madeline on a contact high from her brother. I was experiencing my own contact high, taking my kids on their first research trip. What we found was not exactly what I expected-on many levels. Seamus was quickly overwhelmed by the glut of everything-lots of pictures of toys on boxes, but not a lot to pick up. (It was, in that sense, the very opposite of our visits to the Goodwill store, where you can sit on the floor and play with all those second-hand toys as long as you put them back afterwards.) Not so surprisingly, in retrospect, he went straight for what was familiar, what he could grab in his hand and actually look at: the books. It took some effort to wrestle him away from Five Stories About Princesses and enlist him in my quest for bad toys. (Madeline had, by then, fallen asleep.) I had finally found the Nerf \"blasters,\" but he wasn't interested. \"Let's not go down this aisle, okay, Mom?\" I was, of course, looking for the worst of the worst when it came to weaponry, but it proved remarkably hard to find. The aisle did, admittedly, have the Nerf Zombie Strike Doominator and the Nerf Modulus Recon MKII for $34.99 each. Those certainly sounded grim, given the eternal war against the undead, but the bright orange, cartoonish, completely unrealistic \"blasters\" on display and marketed to kids \"eight and up\" seemed distant indeed from American gun carnage (and our wars in distant lands), nor was there anything on the packaging that even hinted at real people getting shot in real encounters or real wars. I must admit that I don't like the idea of Seamus shooting anything at anyone-even a brain-hungry zombie-but as it turned out, I needn't have worried, not this time around anyway. Zombie-killing wasn't in his wheelhouse. Still, I kept looking for the real gun aisle, and I did come across more blasters, dart shooters, and the like, none with the word \"gun\" on them. Of course, we do live in Connecticut, less than 100 miles from Newtown where, in 2012, Adam Lanza, a devotee of violent video games who grew up in a gun-filled house , killed 20 kids just a little older than Seamus along with six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. So maybe our local toy outlet was being sensitive, but I doubt it. There was the Halo UNSC SMG Blaster (the initials make it sound extra tough but stand for nothing) for $19.99, and the NERF Star Wars Episode VII First Order Stormtrooper Deluxe Blaster , which fires 12 darts up to 65 feet without reloading, for $41.99. The worst thing I could find was the Xploderz Mayhem , with \"more distance, more ammo,\" which shoots easy-to-wash off mini-water pellets. It was on clearance for $18.89. By then, Seamus was pulling me frantically toward the aisle with the full Frozen franchise on display. Madeline was now awake and in heaven. So I left them there briefly and snuck off to do a last check for \"real\" toy guns. No such luck. I didn't find the kind of Airsoft gun Tamir Rice was playing with when he was killed. I didn't find an ersatz Sig Sauer either. It turns out that most brick-and-mortar toy stores don't seem to offer realistic-looking toy weaponry anymore, nor is there the toy store equivalent of the curtained-off area in the old neighborhood video rental shop where the porn was available. For such toys, you have to turn to an online world of websites like Kids-Army.com , where you can indeed buy realistic-looking toy rifles, shotguns, and pistols, or even to Amazon, where you can find an Airsoft version of the Sig Sauer rifle for $249.99. \"Start Them Young\" The National Rifle Association (NRA) would undoubtedly have been disappointed by my local Toys \"R\" Us outlet-just as its officials undoubtedly are by the way most big toy merchants seem to have left their more realistic guns for the online world. This happened, in part, in response to the sort of social pressure that my husband engaged in when in high school and-more critically-the almost routine horror of the blurred line between toy guns and real ones. You know we're a quirky, gun-crazy nation when Cleveland could ban toy guns and umbrellas with pointy tips from the area around the Republican Convention in the name of security, but couldn't keep out the real guns in open-carry Ohio. The NRA wants kids to play with realistic toy guns and BB guns, since they believe that such toys are part of a child's initiation into the future ownership of perfectly real guns. At the moment, the gun lobby is concerned that not enough people have guns-even though the 270 million to 310 million of them already amassed around this country (according to the Pew Research Center ) could arm just about every man, woman, transgendered person, and child around. Still, despite the fact that Americans can now carry guns in all 50 states and the NRA continues to win most of the big political fights, the number of households with guns is actually down from its peak in the late 1960s (though those that are armed have more and deadlier weapons than ever before). No wonder the gun industry and the gun lobby are fighting to produce an army of toddlers. \" Start Them Young ,\" a February 2016 report from the Violence Policy Center, details how gun manufacturers and the NRA are eager to market real guns to younger and younger consumers. The report starts with a selection of quotes from the industry, including this gem from Craig Cushman, marketing director for T h ompson/Center Arms , about their Hot Shot rifle for kids: \"[We're] talking about a tiny gun intended for the very youngest shooters-the ultimate first gun.

After all, even toy guns can mean death under the wrong circumstances. A year ago, I visited the Cuddell Recreation Center in Cleveland with my daughter Madeline and a group of friends. That broad stretch of ball fields and paths, anchored by a gazebo and a playground, was where 12-year-old Tamir Rice was fatally shot by Officer Timothy Loehmann in November 2014. Rice, an African American, was playing with an Airsoft pellet gun that a friend's dad had bought at Walmart . A replica of an actual Colt pistol, it shot plastic pellets and looked pretty real, since the orange tip signifying \"toy\" was missing. However, Officer Loehmann, investigating a report that a man was carrying a gun in the park, was moving too fast to notice much. He sped up and began shooting even before his squad car stopped moving. Rice's hands were still reportedly in his pockets. Though Loehmann was not indicted, the city of Cleveland paid a $6 million settlement to the Rice family and demolished the gazebo where the boy was shot. In the park that day, local activists described the shooting and its aftermath to our group. Half listening, I followed Madeline as she toddled into the playground. I tried to imagine Samaria Rice's pain in this unremarkable place made part shrine, part soapbox by a police officer's quick trigger finger, racism, and her son's blood. I thought about that toy gun in Tamir Rice's hand and what might have been going through his head as he pointed it and played with it. Despite the age difference, it couldn't have been that far from what regularly goes through my son's head when he picks up a stick and points it: pop, boom, wow! The difference, of course, is that Seamus, blond and freckled and unmistakably white, would run little risk of being shot down by a policeman, even eight years from now with a replica toy gun in his hands. Blasters, Blasters, Everywhere Toys are a big business in this country, raking in $19.4 billion in 2015, according to the retail tracking firm NPD Group . Our family is not responsible for even a dime of this. Not surprisingly, then, my announcement that we were all going to spend a rainy afternoon at a local Toys \"R\" Us store came like a bolt from the blue for the kids. I wanted to see what kind of toy weaponry was for sale there. I was curious, among other things, about whether the boys at school who had taught Seamus about superheroes, bad guys, and Star Wars had ignited in my son a love of weaponry; I was curious, that is, as to how he would react to the walls of guns I imagined Toys \"R\" Us displaying. We got into our car as if it were Christmas Eve, Seamus beside himself with excitement, Madeline on a contact high from her brother. I was experiencing my own contact high, taking my kids on their first research trip. What we found was not exactly what I expected-on many levels. Seamus was quickly overwhelmed by the glut of everything-lots of pictures of toys on boxes, but not a lot to pick up. (It was, in that sense, the very opposite of our visits to the Goodwill store, where you can sit on the floor and play with all those second-hand toys as long as you put them back afterwards.) Not so surprisingly, in retrospect, he went straight for what was familiar, what he could grab in his hand and actually look at: the books. It took some effort to wrestle him away from Five Stories About Princesses and enlist him in my quest for bad toys. (Madeline had, by then, fallen asleep.) I had finally found the Nerf \"blasters,\" but he wasn't interested. \"Let's not go down this aisle, okay, Mom?\" I was, of course, looking for the worst of the worst when it came to weaponry, but it proved remarkably hard to find. The aisle did, admittedly, have the Nerf Zombie Strike Doominator and the Nerf Modulus Recon MKII for $34.99 each. Those certainly sounded grim, given the eternal war against the undead, but the bright orange, cartoonish, completely unrealistic \"blasters\" on display and marketed to kids \"eight and up\" seemed distant indeed from American gun carnage (and our wars in distant lands), nor was there anything on the packaging that even hinted at real people getting shot in real encounters or real wars. I must admit that I don't like the idea of Seamus shooting anything at anyone-even a brain-hungry zombie-but as it turned out, I needn't have worried, not this time around anyway. Zombie-killing wasn't in his wheelhouse. Still, I kept looking for the real gun aisle, and I did come across more blasters, dart shooters, and the like, none with the word \"gun\" on them. Of course, we do live in Connecticut, less than 100 miles from Newtown where, in 2012, Adam Lanza, a devotee of violent video games who grew up in a gun-filled house , killed 20 kids just a little older than Seamus along with six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. So maybe our local toy outlet was being sensitive, but I doubt it. There was the Halo UNSC SMG Blaster (the initials make it sound extra tough but stand for nothing) for $19.99, and the NERF Star Wars Episode VII First Order Stormtrooper Deluxe Blaster , which fires 12 darts up to 65 feet without reloading, for $41.99. The worst thing I could find was the Xploderz Mayhem , with \"more distance, more ammo,\" which shoots easy-to-wash off mini-water pellets. It was on clearance for $18.89. By then, Seamus was pulling me frantically toward the aisle with the full Frozen franchise on display. Madeline was now awake and in heaven. So I left them there briefly and snuck off to do a last check for \"real\" toy guns. No such luck. I didn't find the kind of Airsoft gun Tamir Rice was playing with when he was killed. I didn't find an ersatz Sig Sauer either. It turns out that most brick-and-mortar toy stores don't seem to offer realistic-looking toy weaponry anymore, nor is there the toy store equivalent of the curtained-off area in the old neighborhood video rental shop where the porn was available. For such toys, you have to turn to an online world of websites like Kids-Army.com , where you can indeed buy realistic-looking toy rifles, shotguns, and pistols, or even to Amazon, where you can find an Airsoft version of the Sig Sauer rifle for $249.99. \"Start Them Young\" The National Rifle Association (NRA) would undoubtedly have been disappointed by my local Toys \"R\" Us outlet-just as its officials undoubtedly are by the way most big toy merchants seem to have left their more realistic guns for the online world. This happened, in part, in response to the sort of social pressure that my husband engaged in when in high school and-more critically-the almost routine horror of the blurred line between toy guns and real ones. You know we're a quirky, gun-crazy nation when Cleveland could ban toy guns and umbrellas with pointy tips from the area around the Republican Convention in the name of security, but couldn't keep out the real guns in open-carry Ohio. The NRA wants kids to play with realistic toy guns and BB guns, since they believe that such toys are part of a child's initiation into the future ownership of perfectly real guns. At the moment, the gun lobby is concerned that not enough people have guns-even though the 270 million to 310 million of them already amassed around this country (according to the Pew Research Center ) could arm just about every man, woman, transgendered person, and child around. Still, despite the fact that Americans can now carry guns in all 50 states and the NRA continues to win most of the big political fights, the number of households with guns is actually down from its peak in the late 1960s (though those that are armed have more and deadlier weapons than ever before). No wonder the gun industry and the gun lobby are fighting to produce an army of toddlers. \" Start Them Young ,\" a February 2016 report from the Violence Policy Center, details how gun manufacturers and the NRA are eager to market real guns to younger and younger consumers. The report starts with a selection of quotes from the industry, including this gem from Craig Cushman, marketing director for T h ompson/Center Arms , about their Hot Shot rifle for kids: \"[We're] talking about a tiny gun intended for the very youngest shooters-the ultimate first gun. We're targeting the six- to 12-year-old range.\" In other words, kids are literally in their sights. It's a strange world we live in. The toy industry has puffed up and candy-colored its play guns, turned up the volume on the violence online and in video games, and wrapped everything in plastic and safety warnings. At the same time, the gun industry is making its guns smaller and cuter for kids, while putting its energy into the all-important junior market. Can we be safe-any of us-in a nation awash in guns? The gun-and-ammo industry boasted $16 billion in revenue for 2015. Gun stores-from brick-and-mortar shops to online retailers-had $3.1 billion in revenue that same year. The industry as a whole claimed responsibility for nearly $50 billion in \"economic activity\" in 2015 alone. That represents a fair number of jobs, but here is the number that really goes boom: $229 billion. That's the annual cost of fatal and non-fatal gun violence in this country, according to Mother Jones and analyst Ted Miller of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, who teamed up to crunch the numbers. That figure includes both the direct costs of gun injuries and deaths-police investigations, emergency personnel, hospital bills, long-term care for the injured, funeral expenses for the dead, and the costs of prosecuting and imprisoning the perpetrators. As the report concludes: \"Even before accounting for the more intangible costs of the violence... the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America is nearly $400,000. And we pay for 32 of them every single day.\" We are awash in guns. Where does it end? Gun violence is embedded in our national mythology, our foreign policy, our notions of masculinity, our entertainment industry, and our children's play. We see violence solving problems on every screen-from the zombie apocalypse to the rise of ISIS. Russian playwright Anton Chekhov's maxim still applies: \"One should not put a loaded rifle onto the stage if no one is thinking of firing it.\" Sooner or later, that rifle is sure to go off. It might be an accident; it might be terrorism; it might be hate. But it will go off. Somewhere, as you read this, it's going off right now. I don't want to police my kids' imagination. And there is a whole strain of parenting literature that assures me that I don't have to. It says don't interfere with your kid's play, even if it includes guns and shooting and killing. Imagination is imagination and the violence isn't real. It might even, so this line of thinking goes, be a healthy way for them to process feelings of aggression. I get what they're saying, but it seems like a cop-out to me. To my mind, nonintervention is often a missed opportunity to be a parent. Sure, the violence isn't real. The pow-pows don't actually rip skin and tendon or stop hearts from beating, but the United States, which has been fighting distant wars nonstop for 15 years now, does have a violence problem and a man problem and a gun problem. We know where that problem ends, but it starts somewhere, too. One place to begin to look, at least, is at how our kids-particularly our boys-play, and how they are nurtured (or not), and taught to express their emotions (or not). It is, at least in part, up to us, their parents, to decide whether they are going to be the ones who help repair our society and reorient us (or not). And it begins with the kinds of care and love they receive, the kinds of conversations they are invited into, the kinds of expectations they are given about behavior and relationships. I don't want to raise Seamus, Madeline, or Rosena in the austere, ripped from the headlines of horror, polemical atmosphere that was the essence of my own childhood. But I don't want them to get comfortable with killing either. I want so much more for, and from, my little boy than \"Pow, pow, yous are dead now!\" And that starts with taking the gun or the stick or the rainbow flag out of his hands, sitting him down, and having a hard conversation about what guns actually do to people-and how much killing hurts us all.\n\nThose three men and 46 others were massacred on June 12. Another 50 people were wounded. Omar Mateen, who killed them, was armed with a Sig Sauer MCX assault rifle and a Glock 17 9mm semi-automatic pistol . He bought those two weapons legally in the days leading up to the attack. The carnage brought politicians and pundits out in force, using all the usual arguments for and against guns. Because the victims were mostly gay and mostly Latino, and because the attack was carried out by an American citizen with an ethnic last name who may have been enthralled by Islamic terrorism, or a closeted, self-hating homosexual (or both), the commentary quickly became muddled. Was it a hate crime, Islamic terrorism, or a strange double-bonus hit for the haters? Mateen was killed in a shootout with police and so can't speak to his motives. Investigators were left to sift through the material evidence and a dizzying compilation of online comments, Facebook likes, and recollections from old coworkers, family members, and possible lovers in their search for answers. The most essential facts are, however, not that complicated: Mateen had a license to carry a gun, training as a private security guard, and hatreds to act upon. He armed himself and he killed.

Montrell Jackson, 32 Matthew Gerald, 41 Brad Garafola, 45...\" And the killing continues. Using the Gun Violence Archive , I counted another 306 deaths by guns throughout the United States in the first eight days of July alone. Most of them weren't high-profile police shootings or mass tragedies, but in a small-scale and localized way, the grief and outrage of Baton Rouge, St. Paul, and Dallas were replicated in every corner of this country, including Ticfaw, Louisiana; Woodland, California; Tabernacle, New Jersey; and Harvey, Illinois. More than 300 deaths by gun in just eight days. \"Stabbin' My Bunny\": Teaching Kids About Guns and Violence And then, of course, there were my kids, my husband, and those \"guns.\" As a boy, Patrick wasn't allowed to play with toy guns. Instead, he, his parents, and their friends would go to the mall during the Christmas buying spree to put \" Stop War Toys \" stickers on Rambo and G.I. Joe action figures. When he went to his friends' houses, he had to tell them that war toys were verboten . LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS Email I grew up in a similar family of activists. We, too, were forbidden toy guns and other war toys. My brother and I were more likely to play games like \"protester at the Pentagon\" than cops and robbers. I've been thinking recently about why toy guns didn't have a grip on our imaginations as kids. I suspect it was because we understood-were made to understand-what the big gun of US militarism had done in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Indochina, and throughout Central America. Our dad had seen the big gun of war up close and personal. His finger-the same one he pointed at us when we were in trouble-had pulled the trigger again and again in France during World War II. He was decorated there, but had zero nostalgia for the experience. He was, in fact, deeply ashamed of the dashing figure he had once cut when home from the front. And so, Dad screwed up a new kind of courage to say no to war and violence, to killing of any kind. His knowledge of war imbued his nonviolent peace activist mission with a genuine, badass, superhero style swagger. Our parents-our community of ragtag, countercultural Catholic peace activists-made that no-violence, no-killing, no-matter-what point again and again. In fact, my early experience of guns was the chilling fear of knowing that, in protest , my father, mother, and their friends were walking into what they called \"free-fire zones\" on military bases, where well-armed, well-trained soldiers were licensed to kill intruders. So we didn't point toy guns at each other. We didn't pow-pow with our fingers or sticks. We crossed those fingers and hoped that the people we loved would be safe. Our inner city Baltimore neighborhood, where crack cocaine madness was just taking hold, drove that point home on a micro level. Our house was robbed at gunpoint more than once-and we had so little worth taking. We watched a man across the street bleed to death after being stabbed repeatedly in a fight over nothing. People from our house ran to help and were there for far too long before an ambulance even arrived. We knew as little kids that violence was no laughing matter, nor child's play. It was serious business and was to be resisted. As parents tend to do, Patrick and I are passing this tradition on to our kids, hopefully without the emotional scarring that went with our childhoods of resistance. They don't have guns or action figures or any other toy implements of death. Still, we've been watching Seamus, our Team Elsa (from the Disney blockbuster Frozen ) son, as he's recently begun turning every stick into an imaginary gun. This is, of course, happening just as, in the headlines of the moment, actual guns are turning so many previously real people into statistics. Under the circumstances, how could I not find myself thinking about toy guns, real guns, the nature of play, the role of imagination, the place of parents, and how to (or whether to) police (ha!) that imaginary play? When my stepdaughter Rosena was about four, she found a toy dagger at the playground, somehow smuggled it home, and was stabbing one of her beloved stuffed animals, a bunny, repeatedly with it. In the other room, I could hear the thumps on the bedroom floor and called out, \"What are you doing?\" \"Stabbin' my bunny. I kilt her,\" she responded matter-of-factly. Seizing a \"teaching moment\" and undoubtedly gripped by my own childhood experiences and memories of my parents, I blustered into the bedroom with a shoebox. \"Now, your bunny is dead,\" I announced in my version of over-the-top momism. \"You know what happens when living things die, right? It's forever, right? Now, we have to bury her.\" Rosena and I then \"buried\" the doll on a high shelf in her closet. I told her that we cannot hurt or kill the things (or people) we love. I told her that, because she had \"killed\" that bunny, she could never play with it again. About a week later, I slipped it back into her toy basket and, when she asked why, assured her that I thought she wouldn't hurt her toys like that again. She agreed. I recall that episode now with a certain embarrassment, but when I recently heard Rosena explaining death and loss to her little brother and sister, I thought: Oh, maybe the drama of the shoebox burial was actually helpful in some fashion. Toys matter. We've put a fair amount of thought into what might be called toy curation in our household. We've bought nothing new and little used. Mostly, we've accepted shipments of hand-me-downs from friends who just wanted \"this crap\" out of their houses. No guns came with them, thankfully.

Using the Gun Violence Archive , I counted another 306 deaths by guns throughout the United States in the first eight days of July alone. Most of them weren't high-profile police shootings or mass tragedies, but in a small-scale and localized way, the grief and outrage of Baton Rouge, St. Paul, and Dallas were replicated in every corner of this country, including Ticfaw, Louisiana; Woodland, California; Tabernacle, New Jersey; and Harvey, Illinois. More than 300 deaths by gun in just eight days. \"Stabbin' My Bunny\": Teaching Kids About Guns and Violence And then, of course, there were my kids, my husband, and those \"guns.\" As a boy, Patrick wasn't allowed to play with toy guns. Instead, he, his parents, and their friends would go to the mall during the Christmas buying spree to put \" Stop War Toys \" stickers on Rambo and G.I. Joe action figures. When he went to his friends' houses, he had to tell them that war toys were verboten . LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS Email I grew up in a similar family of activists. We, too, were forbidden toy guns and other war toys. My brother and I were more likely to play games like \"protester at the Pentagon\" than cops and robbers. I've been thinking recently about why toy guns didn't have a grip on our imaginations as kids. I suspect it was because we understood-were made to understand-what the big gun of US militarism had done in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Indochina, and throughout Central America. Our dad had seen the big gun of war up close and personal. His finger-the same one he pointed at us when we were in trouble-had pulled the trigger again and again in France during World War II. He was decorated there, but had zero nostalgia for the experience. He was, in fact, deeply ashamed of the dashing figure he had once cut when home from the front. And so, Dad screwed up a new kind of courage to say no to war and violence, to killing of any kind. His knowledge of war imbued his nonviolent peace activist mission with a genuine, badass, superhero style swagger. Our parents-our community of ragtag, countercultural Catholic peace activists-made that no-violence, no-killing, no-matter-what point again and again. In fact, my early experience of guns was the chilling fear of knowing that, in protest , my father, mother, and their friends were walking into what they called \"free-fire zones\" on military bases, where well-armed, well-trained soldiers were licensed to kill intruders. So we didn't point toy guns at each other. We didn't pow-pow with our fingers or sticks. We crossed those fingers and hoped that the people we loved would be safe. Our inner city Baltimore neighborhood, where crack cocaine madness was just taking hold, drove that point home on a micro level. Our house was robbed at gunpoint more than once-and we had so little worth taking. We watched a man across the street bleed to death after being stabbed repeatedly in a fight over nothing. People from our house ran to help and were there for far too long before an ambulance even arrived. We knew as little kids that violence was no laughing matter, nor child's play. It was serious business and was to be resisted. As parents tend to do, Patrick and I are passing this tradition on to our kids, hopefully without the emotional scarring that went with our childhoods of resistance. They don't have guns or action figures or any other toy implements of death. Still, we've been watching Seamus, our Team Elsa (from the Disney blockbuster Frozen ) son, as he's recently begun turning every stick into an imaginary gun. This is, of course, happening just as, in the headlines of the moment, actual guns are turning so many previously real people into statistics. Under the circumstances, how could I not find myself thinking about toy guns, real guns, the nature of play, the role of imagination, the place of parents, and how to (or whether to) police (ha!) that imaginary play? When my stepdaughter Rosena was about four, she found a toy dagger at the playground, somehow smuggled it home, and was stabbing one of her beloved stuffed animals, a bunny, repeatedly with it. In the other room, I could hear the thumps on the bedroom floor and called out, \"What are you doing?\" \"Stabbin' my bunny. I kilt her,\" she responded matter-of-factly. Seizing a \"teaching moment\" and undoubtedly gripped by my own childhood experiences and memories of my parents, I blustered into the bedroom with a shoebox. \"Now, your bunny is dead,\" I announced in my version of over-the-top momism. \"You know what happens when living things die, right? It's forever, right? Now, we have to bury her.\" Rosena and I then \"buried\" the doll on a high shelf in her closet. I told her that we cannot hurt or kill the things (or people) we love. I told her that, because she had \"killed\" that bunny, she could never play with it again. About a week later, I slipped it back into her toy basket and, when she asked why, assured her that I thought she wouldn't hurt her toys like that again. She agreed. I recall that episode now with a certain embarrassment, but when I recently heard Rosena explaining death and loss to her little brother and sister, I thought: Oh, maybe the drama of the shoebox burial was actually helpful in some fashion. Toys matter. We've put a fair amount of thought into what might be called toy curation in our household. We've bought nothing new and little used. Mostly, we've accepted shipments of hand-me-downs from friends who just wanted \"this crap\" out of their houses. No guns came with them, thankfully. After all, even toy guns can mean death under the wrong circumstances. A year ago, I visited the Cuddell Recreation Center in Cleveland with my daughter Madeline and a group of friends. That broad stretch of ball fields and paths, anchored by a gazebo and a playground, was where 12-year-old Tamir Rice was fatally shot by Officer Timothy Loehmann in November 2014. Rice, an African American, was playing with an Airsoft pellet gun that a friend's dad had bought at Walmart . A replica of an actual Colt pistol, it shot plastic pellets and looked pretty real, since the orange tip signifying \"toy\" was missing. However, Officer Loehmann, investigating a report that a man was carrying a gun in the park, was moving too fast to notice much. He sped up and began shooting even before his squad car stopped moving. Rice's hands were still reportedly in his pockets. Though Loehmann was not indicted, the city of Cleveland paid a $6 million settlement to the Rice family and demolished the gazebo where the boy was shot. In the park that day, local activists described the shooting and its aftermath to our group. Half listening, I followed Madeline as she toddled into the playground. I tried to imagine Samaria Rice's pain in this unremarkable place made part shrine, part soapbox by a police officer's quick trigger finger, racism, and her son's blood. I thought about that toy gun in Tamir Rice's hand and what might have been going through his head as he pointed it and played with it. Despite the age difference, it couldn't have been that far from what regularly goes through my son's head when he picks up a stick and points it: pop, boom, wow! The difference, of course, is that Seamus, blond and freckled and unmistakably white, would run little risk of being shot down by a policeman, even eight years from now with a replica toy gun in his hands. Blasters, Blasters, Everywhere Toys are a big business in this country, raking in $19.4 billion in 2015, according to the retail tracking firm NPD Group . Our family is not responsible for even a dime of this. Not surprisingly, then, my announcement that we were all going to spend a rainy afternoon at a local Toys \"R\" Us store came like a bolt from the blue for the kids. I wanted to see what kind of toy weaponry was for sale there. I was curious, among other things, about whether the boys at school who had taught Seamus about superheroes, bad guys, and Star Wars had ignited in my son a love of weaponry; I was curious, that is, as to how he would react to the walls of guns I imagined Toys \"R\" Us displaying. We got into our car as if it were Christmas Eve, Seamus beside himself with excitement, Madeline on a contact high from her brother. I was experiencing my own contact high, taking my kids on their first research trip. What we found was not exactly what I expected-on many levels. Seamus was quickly overwhelmed by the glut of everything-lots of pictures of toys on boxes, but not a lot to pick up. (It was, in that sense, the very opposite of our visits to the Goodwill store, where you can sit on the floor and play with all those second-hand toys as long as you put them back afterwards.) Not so surprisingly, in retrospect, he went straight for what was familiar, what he could grab in his hand and actually look at: the books. It took some effort to wrestle him away from Five Stories About Princesses and enlist him in my quest for bad toys. (Madeline had, by then, fallen asleep.) I had finally found the Nerf \"blasters,\" but he wasn't interested. \"Let's not go down this aisle, okay, Mom?\" I was, of course, looking for the worst of the worst when it came to weaponry, but it proved remarkably hard to find. The aisle did, admittedly, have the Nerf Zombie Strike Doominator and the Nerf Modulus Recon MKII for $34.99 each. Those certainly sounded grim, given the eternal war against the undead, but the bright orange, cartoonish, completely unrealistic \"blasters\" on display and marketed to kids \"eight and up\" seemed distant indeed from American gun carnage (and our wars in distant lands), nor was there anything on the packaging that even hinted at real people getting shot in real encounters or real wars. I must admit that I don't like the idea of Seamus shooting anything at anyone-even a brain-hungry zombie-but as it turned out, I needn't have worried, not this time around anyway. Zombie-killing wasn't in his wheelhouse. Still, I kept looking for the real gun aisle, and I did come across more blasters, dart shooters, and the like, none with the word \"gun\" on them. Of course, we do live in Connecticut, less than 100 miles from Newtown where, in 2012, Adam Lanza, a devotee of violent video games who grew up in a gun-filled house , killed 20 kids just a little older than Seamus along with six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. So maybe our local toy outlet was being sensitive, but I doubt it. There was the Halo UNSC SMG Blaster (the initials make it sound extra tough but stand for nothing) for $19.99, and the NERF Star Wars Episode VII First Order Stormtrooper Deluxe Blaster , which fires 12 darts up to 65 feet without reloading, for $41.99. The worst thing I could find was the Xploderz Mayhem , with \"more distance, more ammo,\" which shoots easy-to-wash off mini-water pellets. It was on clearance for $18.89. By then, Seamus was pulling me frantically toward the aisle with the full Frozen franchise on display. Madeline was now awake and in heaven. So I left them there briefly and snuck off to do a last check for \"real\" toy guns. No such luck. I didn't find the kind of Airsoft gun Tamir Rice was playing with when he was killed. I didn't find an ersatz Sig Sauer either. It turns out that most brick-and-mortar toy stores don't seem to offer realistic-looking toy weaponry anymore, nor is there the toy store equivalent of the curtained-off area in the old neighborhood video rental shop where the porn was available. For such toys, you have to turn to an online world of websites like Kids-Army.com , where you can indeed buy realistic-looking toy rifles, shotguns, and pistols, or even to Amazon, where you can find an Airsoft version of the Sig Sauer rifle for $249.99. \"Start Them Young\" The National Rifle Association (NRA) would undoubtedly have been disappointed by my local Toys \"R\" Us outlet-just as its officials undoubtedly are by the way most big toy merchants seem to have left their more realistic guns for the online world. This happened, in part, in response to the sort of social pressure that my husband engaged in when in high school and-more critically-the almost routine horror of the blurred line between toy guns and real ones. You know we're a quirky, gun-crazy nation when Cleveland could ban toy guns and umbrellas with pointy tips from the area around the Republican Convention in the name of security, but couldn't keep out the real guns in open-carry Ohio. The NRA wants kids to play with realistic toy guns and BB guns, since they believe that such toys are part of a child's initiation into the future ownership of perfectly real guns. At the moment, the gun lobby is concerned that not enough people have guns-even though the 270 million to 310 million of them already amassed around this country (according to the Pew Research Center ) could arm just about every man, woman, transgendered person, and child around. Still, despite the fact that Americans can now carry guns in all 50 states and the NRA continues to win most of the big political fights, the number of households with guns is actually down from its peak in the late 1960s (though those that are armed have more and deadlier weapons than ever before). No wonder the gun industry and the gun lobby are fighting to produce an army of toddlers. \" Start Them Young ,\" a February 2016 report from the Violence Policy Center, details how gun manufacturers and the NRA are eager to market real guns to younger and younger consumers. The report starts with a selection of quotes from the industry, including this gem from Craig Cushman, marketing director for T h ompson/Center Arms , about their Hot Shot rifle for kids: \"[We're] talking about a tiny gun intended for the very youngest shooters-the ultimate first gun. We're targeting the six- to 12-year-old range.\" In other words, kids are literally in their sights. It's a strange world we live in. The toy industry has puffed up and candy-colored its play guns, turned up the volume on the violence online and in video games, and wrapped everything in plastic and safety warnings. At the same time, the gun industry is making its guns smaller and cuter for kids, while putting its energy into the all-important junior market. Can we be safe-any of us-in a nation awash in guns? The gun-and-ammo industry boasted $16 billion in revenue for 2015. Gun stores-from brick-and-mortar shops to online retailers-had $3.1 billion in revenue that same year. The industry as a whole claimed responsibility for nearly $50 billion in \"economic activity\" in 2015 alone. That represents a fair number of jobs, but here is the number that really goes boom: $229 billion. That's the annual cost of fatal and non-fatal gun violence in this country, according to Mother Jones and analyst Ted Miller of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, who teamed up to crunch the numbers. That figure includes both the direct costs of gun injuries and deaths-police investigations, emergency personnel, hospital bills, long-term care for the injured, funeral expenses for the dead, and the costs of prosecuting and imprisoning the perpetrators. As the report concludes: \"Even before accounting for the more intangible costs of the violence... the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America is nearly $400,000. And we pay for 32 of them every single day.\" We are awash in guns. Where does it end? Gun violence is embedded in our national mythology, our foreign policy, our notions of masculinity, our entertainment industry, and our children's play. We see violence solving problems on every screen-from the zombie apocalypse to the rise of ISIS. Russian playwright Anton Chekhov's maxim still applies: \"One should not put a loaded rifle onto the stage if no one is thinking of firing it.\" Sooner or later, that rifle is sure to go off. It might be an accident; it might be terrorism; it might be hate. But it will go off. Somewhere, as you read this, it's going off right now. I don't want to police my kids' imagination. And there is a whole strain of parenting literature that assures me that I don't have to. It says don't interfere with your kid's play, even if it includes guns and shooting and killing. Imagination is imagination and the violence isn't real. It might even, so this line of thinking goes, be a healthy way for them to process feelings of aggression. I get what they're saying, but it seems like a cop-out to me. To my mind, nonintervention is often a missed opportunity to be a parent. Sure, the violence isn't real. The pow-pows don't actually rip skin and tendon or stop hearts from beating, but the United States, which has been fighting distant wars nonstop for 15 years now, does have a violence problem and a man problem and a gun problem. We know where that problem ends, but it starts somewhere, too. One place to begin to look, at least, is at how our kids-particularly our boys-play, and how they are nurtured (or not), and taught to express their emotions (or not). It is, at least in part, up to us, their parents, to decide whether they are going to be the ones who help repair our society and reorient us (or not). And it begins with the kinds of care and love they receive, the kinds of conversations they are invited into, the kinds of expectations they are given about behavior and relationships. I don't want to raise Seamus, Madeline, or Rosena in the austere, ripped from the headlines of horror, polemical atmosphere that was the essence of my own childhood. But I don't want them to get comfortable with killing either. I want so much more for, and from, my little boy than \"Pow, pow, yous are dead now!\" And that starts with taking the gun or the stick or the rainbow flag out of his hands, sitting him down, and having a hard conversation about what guns actually do to people-and how much killing hurts us all.\n\nThe most essential facts are, however, not that complicated: Mateen had a license to carry a gun, training as a private security guard, and hatreds to act upon. He armed himself and he killed.

At the moment, the gun lobby is concerned that not enough people have guns-even though the 270 million to 310 million of them already amassed around this country (according to the Pew Research Center ) could arm just about every man, woman, transgendered person, and child around. Still, despite the fact that Americans can now carry guns in all 50 states and the NRA continues to win most of the big political fights, the number of households with guns is actually down from its peak in the late 1960s (though those that are armed have more and deadlier weapons than ever before). No wonder the gun industry and the gun lobby are fighting to produce an army of toddlers. \" Start Them Young ,\" a February 2016 report from the Violence Policy Center, details how gun manufacturers and the NRA are eager to market real guns to younger and younger consumers. The report starts with a selection of quotes from the industry, including this gem from Craig Cushman, marketing director for T h ompson/Center Arms , about their Hot Shot rifle for kids: \"[We're] talking about a tiny gun intended for the very youngest shooters-the ultimate first gun. We're targeting the six- to 12-year-old range.\" In other words, kids are literally in their sights. It's a strange world we live in. The toy industry has puffed up and candy-colored its play guns, turned up the volume on the violence online and in video games, and wrapped everything in plastic and safety warnings. At the same time, the gun industry is making its guns smaller and cuter for kids, while putting its energy into the all-important junior market. Can we be safe-any of us-in a nation awash in guns? The gun-and-ammo industry boasted $16 billion in revenue for 2015. Gun stores-from brick-and-mortar shops to online retailers-had $3.1 billion in revenue that same year. The industry as a whole claimed responsibility for nearly $50 billion in \"economic activity\" in 2015 alone. That represents a fair number of jobs, but here is the number that really goes boom: $229 billion. That's the annual cost of fatal and non-fatal gun violence in this country, according to Mother Jones and analyst Ted Miller of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, who teamed up to crunch the numbers. That figure includes both the direct costs of gun injuries and deaths-police investigations, emergency personnel, hospital bills, long-term care for the injured, funeral expenses for the dead, and the costs of prosecuting and imprisoning the perpetrators. As the report concludes: \"Even before accounting for the more intangible costs of the violence... the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America is nearly $400,000. And we pay for 32 of them every single day.\" We are awash in guns. Where does it end? Gun violence is embedded in our national mythology, our foreign policy, our notions of masculinity, our entertainment industry, and our children's play. We see violence solving problems on every screen-from the zombie apocalypse to the rise of ISIS. Russian playwright Anton Chekhov's maxim still applies: \"One should not put a loaded rifle onto the stage if no one is thinking of firing it.\" Sooner or later, that rifle is sure to go off. It might be an accident; it might be terrorism; it might be hate. But it will go off. Somewhere, as you read this, it's going off right now. I don't want to police my kids' imagination. And there is a whole strain of parenting literature that assures me that I don't have to. It says don't interfere with your kid's play, even if it includes guns and shooting and killing. Imagination is imagination and the violence isn't real. It might even, so this line of thinking goes, be a healthy way for them to process feelings of aggression. I get what they're saying, but it seems like a cop-out to me. To my mind, nonintervention is often a missed opportunity to be a parent. Sure, the violence isn't real. The pow-pows don't actually rip skin and tendon or stop hearts from beating, but the United States, which has been fighting distant wars nonstop for 15 years now, does have a violence problem and a man problem and a gun problem. We know where that problem ends, but it starts somewhere, too. One place to begin to look, at least, is at how our kids-particularly our boys-play, and how they are nurtured (or not), and taught to express their emotions (or not). It is, at least in part, up to us, their parents, to decide whether they are going to be the ones who help repair our society and reorient us (or not). And it begins with the kinds of care and love they receive, the kinds of conversations they are invited into, the kinds of expectations they are given about behavior and relationships. I don't want to raise Seamus, Madeline, or Rosena in the austere, ripped from the headlines of horror, polemical atmosphere that was the essence of my own childhood. But I don't want them to get comfortable with killing either. I want so much more for, and from, my little boy than \"Pow, pow, yous are dead now!\" And that starts with taking the gun or the stick or the rainbow flag out of his hands, sitting him down, and having a hard conversation about what guns actually do to people-and how much killing hurts us all.\n\nJeet Heer\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nJeet Heer\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nAnd all over the country, since that fateful day that elicited the usual cries of \"never again,\" the killing continues: Alton Sterling and Philando Castille , by the police; Dallas Area Rapid Transit Police Officer Brent Thompson and four Dallas Police officers, Lorne Ahrens, Michael Smith, Michael Krol, and Patrick Zamarripa, by a lone sniper, Micah Johnson, who himself was then killed by an armed police robot; three more police officers in Baton Rouge on July 17. \"... Montrell Jackson, 32 Matthew Gerald, 41 Brad Garafola, 45...\" And the killing continues. Using the Gun Violence Archive , I counted another 306 deaths by guns throughout the United States in the first eight days of July alone. Most of them weren't high-profile police shootings or mass tragedies, but in a small-scale and localized way, the grief and outrage of Baton Rouge, St. Paul, and Dallas were replicated in every corner of this country, including Ticfaw, Louisiana; Woodland, California; Tabernacle, New Jersey; and Harvey, Illinois. More than 300 deaths by gun in just eight days. \"Stabbin' My Bunny\": Teaching Kids About Guns and Violence And then, of course, there were my kids, my husband, and those \"guns.\" As a boy, Patrick wasn't allowed to play with toy guns. Instead, he, his parents, and their friends would go to the mall during the Christmas buying spree to put \" Stop War Toys \" stickers on Rambo and G.I. Joe action figures. When he went to his friends' houses, he had to tell them that war toys were verboten . LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS Email I grew up in a similar family of activists. We, too, were forbidden toy guns and other war toys. My brother and I were more likely to play games like \"protester at the Pentagon\" than cops and robbers. I've been thinking recently about why toy guns didn't have a grip on our imaginations as kids. I suspect it was because we understood-were made to understand-what the big gun of US militarism had done in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Indochina, and throughout Central America. Our dad had seen the big gun of war up close and personal. His finger-the same one he pointed at us when we were in trouble-had pulled the trigger again and again in France during World War II. He was decorated there, but had zero nostalgia for the experience. He was, in fact, deeply ashamed of the dashing figure he had once cut when home from the front. And so, Dad screwed up a new kind of courage to say no to war and violence, to killing of any kind. His knowledge of war imbued his nonviolent peace activist mission with a genuine, badass, superhero style swagger. Our parents-our community of ragtag, countercultural Catholic peace activists-made that no-violence, no-killing, no-matter-what point again and again. In fact, my early experience of guns was the chilling fear of knowing that, in protest , my father, mother, and their friends were walking into what they called \"free-fire zones\" on military bases, where well-armed, well-trained soldiers were licensed to kill intruders. So we didn't point toy guns at each other. We didn't pow-pow with our fingers or sticks. We crossed those fingers and hoped that the people we loved would be safe. Our inner city Baltimore neighborhood, where crack cocaine madness was just taking hold, drove that point home on a micro level. Our house was robbed at gunpoint more than once-and we had so little worth taking. We watched a man across the street bleed to death after being stabbed repeatedly in a fight over nothing. People from our house ran to help and were there for far too long before an ambulance even arrived. We knew as little kids that violence was no laughing matter, nor child's play. It was serious business and was to be resisted. As parents tend to do, Patrick and I are passing this tradition on to our kids, hopefully without the emotional scarring that went with our childhoods of resistance. They don't have guns or action figures or any other toy implements of death. Still, we've been watching Seamus, our Team Elsa (from the Disney blockbuster Frozen ) son, as he's recently begun turning every stick into an imaginary gun. This is, of course, happening just as, in the headlines of the moment, actual guns are turning so many previously real people into statistics. Under the circumstances, how could I not find myself thinking about toy guns, real guns, the nature of play, the role of imagination, the place of parents, and how to (or whether to) police (ha!) that imaginary play? When my stepdaughter Rosena was about four, she found a toy dagger at the playground, somehow smuggled it home, and was stabbing one of her beloved stuffed animals, a bunny, repeatedly with it. In the other room, I could hear the thumps on the bedroom floor and called out, \"What are you doing?\" \"Stabbin' my bunny. I kilt her,\" she responded matter-of-factly. Seizing a \"teaching moment\" and undoubtedly gripped by my own childhood experiences and memories of my parents, I blustered into the bedroom with a shoebox. \"Now, your bunny is dead,\" I announced in my version of over-the-top momism. \"You know what happens when living things die, right? It's forever, right? Now, we have to bury her.\" Rosena and I then \"buried\" the doll on a high shelf in her closet. I told her that we cannot hurt or kill the things (or people) we love. I told her that, because she had \"killed\" that bunny, she could never play with it again. About a week later, I slipped it back into her toy basket and, when she asked why, assured her that I thought she wouldn't hurt her toys like that again. She agreed. I recall that episode now with a certain embarrassment, but when I recently heard Rosena explaining death and loss to her little brother and sister, I thought: Oh, maybe the drama of the shoebox burial was actually helpful in some fashion. Toys matter. We've put a fair amount of thought into what might be called toy curation in our household. We've bought nothing new and little used. Mostly, we've accepted shipments of hand-me-downs from friends who just wanted \"this crap\" out of their houses. No guns came with them, thankfully. After all, even toy guns can mean death under the wrong circumstances. A year ago, I visited the Cuddell Recreation Center in Cleveland with my daughter Madeline and a group of friends. That broad stretch of ball fields and paths, anchored by a gazebo and a playground, was where 12-year-old Tamir Rice was fatally shot by Officer Timothy Loehmann in November 2014. Rice, an African American, was playing with an Airsoft pellet gun that a friend's dad had bought at Walmart . A replica of an actual Colt pistol, it shot plastic pellets and looked pretty real, since the orange tip signifying \"toy\" was missing. However, Officer Loehmann, investigating a report that a man was carrying a gun in the park, was moving too fast to notice much. He sped up and began shooting even before his squad car stopped moving. Rice's hands were still reportedly in his pockets. Though Loehmann was not indicted, the city of Cleveland paid a $6 million settlement to the Rice family and demolished the gazebo where the boy was shot. In the park that day, local activists described the shooting and its aftermath to our group. Half listening, I followed Madeline as she toddled into the playground. I tried to imagine Samaria Rice's pain in this unremarkable place made part shrine, part soapbox by a police officer's quick trigger finger, racism, and her son's blood. I thought about that toy gun in Tamir Rice's hand and what might have been going through his head as he pointed it and played with it. Despite the age difference, it couldn't have been that far from what regularly goes through my son's head when he picks up a stick and points it: pop, boom, wow! The difference, of course, is that Seamus, blond and freckled and unmistakably white, would run little risk of being shot down by a policeman, even eight years from now with a replica toy gun in his hands. Blasters, Blasters, Everywhere Toys are a big business in this country, raking in $19.4 billion in 2015, according to the retail tracking firm NPD Group . Our family is not responsible for even a dime of this. Not surprisingly, then, my announcement that we were all going to spend a rainy afternoon at a local Toys \"R\" Us store came like a bolt from the blue for the kids. I wanted to see what kind of toy weaponry was for sale there. I was curious, among other things, about whether the boys at school who had taught Seamus about superheroes, bad guys, and Star Wars had ignited in my son a love of weaponry; I was curious, that is, as to how he would react to the walls of guns I imagined Toys \"R\" Us displaying. We got into our car as if it were Christmas Eve, Seamus beside himself with excitement, Madeline on a contact high from her brother. I was experiencing my own contact high, taking my kids on their first research trip. What we found was not exactly what I expected-on many levels. Seamus was quickly overwhelmed by the glut of everything-lots of pictures of toys on boxes, but not a lot to pick up. (It was, in that sense, the very opposite of our visits to the Goodwill store, where you can sit on the floor and play with all those second-hand toys as long as you put them back afterwards.) Not so surprisingly, in retrospect, he went straight for what was familiar, what he could grab in his hand and actually look at: the books. It took some effort to wrestle him away from Five Stories About Princesses and enlist him in my quest for bad toys. (Madeline had, by then, fallen asleep.) I had finally found the Nerf \"blasters,\" but he wasn't interested. \"Let's not go down this aisle, okay, Mom?\" I was, of course, looking for the worst of the worst when it came to weaponry, but it proved remarkably hard to find. The aisle did, admittedly, have the Nerf Zombie Strike Doominator and the Nerf Modulus Recon MKII for $34.99 each. Those certainly sounded grim, given the eternal war against the undead, but the bright orange, cartoonish, completely unrealistic \"blasters\" on display and marketed to kids \"eight and up\" seemed distant indeed from American gun carnage (and our wars in distant lands), nor was there anything on the packaging that even hinted at real people getting shot in real encounters or real wars. I must admit that I don't like the idea of Seamus shooting anything at anyone-even a brain-hungry zombie-but as it turned out, I needn't have worried, not this time around anyway. Zombie-killing wasn't in his wheelhouse. Still, I kept looking for the real gun aisle, and I did come across more blasters, dart shooters, and the like, none with the word \"gun\" on them. Of course, we do live in Connecticut, less than 100 miles from Newtown where, in 2012, Adam Lanza, a devotee of violent video games who grew up in a gun-filled house , killed 20 kids just a little older than Seamus along with six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. So maybe our local toy outlet was being sensitive, but I doubt it. There was the Halo UNSC SMG Blaster (the initials make it sound extra tough but stand for nothing) for $19.99, and the NERF Star Wars Episode VII First Order Stormtrooper Deluxe Blaster , which fires 12 darts up to 65 feet without reloading, for $41.99. The worst thing I could find was the Xploderz Mayhem , with \"more distance, more ammo,\" which shoots easy-to-wash off mini-water pellets. It was on clearance for $18.89. By then, Seamus was pulling me frantically toward the aisle with the full Frozen franchise on display. Madeline was now awake and in heaven. So I left them there briefly and snuck off to do a last check for \"real\" toy guns. No such luck. I didn't find the kind of Airsoft gun Tamir Rice was playing with when he was killed. I didn't find an ersatz Sig Sauer either. It turns out that most brick-and-mortar toy stores don't seem to offer realistic-looking toy weaponry anymore, nor is there the toy store equivalent of the curtained-off area in the old neighborhood video rental shop where the porn was available. For such toys, you have to turn to an online world of websites like Kids-Army.com , where you can indeed buy realistic-looking toy rifles, shotguns, and pistols, or even to Amazon, where you can find an Airsoft version of the Sig Sauer rifle for $249.99. \"Start Them Young\" The National Rifle Association (NRA) would undoubtedly have been disappointed by my local Toys \"R\" Us outlet-just as its officials undoubtedly are by the way most big toy merchants seem to have left their more realistic guns for the online world. This happened, in part, in response to the sort of social pressure that my husband engaged in when in high school and-more critically-the almost routine horror of the blurred line between toy guns and real ones. You know we're a quirky, gun-crazy nation when Cleveland could ban toy guns and umbrellas with pointy tips from the area around the Republican Convention in the name of security, but couldn't keep out the real guns in open-carry Ohio. The NRA wants kids to play with realistic toy guns and BB guns, since they believe that such toys are part of a child's initiation into the future ownership of perfectly real guns.

I must admit that I don't like the idea of Seamus shooting anything at anyone-even a brain-hungry zombie-but as it turned out, I needn't have worried, not this time around anyway. Zombie-killing wasn't in his wheelhouse. Still, I kept looking for the real gun aisle, and I did come across more blasters, dart shooters, and the like, none with the word \"gun\" on them. Of course, we do live in Connecticut, less than 100 miles from Newtown where, in 2012, Adam Lanza, a devotee of violent video games who grew up in a gun-filled house , killed 20 kids just a little older than Seamus along with six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. So maybe our local toy outlet was being sensitive, but I doubt it. There was the Halo UNSC SMG Blaster (the initials make it sound extra tough but stand for nothing) for $19.99, and the NERF Star Wars Episode VII First Order Stormtrooper Deluxe Blaster , which fires 12 darts up to 65 feet without reloading, for $41.99. The worst thing I could find was the Xploderz Mayhem , with \"more distance, more ammo,\" which shoots easy-to-wash off mini-water pellets. It was on clearance for $18.89. By then, Seamus was pulling me frantically toward the aisle with the full Frozen franchise on display. Madeline was now awake and in heaven. So I left them there briefly and snuck off to do a last check for \"real\" toy guns. No such luck. I didn't find the kind of Airsoft gun Tamir Rice was playing with when he was killed. I didn't find an ersatz Sig Sauer either. It turns out that most brick-and-mortar toy stores don't seem to offer realistic-looking toy weaponry anymore, nor is there the toy store equivalent of the curtained-off area in the old neighborhood video rental shop where the porn was available. For such toys, you have to turn to an online world of websites like Kids-Army.com , where you can indeed buy realistic-looking toy rifles, shotguns, and pistols, or even to Amazon, where you can find an Airsoft version of the Sig Sauer rifle for $249.99. \"Start Them Young\" The National Rifle Association (NRA) would undoubtedly have been disappointed by my local Toys \"R\" Us outlet-just as its officials undoubtedly are by the way most big toy merchants seem to have left their more realistic guns for the online world. This happened, in part, in response to the sort of social pressure that my husband engaged in when in high school and-more critically-the almost routine horror of the blurred line between toy guns and real ones. You know we're a quirky, gun-crazy nation when Cleveland could ban toy guns and umbrellas with pointy tips from the area around the Republican Convention in the name of security, but couldn't keep out the real guns in open-carry Ohio. The NRA wants kids to play with realistic toy guns and BB guns, since they believe that such toys are part of a child's initiation into the future ownership of perfectly real guns. At the moment, the gun lobby is concerned that not enough people have guns-even though the 270 million to 310 million of them already amassed around this country (according to the Pew Research Center ) could arm just about every man, woman, transgendered person, and child around. Still, despite the fact that Americans can now carry guns in all 50 states and the NRA continues to win most of the big political fights, the number of households with guns is actually down from its peak in the late 1960s (though those that are armed have more and deadlier weapons than ever before). No wonder the gun industry and the gun lobby are fighting to produce an army of toddlers. \" Start Them Young ,\" a February 2016 report from the Violence Policy Center, details how gun manufacturers and the NRA are eager to market real guns to younger and younger consumers. The report starts with a selection of quotes from the industry, including this gem from Craig Cushman, marketing director for T h ompson/Center Arms , about their Hot Shot rifle for kids: \"[We're] talking about a tiny gun intended for the very youngest shooters-the ultimate first gun. We're targeting the six- to 12-year-old range.\" In other words, kids are literally in their sights. It's a strange world we live in. The toy industry has puffed up and candy-colored its play guns, turned up the volume on the violence online and in video games, and wrapped everything in plastic and safety warnings. At the same time, the gun industry is making its guns smaller and cuter for kids, while putting its energy into the all-important junior market. Can we be safe-any of us-in a nation awash in guns? The gun-and-ammo industry boasted $16 billion in revenue for 2015. Gun stores-from brick-and-mortar shops to online retailers-had $3.1 billion in revenue that same year. The industry as a whole claimed responsibility for nearly $50 billion in \"economic activity\" in 2015 alone. That represents a fair number of jobs, but here is the number that really goes boom: $229 billion. That's the annual cost of fatal and non-fatal gun violence in this country, according to Mother Jones and analyst Ted Miller of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, who teamed up to crunch the numbers. That figure includes both the direct costs of gun injuries and deaths-police investigations, emergency personnel, hospital bills, long-term care for the injured, funeral expenses for the dead, and the costs of prosecuting and imprisoning the perpetrators. As the report concludes: \"Even before accounting for the more intangible costs of the violence... the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America is nearly $400,000. And we pay for 32 of them every single day.\" We are awash in guns. Where does it end? Gun violence is embedded in our national mythology, our foreign policy, our notions of masculinity, our entertainment industry, and our children's play. We see violence solving problems on every screen-from the zombie apocalypse to the rise of ISIS. Russian playwright Anton Chekhov's maxim still applies: \"One should not put a loaded rifle onto the stage if no one is thinking of firing it.\" Sooner or later, that rifle is sure to go off. It might be an accident; it might be terrorism; it might be hate. But it will go off. Somewhere, as you read this, it's going off right now. I don't want to police my kids' imagination. And there is a whole strain of parenting literature that assures me that I don't have to. It says don't interfere with your kid's play, even if it includes guns and shooting and killing. Imagination is imagination and the violence isn't real. It might even, so this line of thinking goes, be a healthy way for them to process feelings of aggression. I get what they're saying, but it seems like a cop-out to me. To my mind, nonintervention is often a missed opportunity to be a parent. Sure, the violence isn't real. The pow-pows don't actually rip skin and tendon or stop hearts from beating, but the United States, which has been fighting distant wars nonstop for 15 years now, does have a violence problem and a man problem and a gun problem. We know where that problem ends, but it starts somewhere, too. One place to begin to look, at least, is at how our kids-particularly our boys-play, and how they are nurtured (or not), and taught to express their emotions (or not). It is, at least in part, up to us, their parents, to decide whether they are going to be the ones who help repair our society and reorient us (or not). And it begins with the kinds of care and love they receive, the kinds of conversations they are invited into, the kinds of expectations they are given about behavior and relationships. I don't want to raise Seamus, Madeline, or Rosena in the austere, ripped from the headlines of horror, polemical atmosphere that was the essence of my own childhood. But I don't want them to get comfortable with killing either. I want so much more for, and from, my little boy than \"Pow, pow, yous are dead now!\" And that starts with taking the gun or the stick or the rainbow flag out of his hands, sitting him down, and having a hard conversation about what guns actually do to people-and how much killing hurts us all.\n\nAnd the killing continues. Using the Gun Violence Archive , I counted another 306 deaths by guns throughout the United States in the first eight days of July alone. Most of them weren't high-profile police shootings or mass tragedies, but in a small-scale and localized way, the grief and outrage of Baton Rouge, St. Paul, and Dallas were replicated in every corner of this country, including Ticfaw, Louisiana; Woodland, California; Tabernacle, New Jersey; and Harvey, Illinois. More than 300 deaths by gun in just eight days. \"Stabbin' My Bunny\": Teaching Kids About Guns and Violence And then, of course, there were my kids, my husband, and those \"guns.\" As a boy, Patrick wasn't allowed to play with toy guns. Instead, he, his parents, and their friends would go to the mall during the Christmas buying spree to put \" Stop War Toys \" stickers on Rambo and G.I. Joe action figures. When he went to his friends' houses, he had to tell them that war toys were verboten . LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS Email I grew up in a similar family of activists. We, too, were forbidden toy guns and other war toys. My brother and I were more likely to play games like \"protester at the Pentagon\" than cops and robbers. I've been thinking recently about why toy guns didn't have a grip on our imaginations as kids. I suspect it was because we understood-were made to understand-what the big gun of US militarism had done in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Indochina, and throughout Central America. Our dad had seen the big gun of war up close and personal. His finger-the same one he pointed at us when we were in trouble-had pulled the trigger again and again in France during World War II. He was decorated there, but had zero nostalgia for the experience. He was, in fact, deeply ashamed of the dashing figure he had once cut when home from the front. And so, Dad screwed up a new kind of courage to say no to war and violence, to killing of any kind. His knowledge of war imbued his nonviolent peace activist mission with a genuine, badass, superhero style swagger. Our parents-our community of ragtag, countercultural Catholic peace activists-made that no-violence, no-killing, no-matter-what point again and again. In fact, my early experience of guns was the chilling fear of knowing that, in protest , my father, mother, and their friends were walking into what they called \"free-fire zones\" on military bases, where well-armed, well-trained soldiers were licensed to kill intruders. So we didn't point toy guns at each other. We didn't pow-pow with our fingers or sticks. We crossed those fingers and hoped that the people we loved would be safe. Our inner city Baltimore neighborhood, where crack cocaine madness was just taking hold, drove that point home on a micro level. Our house was robbed at gunpoint more than once-and we had so little worth taking. We watched a man across the street bleed to death after being stabbed repeatedly in a fight over nothing. People from our house ran to help and were there for far too long before an ambulance even arrived. We knew as little kids that violence was no laughing matter, nor child's play. It was serious business and was to be resisted. As parents tend to do, Patrick and I are passing this tradition on to our kids, hopefully without the emotional scarring that went with our childhoods of resistance. They don't have guns or action figures or any other toy implements of death. Still, we've been watching Seamus, our Team Elsa (from the Disney blockbuster Frozen ) son, as he's recently begun turning every stick into an imaginary gun. This is, of course, happening just as, in the headlines of the moment, actual guns are turning so many previously real people into statistics. Under the circumstances, how could I not find myself thinking about toy guns, real guns, the nature of play, the role of imagination, the place of parents, and how to (or whether to) police (ha!) that imaginary play? When my stepdaughter Rosena was about four, she found a toy dagger at the playground, somehow smuggled it home, and was stabbing one of her beloved stuffed animals, a bunny, repeatedly with it. In the other room, I could hear the thumps on the bedroom floor and called out, \"What are you doing?\" \"Stabbin' my bunny. I kilt her,\" she responded matter-of-factly. Seizing a \"teaching moment\" and undoubtedly gripped by my own childhood experiences and memories of my parents, I blustered into the bedroom with a shoebox. \"Now, your bunny is dead,\" I announced in my version of over-the-top momism. \"You know what happens when living things die, right? It's forever, right? Now, we have to bury her.\" Rosena and I then \"buried\" the doll on a high shelf in her closet. I told her that we cannot hurt or kill the things (or people) we love. I told her that, because she had \"killed\" that bunny, she could never play with it again. About a week later, I slipped it back into her toy basket and, when she asked why, assured her that I thought she wouldn't hurt her toys like that again. She agreed. I recall that episode now with a certain embarrassment, but when I recently heard Rosena explaining death and loss to her little brother and sister, I thought: Oh, maybe the drama of the shoebox burial was actually helpful in some fashion. Toys matter. We've put a fair amount of thought into what might be called toy curation in our household. We've bought nothing new and little used. Mostly, we've accepted shipments of hand-me-downs from friends who just wanted \"this crap\" out of their houses. No guns came with them, thankfully. After all, even toy guns can mean death under the wrong circumstances. A year ago, I visited the Cuddell Recreation Center in Cleveland with my daughter Madeline and a group of friends. That broad stretch of ball fields and paths, anchored by a gazebo and a playground, was where 12-year-old Tamir Rice was fatally shot by Officer Timothy Loehmann in November 2014. Rice, an African American, was playing with an Airsoft pellet gun that a friend's dad had bought at Walmart . A replica of an actual Colt pistol, it shot plastic pellets and looked pretty real, since the orange tip signifying \"toy\" was missing. However, Officer Loehmann, investigating a report that a man was carrying a gun in the park, was moving too fast to notice much. He sped up and began shooting even before his squad car stopped moving. Rice's hands were still reportedly in his pockets. Though Loehmann was not indicted, the city of Cleveland paid a $6 million settlement to the Rice family and demolished the gazebo where the boy was shot. In the park that day, local activists described the shooting and its aftermath to our group. Half listening, I followed Madeline as she toddled into the playground. I tried to imagine Samaria Rice's pain in this unremarkable place made part shrine, part soapbox by a police officer's quick trigger finger, racism, and her son's blood. I thought about that toy gun in Tamir Rice's hand and what might have been going through his head as he pointed it and played with it. Despite the age difference, it couldn't have been that far from what regularly goes through my son's head when he picks up a stick and points it: pop, boom, wow! The difference, of course, is that Seamus, blond and freckled and unmistakably white, would run little risk of being shot down by a policeman, even eight years from now with a replica toy gun in his hands. Blasters, Blasters, Everywhere Toys are a big business in this country, raking in $19.4 billion in 2015, according to the retail tracking firm NPD Group . Our family is not responsible for even a dime of this. Not surprisingly, then, my announcement that we were all going to spend a rainy afternoon at a local Toys \"R\" Us store came like a bolt from the blue for the kids. I wanted to see what kind of toy weaponry was for sale there. I was curious, among other things, about whether the boys at school who had taught Seamus about superheroes, bad guys, and Star Wars had ignited in my son a love of weaponry; I was curious, that is, as to how he would react to the walls of guns I imagined Toys \"R\" Us displaying. We got into our car as if it were Christmas Eve, Seamus beside himself with excitement, Madeline on a contact high from her brother. I was experiencing my own contact high, taking my kids on their first research trip. What we found was not exactly what I expected-on many levels. Seamus was quickly overwhelmed by the glut of everything-lots of pictures of toys on boxes, but not a lot to pick up. (It was, in that sense, the very opposite of our visits to the Goodwill store, where you can sit on the floor and play with all those second-hand toys as long as you put them back afterwards.) Not so surprisingly, in retrospect, he went straight for what was familiar, what he could grab in his hand and actually look at: the books. It took some effort to wrestle him away from Five Stories About Princesses and enlist him in my quest for bad toys. (Madeline had, by then, fallen asleep.) I had finally found the Nerf \"blasters,\" but he wasn't interested. \"Let's not go down this aisle, okay, Mom?\" I was, of course, looking for the worst of the worst when it came to weaponry, but it proved remarkably hard to find. The aisle did, admittedly, have the Nerf Zombie Strike Doominator and the Nerf Modulus Recon MKII for $34.99 each. Those certainly sounded grim, given the eternal war against the undead, but the bright orange, cartoonish, completely unrealistic \"blasters\" on display and marketed to kids \"eight and up\" seemed distant indeed from American gun carnage (and our wars in distant lands), nor was there anything on the packaging that even hinted at real people getting shot in real encounters or real wars. I must admit that I don't like the idea of Seamus shooting anything at anyone-even a brain-hungry zombie-but as it turned out, I needn't have worried, not this time around anyway. Zombie-killing wasn't in his wheelhouse. Still, I kept looking for the real gun aisle, and I did come across more blasters, dart shooters, and the like, none with the word \"gun\" on them. Of course, we do live in Connecticut, less than 100 miles from Newtown where, in 2012, Adam Lanza, a devotee of violent video games who grew up in a gun-filled house , killed 20 kids just a little older than Seamus along with six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. So maybe our local toy outlet was being sensitive, but I doubt it. There was the Halo UNSC SMG Blaster (the initials make it sound extra tough but stand for nothing) for $19.99, and the NERF Star Wars Episode VII First Order Stormtrooper Deluxe Blaster , which fires 12 darts up to 65 feet without reloading, for $41.99. The worst thing I could find was the Xploderz Mayhem , with \"more distance, more ammo,\" which shoots easy-to-wash off mini-water pellets. It was on clearance for $18.89. By then, Seamus was pulling me frantically toward the aisle with the full Frozen franchise on display. Madeline was now awake and in heaven. So I left them there briefly and snuck off to do a last check for \"real\" toy guns. No such luck. I didn't find the kind of Airsoft gun Tamir Rice was playing with when he was killed.

I was experiencing my own contact high, taking my kids on their first research trip. What we found was not exactly what I expected-on many levels. Seamus was quickly overwhelmed by the glut of everything-lots of pictures of toys on boxes, but not a lot to pick up. (It was, in that sense, the very opposite of our visits to the Goodwill store, where you can sit on the floor and play with all those second-hand toys as long as you put them back afterwards.) Not so surprisingly, in retrospect, he went straight for what was familiar, what he could grab in his hand and actually look at: the books. It took some effort to wrestle him away from Five Stories About Princesses and enlist him in my quest for bad toys. (Madeline had, by then, fallen asleep.) I had finally found the Nerf \"blasters,\" but he wasn't interested. \"Let's not go down this aisle, okay, Mom?\" I was, of course, looking for the worst of the worst when it came to weaponry, but it proved remarkably hard to find. The aisle did, admittedly, have the Nerf Zombie Strike Doominator and the Nerf Modulus Recon MKII for $34.99 each. Those certainly sounded grim, given the eternal war against the undead, but the bright orange, cartoonish, completely unrealistic \"blasters\" on display and marketed to kids \"eight and up\" seemed distant indeed from American gun carnage (and our wars in distant lands), nor was there anything on the packaging that even hinted at real people getting shot in real encounters or real wars. I must admit that I don't like the idea of Seamus shooting anything at anyone-even a brain-hungry zombie-but as it turned out, I needn't have worried, not this time around anyway. Zombie-killing wasn't in his wheelhouse. Still, I kept looking for the real gun aisle, and I did come across more blasters, dart shooters, and the like, none with the word \"gun\" on them. Of course, we do live in Connecticut, less than 100 miles from Newtown where, in 2012, Adam Lanza, a devotee of violent video games who grew up in a gun-filled house , killed 20 kids just a little older than Seamus along with six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. So maybe our local toy outlet was being sensitive, but I doubt it. There was the Halo UNSC SMG Blaster (the initials make it sound extra tough but stand for nothing) for $19.99, and the NERF Star Wars Episode VII First Order Stormtrooper Deluxe Blaster , which fires 12 darts up to 65 feet without reloading, for $41.99. The worst thing I could find was the Xploderz Mayhem , with \"more distance, more ammo,\" which shoots easy-to-wash off mini-water pellets. It was on clearance for $18.89. By then, Seamus was pulling me frantically toward the aisle with the full Frozen franchise on display. Madeline was now awake and in heaven. So I left them there briefly and snuck off to do a last check for \"real\" toy guns. No such luck. I didn't find the kind of Airsoft gun Tamir Rice was playing with when he was killed. I didn't find an ersatz Sig Sauer either. It turns out that most brick-and-mortar toy stores don't seem to offer realistic-looking toy weaponry anymore, nor is there the toy store equivalent of the curtained-off area in the old neighborhood video rental shop where the porn was available. For such toys, you have to turn to an online world of websites like Kids-Army.com , where you can indeed buy realistic-looking toy rifles, shotguns, and pistols, or even to Amazon, where you can find an Airsoft version of the Sig Sauer rifle for $249.99. \"Start Them Young\" The National Rifle Association (NRA) would undoubtedly have been disappointed by my local Toys \"R\" Us outlet-just as its officials undoubtedly are by the way most big toy merchants seem to have left their more realistic guns for the online world. This happened, in part, in response to the sort of social pressure that my husband engaged in when in high school and-more critically-the almost routine horror of the blurred line between toy guns and real ones. You know we're a quirky, gun-crazy nation when Cleveland could ban toy guns and umbrellas with pointy tips from the area around the Republican Convention in the name of security, but couldn't keep out the real guns in open-carry Ohio. The NRA wants kids to play with realistic toy guns and BB guns, since they believe that such toys are part of a child's initiation into the future ownership of perfectly real guns. At the moment, the gun lobby is concerned that not enough people have guns-even though the 270 million to 310 million of them already amassed around this country (according to the Pew Research Center ) could arm just about every man, woman, transgendered person, and child around. Still, despite the fact that Americans can now carry guns in all 50 states and the NRA continues to win most of the big political fights, the number of households with guns is actually down from its peak in the late 1960s (though those that are armed have more and deadlier weapons than ever before). No wonder the gun industry and the gun lobby are fighting to produce an army of toddlers. \" Start Them Young ,\" a February 2016 report from the Violence Policy Center, details how gun manufacturers and the NRA are eager to market real guns to younger and younger consumers. The report starts with a selection of quotes from the industry, including this gem from Craig Cushman, marketing director for T h ompson/Center Arms , about their Hot Shot rifle for kids: \"[We're] talking about a tiny gun intended for the very youngest shooters-the ultimate first gun. We're targeting the six- to 12-year-old range.\" In other words, kids are literally in their sights. It's a strange world we live in. The toy industry has puffed up and candy-colored its play guns, turned up the volume on the violence online and in video games, and wrapped everything in plastic and safety warnings. At the same time, the gun industry is making its guns smaller and cuter for kids, while putting its energy into the all-important junior market. Can we be safe-any of us-in a nation awash in guns? The gun-and-ammo industry boasted $16 billion in revenue for 2015. Gun stores-from brick-and-mortar shops to online retailers-had $3.1 billion in revenue that same year. The industry as a whole claimed responsibility for nearly $50 billion in \"economic activity\" in 2015 alone. That represents a fair number of jobs, but here is the number that really goes boom: $229 billion. That's the annual cost of fatal and non-fatal gun violence in this country, according to Mother Jones and analyst Ted Miller of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, who teamed up to crunch the numbers. That figure includes both the direct costs of gun injuries and deaths-police investigations, emergency personnel, hospital bills, long-term care for the injured, funeral expenses for the dead, and the costs of prosecuting and imprisoning the perpetrators. As the report concludes: \"Even before accounting for the more intangible costs of the violence... the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America is nearly $400,000. And we pay for 32 of them every single day.\" We are awash in guns. Where does it end? Gun violence is embedded in our national mythology, our foreign policy, our notions of masculinity, our entertainment industry, and our children's play. We see violence solving problems on every screen-from the zombie apocalypse to the rise of ISIS. Russian playwright Anton Chekhov's maxim still applies: \"One should not put a loaded rifle onto the stage if no one is thinking of firing it.\" Sooner or later, that rifle is sure to go off. It might be an accident; it might be terrorism; it might be hate. But it will go off. Somewhere, as you read this, it's going off right now. I don't want to police my kids' imagination. And there is a whole strain of parenting literature that assures me that I don't have to. It says don't interfere with your kid's play, even if it includes guns and shooting and killing. Imagination is imagination and the violence isn't real. It might even, so this line of thinking goes, be a healthy way for them to process feelings of aggression. I get what they're saying, but it seems like a cop-out to me. To my mind, nonintervention is often a missed opportunity to be a parent. Sure, the violence isn't real. The pow-pows don't actually rip skin and tendon or stop hearts from beating, but the United States, which has been fighting distant wars nonstop for 15 years now, does have a violence problem and a man problem and a gun problem. We know where that problem ends, but it starts somewhere, too. One place to begin to look, at least, is at how our kids-particularly our boys-play, and how they are nurtured (or not), and taught to express their emotions (or not). It is, at least in part, up to us, their parents, to decide whether they are going to be the ones who help repair our society and reorient us (or not). And it begins with the kinds of care and love they receive, the kinds of conversations they are invited into, the kinds of expectations they are given about behavior and relationships. I don't want to raise Seamus, Madeline, or Rosena in the austere, ripped from the headlines of horror, polemical atmosphere that was the essence of my own childhood. But I don't want them to get comfortable with killing either. I want so much more for, and from, my little boy than \"Pow, pow, yous are dead now!\" And that starts with taking the gun or the stick or the rainbow flag out of his hands, sitting him down, and having a hard conversation about what guns actually do to people-and how much killing hurts us all.\n\nLIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS\n\nLIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS\n\nI grew up in a similar family of activists. We, too, were forbidden toy guns and other war toys. My brother and I were more likely to play games like \"protester at the Pentagon\" than cops and robbers. I've been thinking recently about why toy guns didn't have a grip on our imaginations as kids. I suspect it was because we understood-were made to understand-what the big gun of US militarism had done in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Indochina, and throughout Central America. Our dad had seen the big gun of war up close and personal. His finger-the same one he pointed at us when we were in trouble-had pulled the trigger again and again in France during World War II. He was decorated there, but had zero nostalgia for the experience. He was, in fact, deeply ashamed of the dashing figure he had once cut when home from the front. And so, Dad screwed up a new kind of courage to say no to war and violence, to killing of any kind. His knowledge of war imbued his nonviolent peace activist mission with a genuine, badass, superhero style swagger. Our parents-our community of ragtag, countercultural Catholic peace activists-made that no-violence, no-killing, no-matter-what point again and again. In fact, my early experience of guns was the chilling fear of knowing that, in protest , my father, mother, and their friends were walking into what they called \"free-fire zones\" on military bases, where well-armed, well-trained soldiers were licensed to kill intruders. So we didn't point toy guns at each other. We didn't pow-pow with our fingers or sticks. We crossed those fingers and hoped that the people we loved would be safe. Our inner city Baltimore neighborhood, where crack cocaine madness was just taking hold, drove that point home on a micro level. Our house was robbed at gunpoint more than once-and we had so little worth taking. We watched a man across the street bleed to death after being stabbed repeatedly in a fight over nothing. People from our house ran to help and were there for far too long before an ambulance even arrived. We knew as little kids that violence was no laughing matter, nor child's play. It was serious business and was to be resisted. As parents tend to do, Patrick and I are passing this tradition on to our kids, hopefully without the emotional scarring that went with our childhoods of resistance. They don't have guns or action figures or any other toy implements of death. Still, we've been watching Seamus, our Team Elsa (from the Disney blockbuster Frozen ) son, as he's recently begun turning every stick into an imaginary gun. This is, of course, happening just as, in the headlines of the moment, actual guns are turning so many previously real people into statistics. Under the circumstances, how could I not find myself thinking about toy guns, real guns, the nature of play, the role of imagination, the place of parents, and how to (or whether to) police (ha!) that imaginary play? When my stepdaughter Rosena was about four, she found a toy dagger at the playground, somehow smuggled it home, and was stabbing one of her beloved stuffed animals, a bunny, repeatedly with it. In the other room, I could hear the thumps on the bedroom floor and called out, \"What are you doing?\" \"Stabbin' my bunny. I kilt her,\" she responded matter-of-factly. Seizing a \"teaching moment\" and undoubtedly gripped by my own childhood experiences and memories of my parents, I blustered into the bedroom with a shoebox. \"Now, your bunny is dead,\" I announced in my version of over-the-top momism. \"You know what happens when living things die, right? It's forever, right? Now, we have to bury her.\" Rosena and I then \"buried\" the doll on a high shelf in her closet. I told her that we cannot hurt or kill the things (or people) we love. I told her that, because she had \"killed\" that bunny, she could never play with it again. About a week later, I slipped it back into her toy basket and, when she asked why, assured her that I thought she wouldn't hurt her toys like that again. She agreed. I recall that episode now with a certain embarrassment, but when I recently heard Rosena explaining death and loss to her little brother and sister, I thought: Oh, maybe the drama of the shoebox burial was actually helpful in some fashion. Toys matter. We've put a fair amount of thought into what might be called toy curation in our household. We've bought nothing new and little used. Mostly, we've accepted shipments of hand-me-downs from friends who just wanted \"this crap\" out of their houses. No guns came with them, thankfully. After all, even toy guns can mean death under the wrong circumstances. A year ago, I visited the Cuddell Recreation Center in Cleveland with my daughter Madeline and a group of friends. That broad stretch of ball fields and paths, anchored by a gazebo and a playground, was where 12-year-old Tamir Rice was fatally shot by Officer Timothy Loehmann in November 2014. Rice, an African American, was playing with an Airsoft pellet gun that a friend's dad had bought at Walmart . A replica of an actual Colt pistol, it shot plastic pellets and looked pretty real, since the orange tip signifying \"toy\" was missing. However, Officer Loehmann, investigating a report that a man was carrying a gun in the park, was moving too fast to notice much. He sped up and began shooting even before his squad car stopped moving. Rice's hands were still reportedly in his pockets. Though Loehmann was not indicted, the city of Cleveland paid a $6 million settlement to the Rice family and demolished the gazebo where the boy was shot. In the park that day, local activists described the shooting and its aftermath to our group. Half listening, I followed Madeline as she toddled into the playground. I tried to imagine Samaria Rice's pain in this unremarkable place made part shrine, part soapbox by a police officer's quick trigger finger, racism, and her son's blood. I thought about that toy gun in Tamir Rice's hand and what might have been going through his head as he pointed it and played with it. Despite the age difference, it couldn't have been that far from what regularly goes through my son's head when he picks up a stick and points it: pop, boom, wow! The difference, of course, is that Seamus, blond and freckled and unmistakably white, would run little risk of being shot down by a policeman, even eight years from now with a replica toy gun in his hands. Blasters, Blasters, Everywhere Toys are a big business in this country, raking in $19.4 billion in 2015, according to the retail tracking firm NPD Group . Our family is not responsible for even a dime of this. Not surprisingly, then, my announcement that we were all going to spend a rainy afternoon at a local Toys \"R\" Us store came like a bolt from the blue for the kids. I wanted to see what kind of toy weaponry was for sale there. I was curious, among other things, about whether the boys at school who had taught Seamus about superheroes, bad guys, and Star Wars had ignited in my son a love of weaponry; I was curious, that is, as to how he would react to the walls of guns I imagined Toys \"R\" Us displaying.

The aisle did, admittedly, have the Nerf Zombie Strike Doominator and the Nerf Modulus Recon MKII for $34.99 each. Those certainly sounded grim, given the eternal war against the undead, but the bright orange, cartoonish, completely unrealistic \"blasters\" on display and marketed to kids \"eight and up\" seemed distant indeed from American gun carnage (and our wars in distant lands), nor was there anything on the packaging that even hinted at real people getting shot in real encounters or real wars. I must admit that I don't like the idea of Seamus shooting anything at anyone-even a brain-hungry zombie-but as it turned out, I needn't have worried, not this time around anyway. Zombie-killing wasn't in his wheelhouse. Still, I kept looking for the real gun aisle, and I did come across more blasters, dart shooters, and the like, none with the word \"gun\" on them. Of course, we do live in Connecticut, less than 100 miles from Newtown where, in 2012, Adam Lanza, a devotee of violent video games who grew up in a gun-filled house , killed 20 kids just a little older than Seamus along with six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. So maybe our local toy outlet was being sensitive, but I doubt it. There was the Halo UNSC SMG Blaster (the initials make it sound extra tough but stand for nothing) for $19.99, and the NERF Star Wars Episode VII First Order Stormtrooper Deluxe Blaster , which fires 12 darts up to 65 feet without reloading, for $41.99. The worst thing I could find was the Xploderz Mayhem , with \"more distance, more ammo,\" which shoots easy-to-wash off mini-water pellets. It was on clearance for $18.89. By then, Seamus was pulling me frantically toward the aisle with the full Frozen franchise on display. Madeline was now awake and in heaven. So I left them there briefly and snuck off to do a last check for \"real\" toy guns. No such luck. I didn't find the kind of Airsoft gun Tamir Rice was playing with when he was killed. I didn't find an ersatz Sig Sauer either. It turns out that most brick-and-mortar toy stores don't seem to offer realistic-looking toy weaponry anymore, nor is there the toy store equivalent of the curtained-off area in the old neighborhood video rental shop where the porn was available. For such toys, you have to turn to an online world of websites like Kids-Army.com , where you can indeed buy realistic-looking toy rifles, shotguns, and pistols, or even to Amazon, where you can find an Airsoft version of the Sig Sauer rifle for $249.99. \"Start Them Young\" The National Rifle Association (NRA) would undoubtedly have been disappointed by my local Toys \"R\" Us outlet-just as its officials undoubtedly are by the way most big toy merchants seem to have left their more realistic guns for the online world. This happened, in part, in response to the sort of social pressure that my husband engaged in when in high school and-more critically-the almost routine horror of the blurred line between toy guns and real ones. You know we're a quirky, gun-crazy nation when Cleveland could ban toy guns and umbrellas with pointy tips from the area around the Republican Convention in the name of security, but couldn't keep out the real guns in open-carry Ohio. The NRA wants kids to play with realistic toy guns and BB guns, since they believe that such toys are part of a child's initiation into the future ownership of perfectly real guns. At the moment, the gun lobby is concerned that not enough people have guns-even though the 270 million to 310 million of them already amassed around this country (according to the Pew Research Center ) could arm just about every man, woman, transgendered person, and child around. Still, despite the fact that Americans can now carry guns in all 50 states and the NRA continues to win most of the big political fights, the number of households with guns is actually down from its peak in the late 1960s (though those that are armed have more and deadlier weapons than ever before). No wonder the gun industry and the gun lobby are fighting to produce an army of toddlers. \" Start Them Young ,\" a February 2016 report from the Violence Policy Center, details how gun manufacturers and the NRA are eager to market real guns to younger and younger consumers. The report starts with a selection of quotes from the industry, including this gem from Craig Cushman, marketing director for T h ompson/Center Arms , about their Hot Shot rifle for kids: \"[We're] talking about a tiny gun intended for the very youngest shooters-the ultimate first gun. We're targeting the six- to 12-year-old range.\" In other words, kids are literally in their sights. It's a strange world we live in. The toy industry has puffed up and candy-colored its play guns, turned up the volume on the violence online and in video games, and wrapped everything in plastic and safety warnings. At the same time, the gun industry is making its guns smaller and cuter for kids, while putting its energy into the all-important junior market. Can we be safe-any of us-in a nation awash in guns? The gun-and-ammo industry boasted $16 billion in revenue for 2015. Gun stores-from brick-and-mortar shops to online retailers-had $3.1 billion in revenue that same year. The industry as a whole claimed responsibility for nearly $50 billion in \"economic activity\" in 2015 alone. That represents a fair number of jobs, but here is the number that really goes boom: $229 billion. That's the annual cost of fatal and non-fatal gun violence in this country, according to Mother Jones and analyst Ted Miller of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, who teamed up to crunch the numbers. That figure includes both the direct costs of gun injuries and deaths-police investigations, emergency personnel, hospital bills, long-term care for the injured, funeral expenses for the dead, and the costs of prosecuting and imprisoning the perpetrators. As the report concludes: \"Even before accounting for the more intangible costs of the violence... the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America is nearly $400,000. And we pay for 32 of them every single day.\" We are awash in guns. Where does it end? Gun violence is embedded in our national mythology, our foreign policy, our notions of masculinity, our entertainment industry, and our children's play. We see violence solving problems on every screen-from the zombie apocalypse to the rise of ISIS. Russian playwright Anton Chekhov's maxim still applies: \"One should not put a loaded rifle onto the stage if no one is thinking of firing it.\" Sooner or later, that rifle is sure to go off. It might be an accident; it might be terrorism; it might be hate. But it will go off. Somewhere, as you read this, it's going off right now. I don't want to police my kids' imagination. And there is a whole strain of parenting literature that assures me that I don't have to. It says don't interfere with your kid's play, even if it includes guns and shooting and killing. Imagination is imagination and the violence isn't real. It might even, so this line of thinking goes, be a healthy way for them to process feelings of aggression. I get what they're saying, but it seems like a cop-out to me. To my mind, nonintervention is often a missed opportunity to be a parent. Sure, the violence isn't real. The pow-pows don't actually rip skin and tendon or stop hearts from beating, but the United States, which has been fighting distant wars nonstop for 15 years now, does have a violence problem and a man problem and a gun problem. We know where that problem ends, but it starts somewhere, too. One place to begin to look, at least, is at how our kids-particularly our boys-play, and how they are nurtured (or not), and taught to express their emotions (or not). It is, at least in part, up to us, their parents, to decide whether they are going to be the ones who help repair our society and reorient us (or not). And it begins with the kinds of care and love they receive, the kinds of conversations they are invited into, the kinds of expectations they are given about behavior and relationships. I don't want to raise Seamus, Madeline, or Rosena in the austere, ripped from the headlines of horror, polemical atmosphere that was the essence of my own childhood. But I don't want them to get comfortable with killing either. I want so much more for, and from, my little boy than \"Pow, pow, yous are dead now!\" And that starts with taking the gun or the stick or the rainbow flag out of his hands, sitting him down, and having a hard conversation about what guns actually do to people-and how much killing hurts us all.\n\nOur inner city Baltimore neighborhood, where crack cocaine madness was just taking hold, drove that point home on a micro level. Our house was robbed at gunpoint more than once-and we had so little worth taking. We watched a man across the street bleed to death after being stabbed repeatedly in a fight over nothing. People from our house ran to help and were there for far too long before an ambulance even arrived. We knew as little kids that violence was no laughing matter, nor child's play. It was serious business and was to be resisted. As parents tend to do, Patrick and I are passing this tradition on to our kids, hopefully without the emotional scarring that went with our childhoods of resistance. They don't have guns or action figures or any other toy implements of death. Still, we've been watching Seamus, our Team Elsa (from the Disney blockbuster Frozen ) son, as he's recently begun turning every stick into an imaginary gun. This is, of course, happening just as, in the headlines of the moment, actual guns are turning so many previously real people into statistics. Under the circumstances, how could I not find myself thinking about toy guns, real guns, the nature of play, the role of imagination, the place of parents, and how to (or whether to) police (ha!) that imaginary play? When my stepdaughter Rosena was about four, she found a toy dagger at the playground, somehow smuggled it home, and was stabbing one of her beloved stuffed animals, a bunny, repeatedly with it. In the other room, I could hear the thumps on the bedroom floor and called out, \"What are you doing?\" \"Stabbin' my bunny. I kilt her,\" she responded matter-of-factly. Seizing a \"teaching moment\" and undoubtedly gripped by my own childhood experiences and memories of my parents, I blustered into the bedroom with a shoebox. \"Now, your bunny is dead,\" I announced in my version of over-the-top momism. \"You know what happens when living things die, right? It's forever, right? Now, we have to bury her.\" Rosena and I then \"buried\" the doll on a high shelf in her closet. I told her that we cannot hurt or kill the things (or people) we love. I told her that, because she had \"killed\" that bunny, she could never play with it again. About a week later, I slipped it back into her toy basket and, when she asked why, assured her that I thought she wouldn't hurt her toys like that again. She agreed. I recall that episode now with a certain embarrassment, but when I recently heard Rosena explaining death and loss to her little brother and sister, I thought: Oh, maybe the drama of the shoebox burial was actually helpful in some fashion. Toys matter. We've put a fair amount of thought into what might be called toy curation in our household. We've bought nothing new and little used. Mostly, we've accepted shipments of hand-me-downs from friends who just wanted \"this crap\" out of their houses. No guns came with them, thankfully. After all, even toy guns can mean death under the wrong circumstances. A year ago, I visited the Cuddell Recreation Center in Cleveland with my daughter Madeline and a group of friends. That broad stretch of ball fields and paths, anchored by a gazebo and a playground, was where 12-year-old Tamir Rice was fatally shot by Officer Timothy Loehmann in November 2014. Rice, an African American, was playing with an Airsoft pellet gun that a friend's dad had bought at Walmart . A replica of an actual Colt pistol, it shot plastic pellets and looked pretty real, since the orange tip signifying \"toy\" was missing. However, Officer Loehmann, investigating a report that a man was carrying a gun in the park, was moving too fast to notice much. He sped up and began shooting even before his squad car stopped moving. Rice's hands were still reportedly in his pockets. Though Loehmann was not indicted, the city of Cleveland paid a $6 million settlement to the Rice family and demolished the gazebo where the boy was shot. In the park that day, local activists described the shooting and its aftermath to our group. Half listening, I followed Madeline as she toddled into the playground. I tried to imagine Samaria Rice's pain in this unremarkable place made part shrine, part soapbox by a police officer's quick trigger finger, racism, and her son's blood. I thought about that toy gun in Tamir Rice's hand and what might have been going through his head as he pointed it and played with it. Despite the age difference, it couldn't have been that far from what regularly goes through my son's head when he picks up a stick and points it: pop, boom, wow! The difference, of course, is that Seamus, blond and freckled and unmistakably white, would run little risk of being shot down by a policeman, even eight years from now with a replica toy gun in his hands. Blasters, Blasters, Everywhere Toys are a big business in this country, raking in $19.4 billion in 2015, according to the retail tracking firm NPD Group . Our family is not responsible for even a dime of this. Not surprisingly, then, my announcement that we were all going to spend a rainy afternoon at a local Toys \"R\" Us store came like a bolt from the blue for the kids. I wanted to see what kind of toy weaponry was for sale there. I was curious, among other things, about whether the boys at school who had taught Seamus about superheroes, bad guys, and Star Wars had ignited in my son a love of weaponry; I was curious, that is, as to how he would react to the walls of guns I imagined Toys \"R\" Us displaying. We got into our car as if it were Christmas Eve, Seamus beside himself with excitement, Madeline on a contact high from her brother. I was experiencing my own contact high, taking my kids on their first research trip. What we found was not exactly what I expected-on many levels. Seamus was quickly overwhelmed by the glut of everything-lots of pictures of toys on boxes, but not a lot to pick up. (It was, in that sense, the very opposite of our visits to the Goodwill store, where you can sit on the floor and play with all those second-hand toys as long as you put them back afterwards.) Not so surprisingly, in retrospect, he went straight for what was familiar, what he could grab in his hand and actually look at: the books. It took some effort to wrestle him away from Five Stories About Princesses and enlist him in my quest for bad toys. (Madeline had, by then, fallen asleep.) I had finally found the Nerf \"blasters,\" but he wasn't interested. \"Let's not go down this aisle, okay, Mom?\" I was, of course, looking for the worst of the worst when it came to weaponry, but it proved remarkably hard to find.

Still, despite the fact that Americans can now carry guns in all 50 states and the NRA continues to win most of the big political fights, the number of households with guns is actually down from its peak in the late 1960s (though those that are armed have more and deadlier weapons than ever before). No wonder the gun industry and the gun lobby are fighting to produce an army of toddlers. \" Start Them Young ,\" a February 2016 report from the Violence Policy Center, details how gun manufacturers and the NRA are eager to market real guns to younger and younger consumers. The report starts with a selection of quotes from the industry, including this gem from Craig Cushman, marketing director for T h ompson/Center Arms , about their Hot Shot rifle for kids: \"[We're] talking about a tiny gun intended for the very youngest shooters-the ultimate first gun. We're targeting the six- to 12-year-old range.\" In other words, kids are literally in their sights. It's a strange world we live in. The toy industry has puffed up and candy-colored its play guns, turned up the volume on the violence online and in video games, and wrapped everything in plastic and safety warnings. At the same time, the gun industry is making its guns smaller and cuter for kids, while putting its energy into the all-important junior market. Can we be safe-any of us-in a nation awash in guns? The gun-and-ammo industry boasted $16 billion in revenue for 2015. Gun stores-from brick-and-mortar shops to online retailers-had $3.1 billion in revenue that same year. The industry as a whole claimed responsibility for nearly $50 billion in \"economic activity\" in 2015 alone. That represents a fair number of jobs, but here is the number that really goes boom: $229 billion. That's the annual cost of fatal and non-fatal gun violence in this country, according to Mother Jones and analyst Ted Miller of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, who teamed up to crunch the numbers. That figure includes both the direct costs of gun injuries and deaths-police investigations, emergency personnel, hospital bills, long-term care for the injured, funeral expenses for the dead, and the costs of prosecuting and imprisoning the perpetrators. As the report concludes: \"Even before accounting for the more intangible costs of the violence... the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America is nearly $400,000. And we pay for 32 of them every single day.\" We are awash in guns. Where does it end? Gun violence is embedded in our national mythology, our foreign policy, our notions of masculinity, our entertainment industry, and our children's play. We see violence solving problems on every screen-from the zombie apocalypse to the rise of ISIS. Russian playwright Anton Chekhov's maxim still applies: \"One should not put a loaded rifle onto the stage if no one is thinking of firing it.\" Sooner or later, that rifle is sure to go off. It might be an accident; it might be terrorism; it might be hate. But it will go off. Somewhere, as you read this, it's going off right now. I don't want to police my kids' imagination. And there is a whole strain of parenting literature that assures me that I don't have to. It says don't interfere with your kid's play, even if it includes guns and shooting and killing. Imagination is imagination and the violence isn't real. It might even, so this line of thinking goes, be a healthy way for them to process feelings of aggression. I get what they're saying, but it seems like a cop-out to me. To my mind, nonintervention is often a missed opportunity to be a parent. Sure, the violence isn't real. The pow-pows don't actually rip skin and tendon or stop hearts from beating, but the United States, which has been fighting distant wars nonstop for 15 years now, does have a violence problem and a man problem and a gun problem. We know where that problem ends, but it starts somewhere, too. One place to begin to look, at least, is at how our kids-particularly our boys-play, and how they are nurtured (or not), and taught to express their emotions (or not). It is, at least in part, up to us, their parents, to decide whether they are going to be the ones who help repair our society and reorient us (or not). And it begins with the kinds of care and love they receive, the kinds of conversations they are invited into, the kinds of expectations they are given about behavior and relationships. I don't want to raise Seamus, Madeline, or Rosena in the austere, ripped from the headlines of horror, polemical atmosphere that was the essence of my own childhood. But I don't want them to get comfortable with killing either. I want so much more for, and from, my little boy than \"Pow, pow, yous are dead now!\" And that starts with taking the gun or the stick or the rainbow flag out of his hands, sitting him down, and having a hard conversation about what guns actually do to people-and how much killing hurts us all.\n\nWhen my stepdaughter Rosena was about four, she found a toy dagger at the playground, somehow smuggled it home, and was stabbing one of her beloved stuffed animals, a bunny, repeatedly with it. In the other room, I could hear the thumps on the bedroom floor and called out, \"What are you doing?\" \"Stabbin' my bunny. I kilt her,\" she responded matter-of-factly. Seizing a \"teaching moment\" and undoubtedly gripped by my own childhood experiences and memories of my parents, I blustered into the bedroom with a shoebox. \"Now, your bunny is dead,\" I announced in my version of over-the-top momism. \"You know what happens when living things die, right? It's forever, right? Now, we have to bury her.\" Rosena and I then \"buried\" the doll on a high shelf in her closet. I told her that we cannot hurt or kill the things (or people) we love. I told her that, because she had \"killed\" that bunny, she could never play with it again. About a week later, I slipped it back into her toy basket and, when she asked why, assured her that I thought she wouldn't hurt her toys like that again. She agreed. I recall that episode now with a certain embarrassment, but when I recently heard Rosena explaining death and loss to her little brother and sister, I thought: Oh, maybe the drama of the shoebox burial was actually helpful in some fashion. Toys matter. We've put a fair amount of thought into what might be called toy curation in our household. We've bought nothing new and little used. Mostly, we've accepted shipments of hand-me-downs from friends who just wanted \"this crap\" out of their houses. No guns came with them, thankfully. After all, even toy guns can mean death under the wrong circumstances. A year ago, I visited the Cuddell Recreation Center in Cleveland with my daughter Madeline and a group of friends. That broad stretch of ball fields and paths, anchored by a gazebo and a playground, was where 12-year-old Tamir Rice was fatally shot by Officer Timothy Loehmann in November 2014. Rice, an African American, was playing with an Airsoft pellet gun that a friend's dad had bought at Walmart . A replica of an actual Colt pistol, it shot plastic pellets and looked pretty real, since the orange tip signifying \"toy\" was missing. However, Officer Loehmann, investigating a report that a man was carrying a gun in the park, was moving too fast to notice much. He sped up and began shooting even before his squad car stopped moving. Rice's hands were still reportedly in his pockets. Though Loehmann was not indicted, the city of Cleveland paid a $6 million settlement to the Rice family and demolished the gazebo where the boy was shot. In the park that day, local activists described the shooting and its aftermath to our group. Half listening, I followed Madeline as she toddled into the playground. I tried to imagine Samaria Rice's pain in this unremarkable place made part shrine, part soapbox by a police officer's quick trigger finger, racism, and her son's blood. I thought about that toy gun in Tamir Rice's hand and what might have been going through his head as he pointed it and played with it. Despite the age difference, it couldn't have been that far from what regularly goes through my son's head when he picks up a stick and points it: pop, boom, wow! The difference, of course, is that Seamus, blond and freckled and unmistakably white, would run little risk of being shot down by a policeman, even eight years from now with a replica toy gun in his hands. Blasters, Blasters, Everywhere Toys are a big business in this country, raking in $19.4 billion in 2015, according to the retail tracking firm NPD Group . Our family is not responsible for even a dime of this. Not surprisingly, then, my announcement that we were all going to spend a rainy afternoon at a local Toys \"R\" Us store came like a bolt from the blue for the kids. I wanted to see what kind of toy weaponry was for sale there. I was curious, among other things, about whether the boys at school who had taught Seamus about superheroes, bad guys, and Star Wars had ignited in my son a love of weaponry; I was curious, that is, as to how he would react to the walls of guns I imagined Toys \"R\" Us displaying. We got into our car as if it were Christmas Eve, Seamus beside himself with excitement, Madeline on a contact high from her brother. I was experiencing my own contact high, taking my kids on their first research trip. What we found was not exactly what I expected-on many levels. Seamus was quickly overwhelmed by the glut of everything-lots of pictures of toys on boxes, but not a lot to pick up. (It was, in that sense, the very opposite of our visits to the Goodwill store, where you can sit on the floor and play with all those second-hand toys as long as you put them back afterwards.) Not so surprisingly, in retrospect, he went straight for what was familiar, what he could grab in his hand and actually look at: the books. It took some effort to wrestle him away from Five Stories About Princesses and enlist him in my quest for bad toys. (Madeline had, by then, fallen asleep.) I had finally found the Nerf \"blasters,\" but he wasn't interested. \"Let's not go down this aisle, okay, Mom?\" I was, of course, looking for the worst of the worst when it came to weaponry, but it proved remarkably hard to find. The aisle did, admittedly, have the Nerf Zombie Strike Doominator and the Nerf Modulus Recon MKII for $34.99 each. Those certainly sounded grim, given the eternal war against the undead, but the bright orange, cartoonish, completely unrealistic \"blasters\" on display and marketed to kids \"eight and up\" seemed distant indeed from American gun carnage (and our wars in distant lands), nor was there anything on the packaging that even hinted at real people getting shot in real encounters or real wars. I must admit that I don't like the idea of Seamus shooting anything at anyone-even a brain-hungry zombie-but as it turned out, I needn't have worried, not this time around anyway. Zombie-killing wasn't in his wheelhouse. Still, I kept looking for the real gun aisle, and I did come across more blasters, dart shooters, and the like, none with the word \"gun\" on them. Of course, we do live in Connecticut, less than 100 miles from Newtown where, in 2012, Adam Lanza, a devotee of violent video games who grew up in a gun-filled house , killed 20 kids just a little older than Seamus along with six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. So maybe our local toy outlet was being sensitive, but I doubt it. There was the Halo UNSC SMG Blaster (the initials make it sound extra tough but stand for nothing) for $19.99, and the NERF Star Wars Episode VII First Order Stormtrooper Deluxe Blaster , which fires 12 darts up to 65 feet without reloading, for $41.99. The worst thing I could find was the Xploderz Mayhem , with \"more distance, more ammo,\" which shoots easy-to-wash off mini-water pellets. It was on clearance for $18.89. By then, Seamus was pulling me frantically toward the aisle with the full Frozen franchise on display. Madeline was now awake and in heaven. So I left them there briefly and snuck off to do a last check for \"real\" toy guns. No such luck. I didn't find the kind of Airsoft gun Tamir Rice was playing with when he was killed. I didn't find an ersatz Sig Sauer either. It turns out that most brick-and-mortar toy stores don't seem to offer realistic-looking toy weaponry anymore, nor is there the toy store equivalent of the curtained-off area in the old neighborhood video rental shop where the porn was available. For such toys, you have to turn to an online world of websites like Kids-Army.com , where you can indeed buy realistic-looking toy rifles, shotguns, and pistols, or even to Amazon, where you can find an Airsoft version of the Sig Sauer rifle for $249.99. \"Start Them Young\" The National Rifle Association (NRA) would undoubtedly have been disappointed by my local Toys \"R\" Us outlet-just as its officials undoubtedly are by the way most big toy merchants seem to have left their more realistic guns for the online world. This happened, in part, in response to the sort of social pressure that my husband engaged in when in high school and-more critically-the almost routine horror of the blurred line between toy guns and real ones. You know we're a quirky, gun-crazy nation when Cleveland could ban toy guns and umbrellas with pointy tips from the area around the Republican Convention in the name of security, but couldn't keep out the real guns in open-carry Ohio. The NRA wants kids to play with realistic toy guns and BB guns, since they believe that such toys are part of a child's initiation into the future ownership of perfectly real guns. At the moment, the gun lobby is concerned that not enough people have guns-even though the 270 million to 310 million of them already amassed around this country (according to the Pew Research Center ) could arm just about every man, woman, transgendered person, and child around.

I recall that episode now with a certain embarrassment, but when I recently heard Rosena explaining death and loss to her little brother and sister, I thought: Oh, maybe the drama of the shoebox burial was actually helpful in some fashion. Toys matter. We've put a fair amount of thought into what might be called toy curation in our household. We've bought nothing new and little used. Mostly, we've accepted shipments of hand-me-downs from friends who just wanted \"this crap\" out of their houses. No guns came with them, thankfully. After all, even toy guns can mean death under the wrong circumstances. A year ago, I visited the Cuddell Recreation Center in Cleveland with my daughter Madeline and a group of friends. That broad stretch of ball fields and paths, anchored by a gazebo and a playground, was where 12-year-old Tamir Rice was fatally shot by Officer Timothy Loehmann in November 2014. Rice, an African American, was playing with an Airsoft pellet gun that a friend's dad had bought at Walmart . A replica of an actual Colt pistol, it shot plastic pellets and looked pretty real, since the orange tip signifying \"toy\" was missing. However, Officer Loehmann, investigating a report that a man was carrying a gun in the park, was moving too fast to notice much. He sped up and began shooting even before his squad car stopped moving. Rice's hands were still reportedly in his pockets. Though Loehmann was not indicted, the city of Cleveland paid a $6 million settlement to the Rice family and demolished the gazebo where the boy was shot. In the park that day, local activists described the shooting and its aftermath to our group. Half listening, I followed Madeline as she toddled into the playground. I tried to imagine Samaria Rice's pain in this unremarkable place made part shrine, part soapbox by a police officer's quick trigger finger, racism, and her son's blood. I thought about that toy gun in Tamir Rice's hand and what might have been going through his head as he pointed it and played with it. Despite the age difference, it couldn't have been that far from what regularly goes through my son's head when he picks up a stick and points it: pop, boom, wow! The difference, of course, is that Seamus, blond and freckled and unmistakably white, would run little risk of being shot down by a policeman, even eight years from now with a replica toy gun in his hands. Blasters, Blasters, Everywhere Toys are a big business in this country, raking in $19.4 billion in 2015, according to the retail tracking firm NPD Group . Our family is not responsible for even a dime of this. Not surprisingly, then, my announcement that we were all going to spend a rainy afternoon at a local Toys \"R\" Us store came like a bolt from the blue for the kids. I wanted to see what kind of toy weaponry was for sale there. I was curious, among other things, about whether the boys at school who had taught Seamus about superheroes, bad guys, and Star Wars had ignited in my son a love of weaponry; I was curious, that is, as to how he would react to the walls of guns I imagined Toys \"R\" Us displaying. We got into our car as if it were Christmas Eve, Seamus beside himself with excitement, Madeline on a contact high from her brother. I was experiencing my own contact high, taking my kids on their first research trip. What we found was not exactly what I expected-on many levels. Seamus was quickly overwhelmed by the glut of everything-lots of pictures of toys on boxes, but not a lot to pick up. (It was, in that sense, the very opposite of our visits to the Goodwill store, where you can sit on the floor and play with all those second-hand toys as long as you put them back afterwards.) Not so surprisingly, in retrospect, he went straight for what was familiar, what he could grab in his hand and actually look at: the books. It took some effort to wrestle him away from Five Stories About Princesses and enlist him in my quest for bad toys. (Madeline had, by then, fallen asleep.) I had finally found the Nerf \"blasters,\" but he wasn't interested. \"Let's not go down this aisle, okay, Mom?\" I was, of course, looking for the worst of the worst when it came to weaponry, but it proved remarkably hard to find. The aisle did, admittedly, have the Nerf Zombie Strike Doominator and the Nerf Modulus Recon MKII for $34.99 each. Those certainly sounded grim, given the eternal war against the undead, but the bright orange, cartoonish, completely unrealistic \"blasters\" on display and marketed to kids \"eight and up\" seemed distant indeed from American gun carnage (and our wars in distant lands), nor was there anything on the packaging that even hinted at real people getting shot in real encounters or real wars. I must admit that I don't like the idea of Seamus shooting anything at anyone-even a brain-hungry zombie-but as it turned out, I needn't have worried, not this time around anyway. Zombie-killing wasn't in his wheelhouse. Still, I kept looking for the real gun aisle, and I did come across more blasters, dart shooters, and the like, none with the word \"gun\" on them. Of course, we do live in Connecticut, less than 100 miles from Newtown where, in 2012, Adam Lanza, a devotee of violent video games who grew up in a gun-filled house , killed 20 kids just a little older than Seamus along with six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. So maybe our local toy outlet was being sensitive, but I doubt it. There was the Halo UNSC SMG Blaster (the initials make it sound extra tough but stand for nothing) for $19.99, and the NERF Star Wars Episode VII First Order Stormtrooper Deluxe Blaster , which fires 12 darts up to 65 feet without reloading, for $41.99. The worst thing I could find was the Xploderz Mayhem , with \"more distance, more ammo,\" which shoots easy-to-wash off mini-water pellets. It was on clearance for $18.89. By then, Seamus was pulling me frantically toward the aisle with the full Frozen franchise on display. Madeline was now awake and in heaven. So I left them there briefly and snuck off to do a last check for \"real\" toy guns. No such luck. I didn't find the kind of Airsoft gun Tamir Rice was playing with when he was killed. I didn't find an ersatz Sig Sauer either. It turns out that most brick-and-mortar toy stores don't seem to offer realistic-looking toy weaponry anymore, nor is there the toy store equivalent of the curtained-off area in the old neighborhood video rental shop where the porn was available. For such toys, you have to turn to an online world of websites like Kids-Army.com , where you can indeed buy realistic-looking toy rifles, shotguns, and pistols, or even to Amazon, where you can find an Airsoft version of the Sig Sauer rifle for $249.99. \"Start Them Young\" The National Rifle Association (NRA) would undoubtedly have been disappointed by my local Toys \"R\" Us outlet-just as its officials undoubtedly are by the way most big toy merchants seem to have left their more realistic guns for the online world. This happened, in part, in response to the sort of social pressure that my husband engaged in when in high school and-more critically-the almost routine horror of the blurred line between toy guns and real ones. You know we're a quirky, gun-crazy nation when Cleveland could ban toy guns and umbrellas with pointy tips from the area around the Republican Convention in the name of security, but couldn't keep out the real guns in open-carry Ohio. The NRA wants kids to play with realistic toy guns and BB guns, since they believe that such toys are part of a child's initiation into the future ownership of perfectly real guns. At the moment, the gun lobby is concerned that not enough people have guns-even though the 270 million to 310 million of them already amassed around this country (according to the Pew Research Center ) could arm just about every man, woman, transgendered person, and child around. Still, despite the fact that Americans can now carry guns in all 50 states and the NRA continues to win most of the big political fights, the number of households with guns is actually down from its peak in the late 1960s (though those that are armed have more and deadlier weapons than ever before). No wonder the gun industry and the gun lobby are fighting to produce an army of toddlers. \" Start Them Young ,\" a February 2016 report from the Violence Policy Center, details how gun manufacturers and the NRA are eager to market real guns to younger and younger consumers. The report starts with a selection of quotes from the industry, including this gem from Craig Cushman, marketing director for T h ompson/Center Arms , about their Hot Shot rifle for kids: \"[We're] talking about a tiny gun intended for the very youngest shooters-the ultimate first gun. We're targeting the six- to 12-year-old range.\" In other words, kids are literally in their sights. It's a strange world we live in. The toy industry has puffed up and candy-colored its play guns, turned up the volume on the violence online and in video games, and wrapped everything in plastic and safety warnings. At the same time, the gun industry is making its guns smaller and cuter for kids, while putting its energy into the all-important junior market. Can we be safe-any of us-in a nation awash in guns? The gun-and-ammo industry boasted $16 billion in revenue for 2015. Gun stores-from brick-and-mortar shops to online retailers-had $3.1 billion in revenue that same year. The industry as a whole claimed responsibility for nearly $50 billion in \"economic activity\" in 2015 alone. That represents a fair number of jobs, but here is the number that really goes boom: $229 billion. That's the annual cost of fatal and non-fatal gun violence in this country, according to Mother Jones and analyst Ted Miller of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, who teamed up to crunch the numbers. That figure includes both the direct costs of gun injuries and deaths-police investigations, emergency personnel, hospital bills, long-term care for the injured, funeral expenses for the dead, and the costs of prosecuting and imprisoning the perpetrators. As the report concludes: \"Even before accounting for the more intangible costs of the violence... the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America is nearly $400,000. And we pay for 32 of them every single day.\" We are awash in guns. Where does it end? Gun violence is embedded in our national mythology, our foreign policy, our notions of masculinity, our entertainment industry, and our children's play. We see violence solving problems on every screen-from the zombie apocalypse to the rise of ISIS. Russian playwright Anton Chekhov's maxim still applies: \"One should not put a loaded rifle onto the stage if no one is thinking of firing it.\" Sooner or later, that rifle is sure to go off. It might be an accident; it might be terrorism; it might be hate. But it will go off. Somewhere, as you read this, it's going off right now. I don't want to police my kids' imagination. And there is a whole strain of parenting literature that assures me that I don't have to. It says don't interfere with your kid's play, even if it includes guns and shooting and killing. Imagination is imagination and the violence isn't real. It might even, so this line of thinking goes, be a healthy way for them to process feelings of aggression. I get what they're saying, but it seems like a cop-out to me. To my mind, nonintervention is often a missed opportunity to be a parent. Sure, the violence isn't real. The pow-pows don't actually rip skin and tendon or stop hearts from beating, but the United States, which has been fighting distant wars nonstop for 15 years now, does have a violence problem and a man problem and a gun problem. We know where that problem ends, but it starts somewhere, too. One place to begin to look, at least, is at how our kids-particularly our boys-play, and how they are nurtured (or not), and taught to express their emotions (or not). It is, at least in part, up to us, their parents, to decide whether they are going to be the ones who help repair our society and reorient us (or not). And it begins with the kinds of care and love they receive, the kinds of conversations they are invited into, the kinds of expectations they are given about behavior and relationships. I don't want to raise Seamus, Madeline, or Rosena in the austere, ripped from the headlines of horror, polemical atmosphere that was the essence of my own childhood. But I don't want them to get comfortable with killing either. I want so much more for, and from, my little boy than \"Pow, pow, yous are dead now!\" And that starts with taking the gun or the stick or the rainbow flag out of his hands, sitting him down, and having a hard conversation about what guns actually do to people-and how much killing hurts us all.\n\nSeizing a \"teaching moment\" and undoubtedly gripped by my own childhood experiences and memories of my parents, I blustered into the bedroom with a shoebox. \"Now, your bunny is dead,\" I announced in my version of over-the-top momism. \"You know what happens when living things die, right? It's forever, right? Now, we have to bury her.\" Rosena and I then \"buried\" the doll on a high shelf in her closet. I told her that we cannot hurt or kill the things (or people) we love. I told her that, because she had \"killed\" that bunny, she could never play with it again. About a week later, I slipped it back into her toy basket and, when she asked why, assured her that I thought she wouldn't hurt her toys like that again. She agreed. I recall that episode now with a certain embarrassment, but when I recently heard Rosena explaining death and loss to her little brother and sister, I thought: Oh, maybe the drama of the shoebox burial was actually helpful in some fashion. Toys matter. We've put a fair amount of thought into what might be called toy curation in our household. We've bought nothing new and little used. Mostly, we've accepted shipments of hand-me-downs from friends who just wanted \"this crap\" out of their houses. No guns came with them, thankfully.

You know we're a quirky, gun-crazy nation when Cleveland could ban toy guns and umbrellas with pointy tips from the area around the Republican Convention in the name of security, but couldn't keep out the real guns in open-carry Ohio. The NRA wants kids to play with realistic toy guns and BB guns, since they believe that such toys are part of a child's initiation into the future ownership of perfectly real guns. At the moment, the gun lobby is concerned that not enough people have guns-even though the 270 million to 310 million of them already amassed around this country (according to the Pew Research Center ) could arm just about every man, woman, transgendered person, and child around. Still, despite the fact that Americans can now carry guns in all 50 states and the NRA continues to win most of the big political fights, the number of households with guns is actually down from its peak in the late 1960s (though those that are armed have more and deadlier weapons than ever before). No wonder the gun industry and the gun lobby are fighting to produce an army of toddlers. \" Start Them Young ,\" a February 2016 report from the Violence Policy Center, details how gun manufacturers and the NRA are eager to market real guns to younger and younger consumers. The report starts with a selection of quotes from the industry, including this gem from Craig Cushman, marketing director for T h ompson/Center Arms , about their Hot Shot rifle for kids: \"[We're] talking about a tiny gun intended for the very youngest shooters-the ultimate first gun. We're targeting the six- to 12-year-old range.\" In other words, kids are literally in their sights. It's a strange world we live in. The toy industry has puffed up and candy-colored its play guns, turned up the volume on the violence online and in video games, and wrapped everything in plastic and safety warnings. At the same time, the gun industry is making its guns smaller and cuter for kids, while putting its energy into the all-important junior market. Can we be safe-any of us-in a nation awash in guns? The gun-and-ammo industry boasted $16 billion in revenue for 2015. Gun stores-from brick-and-mortar shops to online retailers-had $3.1 billion in revenue that same year. The industry as a whole claimed responsibility for nearly $50 billion in \"economic activity\" in 2015 alone. That represents a fair number of jobs, but here is the number that really goes boom: $229 billion. That's the annual cost of fatal and non-fatal gun violence in this country, according to Mother Jones and analyst Ted Miller of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, who teamed up to crunch the numbers. That figure includes both the direct costs of gun injuries and deaths-police investigations, emergency personnel, hospital bills, long-term care for the injured, funeral expenses for the dead, and the costs of prosecuting and imprisoning the perpetrators. As the report concludes: \"Even before accounting for the more intangible costs of the violence... the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America is nearly $400,000. And we pay for 32 of them every single day.\" We are awash in guns. Where does it end? Gun violence is embedded in our national mythology, our foreign policy, our notions of masculinity, our entertainment industry, and our children's play. We see violence solving problems on every screen-from the zombie apocalypse to the rise of ISIS. Russian playwright Anton Chekhov's maxim still applies: \"One should not put a loaded rifle onto the stage if no one is thinking of firing it.\" Sooner or later, that rifle is sure to go off. It might be an accident; it might be terrorism; it might be hate. But it will go off. Somewhere, as you read this, it's going off right now. I don't want to police my kids' imagination. And there is a whole strain of parenting literature that assures me that I don't have to. It says don't interfere with your kid's play, even if it includes guns and shooting and killing. Imagination is imagination and the violence isn't real. It might even, so this line of thinking goes, be a healthy way for them to process feelings of aggression. I get what they're saying, but it seems like a cop-out to me. To my mind, nonintervention is often a missed opportunity to be a parent. Sure, the violence isn't real. The pow-pows don't actually rip skin and tendon or stop hearts from beating, but the United States, which has been fighting distant wars nonstop for 15 years now, does have a violence problem and a man problem and a gun problem. We know where that problem ends, but it starts somewhere, too. One place to begin to look, at least, is at how our kids-particularly our boys-play, and how they are nurtured (or not), and taught to express their emotions (or not). It is, at least in part, up to us, their parents, to decide whether they are going to be the ones who help repair our society and reorient us (or not). And it begins with the kinds of care and love they receive, the kinds of conversations they are invited into, the kinds of expectations they are given about behavior and relationships. I don't want to raise Seamus, Madeline, or Rosena in the austere, ripped from the headlines of horror, polemical atmosphere that was the essence of my own childhood. But I don't want them to get comfortable with killing either. I want so much more for, and from, my little boy than \"Pow, pow, yous are dead now!\" And that starts with taking the gun or the stick or the rainbow flag out of his hands, sitting him down, and having a hard conversation about what guns actually do to people-and how much killing hurts us all.\n\nToys matter. We've put a fair amount of thought into what might be called toy curation in our household. We've bought nothing new and little used. Mostly, we've accepted shipments of hand-me-downs from friends who just wanted \"this crap\" out of their houses. No guns came with them, thankfully. After all, even toy guns can mean death under the wrong circumstances. A year ago, I visited the Cuddell Recreation Center in Cleveland with my daughter Madeline and a group of friends. That broad stretch of ball fields and paths, anchored by a gazebo and a playground, was where 12-year-old Tamir Rice was fatally shot by Officer Timothy Loehmann in November 2014. Rice, an African American, was playing with an Airsoft pellet gun that a friend's dad had bought at Walmart . A replica of an actual Colt pistol, it shot plastic pellets and looked pretty real, since the orange tip signifying \"toy\" was missing. However, Officer Loehmann, investigating a report that a man was carrying a gun in the park, was moving too fast to notice much. He sped up and began shooting even before his squad car stopped moving. Rice's hands were still reportedly in his pockets. Though Loehmann was not indicted, the city of Cleveland paid a $6 million settlement to the Rice family and demolished the gazebo where the boy was shot. In the park that day, local activists described the shooting and its aftermath to our group. Half listening, I followed Madeline as she toddled into the playground. I tried to imagine Samaria Rice's pain in this unremarkable place made part shrine, part soapbox by a police officer's quick trigger finger, racism, and her son's blood. I thought about that toy gun in Tamir Rice's hand and what might have been going through his head as he pointed it and played with it. Despite the age difference, it couldn't have been that far from what regularly goes through my son's head when he picks up a stick and points it: pop, boom, wow! The difference, of course, is that Seamus, blond and freckled and unmistakably white, would run little risk of being shot down by a policeman, even eight years from now with a replica toy gun in his hands. Blasters, Blasters, Everywhere Toys are a big business in this country, raking in $19.4 billion in 2015, according to the retail tracking firm NPD Group . Our family is not responsible for even a dime of this. Not surprisingly, then, my announcement that we were all going to spend a rainy afternoon at a local Toys \"R\" Us store came like a bolt from the blue for the kids. I wanted to see what kind of toy weaponry was for sale there. I was curious, among other things, about whether the boys at school who had taught Seamus about superheroes, bad guys, and Star Wars had ignited in my son a love of weaponry; I was curious, that is, as to how he would react to the walls of guns I imagined Toys \"R\" Us displaying. We got into our car as if it were Christmas Eve, Seamus beside himself with excitement, Madeline on a contact high from her brother. I was experiencing my own contact high, taking my kids on their first research trip. What we found was not exactly what I expected-on many levels. Seamus was quickly overwhelmed by the glut of everything-lots of pictures of toys on boxes, but not a lot to pick up. (It was, in that sense, the very opposite of our visits to the Goodwill store, where you can sit on the floor and play with all those second-hand toys as long as you put them back afterwards.) Not so surprisingly, in retrospect, he went straight for what was familiar, what he could grab in his hand and actually look at: the books. It took some effort to wrestle him away from Five Stories About Princesses and enlist him in my quest for bad toys. (Madeline had, by then, fallen asleep.) I had finally found the Nerf \"blasters,\" but he wasn't interested. \"Let's not go down this aisle, okay, Mom?\" I was, of course, looking for the worst of the worst when it came to weaponry, but it proved remarkably hard to find. The aisle did, admittedly, have the Nerf Zombie Strike Doominator and the Nerf Modulus Recon MKII for $34.99 each. Those certainly sounded grim, given the eternal war against the undead, but the bright orange, cartoonish, completely unrealistic \"blasters\" on display and marketed to kids \"eight and up\" seemed distant indeed from American gun carnage (and our wars in distant lands), nor was there anything on the packaging that even hinted at real people getting shot in real encounters or real wars. I must admit that I don't like the idea of Seamus shooting anything at anyone-even a brain-hungry zombie-but as it turned out, I needn't have worried, not this time around anyway. Zombie-killing wasn't in his wheelhouse. Still, I kept looking for the real gun aisle, and I did come across more blasters, dart shooters, and the like, none with the word \"gun\" on them. Of course, we do live in Connecticut, less than 100 miles from Newtown where, in 2012, Adam Lanza, a devotee of violent video games who grew up in a gun-filled house , killed 20 kids just a little older than Seamus along with six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. So maybe our local toy outlet was being sensitive, but I doubt it. There was the Halo UNSC SMG Blaster (the initials make it sound extra tough but stand for nothing) for $19.99, and the NERF Star Wars Episode VII First Order Stormtrooper Deluxe Blaster , which fires 12 darts up to 65 feet without reloading, for $41.99. The worst thing I could find was the Xploderz Mayhem , with \"more distance, more ammo,\" which shoots easy-to-wash off mini-water pellets. It was on clearance for $18.89. By then, Seamus was pulling me frantically toward the aisle with the full Frozen franchise on display. Madeline was now awake and in heaven. So I left them there briefly and snuck off to do a last check for \"real\" toy guns. No such luck. I didn't find the kind of Airsoft gun Tamir Rice was playing with when he was killed. I didn't find an ersatz Sig Sauer either. It turns out that most brick-and-mortar toy stores don't seem to offer realistic-looking toy weaponry anymore, nor is there the toy store equivalent of the curtained-off area in the old neighborhood video rental shop where the porn was available. For such toys, you have to turn to an online world of websites like Kids-Army.com , where you can indeed buy realistic-looking toy rifles, shotguns, and pistols, or even to Amazon, where you can find an Airsoft version of the Sig Sauer rifle for $249.99. \"Start Them Young\" The National Rifle Association (NRA) would undoubtedly have been disappointed by my local Toys \"R\" Us outlet-just as its officials undoubtedly are by the way most big toy merchants seem to have left their more realistic guns for the online world.

Those certainly sounded grim, given the eternal war against the undead, but the bright orange, cartoonish, completely unrealistic \"blasters\" on display and marketed to kids \"eight and up\" seemed distant indeed from American gun carnage (and our wars in distant lands), nor was there anything on the packaging that even hinted at real people getting shot in real encounters or real wars. I must admit that I don't like the idea of Seamus shooting anything at anyone-even a brain-hungry zombie-but as it turned out, I needn't have worried, not this time around anyway. Zombie-killing wasn't in his wheelhouse. Still, I kept looking for the real gun aisle, and I did come across more blasters, dart shooters, and the like, none with the word \"gun\" on them. Of course, we do live in Connecticut, less than 100 miles from Newtown where, in 2012, Adam Lanza, a devotee of violent video games who grew up in a gun-filled house , killed 20 kids just a little older than Seamus along with six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. So maybe our local toy outlet was being sensitive, but I doubt it. There was the Halo UNSC SMG Blaster (the initials make it sound extra tough but stand for nothing) for $19.99, and the NERF Star Wars Episode VII First Order Stormtrooper Deluxe Blaster , which fires 12 darts up to 65 feet without reloading, for $41.99. The worst thing I could find was the Xploderz Mayhem , with \"more distance, more ammo,\" which shoots easy-to-wash off mini-water pellets. It was on clearance for $18.89. By then, Seamus was pulling me frantically toward the aisle with the full Frozen franchise on display. Madeline was now awake and in heaven. So I left them there briefly and snuck off to do a last check for \"real\" toy guns. No such luck. I didn't find the kind of Airsoft gun Tamir Rice was playing with when he was killed. I didn't find an ersatz Sig Sauer either. It turns out that most brick-and-mortar toy stores don't seem to offer realistic-looking toy weaponry anymore, nor is there the toy store equivalent of the curtained-off area in the old neighborhood video rental shop where the porn was available. For such toys, you have to turn to an online world of websites like Kids-Army.com , where you can indeed buy realistic-looking toy rifles, shotguns, and pistols, or even to Amazon, where you can find an Airsoft version of the Sig Sauer rifle for $249.99. \"Start Them Young\" The National Rifle Association (NRA) would undoubtedly have been disappointed by my local Toys \"R\" Us outlet-just as its officials undoubtedly are by the way most big toy merchants seem to have left their more realistic guns for the online world. This happened, in part, in response to the sort of social pressure that my husband engaged in when in high school and-more critically-the almost routine horror of the blurred line between toy guns and real ones. You know we're a quirky, gun-crazy nation when Cleveland could ban toy guns and umbrellas with pointy tips from the area around the Republican Convention in the name of security, but couldn't keep out the real guns in open-carry Ohio. The NRA wants kids to play with realistic toy guns and BB guns, since they believe that such toys are part of a child's initiation into the future ownership of perfectly real guns. At the moment, the gun lobby is concerned that not enough people have guns-even though the 270 million to 310 million of them already amassed around this country (according to the Pew Research Center ) could arm just about every man, woman, transgendered person, and child around. Still, despite the fact that Americans can now carry guns in all 50 states and the NRA continues to win most of the big political fights, the number of households with guns is actually down from its peak in the late 1960s (though those that are armed have more and deadlier weapons than ever before). No wonder the gun industry and the gun lobby are fighting to produce an army of toddlers. \" Start Them Young ,\" a February 2016 report from the Violence Policy Center, details how gun manufacturers and the NRA are eager to market real guns to younger and younger consumers. The report starts with a selection of quotes from the industry, including this gem from Craig Cushman, marketing director for T h ompson/Center Arms , about their Hot Shot rifle for kids: \"[We're] talking about a tiny gun intended for the very youngest shooters-the ultimate first gun. We're targeting the six- to 12-year-old range.\" In other words, kids are literally in their sights. It's a strange world we live in. The toy industry has puffed up and candy-colored its play guns, turned up the volume on the violence online and in video games, and wrapped everything in plastic and safety warnings. At the same time, the gun industry is making its guns smaller and cuter for kids, while putting its energy into the all-important junior market. Can we be safe-any of us-in a nation awash in guns? The gun-and-ammo industry boasted $16 billion in revenue for 2015. Gun stores-from brick-and-mortar shops to online retailers-had $3.1 billion in revenue that same year. The industry as a whole claimed responsibility for nearly $50 billion in \"economic activity\" in 2015 alone. That represents a fair number of jobs, but here is the number that really goes boom: $229 billion. That's the annual cost of fatal and non-fatal gun violence in this country, according to Mother Jones and analyst Ted Miller of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, who teamed up to crunch the numbers. That figure includes both the direct costs of gun injuries and deaths-police investigations, emergency personnel, hospital bills, long-term care for the injured, funeral expenses for the dead, and the costs of prosecuting and imprisoning the perpetrators. As the report concludes: \"Even before accounting for the more intangible costs of the violence... the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America is nearly $400,000. And we pay for 32 of them every single day.\" We are awash in guns. Where does it end? Gun violence is embedded in our national mythology, our foreign policy, our notions of masculinity, our entertainment industry, and our children's play. We see violence solving problems on every screen-from the zombie apocalypse to the rise of ISIS. Russian playwright Anton Chekhov's maxim still applies: \"One should not put a loaded rifle onto the stage if no one is thinking of firing it.\" Sooner or later, that rifle is sure to go off. It might be an accident; it might be terrorism; it might be hate. But it will go off. Somewhere, as you read this, it's going off right now. I don't want to police my kids' imagination. And there is a whole strain of parenting literature that assures me that I don't have to. It says don't interfere with your kid's play, even if it includes guns and shooting and killing. Imagination is imagination and the violence isn't real. It might even, so this line of thinking goes, be a healthy way for them to process feelings of aggression. I get what they're saying, but it seems like a cop-out to me. To my mind, nonintervention is often a missed opportunity to be a parent. Sure, the violence isn't real. The pow-pows don't actually rip skin and tendon or stop hearts from beating, but the United States, which has been fighting distant wars nonstop for 15 years now, does have a violence problem and a man problem and a gun problem. We know where that problem ends, but it starts somewhere, too. One place to begin to look, at least, is at how our kids-particularly our boys-play, and how they are nurtured (or not), and taught to express their emotions (or not). It is, at least in part, up to us, their parents, to decide whether they are going to be the ones who help repair our society and reorient us (or not). And it begins with the kinds of care and love they receive, the kinds of conversations they are invited into, the kinds of expectations they are given about behavior and relationships. I don't want to raise Seamus, Madeline, or Rosena in the austere, ripped from the headlines of horror, polemical atmosphere that was the essence of my own childhood. But I don't want them to get comfortable with killing either. I want so much more for, and from, my little boy than \"Pow, pow, yous are dead now!\" And that starts with taking the gun or the stick or the rainbow flag out of his hands, sitting him down, and having a hard conversation about what guns actually do to people-and how much killing hurts us all.\n\nI thought about that toy gun in Tamir Rice's hand and what might have been going through his head as he pointed it and played with it. Despite the age difference, it couldn't have been that far from what regularly goes through my son's head when he picks up a stick and points it: pop, boom, wow! The difference, of course, is that Seamus, blond and freckled and unmistakably white, would run little risk of being shot down by a policeman, even eight years from now with a replica toy gun in his hands. Blasters, Blasters, Everywhere Toys are a big business in this country, raking in $19.4 billion in 2015, according to the retail tracking firm NPD Group . Our family is not responsible for even a dime of this. Not surprisingly, then, my announcement that we were all going to spend a rainy afternoon at a local Toys \"R\" Us store came like a bolt from the blue for the kids. I wanted to see what kind of toy weaponry was for sale there. I was curious, among other things, about whether the boys at school who had taught Seamus about superheroes, bad guys, and Star Wars had ignited in my son a love of weaponry; I was curious, that is, as to how he would react to the walls of guns I imagined Toys \"R\" Us displaying. We got into our car as if it were Christmas Eve, Seamus beside himself with excitement, Madeline on a contact high from her brother. I was experiencing my own contact high, taking my kids on their first research trip. What we found was not exactly what I expected-on many levels. Seamus was quickly overwhelmed by the glut of everything-lots of pictures of toys on boxes, but not a lot to pick up. (It was, in that sense, the very opposite of our visits to the Goodwill store, where you can sit on the floor and play with all those second-hand toys as long as you put them back afterwards.) Not so surprisingly, in retrospect, he went straight for what was familiar, what he could grab in his hand and actually look at: the books. It took some effort to wrestle him away from Five Stories About Princesses and enlist him in my quest for bad toys. (Madeline had, by then, fallen asleep.) I had finally found the Nerf \"blasters,\" but he wasn't interested. \"Let's not go down this aisle, okay, Mom?\" I was, of course, looking for the worst of the worst when it came to weaponry, but it proved remarkably hard to find.

For such toys, you have to turn to an online world of websites like Kids-Army.com , where you can indeed buy realistic-looking toy rifles, shotguns, and pistols, or even to Amazon, where you can find an Airsoft version of the Sig Sauer rifle for $249.99. \"Start Them Young\" The National Rifle Association (NRA) would undoubtedly have been disappointed by my local Toys \"R\" Us outlet-just as its officials undoubtedly are by the way most big toy merchants seem to have left their more realistic guns for the online world. This happened, in part, in response to the sort of social pressure that my husband engaged in when in high school and-more critically-the almost routine horror of the blurred line between toy guns and real ones. You know we're a quirky, gun-crazy nation when Cleveland could ban toy guns and umbrellas with pointy tips from the area around the Republican Convention in the name of security, but couldn't keep out the real guns in open-carry Ohio. The NRA wants kids to play with realistic toy guns and BB guns, since they believe that such toys are part of a child's initiation into the future ownership of perfectly real guns. At the moment, the gun lobby is concerned that not enough people have guns-even though the 270 million to 310 million of them already amassed around this country (according to the Pew Research Center ) could arm just about every man, woman, transgendered person, and child around. Still, despite the fact that Americans can now carry guns in all 50 states and the NRA continues to win most of the big political fights, the number of households with guns is actually down from its peak in the late 1960s (though those that are armed have more and deadlier weapons than ever before). No wonder the gun industry and the gun lobby are fighting to produce an army of toddlers. \" Start Them Young ,\" a February 2016 report from the Violence Policy Center, details how gun manufacturers and the NRA are eager to market real guns to younger and younger consumers. The report starts with a selection of quotes from the industry, including this gem from Craig Cushman, marketing director for T h ompson/Center Arms , about their Hot Shot rifle for kids: \"[We're] talking about a tiny gun intended for the very youngest shooters-the ultimate first gun. We're targeting the six- to 12-year-old range.\" In other words, kids are literally in their sights. It's a strange world we live in. The toy industry has puffed up and candy-colored its play guns, turned up the volume on the violence online and in video games, and wrapped everything in plastic and safety warnings. At the same time, the gun industry is making its guns smaller and cuter for kids, while putting its energy into the all-important junior market. Can we be safe-any of us-in a nation awash in guns? The gun-and-ammo industry boasted $16 billion in revenue for 2015. Gun stores-from brick-and-mortar shops to online retailers-had $3.1 billion in revenue that same year. The industry as a whole claimed responsibility for nearly $50 billion in \"economic activity\" in 2015 alone. That represents a fair number of jobs, but here is the number that really goes boom: $229 billion. That's the annual cost of fatal and non-fatal gun violence in this country, according to Mother Jones and analyst Ted Miller of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, who teamed up to crunch the numbers. That figure includes both the direct costs of gun injuries and deaths-police investigations, emergency personnel, hospital bills, long-term care for the injured, funeral expenses for the dead, and the costs of prosecuting and imprisoning the perpetrators. As the report concludes: \"Even before accounting for the more intangible costs of the violence... the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America is nearly $400,000. And we pay for 32 of them every single day.\" We are awash in guns. Where does it end? Gun violence is embedded in our national mythology, our foreign policy, our notions of masculinity, our entertainment industry, and our children's play. We see violence solving problems on every screen-from the zombie apocalypse to the rise of ISIS. Russian playwright Anton Chekhov's maxim still applies: \"One should not put a loaded rifle onto the stage if no one is thinking of firing it.\" Sooner or later, that rifle is sure to go off. It might be an accident; it might be terrorism; it might be hate. But it will go off. Somewhere, as you read this, it's going off right now. I don't want to police my kids' imagination. And there is a whole strain of parenting literature that assures me that I don't have to. It says don't interfere with your kid's play, even if it includes guns and shooting and killing. Imagination is imagination and the violence isn't real. It might even, so this line of thinking goes, be a healthy way for them to process feelings of aggression. I get what they're saying, but it seems like a cop-out to me. To my mind, nonintervention is often a missed opportunity to be a parent. Sure, the violence isn't real. The pow-pows don't actually rip skin and tendon or stop hearts from beating, but the United States, which has been fighting distant wars nonstop for 15 years now, does have a violence problem and a man problem and a gun problem. We know where that problem ends, but it starts somewhere, too. One place to begin to look, at least, is at how our kids-particularly our boys-play, and how they are nurtured (or not), and taught to express their emotions (or not). It is, at least in part, up to us, their parents, to decide whether they are going to be the ones who help repair our society and reorient us (or not). And it begins with the kinds of care and love they receive, the kinds of conversations they are invited into, the kinds of expectations they are given about behavior and relationships. I don't want to raise Seamus, Madeline, or Rosena in the austere, ripped from the headlines of horror, polemical atmosphere that was the essence of my own childhood. But I don't want them to get comfortable with killing either. I want so much more for, and from, my little boy than \"Pow, pow, yous are dead now!\" And that starts with taking the gun or the stick or the rainbow flag out of his hands, sitting him down, and having a hard conversation about what guns actually do to people-and how much killing hurts us all.\n\nWe got into our car as if it were Christmas Eve, Seamus beside himself with excitement, Madeline on a contact high from her brother. I was experiencing my own contact high, taking my kids on their first research trip. What we found was not exactly what I expected-on many levels. Seamus was quickly overwhelmed by the glut of everything-lots of pictures of toys on boxes, but not a lot to pick up. (It was, in that sense, the very opposite of our visits to the Goodwill store, where you can sit on the floor and play with all those second-hand toys as long as you put them back afterwards.) Not so surprisingly, in retrospect, he went straight for what was familiar, what he could grab in his hand and actually look at: the books. It took some effort to wrestle him away from Five Stories About Princesses and enlist him in my quest for bad toys. (Madeline had, by then, fallen asleep.) I had finally found the Nerf \"blasters,\" but he wasn't interested. \"Let's not go down this aisle, okay, Mom?\" I was, of course, looking for the worst of the worst when it came to weaponry, but it proved remarkably hard to find. The aisle did, admittedly, have the Nerf Zombie Strike Doominator and the Nerf Modulus Recon MKII for $34.99 each. Those certainly sounded grim, given the eternal war against the undead, but the bright orange, cartoonish, completely unrealistic \"blasters\" on display and marketed to kids \"eight and up\" seemed distant indeed from American gun carnage (and our wars in distant lands), nor was there anything on the packaging that even hinted at real people getting shot in real encounters or real wars. I must admit that I don't like the idea of Seamus shooting anything at anyone-even a brain-hungry zombie-but as it turned out, I needn't have worried, not this time around anyway. Zombie-killing wasn't in his wheelhouse. Still, I kept looking for the real gun aisle, and I did come across more blasters, dart shooters, and the like, none with the word \"gun\" on them. Of course, we do live in Connecticut, less than 100 miles from Newtown where, in 2012, Adam Lanza, a devotee of violent video games who grew up in a gun-filled house , killed 20 kids just a little older than Seamus along with six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. So maybe our local toy outlet was being sensitive, but I doubt it. There was the Halo UNSC SMG Blaster (the initials make it sound extra tough but stand for nothing) for $19.99, and the NERF Star Wars Episode VII First Order Stormtrooper Deluxe Blaster , which fires 12 darts up to 65 feet without reloading, for $41.99. The worst thing I could find was the Xploderz Mayhem , with \"more distance, more ammo,\" which shoots easy-to-wash off mini-water pellets. It was on clearance for $18.89. By then, Seamus was pulling me frantically toward the aisle with the full Frozen franchise on display. Madeline was now awake and in heaven. So I left them there briefly and snuck off to do a last check for \"real\" toy guns. No such luck. I didn't find the kind of Airsoft gun Tamir Rice was playing with when he was killed. I didn't find an ersatz Sig Sauer either. It turns out that most brick-and-mortar toy stores don't seem to offer realistic-looking toy weaponry anymore, nor is there the toy store equivalent of the curtained-off area in the old neighborhood video rental shop where the porn was available.

The pow-pows don't actually rip skin and tendon or stop hearts from beating, but the United States, which has been fighting distant wars nonstop for 15 years now, does have a violence problem and a man problem and a gun problem. We know where that problem ends, but it starts somewhere, too. One place to begin to look, at least, is at how our kids-particularly our boys-play, and how they are nurtured (or not), and taught to express their emotions (or not). It is, at least in part, up to us, their parents, to decide whether they are going to be the ones who help repair our society and reorient us (or not). And it begins with the kinds of care and love they receive, the kinds of conversations they are invited into, the kinds of expectations they are given about behavior and relationships. I don't want to raise Seamus, Madeline, or Rosena in the austere, ripped from the headlines of horror, polemical atmosphere that was the essence of my own childhood. But I don't want them to get comfortable with killing either. I want so much more for, and from, my little boy than \"Pow, pow, yous are dead now!\" And that starts with taking the gun or the stick or the rainbow flag out of his hands, sitting him down, and having a hard conversation about what guns actually do to people-and how much killing hurts us all.\n\nI had finally found the Nerf \"blasters,\" but he wasn't interested. \"Let's not go down this aisle, okay, Mom?\" I was, of course, looking for the worst of the worst when it came to weaponry, but it proved remarkably hard to find. The aisle did, admittedly, have the Nerf Zombie Strike Doominator and the Nerf Modulus Recon MKII for $34.99 each. Those certainly sounded grim, given the eternal war against the undead, but the bright orange, cartoonish, completely unrealistic \"blasters\" on display and marketed to kids \"eight and up\" seemed distant indeed from American gun carnage (and our wars in distant lands), nor was there anything on the packaging that even hinted at real people getting shot in real encounters or real wars. I must admit that I don't like the idea of Seamus shooting anything at anyone-even a brain-hungry zombie-but as it turned out, I needn't have worried, not this time around anyway. Zombie-killing wasn't in his wheelhouse. Still, I kept looking for the real gun aisle, and I did come across more blasters, dart shooters, and the like, none with the word \"gun\" on them. Of course, we do live in Connecticut, less than 100 miles from Newtown where, in 2012, Adam Lanza, a devotee of violent video games who grew up in a gun-filled house , killed 20 kids just a little older than Seamus along with six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. So maybe our local toy outlet was being sensitive, but I doubt it. There was the Halo UNSC SMG Blaster (the initials make it sound extra tough but stand for nothing) for $19.99, and the NERF Star Wars Episode VII First Order Stormtrooper Deluxe Blaster , which fires 12 darts up to 65 feet without reloading, for $41.99. The worst thing I could find was the Xploderz Mayhem , with \"more distance, more ammo,\" which shoots easy-to-wash off mini-water pellets. It was on clearance for $18.89. By then, Seamus was pulling me frantically toward the aisle with the full Frozen franchise on display. Madeline was now awake and in heaven. So I left them there briefly and snuck off to do a last check for \"real\" toy guns. No such luck. I didn't find the kind of Airsoft gun Tamir Rice was playing with when he was killed. I didn't find an ersatz Sig Sauer either. It turns out that most brick-and-mortar toy stores don't seem to offer realistic-looking toy weaponry anymore, nor is there the toy store equivalent of the curtained-off area in the old neighborhood video rental shop where the porn was available. For such toys, you have to turn to an online world of websites like Kids-Army.com , where you can indeed buy realistic-looking toy rifles, shotguns, and pistols, or even to Amazon, where you can find an Airsoft version of the Sig Sauer rifle for $249.99. \"Start Them Young\" The National Rifle Association (NRA) would undoubtedly have been disappointed by my local Toys \"R\" Us outlet-just as its officials undoubtedly are by the way most big toy merchants seem to have left their more realistic guns for the online world. This happened, in part, in response to the sort of social pressure that my husband engaged in when in high school and-more critically-the almost routine horror of the blurred line between toy guns and real ones. You know we're a quirky, gun-crazy nation when Cleveland could ban toy guns and umbrellas with pointy tips from the area around the Republican Convention in the name of security, but couldn't keep out the real guns in open-carry Ohio. The NRA wants kids to play with realistic toy guns and BB guns, since they believe that such toys are part of a child's initiation into the future ownership of perfectly real guns. At the moment, the gun lobby is concerned that not enough people have guns-even though the 270 million to 310 million of them already amassed around this country (according to the Pew Research Center ) could arm just about every man, woman, transgendered person, and child around. Still, despite the fact that Americans can now carry guns in all 50 states and the NRA continues to win most of the big political fights, the number of households with guns is actually down from its peak in the late 1960s (though those that are armed have more and deadlier weapons than ever before). No wonder the gun industry and the gun lobby are fighting to produce an army of toddlers. \" Start Them Young ,\" a February 2016 report from the Violence Policy Center, details how gun manufacturers and the NRA are eager to market real guns to younger and younger consumers. The report starts with a selection of quotes from the industry, including this gem from Craig Cushman, marketing director for T h ompson/Center Arms , about their Hot Shot rifle for kids: \"[We're] talking about a tiny gun intended for the very youngest shooters-the ultimate first gun. We're targeting the six- to 12-year-old range.\" In other words, kids are literally in their sights. It's a strange world we live in. The toy industry has puffed up and candy-colored its play guns, turned up the volume on the violence online and in video games, and wrapped everything in plastic and safety warnings. At the same time, the gun industry is making its guns smaller and cuter for kids, while putting its energy into the all-important junior market. Can we be safe-any of us-in a nation awash in guns? The gun-and-ammo industry boasted $16 billion in revenue for 2015. Gun stores-from brick-and-mortar shops to online retailers-had $3.1 billion in revenue that same year. The industry as a whole claimed responsibility for nearly $50 billion in \"economic activity\" in 2015 alone. That represents a fair number of jobs, but here is the number that really goes boom: $229 billion. That's the annual cost of fatal and non-fatal gun violence in this country, according to Mother Jones and analyst Ted Miller of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, who teamed up to crunch the numbers. That figure includes both the direct costs of gun injuries and deaths-police investigations, emergency personnel, hospital bills, long-term care for the injured, funeral expenses for the dead, and the costs of prosecuting and imprisoning the perpetrators. As the report concludes: \"Even before accounting for the more intangible costs of the violence... the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America is nearly $400,000. And we pay for 32 of them every single day.\" We are awash in guns. Where does it end? Gun violence is embedded in our national mythology, our foreign policy, our notions of masculinity, our entertainment industry, and our children's play. We see violence solving problems on every screen-from the zombie apocalypse to the rise of ISIS. Russian playwright Anton Chekhov's maxim still applies: \"One should not put a loaded rifle onto the stage if no one is thinking of firing it.\" Sooner or later, that rifle is sure to go off. It might be an accident; it might be terrorism; it might be hate. But it will go off. Somewhere, as you read this, it's going off right now. I don't want to police my kids' imagination. And there is a whole strain of parenting literature that assures me that I don't have to. It says don't interfere with your kid's play, even if it includes guns and shooting and killing. Imagination is imagination and the violence isn't real. It might even, so this line of thinking goes, be a healthy way for them to process feelings of aggression.

No such luck. I didn't find the kind of Airsoft gun Tamir Rice was playing with when he was killed. I didn't find an ersatz Sig Sauer either. It turns out that most brick-and-mortar toy stores don't seem to offer realistic-looking toy weaponry anymore, nor is there the toy store equivalent of the curtained-off area in the old neighborhood video rental shop where the porn was available. For such toys, you have to turn to an online world of websites like Kids-Army.com , where you can indeed buy realistic-looking toy rifles, shotguns, and pistols, or even to Amazon, where you can find an Airsoft version of the Sig Sauer rifle for $249.99. \"Start Them Young\" The National Rifle Association (NRA) would undoubtedly have been disappointed by my local Toys \"R\" Us outlet-just as its officials undoubtedly are by the way most big toy merchants seem to have left their more realistic guns for the online world. This happened, in part, in response to the sort of social pressure that my husband engaged in when in high school and-more critically-the almost routine horror of the blurred line between toy guns and real ones. You know we're a quirky, gun-crazy nation when Cleveland could ban toy guns and umbrellas with pointy tips from the area around the Republican Convention in the name of security, but couldn't keep out the real guns in open-carry Ohio. The NRA wants kids to play with realistic toy guns and BB guns, since they believe that such toys are part of a child's initiation into the future ownership of perfectly real guns. At the moment, the gun lobby is concerned that not enough people have guns-even though the 270 million to 310 million of them already amassed around this country (according to the Pew Research Center ) could arm just about every man, woman, transgendered person, and child around. Still, despite the fact that Americans can now carry guns in all 50 states and the NRA continues to win most of the big political fights, the number of households with guns is actually down from its peak in the late 1960s (though those that are armed have more and deadlier weapons than ever before). No wonder the gun industry and the gun lobby are fighting to produce an army of toddlers. \" Start Them Young ,\" a February 2016 report from the Violence Policy Center, details how gun manufacturers and the NRA are eager to market real guns to younger and younger consumers. The report starts with a selection of quotes from the industry, including this gem from Craig Cushman, marketing director for T h ompson/Center Arms , about their Hot Shot rifle for kids: \"[We're] talking about a tiny gun intended for the very youngest shooters-the ultimate first gun. We're targeting the six- to 12-year-old range.\" In other words, kids are literally in their sights. It's a strange world we live in. The toy industry has puffed up and candy-colored its play guns, turned up the volume on the violence online and in video games, and wrapped everything in plastic and safety warnings. At the same time, the gun industry is making its guns smaller and cuter for kids, while putting its energy into the all-important junior market. Can we be safe-any of us-in a nation awash in guns? The gun-and-ammo industry boasted $16 billion in revenue for 2015. Gun stores-from brick-and-mortar shops to online retailers-had $3.1 billion in revenue that same year. The industry as a whole claimed responsibility for nearly $50 billion in \"economic activity\" in 2015 alone. That represents a fair number of jobs, but here is the number that really goes boom: $229 billion. That's the annual cost of fatal and non-fatal gun violence in this country, according to Mother Jones and analyst Ted Miller of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, who teamed up to crunch the numbers. That figure includes both the direct costs of gun injuries and deaths-police investigations, emergency personnel, hospital bills, long-term care for the injured, funeral expenses for the dead, and the costs of prosecuting and imprisoning the perpetrators. As the report concludes: \"Even before accounting for the more intangible costs of the violence... the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America is nearly $400,000. And we pay for 32 of them every single day.\" We are awash in guns. Where does it end? Gun violence is embedded in our national mythology, our foreign policy, our notions of masculinity, our entertainment industry, and our children's play. We see violence solving problems on every screen-from the zombie apocalypse to the rise of ISIS. Russian playwright Anton Chekhov's maxim still applies: \"One should not put a loaded rifle onto the stage if no one is thinking of firing it.\" Sooner or later, that rifle is sure to go off. It might be an accident; it might be terrorism; it might be hate. But it will go off. Somewhere, as you read this, it's going off right now. I don't want to police my kids' imagination. And there is a whole strain of parenting literature that assures me that I don't have to. It says don't interfere with your kid's play, even if it includes guns and shooting and killing. Imagination is imagination and the violence isn't real. It might even, so this line of thinking goes, be a healthy way for them to process feelings of aggression. I get what they're saying, but it seems like a cop-out to me. To my mind, nonintervention is often a missed opportunity to be a parent. Sure, the violence isn't real. The pow-pows don't actually rip skin and tendon or stop hearts from beating, but the United States, which has been fighting distant wars nonstop for 15 years now, does have a violence problem and a man problem and a gun problem. We know where that problem ends, but it starts somewhere, too. One place to begin to look, at least, is at how our kids-particularly our boys-play, and how they are nurtured (or not), and taught to express their emotions (or not). It is, at least in part, up to us, their parents, to decide whether they are going to be the ones who help repair our society and reorient us (or not). And it begins with the kinds of care and love they receive, the kinds of conversations they are invited into, the kinds of expectations they are given about behavior and relationships. I don't want to raise Seamus, Madeline, or Rosena in the austere, ripped from the headlines of horror, polemical atmosphere that was the essence of my own childhood. But I don't want them to get comfortable with killing either. I want so much more for, and from, my little boy than \"Pow, pow, yous are dead now!\" And that starts with taking the gun or the stick or the rainbow flag out of his hands, sitting him down, and having a hard conversation about what guns actually do to people-and how much killing hurts us all.\n\nIt turns out that most brick-and-mortar toy stores don't seem to offer realistic-looking toy weaponry anymore, nor is there the toy store equivalent of the curtained-off area in the old neighborhood video rental shop where the porn was available.

That's the annual cost of fatal and non-fatal gun violence in this country, according to Mother Jones and analyst Ted Miller of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, who teamed up to crunch the numbers. That figure includes both the direct costs of gun injuries and deaths-police investigations, emergency personnel, hospital bills, long-term care for the injured, funeral expenses for the dead, and the costs of prosecuting and imprisoning the perpetrators. As the report concludes: \"Even before accounting for the more intangible costs of the violence... the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America is nearly $400,000. And we pay for 32 of them every single day.\" We are awash in guns. Where does it end? Gun violence is embedded in our national mythology, our foreign policy, our notions of masculinity, our entertainment industry, and our children's play. We see violence solving problems on every screen-from the zombie apocalypse to the rise of ISIS. Russian playwright Anton Chekhov's maxim still applies: \"One should not put a loaded rifle onto the stage if no one is thinking of firing it.\" Sooner or later, that rifle is sure to go off. It might be an accident; it might be terrorism; it might be hate. But it will go off. Somewhere, as you read this, it's going off right now. I don't want to police my kids' imagination. And there is a whole strain of parenting literature that assures me that I don't have to. It says don't interfere with your kid's play, even if it includes guns and shooting and killing. Imagination is imagination and the violence isn't real. It might even, so this line of thinking goes, be a healthy way for them to process feelings of aggression. I get what they're saying, but it seems like a cop-out to me. To my mind, nonintervention is often a missed opportunity to be a parent. Sure, the violence isn't real. The pow-pows don't actually rip skin and tendon or stop hearts from beating, but the United States, which has been fighting distant wars nonstop for 15 years now, does have a violence problem and a man problem and a gun problem. We know where that problem ends, but it starts somewhere, too. One place to begin to look, at least, is at how our kids-particularly our boys-play, and how they are nurtured (or not), and taught to express their emotions (or not). It is, at least in part, up to us, their parents, to decide whether they are going to be the ones who help repair our society and reorient us (or not). And it begins with the kinds of care and love they receive, the kinds of conversations they are invited into, the kinds of expectations they are given about behavior and relationships. I don't want to raise Seamus, Madeline, or Rosena in the austere, ripped from the headlines of horror, polemical atmosphere that was the essence of my own childhood. But I don't want them to get comfortable with killing either. I want so much more for, and from, my little boy than \"Pow, pow, yous are dead now!\" And that starts with taking the gun or the stick or the rainbow flag out of his hands, sitting him down, and having a hard conversation about what guns actually do to people-and how much killing hurts us all.\n\nWe are awash in guns.

Biden Jr.'s gun control initiative. The Supreme Court has upheld the regulation, issued in 2022.\n\nBy Annie Karni and Chris Cameron\n\nThe Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld federal restrictions the Biden administration placed on \"ghost guns,\" drawing a spotlight to the kits that can be assembled into homemade firearms and the new front in the fight over gun control that they opened up.\n\nAdministration officials had said the popularity of the weapons had soared in recent years, particularly among criminals barred from buying ordinary guns. The regulation, issued in 2022 by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, broadened the bureau's interpretation of the definition of \"firearm\" in the Gun Control Act of 1968.\n\nIt did not ban the sale or possession of parts that can be assembled to make homemade guns, but it did require manufacturers and sellers to obtain licenses, mark their products with serial numbers and conduct background checks.\n\nThe rule was a centerpiece of President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s broader initiative to address the proliferation of illegal weapons. Mr. Biden said in 2022 that the rule would \"help save lives, reduce crime and get more criminals off the streets.\"\n\nBut the federal effort to regulate ghost guns has been troubled by uneven enforcement , significant loopholes and court challenges. A federal appeals court had struck down the regulation, but in a 7-to-2 ruling on Wednesday, the Supreme Court said it could remain in place.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the weapons.\n\nTraditional firearms are made by licensed companies and then bought from licensed gun dealers. All guns manufactured in the United States, as well as those imported from abroad, are legally required to have serial numbers that are typically displayed on the back of the frame.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Until They Did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nTimes Insider\n\nSome new gun owners, a reporter found, are ready to approach the painful topic of firearms with more curiosity and less confrontation.\n\nBy Jenna Russell\n\nTimes Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.\n\nOne of the great joys of living in New England, where I am a reporter for The New York Times, is the ease of reporting in both rural and urban settings, in a region where the distance between the two is rarely more than a few hours' drive.\n\nIn this long-settled and compact corner of the country, often misunderstood by outsiders to be a monochromatic blue swath of liberal views, attitudes toward guns span the same wide, divisive spectrum that they do in the rest of the nation. Many rural New Englanders, even in western Massachusetts and northern Vermont, treasure their long traditions of hunting and recreational shooting, and resent what they see as the encroachment from the left on their right to bear arms.\n\nAfter a mass shooting in Lewiston, Maine, shocked the state in October 2023, some grieving residents called for stricter gun laws. But others lamented that existing laws had prohibited patrons from carrying firearms inside the bowling alley where the shooting began. If they had been, the thinking went, someone might have stopped the gunman before he killed 18 people.\n\nUntil recently, I had imagined people's views on gun ownership to be largely fixed, a kind of permanent feature, like their height or eye color. I had not seen my friends or family dramatically change their opinions on guns; if anything, their attitudes seemed to become more entrenched over time.\n\nThen my editors asked me to work on a project about people who had in recent years purchased a gun for the first time.\n\nIn collaboration with the video journalist Emily Rhyne, I began contacting people who had responded to a Times callout to the public and volunteered to discuss their gun purchase and ownership. Then I contacted gun stores, ranges and shooting clubs. In conversations with people across the country - men and women; young and old; Black and white - I came to see something I might not have considered previously: A whole universe of people had once believed, firmly, that they would never buy a gun. Until they did.\n\nThese Americans are upending preconceptions about who buys a gun and why.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

For firearms.\n\nSome 22 million guns were sold that year, 64 percent more than in 2019. More than eight million of them went to novices who had never owned a firearm, according to the firearm industry's trade association, the National Shooting Sports Foundation.\n\nFirearm homicides increased that year as well, to 19,350 from 14,392 in 2019. The death count from guns, including suicides, rose to 45,222 in 2020 from 39,702 in 2019. The number of lives lost to guns rose again in 2021, to 48,830.\n\nAfter quashing research into gun violence for 25 years, Congress began funneling millions of dollars to federal agencies in 2021 to gather data.\n\nHere is what social psychologists are finding about who purchased firearms, what motivated them and how owning, or even holding, a firearm can alter behavior.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

So How Are Gangs Awash in Them?\n\nTurmoil in Haiti\n\nFederal authorities in several countries have recently nabbed several caches of weapons headed to Haiti, but armed violence continues to rise there, with gangs increasingly obtaining high-caliber firearms and ammunition.\n\nVideos, like this one shared on Whatsapp, are circulating on social media and show that Haitian gangs have obtained firearms and ammunition. Credit...\n\nSupported by\n\nBy David C. Adams and Frances Robles\n\nReporting from Florida\n\nA video that circulated widely on the internet recently showed a Haitian gang leader, Joseph Wilson, shirtless, happily showing off belts of .50 caliber ammunition, mockingly saying he used the armor-piercing bullets to groom his hair.\n\n\"We have enough combs for our hair to last a year,\" he joked.\n\nSo how did he get them?\n\nGuns are not manufactured in Haiti, and it's illegal to ship any there, but the gangs terrorizing the country's capital, Port-au-Prince, never seem to be short of them - or of ammunition.\n\nExperts estimate that there are about 20 armed groups operating in Port-au-Prince, some who carry AR-15 and Galil assault rifles, shotguns and Glock handguns. The United Nations estimates that between 270,000 and 500,000 firearms are circulating illegally in Haiti, with most weapons in the hands of gangs.\n\nTheir superior fire power has overwhelmed the thin ranks of Haiti's ill-equipped police and contributed to an astonishing death toll last year of more than 5,600 homicide victims, a jump of more than 1,000 from the year before.\n\nThe United Nations imposed an arms embargo on Haiti three years ago, yet most weapons on Haiti's streets are from the United States, where they are purchased by straw buyers and smuggled into the country by sea or sometimes by land through the Dominican Republic, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe issue has become so serious that Haiti's government has restricted imports along its land border with the Dominican Republic. Only goods that were originally produced there are allowed; any products that didn't originate in the Dominican Republic have to enter through Haiti's gang-infested seaports.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Gorsuch, one of the court's conservatives, the justices left in place requirements enacted during the Biden administration as part of a broader effort to combat gun violence by placing restrictions on so-called ghost guns .\n\nJustice Gorsuch included photographs, unusual in court opinions, to illustrate how one of the gun kits, Polymer80's \"Buy Build Shoot,\" came with \"all of the necessary components to build\" a Glock-style semiautomatic weapon. He wrote that it was \"so easy to assemble\" that it could be put together in about 20 minutes.\n\n\"Plainly, the finished 'Buy Build Shoot' kit is an instrument of combat,\" Justice Gorsuch wrote, adding that no one would confuse the pistol \"with a tool or a toy.\"\n\nThe ruling in favor of gun regulations is a departure for the court, which has shown itself to be skeptical of them - and of administrative agency power. Justices Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Clarence Thomas, both conservatives, filed dissents.\n\nThe \"weapon-parts kits themselves do not meet the statutory definition of 'firearm,'\" Justice Thomas wrote, important because Congress in 1968 agreed the government could legally impose some regulations on firearms. \"That should end the case.\"\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

In one corner, the elder Gibbons-Neff had his desk, along with a painting of the submarine-hunting warship he had crewed in World War II and a locked cabinet full of guns.\n\nInside were some shotguns and my dad's .22-caliber bolt-action rifle. The scarred wooden gun had been given to him in the early 1950s, when he was around my age.\n\nAfter some pleading and safety training with the rifle, my dad let me shoot it at a paper target outside. I don't know when he said it, but I remember it distinctly: It was the first time he had fired a rifle since 1966, when he served in the Vietnam War.\n\nSo began my complicated relationship with firearms.\n\nWhen I was a boy growing up in suburban Connecticut, target shooting at my grandfather's farm in Maryland felt a little rebellious. At one point, I thought it would be cool to sew an N.R.A. patch onto my sweatshirt, but like most teenage boys I didn't know how to sew, or care to learn.\n\nShooting was a hobby that made me feel different, as if I had a skill few of my classmates possessed. When I was 18, I even used money from a summer job to buy an M-1 Garand, the semiautomatic rifle used by American G.I.s in World War II.\n\nIn 2007 I joined the Marine Corps, an institution where I memorized a boot camp creed that begins: \"This is my rifle.

      "text": "The Last Gun I Shot\n\nThe first time I saw an AR-15 up close was at my friend Agustin's house, in Texas. This was in the summer of 2020, after the mass shootings in El Paso and Sutherland Springs and Midland-Odessa, but before the ones in Uvalde and Cleveland and the Allen Outlets mall.\n\nI had been shooting guns because I had been writing about guns. So far, though, my only experience was with pistols; Agustin had offered to teach me about semi-automatic rifles. Agustin and I were both members of the volunteer fire department in Marfa, which sounds more exciting than it is-we spent a lot of time sitting around the station, fiddling with engines, and trading local gossip.\n\nI'd picked Agustin as my long-gun tutor because he seemed like a good mixture of brave and safe. He worked at the power company, where he was a lineman; on the weekends, he competed in those obstacle courses in which you scale walls and splash through mud pits. He had a black Corvette that he drove in an open-road race in which the goal was not to go as fast as possible but to maintain an average speed of a hundred and twenty-five miles per hour. That was very Agustin-adrenaline, but within boundaries. On the rare occasion it was necessary for the fire department to enter a burning building, it was often Agustin who went.\n\nI went over one evening for the first lesson. Agustin's dog nosed at my knees and I scratched her on the head, but I had a hard time paying attention to anything other than the gun. It sat on a table in the living room, an empty magazine beside it. I'd grown to appreciate the handgun I'd been shooting, a friend's Glock, for its heft in my hand, its compact efficiency. But I didn't like the rifle. It seemed to radiate menace, even unloaded. Its aesthetic was one that I associated with soldiers and SWAT teams and spree killers. I'd heard gun people scoff at the gun-ignorant expressing this kind of reflexive, animistic fear. What did I think it was going to do, jump up and bite me? (Of course, gun people believe in the fetishistic power of the semi-automatic rifle, too-that's why they put its silhouette on their shirts, their bumper stickers, their flags.)\n\nA friend who had recently returned from living in Scandinavia was vehemently opposed to my project. Why did I need to shoot guns to write about guns? To him, it was simple: in America, they were instruments of death. If there was anything more I needed to learn, perhaps I could go interview some parents of murdered children, or watch footage of the aftermath of a mass shooting in the setting of my choice-mall, church, library, Walmart, movie theatre, dance club. I could look at some charts of gun deaths per hundred thousand residents: Norway, Denmark, Finland, hugging the x-axis; the United States, a line spiking out of all proportion, like a statistical error.\n\nBut I believed that I wouldn't be able to understand where I lived unless I wrapped my head around the guns themselves. No other state is so closely associated with the mythology of the gun , and, by raw numbers, Texas has more of them than anywhere else in the U.S. (Per capita, our rates of firearm ownership are closer to the national average.) No matter where I go, when I tell people where I live, they grin and point gun fingers at me. Bang, bang-the universally understood symbol for Texas.\n\nAround the time of my visit to Agustin's house, I had been reading the work of David Yamane, a professor of sociology at Wake Forest University and a self-identified liberal gun owner. One of Yamane's main points was that, for many Americans, guns are normal-neither instruments of righteous retribution, like some on the right like to imagine, nor harbingers of societal collapse, like some on the left believe. Millions of Americans live with firearms, and most of them don't kill themselves or anyone else. As a Texan, as an American, I was going to encounter guns, whether I liked it or not. Perhaps it was possible to enter into a truce with them, or even to find some appreciation. But there was something else: if everyone around me was going to be armed, then I should probably know how to shoot, too.\n\nI grew up in a conservative place-I went to a public high school whose mascot was a Confederate soldier, in a city where one of the main thoroughfares featured monuments to Confederate generals, in a state where the third Monday in January was celebrated not as Martin Luther King, Jr., Day but as Lee-Jackson-King Day-but the conservatism of suburban Virginia in the nineties wasn't oriented around guns. This was before Columbine , before the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. I had plenty of classmates who spent weekends hunting with their uncles, but guns didn't define anyone's personality.\n\nAfter college, I lived in Baltimore, a city with tough gun laws and lots of gun murders. During the summer, I worked at an outdoor-education program for high-school students. The sweetest of the teens didn't come back the second year; I heard that he had been hit by a stray bullet, and was now in a wheelchair. The Baltimore police founded a special task force to get guns off the street, and it became one of the most successful gangs in the city-robbing people, planting guns, stealing drugs and reselling them. In Baltimore, the presence of a gun would have indicated some kind of emergency, and I had no urge to shoot one. Then, in 2012, I moved to rural Texas. My first week in town, a new friend invited me to go to a ranch for target practice. We tromped through the switchgrass and pointed a borrowed shotgun at a row of empty beer cans. I was giddy at the strangeness of it all: the wide expanse of sky; the grasshoppers as big as my palm, hurtling across the path; the casual, unapologetic presence of guns. I kept a spent shell in my pocket for a week, a reminder of my new life.\n\nI arrived in Texas with the vague impression that the state was a lawless libertarian paradise when it came to firearms, but that wasn't exactly true. Until the mid-nineties, when the Texas legislature passed a contentious bill allowing concealed carry, it was illegal for civilians to be armed in public. (Texas's gun restrictions stemmed from post-Civil War attempts to keep weapons away from both restive Confederates and formerly enslaved people.) As opinions about guns became more politicized, advocating looser laws became a useful tool for politicians to motivate a conservative base. But, when I moved there, Texas was still less gun-friendly than Missouri or Florida or a dozen other states, according to a ranking in Guns & Ammo . The Republican-dominated legislature kept pushing. In 2016, the state legalized open carry for permit holders; then the legislature got rid of the need for a permit. Now nearly any adult in Texas can be armed in public without the need for training, background checks, or rudimentary guidance.\n\nTexas's gun policies are increasingly misaligned with public opinion-even many conservatives weren't thrilled about permitless carry-but it doesn't seem to matter. Earlier this year, families from Uvalde , where, in 2022, a gunman with an AR-15 killed nineteen students and two teachers at Robb Elementary School, campaigned to raise the minimum age to buy some semi-automatic weapons from eighteen to twenty-one, a broadly popular proposal. Instead, the legislature opted to require at least one armed security officer in every public school. The state's rates of gun deaths-suicides, homicides, and accidents-are the highest they've been in decades.\n\nAgustin and I practiced at a range on the outskirts of Alpine, a B.Y.O.-targets kind of place where the ground was littered with brass bullet casings. Agustin approached the exercise with a rigor that was almost ritualistic. I liked doing something that was serious enough to require ear and eye protection; I liked the sound the magazine made when I clicked it into place; I liked how jangly I felt after I pulled the trigger, all the built-up tension in my body suddenly released. When my shots went wide, which was often, I would feel an obsessive focus on correcting my error. And I liked holding that much power in my hands. Better in mine than in yours, I remember thinking, a thought directed at no one in particular, or at everyone.\n\nIn 2020, amid the upheavals of the pandemic, the Presidential election, and the George Floyd protests, the United States, a country that already had more guns than people, accumulated millions more of them, many purchased by first-time gun owners. A large share of the 22.8 million firearms sold that year were bought by white men, who make up the vast majority of gun owners. But some of the fastest-growing segments of gun owners are from backgrounds the industry considers \"non-traditional\": women, Asian Americans, liberals.\n\nThat year and into the next, I continued with my gun research. I got a concealed-carry permit, for journalism, and spent some time at a gun store in Austin, also for journalism. Or at least that was the excuse I gave my friends. The store had flyers for a gun-themed comedy show called \"Guns and Giggles,\" which I did not attend. I was at the shop so frequently that I developed a crush on one of its employees, a lanky bicycle mechanic whose name was Freedom. The natural next step would be to get a gun, for journalism. Freedom recommended a Glock 19: compact, with minimal kickback. A year earlier, the idea would have struck me as absurd, but now it had the aura of possibility.\n\nFriends and acquaintances kept telling me about the guns they had bought, or almost bought. My mother, who had never displayed any interest in firearms, mentioned that she'd taken a women's-only handgun class. On Instagram, I followed a collective of trans alpaca farmers living in rural Colorado whose pictures of their baby animals were interspersed with pictures of their self-defense arsenal. A couple of my most politically active friends went to the woods for mysterious tactical training that they were pointedly close-lipped about.\n\nIn November, I travelled to Arizona to take a defensive pistol class at Gunsite, a bucket-list destination for a certain kind of dad. For five days, a sinewy, joyless ex-special-ops soldier watched over us as we practiced drawing, aiming, firing, and reloading as quickly and as accurately as possible. The point of all the repetition was to build muscle memory, to make the actions automatic, movement that preceded thought. Before holstering your weapon, you were supposed to ask yourself: Is my world safe? If not, you stayed drawn.\n\nI loaded enough bullets that week that my thumb cramped, so I bought a speed loader. It was pink, the preferred color for gun accessories for women. (You can get pink thigh holsters, pink-camo gun safes, and enough pink parts to build an almost entirely pink AR-15.) I was one of two women in the class, and our instructors kept praising us for our presence. All week long, they had been presenting scenarios to justify our imaginary use of force. They were usually laced with sexual menace: the biker gang, the meth heads, and the \"unspeakable things\" they wanted to do to women and children. Being armed was not just a means of self-defense but a responsibility, according to this way of thinking. Men were armed in order to protect women; empowerment, in gun world, was women protecting themselves.\n\nI wouldn't say I had a good time at Gunsite, exactly, but I did feel a growing pride in my competence. I wasn't the worst shooter in the class, as I'd feared. I wore my loaner pistol in a hip holster, and its presence, initially unnerving, soon faded into the background of my day. One evening, back at my hotel, I had the sudden sense that I had forgotten something important. I looked around the room for a minute before I figured it out: it was the weight of the gun that I missed.\n\nThe sociologist Jennifer Carlson writes about the figure of the \"citizen-protector\": \"Gun carriers use firearms to actively assert their authority and relevance by embracing the duty to protect themselves and police others.\" For Carlson, this new model of citizenship emerges from a context of American decline, economic precarity, and social alienation. In a world of decaying institutions, the citizen-protector takes matters into his own hands. The implicit assumption that he is not just a guy with a gun but a good guy with a gun is fundamental, a conviction so automatic that it precedes thought. During my lunch break at Gunsite, I indulged in my own citizen-protector daydreams. In them, I was in the midst of some future calamity, a mass-shooting incident, say. It never ended with me coolly bringing down the bad guy with a single shot-in my fantasies, I was unarmed-but with me using my new knowledge to seize his gun and confidently eject the bullet from the chamber.\n\nThe grand finale of the week was a tour of the home of Gunsite's late founder, an imperious and erudite racist named Jeff Cooper. The house was built like a fortress, with walls that could withstand small-arms fire, steel gates to shield the bedrooms, and window slits near the front door so that Cooper could target any unwelcome visitors. As Cooper's granddaughter served us cookies and juice, my classmates asked, again, if I was going to get a gun. They wanted to recruit another person to their side, I'm sure. But I think they also thought that I should own a gun for my own good.\n\n\"A gun is status-that's why they call it an equalizer,\" Richard Hofstadter quotes \"a young Chicago black\" as saying, in a 1970 article in American Heritage on American gun culture. \"What's happening today is that everybody's getting more and more equal, because everybody's got one.\" But convictions for gun crimes still disproportionately impact Black and Latino populations. A police officer killed Philando Castile when he was reaching for his gun license; Marissa Alexander was sentenced to twenty years for firing a warning shot in the air to scare off her abusive husband. As an equalizing instrument, guns are no match for an unequal society; if anything, they merely make existing inequalities more volatile.\n\nI got to Uvalde late on the night of the shooting at Robb Elementary School, after driving through one of the biggest storms I've ever encountered. It was Biblical, terrifying. The next morning, the first camera crews were staking out their spots in the grassy plaza across the street from City Hall. Uvalde was a town of hunters and veterans and small-scale drug crime-a town where guns were normal, until they weren't.\n\nI interviewed an elderly man in a \"Duck Dynasty\" cap, sent adrift by the news. He was a hunter, but he didn't understand the appeal of an AR-15. \"I don't even like pistols ,\" he told me, stricken. I saw him at the library weeks later, and he looked worse, pale and hollowed out. \"I'm having a hard time,\" he said. I think I hugged him, but I don't remember. I remember feeling unequal to his grief; I felt unequal to everyone's grief in Uvalde. I remember thinking about the refrain I'd learned at Gunsite: Is my world safe? I could imagine wanting to draw a gun and never, ever putting it down.\n\nI haven't shot a gun since I was in Uvalde; I seem to have lost my appetite for it. I didn't know that the last time would be the last. Three months before Uvalde, I was on the way to Boca Chica, the South Texas beach where SpaceX launches its rockets, and I stopped at Massey's, a gun range I had visited once before. Massey's has the alarming, ramshackle charm of a roadside stand that rents Uzis. A poster on the wall showed a silhouette of a man looming outside a suburban house, and the caption \"He's not here to borrow a cup of sugar.\"\n\nIt was a slow day, and the guy behind the counter flirted with me half-heartedly. He showed me the custom etchings on his AR, where the safety switch was labelled \"Libturd\" and \"Triggered.\" He gave me a fifty-calibre bullet as a souvenir, and let me shoot his handgun with the silencer on so that I could see how quiet it was. Finally, he walked me out to the range with my rental pistol and a box of bullets. He hung around to watch me load the magazine. It had been a while, and my hand shook a little. I didn't think I was afraid, and yet there it was, my body telling me something that my mind didn't know yet. He looked at me kindly, forgiving me for my nerves. \"You just have to keep practicing,\" he said. \"You get to where you can override the fear, where you don't feel it anymore.\"\n\nFor a moment I could imagine myself as who he wanted me to be. My movements so practiced that I didn't think about them anymore. Impervious, solid in my certainty, hands held firm, steady in my aim. It was later, when I was in Uvalde, that I understood that the shaking came from a part of me I didn't want to override. The world is tough, I remember thinking during my gun period. Maybe you have to meet it where it is, rather than wish it were otherwise. But I've decided that I don't believe that. Because the world is something we make. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "How Did Guns Get So Powerful?\n\nSamuel Walker and fifteen other Texas Rangers rode into the countryside to hunt for Comanches in June of 1844. The Lords of the South Plains, as the Comanches were known, had ruled the American Southwest for a century; by displacing other Native American nations, raiding colonial outposts, enslaving people, and extracting tribute, they enacted what the historian Pekka Hämäläinen, in his book \" The Comanche Empire ,\" called a story of role reversal, \"in which Indians expand, dictate, and prosper, and European colonists resist, retreat, and struggle to survive.\" About a week into Walker's expedition, dozens of Comanche horsemen appeared behind the Rangers, armed and shouting taunts in Spanish. More were almost certainly hidden nearby.\n\nThat day, the Rangers carried rifles-their usual weapons. But each man also wore a pair of Colt Paterson revolvers, new and mostly untested. The guns used rotating cylinders; by drawing back a hammer, a shooter turned the cylinder, putting one of five chambers in position to fire. Intellectually, the Rangers understood the value of these weapons: there'd be no need to reload until all five rounds had been expended. Still, the guns were small and inaccurate, and so the Texans reached for their rifles first. The Comanches rode back and forth, goading them into taking shots. As the Rangers used up their ammunition, more Comanches emerged-sixty or seventy all told.\n\nEventually, the Rangers ran out of bullets, and the Comanches closed in. As the riders rushed across the prairie, the Rangers drew their pistols. The men fired a volley-and then, without pause, another and another. Comanches tumbled from their saddles. The Rangers \"had a shot for every finger on the hand,\" a surviving Comanche recalled. The Native Americans fled, and the Rangers followed; by the end of the day, sixteen Rangers had killed twenty Comanches and wounded thirty more, dealing most of the damage with their Colts. \"These daring Indians had always supposed themselves superior to us, man to man, on horse,\" Walker later wrote. \"The result of this engagement was such as to intimidate them and enable us to treat with them.\" This seemed to promise the decline of the Comanche empire and the security of Texas as a burgeoning slave state.\n\nAfter the battle, Walker wrote to Samuel Colt, the inventor of the revolver, to inquire about buying more guns. But he discovered that Colt's Patent Fire-Arms Manufacturing Company had gone out of business. Colt had been making money by supplying his \"repeating rifles\" to soldiers during the so-called second Seminole War, but \"by exterminating the Indians, and bringing the war rapidly to an end, the market for the arms was destroyed,\" he later wrote. (\"The thing was so good it ruined itself,\" his lawyer complained.) As the historian Pamela Haag writes, in \" The Gunning of America: Business and the Making of American Gun Culture ,\" there was no mass market for firearms in nineteenth-century America. In fact, since before the country was founded, its appetite for guns had been so low as to be considered a security liability. A report from 1756 on the military preparedness of the colonies found that no more than half of militia members were armed, often with broken, ungainly, outdated, badly designed, or poorly maintained weapons; in 1776, the governor of Rhode Island told George Washington that the colonists had almost entirely \"disposed of their arms,\" because they believed themselves to be in \"a perfect state of security.\" When the Revolutionary War began, the scarcity of gunsmiths and guns forced the colonies to purchase tens of thousands of muskets from France.\n\nColt's fast-firing revolvers were a significant innovation in gun design. But the generals who awarded firearms contracts weren't impressed-they tended to focus on the accuracy of guns while undervaluing their speed. General James Wolfe Ripley, the Union Army's chief of ordnance during the Civil War, saw repeating weapons as a \"great evil\" that wasted ammunition, and preferred rifles that a shooter could carefully and accurately aim. Walker and Colt lived in what now looks to us like a prehistoric ballistic world. Guns were slow and inaccurate. Innovation was possible but stymied by dogma. And the market for guns was too small to sustain large gun manufacturers.\n\nBefore starting his weapons company, Colt had travelled America as \"Dr. Coult of New York, London, and Calcutta,\" administering nitrous oxide to spectators, promising that the gas would help them laugh, dance, sing, and perform startling feats of \"muscular exertion.\" He decided to use his flair for advertising to restart his company on a new basis, removed from the boom and bust of wartime gun sales. He began selling abroad, attempting to smuggle guns into Russia in bales of cotton, supplying guns to soldiers of fortune in Cuba, and equipping the British in South Africa and \"men of brains\" in Mexico. At the same time, he worked at building up the U.S. civilian market. (\"The Government may go to the Devil and I will go my own way,\" Colt said.) He pioneered the use of celebrity endorsements, commissioning the well-known painter George Catlin to create absurd portraits in which Colt appeared shooting buffalo and jaguar with Colt revolvers. A native of Hartford, he persuaded the governor of Connecticut to make him a lieutenant colonel in that state's militia; using that honorific, he introduced himself at foreign courts, presenting European royalty with lavishly engraved Colts. When a Hartford clergyman's home was burglarized, Colt sent over a revolver along with a message declaring the gun \"my latest work on 'Moral Reform.' \"\n\nColt used the phrase \"new and improved\" to entice buyers, and published advertorials about his guns in magazines. To stoke sales, he suggested dangers around every corner; he wrote to the Mormon leader Brigham Young , advising him to buy Colt revolvers as a defense against \"raids of savages\" and \"white marauders.\" Later, he named several streets in Coltsville, his factory town, after prominent Native Americans-Sequassen, Wawarme, Masseek, Curcombe, and Weehassat-the names conjuring the images of Indian-fighting that had burnished his weapons' reputation.\n\n\"What Colt invented was a system of myths, symbols, stagecraft, and distribution,\" the historian William Hosley writes, in \" Colt: The Making of an American Legend .\" His guns were sold not just as tools but as a way to access \"the celebrity, glamour and dreams of its namesake.\" As Haag shows, other gun manufacturers soon picked up on the strategy. The Winchester Repeating Arms Company, which was also trying to grow its civilian market by adopting a policy of \"scattering\" its guns-rejecting higher-volume orders in favor of smaller buyers who might disperse its weaponry more broadly-began advertising its products as ideal for \"single individuals, traveling through a wild country.\" Gun manufacturers, Haag writes, began to employ \"predicament\" advertising, in which lone travellers were portrayed facing bears or outlaws. The only way out was through violence.\n\nLast year, versions of these nineteenth-century messages persuaded Americans to buy nearly twenty million guns . In 2020, gun violence took the lives of twenty thousand Americans; add in suicides, and more than forty-five thousand lives were ended by firearms. Yet, if the messages were familiar, the guns themselves were transformed. In 1620, John Billington, the man who would become America's first convicted murderer, arrived on the Mayflower; in 1630, he killed John Newcomen, a fellow-member of the Plymouth Colony, after they got into an argument in the woods. According to one story, as Billington took aim, Newcomen fled toward the shelter of nearby trees-an evasive maneuver that had every chance of success, given firearms technology at that time. Back then, reloading a gun was an arduous process, requiring the shooter to drop the weapon from the shoulder, point its muzzle upward, pour in gunpowder, shove in a bullet alongside a small piece of cloth, push both down the barrel with a ramrod until the bullet was seated against the powder charge, and then prime the firing mechanism. If the weapon had a cutting-edge flintlock ignition system, the shooter would additionally need to half-cock the hammer of his weapon, open a little pan sitting on top of the rifle, pour in gunpowder, close the pan, and set the hammer to full cock before taking aim. (Billington aimed true, and his rudimentary bullet crushed through Newcomen's shoulder, killing him soon after.)\n\nCompared with Billington's gun-or Walker's-a modern firearm is like a monster truck alongside a horse and cart. The anthropologist Thomas McDade has observed that, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the axe was \"no less lethal a weapon\" than the gun, but today otherwise ordinary Americans can unleash devastating firepower-as happened on May 14th, when a white supremacist killed ten people in a supermarket in a predominantly Black neighborhood of Buffalo, New York, and again on May 24th, when an eighteen-year-old gunman killed twenty-one people in an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, nineteen of them children.\n\nWe wonder how we got here. How did guns grow so powerful-both technically and culturally? Like automobiles , firearms have grown increasingly advanced while becoming more than machines; they are both devices and symbols, possessing a cultural magnetism that makes them, for many people, the cornerstone of a way of life. They're tools that kill efficiently while also promising power, respect, and equality-liberation from tyranny, from crime, from weakness. They're a heritage from an imagined past, and a fantasy about protecting our future. It's taken nearly two hundred years for guns to become the problem they are today. The story of how they acquired their power explains why, now, they are so hard to stop.\n\nOn July 3, 1863, line after line of Confederate soldiers, dressed in gray, marched forward as soldiers had done in decades past, charging toward a weak point in the Union line at Gettysburg. But weaponry had changed. Men fell \"like wheat before the garner,\" as one veteran would later describe it. Two years earlier, when the Civil War had begun, both armies primarily carried muzzle-loading smoothbore muskets. They'd rapidly switched, however, to .58-calibre rifles that fired a groundbreaking conical bullet called the minié ball. The bullet was easier to load and more aerodynamic than previous designs. It allowed soldiers to fire farther and more accurately upon rushing enemy troops, making massed charges deadly and Napoleonic infantry tactics obsolete.\n\nIn white Southerners' popular memory, Pickett's Charge, as the attack became known, would be seen as a gallant act of doomed bravery-the high-water mark of the Confederacy, marking the northernmost point that the rebels reached. But, in fact, it was a technologically aided slaughter, in which accurate, long-flying bullets insured a casualty rate of more than fifty per cent for the charging men. During the course of the war, the minié ball would kill tens of thousands; relatively few Civil War soldiers died of bayonet wounds, in part because they rarely got close enough to their enemies to receive them. As a result, tactics changed. Soldiers stopped firing at one another from close ranks; instead, they began arranging themselves into dispersed lines and firing from behind covered positions, such as walls, trees, rocks, fences, or elaborate fortifications. Slowly, this defensive style turned into an offensive one. One group of attacking soldiers could provide \"covering fire\" by shooting at an enemy position, forcing its soldiers to keep their heads down while another attacking unit moved forward safely.\n\nSoldiers providing covering fire didn't depend on accuracy. They often shot blindly, not even bothering to put the gunsights to their eyes. In theory, the units maneuvering into position would use precision fire to kill. But in practice this was rarely the case. Eventually, studies conducted during the Second World War would confirm that most battlefield bullet wounds occur randomly, and at close range. War movies often depict heroic point-target aiming and killing, and yet soldiers are often terrified; as their hearts surge with adrenaline, blood flows away from their extremities, impairing their fine-motor control as they spray gunfire toward their foes.\n\nDuring the First World War , the use of machine guns epitomized this approach. The area fire created by such weapons removed the human element in aiming altogether. A machine gunner, whom the military historian John Keegan has characterized less as a soldier than a \"machine-minder,\" traversed his target area by applying a \"two-inch tap\" to the breeches of his weapon, sending it two inches to the right or left on a set of tracks; he tapped repeatedly until the gun reached a stop at one end, then tapped in the opposite direction. In this way, the area in front of the gun could be blanketed with bullets without the gunner having eyes on any particular target. Since each round had a slightly different trajectory, the target zone would be saturated with fire, creating a deadly area known as \"the beaten zone.\" As one Japanese officer put it, during the Russo-Japanese War, the machine gun could \"be made to sprinkle its shot as roads are watered with a hose.\" Kenneth Koch, the poet and Second World War veteran, would later recall how, \"As machines make ice, / we made dead enemy soldiers\"; writing in the Times , Brian Van Reet, a combat veteran of the Iraq War, has described how he and the men he served with often \"fired nearly blindly, under the influence of a strange and numbing feeling of terror, rage and exhilaration. . . . Few of us really knew whom, if anyone, we had hit.\"\n\nThe unromantic reality of increasingly industrialized war wasn't likely to capture the public imagination, and so, in ads, dime-store novels, and movies, gun companies proposed a self-serving alternative history. Though Southern Plains tribes like the Comanches had been decimated less by firearms than by disease, Winchester described its Model 73 repeating rifle-a specially promoted gun that had been used by Billy the Kid and Buffalo Bill-as \"the gun that won the West\"; this legend helped the company to sell almost thirty times as many guns in 1914 as it had in 1875. Blending the military and civilian domains, Winchester advertised its weapons as \"For Military and Sporting Purposes\"; Colt marketed its Single Action Army model as \"the Peacemaker,\" a weapon \"for all who travel among dangerous communities.\" The Thompson machine gun, developed as a trench-clearing tool during the First World War, was advertised through images showing cowboys defending their ranches against marauders; ads proclaimed the machine gun \"the ideal weapon for the protection of large estates, ranches, plantations, etc.\" A deadly but inaccurate weapon of industrialized war was recast as a precision instrument for taming the supposedly savage frontier.\n\nOn a deeper level, the ads were political, recasting the American ideals of freedom and equality in martial terms. In gun marketing, self-reliance, respect, and freedom of movement were tied to the capacity to kill: \"Abe Lincoln may have freed all men, but Sam Colt made them equal,\" one advertisement read. The mythology of the hyper-violent West became so embedded in American consciousness that Teddy Roosevelt could construct a notion of American identity around it. In \" The Winning of the West ,\" he painted a portrait of hard life on the frontier marked by continual violence; the effect of this continual hardship was to \"weld together into one people the representatives of these numerous and widely different races.\" According to this view of history, American identity was in large part a product of violence.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Solomon Zuckerman, a scientist advising the Allies, made a surprising discovery. While examining an X-ray of a wounded soldier evacuated from Dunkirk, Zuckerman noticed that there was something odd about the way in which he'd been hurt: a grievous injury had resulted from a small metal fragment, barely larger than a pinhead, lodged in the man's kidney. Other soldiers Zuckerman examined had similar injuries. At the time, experts usually considered fragments from exploding shells and grenades dangerous only if they weighed more than a twenty-fifth of an ounce-and yet one soldier had been severely hurt by a far lighter shard, one weighing less than ten milligrams. Another's forearm had been shattered by a minute metal splinter. According to the science of ballistics, such injuries made no sense.\n\nZuckerman, who was born in South Africa, had trained as an anatomist and a zoologist. During the war, he'd learned to see horrific violence scientifically. He had studied the accuracy of bombing raids and the lethal effects of bomb blasts; his goal was to learn how much force living bodies could take, and where they were most vulnerable. His work had helped the Royal Air Force maximize the casualties caused by its bombs. At the same time, his steel \"Zuckerman helmet,\" worn by civilians and civil-defense organizations, protected British heads from falling debris during enemy raids.\n\nNow, working alongside Paul Libessart, a French engineer who had fled to England after the fall of France, Zuckerman turned to the science of wound ballistics-the study of the manner in which projectiles damage human bodies. In the mid-nineteenth century, the deadliness of a firearm had often been judged by how deeply its bullets penetrated into wood; in the eighteen-eighties, the metric had shifted to whether a bullet could kill a cavalry horse. It was obvious that some bullets and weapons had more \"stopping power\" than others, but it wasn't clear exactly how that power worked. Zuckerman wanted to solve the mystery.\n\nSoldiers tended to assume that stopping a rush required heavier, more powerful bullets. In the first half of the twentieth century, American researchers conducted experiments of dubious value designed to prove this point. They hung cadavers in the air and shot them while onlookers estimated how far the corpses swung; they shot cows and observed the effects. Eventually, the U.S. Army concluded that kinetic energy-a combination of bullet weight and speed-was the crucial factor in bullet lethality.\n\nThe Dunkirk injuries convinced Zuckerman that something was missing from this story. He began to think that the over-all kinetic energy of a bullet might be less important than how much of that energy was transferred to a body during impact. He and his team tried firing a steel ball into a phone book, then repeating the shot with the book placed behind a block of gelatin, which could serve as a proxy for a human body. By measuring how much the gelatin slowed the bullet, they could guess at how much energy it transferred. They found that some varieties of bullets slowed down more than others, transferring more energy. Later, the team shot small metal balls through the bodies of unfortunate rabbits. By means of a technique called shadowgraphy-the analysis of shadows cast by bodies in rapid motion-they captured the moment of energy transfer. In the split second after impact, Zuckerman wrote, the limbs \"ballooned due to the formation of an internal cavity.\"\n\nWounds caused by firearms had long been identified with a \"permanent cavity\" created when the bullet itself physically crushed the body's tissues. But Zuckerman's images captured a different kind of injury: a \"temporary cavity,\" formed when the slowing bullet transferred energy to the surrounding soft tissue. Just as a diver creates ripples as she enters the water, so a bullet transfers momentum to whatever blood, spleen, brain, or muscle happens to surround its entry point. These ripples produce blunt trauma, pulping tissue and breaking bones. This was how tiny slivers of metal could shatter a man's arm.\n\nZuckerman's discoveries came too late to change the way soldiers were armed during the Second World War. But subsequent military studies, including a groundbreaking report written by the U.S. military's Operations Research Office during the Korean War, measured a gun's lethality by looking at the maximum size of the temporary cavity. The report concluded that \"smaller bullets can be used to produce battlefield physiological effects at least equivalent to those of the present standard .30 cal.\" Although the Army remained committed to powerful, accurate, larger-calibre weapons, a small insurgency within it began advocating a novel idea known as S.C.H.V.: small-calibre, high-velocity. Adherents to S.C.H.V. proposed that lighter rifles loaded with smaller bullets could allow soldiers to carry more rounds and fire with less recoil, while still causing horrible wounds.\n\nThese arguments dovetailed with work being done by an engineer named Eugene Stoner, who was tinkering in his garage in Hollywood, California, during the nineteen-fifties. Shy, reserved, and opinionated, Stoner was a Marine Corps veteran who'd fought in the Pacific theatre; he lacked a formal engineering education, but had worked his way up through the machine shop at the Fairchild Engine & Airplane Corporation. By the middle of the decade, Stoner had begun to apply his experience with aircraft ordnance to firearms. Using advanced alloys and lightweight parts that were common in aeronautics, he started developing a firing mechanism for a new kind of lightweight rifle. Success was slow in coming; the barrel of Stoner's first prototype burst in Army tests. The weight of U.S. military opinion was in favor of a heavier, more powerful weapon, the M14. His fortunes began to change when one of S.C.H.V.'s boosters, General Willard G. Wyman, asked Stoner to modify his rifle so that it could shoot a redesigned .223-calibre round weighing roughly a tenth of an ounce.\n\nThe resulting rifle, the AR-15, could fire its .223 round at more than thirty-two hundred feet per second-nearly three times the speed of sound. Stoner later explained the advantages of its smaller bullets to Congress. All bullets are \"stabilized to fly through the air,\" he said, but \"when they hit something, they immediately go unstable.\" Tiny bullets, having a smaller mass, grow unstable faster, and tumble through the body, causing disproportionate damage. As a smaller bullet tumbles, it transfers its energy to your organs and creates shock waves strong enough to sever muscle; if such a bullet strikes your head, the pressure it creates can shatter your skull or squeeze brain tissue through your sinuses. It might also fragment inside the body, scattering small pieces of itself and increasing the damage.\n\nAs the Vietnam War began to ramp up, it was clear that U.S. soldiers faced a small-arms imbalance. American troops were armed with big, heavy, and extremely accurate M14 rifles; the North Vietnamese had AK-47s-sturdy, reliable weapons that children could, and often did, use. AK-47s were terribly inaccurate; expert shooters could struggle to put ten consecutive rounds on target from three hundred metres. Still, the U.S. military concluded that the M14 was an imperfect combat weapon. It had too much recoil to be fired effectively on automatic. Its heavy rounds imposed logistical limits on how much ammo could be carried. The journalist C. J. Chivers wrote in his book \" The Gun \" that, in fielding the M14, American soldiers fell victim to the \"romance\" of \"old-fashioned rifles and the sharpshooting riflemen who carried them.\" What they needed was an easy-to-handle assault rifle that could give them so-called fire superiority in close, frightening encounters.\n\nColt's firearms division took a gamble on the AR-15, buying the manufacturing rights for the rifle from Stoner in 1959 and embarking on a unique marketing campaign. The firm invited the Air Force Chief of Staff Curtis LeMay to a party at a gentleman's farm, where he fired the gun into a series of watermelons, creating bright-red explosions with each successful shot. The rifle was also tested on human heads imported from India, which were encased in ballistic gelatin and shot at from various distances. By 1964, the AR-15 had been adapted into the M16-an automatic, magazine-fed, gas-operated assault rifle with smaller rounds, which could be carried in greater numbers and caused less recoil. The rifle was adopted quickly, without the usual process of debugging and refinement, and soldiers found that it often broke down in the field, jamming or failing to fire in combat. Soldiers died with jammed rifles in their hands while the design was revised. Meanwhile, Colt posted twelve million dollars in profits in 1967; Stoner became a wealthy celebrity.\n\nAs the twentieth century drew to a close, firearms manufacturers kept updating their stories. Crime rates spiked, and so the image of the frontier hero fending off nonwhite marauders was revised for the era of vigilante-vengeance films such as \"Death Wish\" and \"The Exterminator.\" The National Rifle Association ran ads asking \"Why can't a policeman be there when you need him?\" and \"Should you shoot a rapist before he cuts your throat?\" In 1993, the shootout between members of the Branch Davidian cult and agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms sparked an anti-government wave. The N.R.A. added a new twist to the story, with ads that asked, \"What's the first step to a police state?\" Guns had once been tools for the frontier spaces that the government couldn't reach. Now, according to the gun lobby, they were a necessity for all spaces, at all times. When crime and authoritarianism run rampant, the Wild West is everywhere.\n\nCrime fell in the late nineties. So did gun production, with just over five million units manufactured in 1994, and under three million in 2001. The 9/11 attacks provoked a modest recovery. But 2008 brought a seismic transformation-the so-called Barack Boom . The election of America's first Black President coincided with what one gun-industry newsletter called an \"incessant consumer demand for high-capacity pistols and military style rifles.\" During the 2008 election, the N.R.A. warned that never in its history had it \"faced a presidential candidate-and hundreds of candidates running for other offices-with such a deep-rooted hatred of firearm freedoms.\" In 2013, despite crime rates that were lower than they'd been in decades, the head of the N.R.A., Wayne LaPierre , claimed that, under President Barack Obama, \"Latin American drug gangs\" had \"invaded every city of significant size in the United States.\" Gun marketing and political messaging merged more deeply, and in the last year of Obama's second term gun manufacturers produced a record 11,497,441 guns for domestic consumption.\n\nWhen John Billington came upon John Newcomen, his weapon did not promise him his manhood, or protection from his fellow-colonists, or escape from the coercive state under which he suffered. His gun did not claim to be the bedrock of his freedom or the means by which all men would be made to treat him as an equal. When Billington pulled his gun's trigger, the bullet he sent forth was a simple metal sphere travelling at less than half the speed of the bullets fired by today's mass shooters. It moved awkwardly through the air, and, in the body, it damaged only what was directly in its path. And it was a lone projectile. Billington's gun, which took many minutes to reload, was incapable of creating a beaten zone. He had a tool suitable for murder-but not mass murder.\n\nThe guns that today's Americans buy and sell by the millions are perfectly suited for that purpose. Civilian AR-15s differ from military versions because, in 1986, the Firearm Owners Protection Act banned the transfer or possession of machine guns; as a result, a mechanical block on civilian ARs requires the shooter to pull the trigger to release another bullet. But clever gun enthusiasts have figured out an easy way to bypass this mechanism: a device known as a bump stock uses the energy of the rifle's recoil to assist in bumping the trigger against the shooter's finger. The original military version of the AR-15 can fire eight hundred rounds per minute; an unmodified civilian AR-15 might fire forty-five to sixty. A version with a bump stock can fire somewhere between four hundred and eight hundred. In the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, a sixty-four-year-old man without advanced marksmanship skills or military training used a bump stock to achieve something like fully automated rifle fire, sending more than eleven hundred rounds into a crowd in the course of ten minutes, killing fifty-eight people and wounding more than five hundred. It would have taken Billington six hours to fire that many bullets.\n\nBecause a bump stock causes the rifle to slide forward and backward as it fires, it diminishes accuracy. In the aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting , this spurred some, like the Georgia state senator Michael Williams, to argue that the use of a bump stock \"actually prevented more casualties,\" because of the resulting \"inconsistency, inaccuracy, and lack of control.\" But statements such as this betray a basic ignorance about the history of guns and the reality of how they are used in battle. The bump stock effectively turns the AR-15 into a machine gun capable of area fire. This is how the Las Vegas shooter was using his weapon. As the retired Army Lieutenant Colonel Arthur B. Alphin explained, to the Los Angeles Times , the gunman \"was not aiming at any individual person. He was just throwing bullets in a huge 'beaten zone' \" filled with civilians bunched together in ways that soldiers had long ago learned to avoid. Williams's view is typical of a contemporary gun culture that sees the real-world damage caused by guns only through the foggy lens of a fictitious history; it puts a false emphasis on the accuracy of the shooter. The gunman's lethality-dozens dead, hundreds wounded-wasn't the result of skill but of the sheer number of rounds that his weapons could fire. He was not the expert long-range rifleman of Western lore but the machine-minder of the First World War, initiating a mechanical process designed to inflict death on an industrial scale.\n\nIn 1962, the Surgeon General of the U.S. Army, Lieutenant General Leonard D. Heaton, released a landmark study of wound ballistics. \"The message which this volume contains for the physician who will be treating the wounds of war is clear,\" he wrote, in the report. \"War wounds, in many respects, are different from those found in peacetime civilian practice.\" Heaton couldn't have foreseen a world in which more than twenty million AR-15s were in circulation within the United States. In Las Vegas, the gunman's high rate of fire made him more lethal, but so did the design of his bullets, which flew from his hotel room at supersonic speeds and then, upon striking their victims, began to slow and yaw, imparting their energy to bones, tissue, and organs. That night, of the hundred and four shooting victims seen at the U.M.C. Trauma Center, more than thirty had critical injuries; more than a dozen needed operations from orthopedists and cardiovascular surgeons. Chest tubes had to be inserted to drain internal bleeding; bowels had to be carefully resected by doctors working with needle and thread.\n\nAfter such killings, there's always a frantic parsing of the killer's motives. Was the murderer driven by hatred of women, by white supremacy, by \" replacement theory ,\" by Black nationalism, by ISIS , by anti-Asian hatred, by dreams of a race war, by bullying, by America's mental-health crisis, by a spiritual darkness at the heart of our society? Why the shooter chose to open fire is always, fundamentally, a mystery. But with mass shootings the why is ultimately less important than the how. The guns have no motive. They have only a purpose: to rend flesh as efficiently as possible.\n\nAnd yet it's not quite right to see a gun as merely an efficient machine. When Americans call for regulation of guns, it isn't the physical object in all its terrifying utility that blocks them but the deep attachment that their fellow-citizens have to their weapons and what they think they represent. Many of us walk around with an image of our country in our heads that we believe comes from history, when in fact it comes from marketing and mythology. It's that marketing and mythology which keep us saturated with weaponry, and which need to be rejected before we can make any enduring change.\n\nIn 1968, an N.R.A. spokesman told Congress that American gun culture was the result of a \"very special relationship between a man and his gun-atavistic, with its roots deep in history.\" But in truth those roots are shallow, and the fantasies underlying the \"very special relationship\" are often threadbare. As the horror in Uvalde unfolded, there were plenty of armed police officers, but there was little willingness to charge in against a barricaded shooter. The police have been called cowards for their hesitancy, but their reaction is unsurprising: despite the often militaristic rhetoric of police unions, the average cop is not going to be ready for a situation most United States marines have never faced. When we arm our citizens with such lethal weapons, we can't always expect uncommon valor.\n\nIncreasing gun sales have failed to counter increasing levels of gun violence: the Gun Violence Archive counts more than eight thousand gun deaths in the first half of 2022 alone. Perhaps the steady stream of death will eventually cause us to begin to reassess that \"very special relationship\" and open up new understandings of our own history. Until then, many Americans will keep living out a hundred-and-fifty-year-old dream-that, no matter what it is that frightens or enrages us in our complex, chaotic, and often unsettling world, guns are the answer. ♦\n\nThis is drawn from \" Uncertain Ground: Citizenship in an Age of Endless, Invisible War .\"\n\nAn earlier version of this article incorrectly described the origin of the phrase \"new and improved,\" and the firing mode of the original M16 rifle.\n\nThe dire wolf is back .\n\nWhy is the American diet so deadly ?\n\nCan we stop runaway A.I. ?\n\nWhen a virus is the cure .\n\nHow do you know when a system has failed ?\n\nA heat shield for the most important ice on Earth .\n\nThe climate solutions we can't live without .\n\nSupport The New Yorker's award-winning journalism.

      "text": "How Did Guns Get So Powerful?\n\nSamuel Walker and fifteen other Texas Rangers rode into the countryside to hunt for Comanches in June of 1844. The Lords of the South Plains, as the Comanches were known, had ruled the American Southwest for a century; by displacing other Native American nations, raiding colonial outposts, enslaving people, and extracting tribute, they enacted what the historian Pekka Hämäläinen, in his book \" The Comanche Empire ,\" called a story of role reversal, \"in which Indians expand, dictate, and prosper, and European colonists resist, retreat, and struggle to survive.\" About a week into Walker's expedition, dozens of Comanche horsemen appeared behind the Rangers, armed and shouting taunts in Spanish. More were almost certainly hidden nearby.\n\nThat day, the Rangers carried rifles-their usual weapons. But each man also wore a pair of Colt Paterson revolvers, new and mostly untested. The guns used rotating cylinders; by drawing back a hammer, a shooter turned the cylinder, putting one of five chambers in position to fire. Intellectually, the Rangers understood the value of these weapons: there'd be no need to reload until all five rounds had been expended. Still, the guns were small and inaccurate, and so the Texans reached for their rifles first. The Comanches rode back and forth, goading them into taking shots. As the Rangers used up their ammunition, more Comanches emerged-sixty or seventy all told.\n\nEventually, the Rangers ran out of bullets, and the Comanches closed in. As the riders rushed across the prairie, the Rangers drew their pistols. The men fired a volley-and then, without pause, another and another. Comanches tumbled from their saddles. The Rangers \"had a shot for every finger on the hand,\" a surviving Comanche recalled. The Native Americans fled, and the Rangers followed; by the end of the day, sixteen Rangers had killed twenty Comanches and wounded thirty more, dealing most of the damage with their Colts. \"These daring Indians had always supposed themselves superior to us, man to man, on horse,\" Walker later wrote. \"The result of this engagement was such as to intimidate them and enable us to treat with them.\" This seemed to promise the decline of the Comanche empire and the security of Texas as a burgeoning slave state.\n\nAfter the battle, Walker wrote to Samuel Colt, the inventor of the revolver, to inquire about buying more guns. But he discovered that Colt's Patent Fire-Arms Manufacturing Company had gone out of business. Colt had been making money by supplying his \"repeating rifles\" to soldiers during the so-called second Seminole War, but \"by exterminating the Indians, and bringing the war rapidly to an end, the market for the arms was destroyed,\" he later wrote. (\"The thing was so good it ruined itself,\" his lawyer complained.) As the historian Pamela Haag writes, in \" The Gunning of America: Business and the Making of American Gun Culture ,\" there was no mass market for firearms in nineteenth-century America. In fact, since before the country was founded, its appetite for guns had been so low as to be considered a security liability. A report from 1756 on the military preparedness of the colonies found that no more than half of militia members were armed, often with broken, ungainly, outdated, badly designed, or poorly maintained weapons; in 1776, the governor of Rhode Island told George Washington that the colonists had almost entirely \"disposed of their arms,\" because they believed themselves to be in \"a perfect state of security.\" When the Revolutionary War began, the scarcity of gunsmiths and guns forced the colonies to purchase tens of thousands of muskets from France.\n\nColt's fast-firing revolvers were a significant innovation in gun design. But the generals who awarded firearms contracts weren't impressed-they tended to focus on the accuracy of guns while undervaluing their speed. General James Wolfe Ripley, the Union Army's chief of ordnance during the Civil War, saw repeating weapons as a \"great evil\" that wasted ammunition, and preferred rifles that a shooter could carefully and accurately aim. Walker and Colt lived in what now looks to us like a prehistoric ballistic world. Guns were slow and inaccurate. Innovation was possible but stymied by dogma. And the market for guns was too small to sustain large gun manufacturers.\n\nBefore starting his weapons company, Colt had travelled America as \"Dr. Coult of New York, London, and Calcutta,\" administering nitrous oxide to spectators, promising that the gas would help them laugh, dance, sing, and perform startling feats of \"muscular exertion.\" He decided to use his flair for advertising to restart his company on a new basis, removed from the boom and bust of wartime gun sales. He began selling abroad, attempting to smuggle guns into Russia in bales of cotton, supplying guns to soldiers of fortune in Cuba, and equipping the British in South Africa and \"men of brains\" in Mexico. At the same time, he worked at building up the U.S. civilian market. (\"The Government may go to the Devil and I will go my own way,\" Colt said.) He pioneered the use of celebrity endorsements, commissioning the well-known painter George Catlin to create absurd portraits in which Colt appeared shooting buffalo and jaguar with Colt revolvers. A native of Hartford, he persuaded the governor of Connecticut to make him a lieutenant colonel in that state's militia; using that honorific, he introduced himself at foreign courts, presenting European royalty with lavishly engraved Colts. When a Hartford clergyman's home was burglarized, Colt sent over a revolver along with a message declaring the gun \"my latest work on 'Moral Reform.' \"\n\nColt used the phrase \"new and improved\" to entice buyers, and published advertorials about his guns in magazines. To stoke sales, he suggested dangers around every corner; he wrote to the Mormon leader Brigham Young , advising him to buy Colt revolvers as a defense against \"raids of savages\" and \"white marauders.\" Later, he named several streets in Coltsville, his factory town, after prominent Native Americans-Sequassen, Wawarme, Masseek, Curcombe, and Weehassat-the names conjuring the images of Indian-fighting that had burnished his weapons' reputation.\n\n\"What Colt invented was a system of myths, symbols, stagecraft, and distribution,\" the historian William Hosley writes, in \" Colt: The Making of an American Legend .\" His guns were sold not just as tools but as a way to access \"the celebrity, glamour and dreams of its namesake.\" As Haag shows, other gun manufacturers soon picked up on the strategy. The Winchester Repeating Arms Company, which was also trying to grow its civilian market by adopting a policy of \"scattering\" its guns-rejecting higher-volume orders in favor of smaller buyers who might disperse its weaponry more broadly-began advertising its products as ideal for \"single individuals, traveling through a wild country.\" Gun manufacturers, Haag writes, began to employ \"predicament\" advertising, in which lone travellers were portrayed facing bears or outlaws. The only way out was through violence.\n\nLast year, versions of these nineteenth-century messages persuaded Americans to buy nearly twenty million guns . In 2020, gun violence took the lives of twenty thousand Americans; add in suicides, and more than forty-five thousand lives were ended by firearms. Yet, if the messages were familiar, the guns themselves were transformed. In 1620, John Billington, the man who would become America's first convicted murderer, arrived on the Mayflower; in 1630, he killed John Newcomen, a fellow-member of the Plymouth Colony, after they got into an argument in the woods. According to one story, as Billington took aim, Newcomen fled toward the shelter of nearby trees-an evasive maneuver that had every chance of success, given firearms technology at that time. Back then, reloading a gun was an arduous process, requiring the shooter to drop the weapon from the shoulder, point its muzzle upward, pour in gunpowder, shove in a bullet alongside a small piece of cloth, push both down the barrel with a ramrod until the bullet was seated against the powder charge, and then prime the firing mechanism. If the weapon had a cutting-edge flintlock ignition system, the shooter would additionally need to half-cock the hammer of his weapon, open a little pan sitting on top of the rifle, pour in gunpowder, close the pan, and set the hammer to full cock before taking aim. (Billington aimed true, and his rudimentary bullet crushed through Newcomen's shoulder, killing him soon after.)\n\nCompared with Billington's gun-or Walker's-a modern firearm is like a monster truck alongside a horse and cart. The anthropologist Thomas McDade has observed that, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the axe was \"no less lethal a weapon\" than the gun, but today otherwise ordinary Americans can unleash devastating firepower-as happened on May 14th, when a white supremacist killed ten people in a supermarket in a predominantly Black neighborhood of Buffalo, New York, and again on May 24th, when an eighteen-year-old gunman killed twenty-one people in an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, nineteen of them children.\n\nWe wonder how we got here. How did guns grow so powerful-both technically and culturally? Like automobiles , firearms have grown increasingly advanced while becoming more than machines; they are both devices and symbols, possessing a cultural magnetism that makes them, for many people, the cornerstone of a way of life. They're tools that kill efficiently while also promising power, respect, and equality-liberation from tyranny, from crime, from weakness. They're a heritage from an imagined past, and a fantasy about protecting our future. It's taken nearly two hundred years for guns to become the problem they are today. The story of how they acquired their power explains why, now, they are so hard to stop.\n\nOn July 3, 1863, line after line of Confederate soldiers, dressed in gray, marched forward as soldiers had done in decades past, charging toward a weak point in the Union line at Gettysburg. But weaponry had changed. Men fell \"like wheat before the garner,\" as one veteran would later describe it. Two years earlier, when the Civil War had begun, both armies primarily carried muzzle-loading smoothbore muskets. They'd rapidly switched, however, to .58-calibre rifles that fired a groundbreaking conical bullet called the minié ball. The bullet was easier to load and more aerodynamic than previous designs. It allowed soldiers to fire farther and more accurately upon rushing enemy troops, making massed charges deadly and Napoleonic infantry tactics obsolete.\n\nIn white Southerners' popular memory, Pickett's Charge, as the attack became known, would be seen as a gallant act of doomed bravery-the high-water mark of the Confederacy, marking the northernmost point that the rebels reached. But, in fact, it was a technologically aided slaughter, in which accurate, long-flying bullets insured a casualty rate of more than fifty per cent for the charging men. During the course of the war, the minié ball would kill tens of thousands; relatively few Civil War soldiers died of bayonet wounds, in part because they rarely got close enough to their enemies to receive them. As a result, tactics changed. Soldiers stopped firing at one another from close ranks; instead, they began arranging themselves into dispersed lines and firing from behind covered positions, such as walls, trees, rocks, fences, or elaborate fortifications. Slowly, this defensive style turned into an offensive one. One group of attacking soldiers could provide \"covering fire\" by shooting at an enemy position, forcing its soldiers to keep their heads down while another attacking unit moved forward safely.\n\nSoldiers providing covering fire didn't depend on accuracy. They often shot blindly, not even bothering to put the gunsights to their eyes. In theory, the units maneuvering into position would use precision fire to kill. But in practice this was rarely the case. Eventually, studies conducted during the Second World War would confirm that most battlefield bullet wounds occur randomly, and at close range. War movies often depict heroic point-target aiming and killing, and yet soldiers are often terrified; as their hearts surge with adrenaline, blood flows away from their extremities, impairing their fine-motor control as they spray gunfire toward their foes.\n\nDuring the First World War , the use of machine guns epitomized this approach. The area fire created by such weapons removed the human element in aiming altogether. A machine gunner, whom the military historian John Keegan has characterized less as a soldier than a \"machine-minder,\" traversed his target area by applying a \"two-inch tap\" to the breeches of his weapon, sending it two inches to the right or left on a set of tracks; he tapped repeatedly until the gun reached a stop at one end, then tapped in the opposite direction. In this way, the area in front of the gun could be blanketed with bullets without the gunner having eyes on any particular target. Since each round had a slightly different trajectory, the target zone would be saturated with fire, creating a deadly area known as \"the beaten zone.\" As one Japanese officer put it, during the Russo-Japanese War, the machine gun could \"be made to sprinkle its shot as roads are watered with a hose.\" Kenneth Koch, the poet and Second World War veteran, would later recall how, \"As machines make ice, / we made dead enemy soldiers\"; writing in the Times , Brian Van Reet, a combat veteran of the Iraq War, has described how he and the men he served with often \"fired nearly blindly, under the influence of a strange and numbing feeling of terror, rage and exhilaration. . . . Few of us really knew whom, if anyone, we had hit.\"\n\nThe unromantic reality of increasingly industrialized war wasn't likely to capture the public imagination, and so, in ads, dime-store novels, and movies, gun companies proposed a self-serving alternative history. Though Southern Plains tribes like the Comanches had been decimated less by firearms than by disease, Winchester described its Model 73 repeating rifle-a specially promoted gun that had been used by Billy the Kid and Buffalo Bill-as \"the gun that won the West\"; this legend helped the company to sell almost thirty times as many guns in 1914 as it had in 1875. Blending the military and civilian domains, Winchester advertised its weapons as \"For Military and Sporting Purposes\"; Colt marketed its Single Action Army model as \"the Peacemaker,\" a weapon \"for all who travel among dangerous communities.\" The Thompson machine gun, developed as a trench-clearing tool during the First World War, was advertised through images showing cowboys defending their ranches against marauders; ads proclaimed the machine gun \"the ideal weapon for the protection of large estates, ranches, plantations, etc.\" A deadly but inaccurate weapon of industrialized war was recast as a precision instrument for taming the supposedly savage frontier.\n\nOn a deeper level, the ads were political, recasting the American ideals of freedom and equality in martial terms. In gun marketing, self-reliance, respect, and freedom of movement were tied to the capacity to kill: \"Abe Lincoln may have freed all men, but Sam Colt made them equal,\" one advertisement read. The mythology of the hyper-violent West became so embedded in American consciousness that Teddy Roosevelt could construct a notion of American identity around it. In \" The Winning of the West ,\" he painted a portrait of hard life on the frontier marked by continual violence; the effect of this continual hardship was to \"weld together into one people the representatives of these numerous and widely different races.\" According to this view of history, American identity was in large part a product of violence.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Solomon Zuckerman, a scientist advising the Allies, made a surprising discovery. While examining an X-ray of a wounded soldier evacuated from Dunkirk, Zuckerman noticed that there was something odd about the way in which he'd been hurt: a grievous injury had resulted from a small metal fragment, barely larger than a pinhead, lodged in the man's kidney. Other soldiers Zuckerman examined had similar injuries. At the time, experts usually considered fragments from exploding shells and grenades dangerous only if they weighed more than a twenty-fifth of an ounce-and yet one soldier had been severely hurt by a far lighter shard, one weighing less than ten milligrams. Another's forearm had been shattered by a minute metal splinter. According to the science of ballistics, such injuries made no sense.\n\nZuckerman, who was born in South Africa, had trained as an anatomist and a zoologist. During the war, he'd learned to see horrific violence scientifically. He had studied the accuracy of bombing raids and the lethal effects of bomb blasts; his goal was to learn how much force living bodies could take, and where they were most vulnerable. His work had helped the Royal Air Force maximize the casualties caused by its bombs. At the same time, his steel \"Zuckerman helmet,\" worn by civilians and civil-defense organizations, protected British heads from falling debris during enemy raids.\n\nNow, working alongside Paul Libessart, a French engineer who had fled to England after the fall of France, Zuckerman turned to the science of wound ballistics-the study of the manner in which projectiles damage human bodies. In the mid-nineteenth century, the deadliness of a firearm had often been judged by how deeply its bullets penetrated into wood; in the eighteen-eighties, the metric had shifted to whether a bullet could kill a cavalry horse. It was obvious that some bullets and weapons had more \"stopping power\" than others, but it wasn't clear exactly how that power worked. Zuckerman wanted to solve the mystery.\n\nSoldiers tended to assume that stopping a rush required heavier, more powerful bullets. In the first half of the twentieth century, American researchers conducted experiments of dubious value designed to prove this point. They hung cadavers in the air and shot them while onlookers estimated how far the corpses swung; they shot cows and observed the effects. Eventually, the U.S. Army concluded that kinetic energy-a combination of bullet weight and speed-was the crucial factor in bullet lethality.\n\nThe Dunkirk injuries convinced Zuckerman that something was missing from this story. He began to think that the over-all kinetic energy of a bullet might be less important than how much of that energy was transferred to a body during impact. He and his team tried firing a steel ball into a phone book, then repeating the shot with the book placed behind a block of gelatin, which could serve as a proxy for a human body. By measuring how much the gelatin slowed the bullet, they could guess at how much energy it transferred. They found that some varieties of bullets slowed down more than others, transferring more energy. Later, the team shot small metal balls through the bodies of unfortunate rabbits. By means of a technique called shadowgraphy-the analysis of shadows cast by bodies in rapid motion-they captured the moment of energy transfer. In the split second after impact, Zuckerman wrote, the limbs \"ballooned due to the formation of an internal cavity.\"\n\nWounds caused by firearms had long been identified with a \"permanent cavity\" created when the bullet itself physically crushed the body's tissues. But Zuckerman's images captured a different kind of injury: a \"temporary cavity,\" formed when the slowing bullet transferred energy to the surrounding soft tissue. Just as a diver creates ripples as she enters the water, so a bullet transfers momentum to whatever blood, spleen, brain, or muscle happens to surround its entry point. These ripples produce blunt trauma, pulping tissue and breaking bones. This was how tiny slivers of metal could shatter a man's arm.\n\nZuckerman's discoveries came too late to change the way soldiers were armed during the Second World War. But subsequent military studies, including a groundbreaking report written by the U.S. military's Operations Research Office during the Korean War, measured a gun's lethality by looking at the maximum size of the temporary cavity. The report concluded that \"smaller bullets can be used to produce battlefield physiological effects at least equivalent to those of the present standard .30 cal.\" Although the Army remained committed to powerful, accurate, larger-calibre weapons, a small insurgency within it began advocating a novel idea known as S.C.H.V.: small-calibre, high-velocity. Adherents to S.C.H.V. proposed that lighter rifles loaded with smaller bullets could allow soldiers to carry more rounds and fire with less recoil, while still causing horrible wounds.\n\nThese arguments dovetailed with work being done by an engineer named Eugene Stoner, who was tinkering in his garage in Hollywood, California, during the nineteen-fifties. Shy, reserved, and opinionated, Stoner was a Marine Corps veteran who'd fought in the Pacific theatre; he lacked a formal engineering education, but had worked his way up through the machine shop at the Fairchild Engine & Airplane Corporation. By the middle of the decade, Stoner had begun to apply his experience with aircraft ordnance to firearms. Using advanced alloys and lightweight parts that were common in aeronautics, he started developing a firing mechanism for a new kind of lightweight rifle. Success was slow in coming; the barrel of Stoner's first prototype burst in Army tests. The weight of U.S. military opinion was in favor of a heavier, more powerful weapon, the M14. His fortunes began to change when one of S.C.H.V.'s boosters, General Willard G. Wyman, asked Stoner to modify his rifle so that it could shoot a redesigned .223-calibre round weighing roughly a tenth of an ounce.\n\nThe resulting rifle, the AR-15, could fire its .223 round at more than thirty-two hundred feet per second-nearly three times the speed of sound. Stoner later explained the advantages of its smaller bullets to Congress. All bullets are \"stabilized to fly through the air,\" he said, but \"when they hit something, they immediately go unstable.\" Tiny bullets, having a smaller mass, grow unstable faster, and tumble through the body, causing disproportionate damage. As a smaller bullet tumbles, it transfers its energy to your organs and creates shock waves strong enough to sever muscle; if such a bullet strikes your head, the pressure it creates can shatter your skull or squeeze brain tissue through your sinuses. It might also fragment inside the body, scattering small pieces of itself and increasing the damage.\n\nAs the Vietnam War began to ramp up, it was clear that U.S. soldiers faced a small-arms imbalance. American troops were armed with big, heavy, and extremely accurate M14 rifles; the North Vietnamese had AK-47s-sturdy, reliable weapons that children could, and often did, use. AK-47s were terribly inaccurate; expert shooters could struggle to put ten consecutive rounds on target from three hundred metres. Still, the U.S. military concluded that the M14 was an imperfect combat weapon. It had too much recoil to be fired effectively on automatic. Its heavy rounds imposed logistical limits on how much ammo could be carried. The journalist C. J. Chivers wrote in his book \" The Gun \" that, in fielding the M14, American soldiers fell victim to the \"romance\" of \"old-fashioned rifles and the sharpshooting riflemen who carried them.\" What they needed was an easy-to-handle assault rifle that could give them so-called fire superiority in close, frightening encounters.\n\nColt's firearms division took a gamble on the AR-15, buying the manufacturing rights for the rifle from Stoner in 1959 and embarking on a unique marketing campaign. The firm invited the Air Force Chief of Staff Curtis LeMay to a party at a gentleman's farm, where he fired the gun into a series of watermelons, creating bright-red explosions with each successful shot. The rifle was also tested on human heads imported from India, which were encased in ballistic gelatin and shot at from various distances. By 1964, the AR-15 had been adapted into the M16-an automatic, magazine-fed, gas-operated assault rifle with smaller rounds, which could be carried in greater numbers and caused less recoil. The rifle was adopted quickly, without the usual process of debugging and refinement, and soldiers found that it often broke down in the field, jamming or failing to fire in combat. Soldiers died with jammed rifles in their hands while the design was revised. Meanwhile, Colt posted twelve million dollars in profits in 1967; Stoner became a wealthy celebrity.\n\nAs the twentieth century drew to a close, firearms manufacturers kept updating their stories. Crime rates spiked, and so the image of the frontier hero fending off nonwhite marauders was revised for the era of vigilante-vengeance films such as \"Death Wish\" and \"The Exterminator.\" The National Rifle Association ran ads asking \"Why can't a policeman be there when you need him?\" and \"Should you shoot a rapist before he cuts your throat?\" In 1993, the shootout between members of the Branch Davidian cult and agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms sparked an anti-government wave. The N.R.A. added a new twist to the story, with ads that asked, \"What's the first step to a police state?\" Guns had once been tools for the frontier spaces that the government couldn't reach. Now, according to the gun lobby, they were a necessity for all spaces, at all times. When crime and authoritarianism run rampant, the Wild West is everywhere.\n\nCrime fell in the late nineties. So did gun production, with just over five million units manufactured in 1994, and under three million in 2001. The 9/11 attacks provoked a modest recovery. But 2008 brought a seismic transformation-the so-called Barack Boom . The election of America's first Black President coincided with what one gun-industry newsletter called an \"incessant consumer demand for high-capacity pistols and military style rifles.\" During the 2008 election, the N.R.A. warned that never in its history had it \"faced a presidential candidate-and hundreds of candidates running for other offices-with such a deep-rooted hatred of firearm freedoms.\" In 2013, despite crime rates that were lower than they'd been in decades, the head of the N.R.A., Wayne LaPierre , claimed that, under President Barack Obama, \"Latin American drug gangs\" had \"invaded every city of significant size in the United States.\" Gun marketing and political messaging merged more deeply, and in the last year of Obama's second term gun manufacturers produced a record 11,497,441 guns for domestic consumption.\n\nWhen John Billington came upon John Newcomen, his weapon did not promise him his manhood, or protection from his fellow-colonists, or escape from the coercive state under which he suffered. His gun did not claim to be the bedrock of his freedom or the means by which all men would be made to treat him as an equal. When Billington pulled his gun's trigger, the bullet he sent forth was a simple metal sphere travelling at less than half the speed of the bullets fired by today's mass shooters. It moved awkwardly through the air, and, in the body, it damaged only what was directly in its path. And it was a lone projectile. Billington's gun, which took many minutes to reload, was incapable of creating a beaten zone. He had a tool suitable for murder-but not mass murder.\n\nThe guns that today's Americans buy and sell by the millions are perfectly suited for that purpose. Civilian AR-15s differ from military versions because, in 1986, the Firearm Owners Protection Act banned the transfer or possession of machine guns; as a result, a mechanical block on civilian ARs requires the shooter to pull the trigger to release another bullet. But clever gun enthusiasts have figured out an easy way to bypass this mechanism: a device known as a bump stock uses the energy of the rifle's recoil to assist in bumping the trigger against the shooter's finger. The original military version of the AR-15 can fire eight hundred rounds per minute; an unmodified civilian AR-15 might fire forty-five to sixty. A version with a bump stock can fire somewhere between four hundred and eight hundred. In the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, a sixty-four-year-old man without advanced marksmanship skills or military training used a bump stock to achieve something like fully automated rifle fire, sending more than eleven hundred rounds into a crowd in the course of ten minutes, killing fifty-eight people and wounding more than five hundred. It would have taken Billington six hours to fire that many bullets.\n\nBecause a bump stock causes the rifle to slide forward and backward as it fires, it diminishes accuracy. In the aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting , this spurred some, like the Georgia state senator Michael Williams, to argue that the use of a bump stock \"actually prevented more casualties,\" because of the resulting \"inconsistency, inaccuracy, and lack of control.\" But statements such as this betray a basic ignorance about the history of guns and the reality of how they are used in battle. The bump stock effectively turns the AR-15 into a machine gun capable of area fire. This is how the Las Vegas shooter was using his weapon. As the retired Army Lieutenant Colonel Arthur B. Alphin explained, to the Los Angeles Times , the gunman \"was not aiming at any individual person. He was just throwing bullets in a huge 'beaten zone' \" filled with civilians bunched together in ways that soldiers had long ago learned to avoid. Williams's view is typical of a contemporary gun culture that sees the real-world damage caused by guns only through the foggy lens of a fictitious history; it puts a false emphasis on the accuracy of the shooter. The gunman's lethality-dozens dead, hundreds wounded-wasn't the result of skill but of the sheer number of rounds that his weapons could fire. He was not the expert long-range rifleman of Western lore but the machine-minder of the First World War, initiating a mechanical process designed to inflict death on an industrial scale.\n\nIn 1962, the Surgeon General of the U.S. Army, Lieutenant General Leonard D. Heaton, released a landmark study of wound ballistics. \"The message which this volume contains for the physician who will be treating the wounds of war is clear,\" he wrote, in the report. \"War wounds, in many respects, are different from those found in peacetime civilian practice.\" Heaton couldn't have foreseen a world in which more than twenty million AR-15s were in circulation within the United States. In Las Vegas, the gunman's high rate of fire made him more lethal, but so did the design of his bullets, which flew from his hotel room at supersonic speeds and then, upon striking their victims, began to slow and yaw, imparting their energy to bones, tissue, and organs. That night, of the hundred and four shooting victims seen at the U.M.C. Trauma Center, more than thirty had critical injuries; more than a dozen needed operations from orthopedists and cardiovascular surgeons. Chest tubes had to be inserted to drain internal bleeding; bowels had to be carefully resected by doctors working with needle and thread.\n\nAfter such killings, there's always a frantic parsing of the killer's motives. Was the murderer driven by hatred of women, by white supremacy, by \" replacement theory ,\" by Black nationalism, by ISIS , by anti-Asian hatred, by dreams of a race war, by bullying, by America's mental-health crisis, by a spiritual darkness at the heart of our society? Why the shooter chose to open fire is always, fundamentally, a mystery. But with mass shootings the why is ultimately less important than the how. The guns have no motive. They have only a purpose: to rend flesh as efficiently as possible.\n\nAnd yet it's not quite right to see a gun as merely an efficient machine. When Americans call for regulation of guns, it isn't the physical object in all its terrifying utility that blocks them but the deep attachment that their fellow-citizens have to their weapons and what they think they represent. Many of us walk around with an image of our country in our heads that we believe comes from history, when in fact it comes from marketing and mythology. It's that marketing and mythology which keep us saturated with weaponry, and which need to be rejected before we can make any enduring change.\n\nIn 1968, an N.R.A. spokesman told Congress that American gun culture was the result of a \"very special relationship between a man and his gun-atavistic, with its roots deep in history.\" But in truth those roots are shallow, and the fantasies underlying the \"very special relationship\" are often threadbare. As the horror in Uvalde unfolded, there were plenty of armed police officers, but there was little willingness to charge in against a barricaded shooter. The police have been called cowards for their hesitancy, but their reaction is unsurprising: despite the often militaristic rhetoric of police unions, the average cop is not going to be ready for a situation most United States marines have never faced. When we arm our citizens with such lethal weapons, we can't always expect uncommon valor.\n\nIncreasing gun sales have failed to counter increasing levels of gun violence: the Gun Violence Archive counts more than eight thousand gun deaths in the first half of 2022 alone. Perhaps the steady stream of death will eventually cause us to begin to reassess that \"very special relationship\" and open up new understandings of our own history. Until then, many Americans will keep living out a hundred-and-fifty-year-old dream-that, no matter what it is that frightens or enrages us in our complex, chaotic, and often unsettling world, guns are the answer. ♦\n\nThis is drawn from \" Uncertain Ground: Citizenship in an Age of Endless, Invisible War .\"\n\nAn earlier version of this article incorrectly described the origin of the phrase \"new and improved,\" and the firing mode of the original M16 rifle.\n\nThe dire wolf is back .\n\nWhy is the American diet so deadly ?\n\nCan we stop runaway A.I. ?\n\nWhen a virus is the cure .\n\nHow do you know when a system has failed ?\n\nA heat shield for the most important ice on Earth .\n\nThe climate solutions we can't live without .\n\nSupport The New Yorker's award-winning journalism.

      "text": "Guns, Trump, and the G.O.P.\n\nSome visions of how to live well in America are inextricably linked to owning a gun. Donald Trump certainly took that view recently, in a CNN town hall at Saint Anselm College, in New Hampshire, before an audience of Republicans and independents. Indeed, he presented guns as necessary for survival in a dark and violent landscape. \"Remember, we have seven hundred million guns-seven hundred million. Many people, if they don't have a gun, they're not going to be very safe,\" he said. \"Many of them would not be alive today.\" He condemned Chicago and New York for having tight gun restrictions, praised Brazil for loosening its laws, and called for arming teachers, many of whom, he claimed, are \"soldiers, ex-soldiers, ex-policemen\" who \"really understand weapons.\"\n\nTrump's event was so riddled with falsehoods that it hardly registered that his seven-hundred-million figure was wrong. The actual number of guns in the United States is estimated to be close to four hundred million (more than ninety-five per cent of which are in civilian hands). It's still a huge number-the U.S. has both more guns and more gun deaths per capita than any other wealthy nation, according to the gun-safety advocacy group Giffords. One in every three firearm suicides on the planet occurs in this country.\n\nYet, in the town hall, when a member of the Saint Anselm College Republicans questioned Trump on the subject, the student asked not about stopping gun violence but about his concern that, with all the gun violence and mass shootings in the news, politicians would act to \"repress gun rights.\" He also wanted to know how Trump would \"restore rights that have been taken from us.\" It was, oddly enough, one of the few moments when Trump appeared defensive, because the student seemed discontent with his decision, after a shooter killed fifty-eight people in Las Vegas, in 2017, to ban bump stocks, which can effectively allow semi-automatic firearms (which are readily available) to act like machine guns (the purchase of which is very highly restricted). Trump replied that he was aligned with the N.R.A. on bump stocks; in fact, the N.R.A. said that it was \"disappointed\" by the ban.\n\nThe exchange captured a number of factors that are converging to make this a particularly critical moment in the story of guns in America. One is judicial: New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc., et al. v. Bruen, the Supreme Court decision from last summer that struck down New York's permit requirements for carrying a concealed handgun, has set off a stream of litigation. The majority opinion, written by Clarence Thomas, holds that courts, when looking at gun laws, should begin by presuming that \"ordinary, law abiding citizens\" basically have the right to own whatever guns they want and to carry them wherever they choose. The burden would then be on the government to show that any limits on that right comport with Thomas's highly selective sense of the nation's \"historical tradition.\" Stephen Breyer, in a dissent, suggested that even the Justices in the majority might not know what laws could survive under the new standard. It's looking like he was right.\n\nFor example, the Saint Anselm student may not need to worry much longer about anyone being deprived of a bump stock. In January, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the ban was unlawful-a decision that the Biden Administration is appealing to the Supreme Court-and the Sixth Circuit did the same last month. And, a few weeks ago, a district-court judge in Virginia, citing Bruen, threw out a federal minimum-age requirement of twenty-one to buy handguns, which would make it legal for people as young as eighteen to do so; several similar cases are being heard.\n\nGun-rights advocates have also been pressing for new laws to make it easier to be armed. The result is a judicial and legislative free-for-all that is intersecting, disastrously, with the 2024 Presidential race. Last month, Governor Ron DeSantis, of Florida, who is expected to announce his campaign for the Republican nomination this week, signed a bill allowing most adults to carry concealed guns without a state permit. (Twenty-six other states now have similar laws.) \"You don't need a permission slip from the government to be able to exercise your constitutional rights,\" DeSantis said, according to Politico. He was speaking at Adventure Outdoors, in Smyrna, Georgia, an establishment that the Atlanta Journal-Constitution described as a \"firearms superstore.\" Georgia, of course, will be a battleground state in 2024. But even that reckless posturing wasn't good enough for some gun advocates in Florida, who complained that DeSantis hadn't done away with restrictions on openly brandishing a weapon.\n\nThe internal dynamics of the G.O.P. appear to be pushing Presidential contenders to increasingly extreme positions. Not that most of them need much prodding on guns: former Vice-President Mike Pence, who has indicated that he is considering running, has long been something of a Second Amendment fundamentalist. Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and a declared candidate, recently said that focussing on guns as a means to reduce gun violence was \"lazy.\" And, as the town hall demonstrated, even Trump is not exempt from the pressure. The Bruen decision is part of his legacy-he appointed three of the six Justices who signed the majority opinion. From the perspective of Republican activists, expanding on that victory is now his task, or that of whoever else wants to be President.\n\nYet there may be a parallel here to the right's overreach on abortion since Roe v. Wade was overturned. There is widespread revulsion at mass violence and the toll that it takes, particularly on children. A Gallup poll a few months ago showed that, although most G.O.P. voters don't want stricter gun laws, a majority don't want looser ones, either. In a number of blue states, there are efforts under way to pass gun-safety laws that supporters hope will pass scrutiny under Bruen. On Tuesday, for instance, Wes Moore, the governor of Maryland, signed legislation restricting the places where people can bring guns-not to schools, hospitals, or polling stations. (The same day, the N.R.A. sued to block the law.)\n\nIn contrast, Jim Justice, the Republican governor of West Virginia, signed a \"campus carry\" bill in March that not only allows guns for those with permits on college and university grounds but directs administrators to provide gun-storage units in dorms. The gun-law terrain has rarely been more unsettled. What makes the impending fight over gun safety, amid an election, all the more hazardous is Trumpism itself, with its incessant invocation of the prospect of political violence, and its message for America: if you want to make your way in this country, make sure that you have a gun. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Guns, Trump, and the G.O.P.\n\nSome visions of how to live well in America are inextricably linked to owning a gun. Donald Trump certainly took that view recently, in a CNN town hall at Saint Anselm College, in New Hampshire, before an audience of Republicans and independents. Indeed, he presented guns as necessary for survival in a dark and violent landscape. \"Remember, we have seven hundred million guns-seven hundred million. Many people, if they don't have a gun, they're not going to be very safe,\" he said. \"Many of them would not be alive today.\" He condemned Chicago and New York for having tight gun restrictions, praised Brazil for loosening its laws, and called for arming teachers, many of whom, he claimed, are \"soldiers, ex-soldiers, ex-policemen\" who \"really understand weapons.\"\n\nTrump's event was so riddled with falsehoods that it hardly registered that his seven-hundred-million figure was wrong. The actual number of guns in the United States is estimated to be close to four hundred million (more than ninety-five per cent of which are in civilian hands). It's still a huge number-the U.S. has both more guns and more gun deaths per capita than any other wealthy nation, according to the gun-safety advocacy group Giffords. One in every three firearm suicides on the planet occurs in this country.\n\nYet, in the town hall, when a member of the Saint Anselm College Republicans questioned Trump on the subject, the student asked not about stopping gun violence but about his concern that, with all the gun violence and mass shootings in the news, politicians would act to \"repress gun rights.\" He also wanted to know how Trump would \"restore rights that have been taken from us.\" It was, oddly enough, one of the few moments when Trump appeared defensive, because the student seemed discontent with his decision, after a shooter killed fifty-eight people in Las Vegas, in 2017, to ban bump stocks, which can effectively allow semi-automatic firearms (which are readily available) to act like machine guns (the purchase of which is very highly restricted). Trump replied that he was aligned with the N.R.A. on bump stocks; in fact, the N.R.A. said that it was \"disappointed\" by the ban.\n\nThe exchange captured a number of factors that are converging to make this a particularly critical moment in the story of guns in America. One is judicial: New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc., et al. v. Bruen, the Supreme Court decision from last summer that struck down New York's permit requirements for carrying a concealed handgun, has set off a stream of litigation. The majority opinion, written by Clarence Thomas, holds that courts, when looking at gun laws, should begin by presuming that \"ordinary, law abiding citizens\" basically have the right to own whatever guns they want and to carry them wherever they choose. The burden would then be on the government to show that any limits on that right comport with Thomas's highly selective sense of the nation's \"historical tradition.\" Stephen Breyer, in a dissent, suggested that even the Justices in the majority might not know what laws could survive under the new standard. It's looking like he was right.\n\nFor example, the Saint Anselm student may not need to worry much longer about anyone being deprived of a bump stock. In January, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the ban was unlawful-a decision that the Biden Administration is appealing to the Supreme Court-and the Sixth Circuit did the same last month. And, a few weeks ago, a district-court judge in Virginia, citing Bruen, threw out a federal minimum-age requirement of twenty-one to buy handguns, which would make it legal for people as young as eighteen to do so; several similar cases are being heard.\n\nGun-rights advocates have also been pressing for new laws to make it easier to be armed. The result is a judicial and legislative free-for-all that is intersecting, disastrously, with the 2024 Presidential race. Last month, Governor Ron DeSantis, of Florida, who is expected to announce his campaign for the Republican nomination this week, signed a bill allowing most adults to carry concealed guns without a state permit. (Twenty-six other states now have similar laws.) \"You don't need a permission slip from the government to be able to exercise your constitutional rights,\" DeSantis said, according to Politico. He was speaking at Adventure Outdoors, in Smyrna, Georgia, an establishment that the Atlanta Journal-Constitution described as a \"firearms superstore.\" Georgia, of course, will be a battleground state in 2024. But even that reckless posturing wasn't good enough for some gun advocates in Florida, who complained that DeSantis hadn't done away with restrictions on openly brandishing a weapon.\n\nThe internal dynamics of the G.O.P. appear to be pushing Presidential contenders to increasingly extreme positions. Not that most of them need much prodding on guns: former Vice-President Mike Pence, who has indicated that he is considering running, has long been something of a Second Amendment fundamentalist. Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and a declared candidate, recently said that focussing on guns as a means to reduce gun violence was \"lazy.\" And, as the town hall demonstrated, even Trump is not exempt from the pressure. The Bruen decision is part of his legacy-he appointed three of the six Justices who signed the majority opinion. From the perspective of Republican activists, expanding on that victory is now his task, or that of whoever else wants to be President.\n\nYet there may be a parallel here to the right's overreach on abortion since Roe v. Wade was overturned. There is widespread revulsion at mass violence and the toll that it takes, particularly on children. A Gallup poll a few months ago showed that, although most G.O.P. voters don't want stricter gun laws, a majority don't want looser ones, either. In a number of blue states, there are efforts under way to pass gun-safety laws that supporters hope will pass scrutiny under Bruen. On Tuesday, for instance, Wes Moore, the governor of Maryland, signed legislation restricting the places where people can bring guns-not to schools, hospitals, or polling stations. (The same day, the N.R.A. sued to block the law.)\n\nIn contrast, Jim Justice, the Republican governor of West Virginia, signed a \"campus carry\" bill in March that not only allows guns for those with permits on college and university grounds but directs administrators to provide gun-storage units in dorms. The gun-law terrain has rarely been more unsettled. What makes the impending fight over gun safety, amid an election, all the more hazardous is Trumpism itself, with its incessant invocation of the prospect of political violence, and its message for America: if you want to make your way in this country, make sure that you have a gun. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "The Dark Presence of Guns\n\nYears ago, when I was twenty-two, I was a policeman in Wellfleet, Massachusetts, on Cape Cod, and I had a .38 Smith and Wesson. It wasn't mine; it had been given to me on my first night of work, selected by the sergeant, who took it from a desk drawer in the chief's office, along with another .38. He measured them beside each other then decided that one of them had a problem with its trigger and gave me what he was pretty sure was the other one. Two thousand people lived in Wellfleet, and we were a fairly informal two-car department of nine men.\n\nSomewhere Chesterton writes-I think it is Chesterton-that you cannot reason a man from a position that reason didn't deliver him to. A few days later I was taken to the firing range and given six bullets to shoot at a hillside, which was all I could hit. It was the first time I had fired a gun, and by the time the chambers were empty I understood something: a gun was an object in which a power of nature was concentrated so forcefully that a person could use one and feel party to a solemn and thrilling mystery. The thought crossed my mind, unbidden, that if I pointed the gun at the man beside me I could end his life. I don't mean that I had a murderous impulse, I mean that I had become aware of the authority that the gun had given me. Absent its hard, mechanical shell in my hand, I had no special power. I was just a guy.\n\nFor a year I wore the gun on my hip, and it made me feel like someone of more substance than I was. One of the other officers used to say, \"As long as I have Mr. Smith and Mr. Wesson with me, I need fear no man.\" Sometimes to search a dark building at night where a door stood open, I held the gun in front of me. Once I caught my reflection in a picture window illuminated by a streetlight, holding the gun and crouching, and I was thrilled to see that I looked like a movie star in a role, or even someone who might have a movie made about him-someone knowledgeable about and attentive to the sinewy truths of life, like in a fable. I did stupid things with the gun. When I wasn't working, I sometimes carried it in the glove compartment of my car. (The others wore theirs under their coats or in holsters that fit into the small of their backs.) I didn't think I would run into a need to draw the gun, but I had a girlfriend who lived three hundred miles away whom I would visit on my days off. When I was pulled over for speeding, I would say to the cop, \"My registration is in the glove compartment, but I'm a cop and my gun is in there, too,\" and I would not be given a ticket. Once during the winter I had driven up to Provincetown on an errand and coming back along Route 6 a car of what I took to be high-school students, or maybe fishermen, drew alongside me. This was the late seventies, when some of the people who lived in Provincetown had hard feelings for the gay people among them. The boys, taking me for being gay, I suppose, began cursing at me and pointing to me to pull over, so we could fight. I pursed my lips as if offering them a kiss, and when they began screaming and shaking their fists, I pointed my gun at them, and they fell away like bridesmaids parting at the end of the aisle.

This happened one morning in Indianapolis. The husband had been a probation officer who came to the man's house for an interview. The killer shot him as he walked toward the front door, then left in a car. He drove to a convenience store where he shot the clerk when the man didn't hand over the money from the cash register fast enough. Over the next few hours he killed a few more people and kidnapped others in Indiana and Missouri-by the end of the day he was the most sought after criminal at large in America--and then he crashed his car beside a highway and ran into some woods and disappeared. In reconstructing the day, I sought out as many witnesses as I could find, and one was a man who had been in the store when the shotgun went off. He had had a handgun in his coat pocket.

      "text": "The Supreme Court Steps Back from the Brink on Guns\n\nOne day, in December, 2019, a woman known in court documents as C.M. was berated by Zackey Rahimi, a man with whom she had a young child, in a parking lot in Arlington, Texas. C.M. tried to get away, but Rahimi allegedly grabbed her and dragged her to his car and forced her inside, hitting her head against the dashboard in the process. Before he could drive off, Rahimi noticed that another person in the parking lot had witnessed his assault. He retrieved a gun from the car and fired a shot, according to government filings. (Thankfully, no one was hit.) In that instant, C.M. managed to escape. It's impossible to know what would have happened to her-or to the bystander-if she hadn't.\n\nAfterward, C.M. got a call from Rahimi, who threatened to shoot her if she reported him. She sought a temporary protective order against him anyway. Rahimi, who was then twenty years old, appeared in court, and a judge mandated that he stay away from C.M. and suspended his gun license for two years. She should have had reason to hope that such orders are worth more than the paper they're written on. And, on Friday, in the case of United States v. Rahimi , the Supreme Court at least partly affirmed that they are. By a vote of 8-1-the only dissenter was Justice Clarence Thomas -the Court upheld a federal law, Section 922(g)(8), which prohibits people subject to certain domestic-violence protective orders from having a gun. It was used to prosecute Rahimi after he violated his order.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts , writing for the majority, invoked \"common sense\": \"When an individual poses a clear threat of physical violence to another, the threatening individual may be disarmed.\" But this case would never have needed to be heard by the Court had the majority not veered sharply away from common sense in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc., et al. v. Bruen , a landmark 2022 decision, which Thomas wrote. Bruen threatened to invalidate any gun law for which there was not a model in the \"historical tradition of firearm regulation\"-whatever that means. Thomas suggested reaching back two and a half centuries. Owing to the Bruen decision, Rahimi was able to persuade the Fifth Circuit that Section 922(g)(8) was unconstitutional on its face, on the ground that there wasn't a founding-era law that would have disarmed someone in order to protect a woman like C.M. from \"domestic gun abuse.\" A woman in the eighteenth century might not have been surprised to hear that; one would think that a woman in the twenty-first could demand something different.\n\nBruen itself says that, even if judges can't find a \"historical twin\" for a challenged law, it may be enough if they can dig up something that is \"analogous enough.\" How similar is enough, though? Much depends on how such analogizing is framed. The Fifth Circuit looked for an analogous domestic-violence law, and stopped there. The Court, in Rahimi, ruled that the scope could be broader, and based on underlying tradition-based \"principles\": it identified eighteenth-century laws involving the disarmament of a range of people \"found by a court to pose a credible threat to the physical safety of another.\" (The judge who issued Rahimi's protective order had made a finding that he had committed \"family violence\" and was a threat to C.M. and their child, identified as A.R.) Among other measures, the majority decision cited colonial \"restrictions on gun use by drunken New Year's Eve revelers.\"\n\nThe Rahimi case is a clear illustration of the problem with Bruen: judges don't know where to start or what they're looking for when they're told to consult the past. There are five concurring opinions, each with a distinct view on how to go about that task. In one, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson describes a \"mad scramble for historical records,\" being weighed by jurists not trained in archival work.\n\nIn other words, while the Rahimi ruling is a relief-especially to anyone concerned about domestic violence-it still keeps the adjudication of gun laws in the dizzying framework of Bruen. Jackson, in her concurrence, notes that the clear message emerging from lower courts is that \"there is little method to Bruen 's madness.\" She cites a litany of pleas for guidance from judges around the country, adding that it will take a lot of litigation to even come up with a workable standard. Rahimi \"inches that ball forward,\" but \"there are miles to go,\" she wrote.\n\nUsing another sports analogy, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in his concurrence  that this Court is in the \"early innings\" of figuring out what it thinks about guns. It's a long game, then. It took seven months, from the time of the oral arguments last November, for the Justices to issue their decision in Rahimi. Among those awaiting the outcome was, undoubtedly, Hunter Biden , the President's son, whose lawyers have suggested that the law used to prosecute him, which is meant to keep those who are using or addicted to illegal drugs from buying guns, is at odds with Bruen, because, they claim, there is no close analogue in the founding era. The survival of the law in Biden's case, though, remains an open question; Roberts emphasized that the Rahimi decision is a relatively narrow one. Other cases have been waiting on Rahimi, too, including United States v. Quiroz, on the question of whether someone charged with a felony but not yet convicted can be forbidden from obtaining a gun; again, the issue is a sufficient historical analogue. (The Court has endorsed taking guns from convicted felons, a category that now includes Donald Trump .) A lower-court judge in that case described a \"predicament\" involving \"unknown unknowns: the constitutionality of firearm regulations in a post- Bruen world.\" Unfortunately, the post-Rahimi world is not much better charted.\n\nJudges across the country have been eager to test Bruen's limits. (According to a study by Giffords, a gun-safety organization, lower courts overturned thirty-one gun laws in the first eight months after Bruen was decided.) The Fifth Circuit judges, two of them Trump appointees, found in Rahimi's favor, even though they acknowledged that, in their words, he was not a \"model citizen.\" By that, they meant that he seems to have treated the protective order as, at best, a suggestion. He continued to contact C.M., according to filings quoted in the opinions. He allegedly threatened a second woman with a gun and then, in the space of two months, fired guns at cars and their drivers in two separate road-rage incidents; fired an AR-15-style weapon at the home of someone who had bought drugs from him and then posted comments on social media that Rahimi didn't appreciate; shot bullets in the air near children on a residential street; and shot in the air again after a friend's credit card was declined at a local Whataburger. (The many criminal charges resulting from that spree are at various stages, and are not directly at issue in this case; he's now incarcerated.)\n\nIn the oral arguments for the case, Roberts told Rahimi's lawyer, \"You don't have any doubt that your client's a dangerous person, do you?\" The lawyer replied, \"Your Honor, I would want to know what 'dangerous person' means.\" Roberts interrupted him to say, \"Well, it means someone who's shooting, you know, at people. That's a good start.\"\n\nRoberts wrote that \"some courts have misunderstood the methodology of our recent Second Amendment cases. These precedents were not meant to suggest a law trapped in amber\"-or, perhaps to his mind, to suggest that dangerous people on shooting sprees get to keep their guns. That's good to know, but the law is still trapped in ambiguity. \"Make no mistake,\" Jackson wrote. \"Today's effort to clear up\" that purported misunderstanding is \"a tacit admission that lower courts are struggling.\" She added, \"In my view, the blame may lie with us, not with them.\"\n\nHer colleagues appear to still be struggling, too. Both the majority and dissenting opinions in Rahimi refer to an ongoing debate about the relative weight of eighteenth-century and Reconstruction-era laws, while agreeing that this case won't resolve it. Kavanaugh's concurrence is a somewhat rambling twenty-four-page paean to tradition-based judging and the wisdom of Antonin Scalia. Kavanaugh's position seems at odds with that of Amy Coney Barrett , who prioritized ferreting out a constitutional text's meaning at the time of ratification over digging up old laws. \"Call this 'original contours' history,\" Barrett recommends-perhaps not the catchiest phrase, but one that may suggest a growing distance between Barrett and the Court's most conservative Justices. (There were similar signs in a partial concurrence that she wrote in the Court's ruling on a trademark case this month.)\n\nDuring the oral arguments, Justice Samuel Alito raised the question of how easy-too easy?-it is to get a protective order. But Rahimi wasn't arguing that he had been denied due process; he was arguing that Section 922(g)(8) would be a violation of the Second Amendment in any and all circumstances. Section 922(g)(8) only applies to protective orders which meet certain conditions, including the notice of a hearing and an opportunity to participate in it, which may prove to be important if there are other challenges to the law. (Justice Neil Gorsuch , in his concurrence, suggested that there could be.)\n\nThomas, meanwhile, in his dissent, argued that none of the laws that the majority cited was a close enough match for him. One of his objections was that some of them had to do with the danger posed to \"the public or government,\" rather than to particular individuals, such as C.M. or A.R., her child. For all of the pages and pages of opinions, there is a striking reticence when it comes to any real discussion of gender and intimate violence. An exception is Justice Sonia Sotomayor 's concurrence (joined by Justice Elena Kagan ), which offers grim statistics: a woman who lives with a domestic abuser is five times more likely to be killed if there is access to a gun; more than seventy people are shot and killed in the U.S. each month by an intimate partner.\n\nC.M. wasn't one of them. She wasn't even, technically, a party to this case-legally, it's between the federal government and Zackey Rahimi. But the case came to the Court because, in a parking lot in Texas, she got away from an angry man with a gun.

      "text": "Maybe Neil Gorsuch's Flip on Ghost Guns Shouldn't Have Come as a Surprise\n\nSign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nThe Supreme Court dealt a huge blow to the ghost gun industry on Wednesday, upholding a federal regulation that strictly limits the sale of these untraceable weapons by a 7-2 vote. In a surprise move, Justice Neil Gorsuch-typically an ally of firearm advocates-wrote the court's opinion affirming the government's broad authority to regulate \"weapon parts kits\" that can be easily assembled into working firearms. Although the rule in question was issued by the Biden administration, Gorsuch's opinion leaves relatively little room for the Trump administration to replace it with a watered-down substitute. The court's forceful decision and lopsided vote indicate that a majority of justices have little tolerance for a law-breaking industry that specializes in selling guns to criminals.\n\nAs Wednesday's ruling in Bondi v. VanDerStok makes clear, ghost gun companies largely exist for the purpose of sidestepping federal law. They mail their \"kits\" directly to customers, who can transform them into functioning firearms in less than half an hour with the help of a YouTube video. The Gun Control Act of 1968 directs gun sellers to conduct background checks and ensure that weapons are marked with a serial number. Yet ghost gun companies refuse to comply with these requirements-and frequently boast about it. One major seller assured buyers that they did not \"have to worry\" about a background check and could use their \"unmarked and unserialized\" firearm without any \"documentation\" that would link it to them.\n\nThe predictable result was an exponential increase in crimes involving ghost guns. As recently as 2017, Gorsuch wrote, law enforcement agencies submitted around 1,600 of these weapons for tracing. By 2021, the number rose to 19,000. In response, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives issued a new rule restricting their sale. ATF did not ban ghost guns. But it did declare that sellers of \"weapons kits\" must abide by the Gun Control Act, including requirements for serial numbers and a background check. Lower courts blocked the regulation, but the Supreme Court let it take effect in 2022 by a 5-4 vote, with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joining the liberals. The rule effectively shut down the ghost gun industry-which, after all, was built around the sale of untraceable guns for people who could not legally buy them. As a result, the number of ghost guns used in crimes promptly plummeted . (The gun that Luigi Mangione has been accused of using was a 3D-printed weapon, which is subject to separate regulations not at issue here.)\n\nNow the Supreme Court has declined to reverse that lifesaving progress, in as emphatic terms as anyone could hope for from such a gun-friendly institution . The legal question, as Gorsuch explained, is simple and straightforward. Federal law defines \"firearms\" as \"any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive,\" as well as \"the frame or receiver of any such weapon.\" Ghost gun kits \"may readily be converted to expel a projectile\" with no specialized knowledge. Most include an incomplete \"frame or receiver,\" the core component of a firearm. The buyer need only assemble the pieces and drill a few holes, then presto: It's ready to fire. Clearly, then, these kits fall under the federal definition of a firearm.\n\nWhen contesting the regulation, ghost gun companies argued that it simply made no sense to describe a box of parts as a \"weapon.\" And Justice Clarence Thomas adopted their position in his disgruntled dissent. But Gorsuch saw nothing unusual in this description. Here, he wrote-citing scholars of linguistics -that the term weapon is \"an artifact known,\" meaning it is \"characterized by an intended function,\" rather than by \"some ineffable natural essence.\" And English speakers \"sometimes use artifact nouns to refer to unfinished objects\" when \"their intended function is clear.\" For instance, \"an author might invite your opinion on her latest novel , even if she sends you an unfinished manuscript. A friend might speak of the table he just bought at IKEA, even though hours of assembly remain ahead of him.\" In each case, \"the artifact noun fits because the intended function of the unfinished object is obvious to speaker and listener alike.\"\n\nThat's all well and true. But linguistics aside, the ghost gun industry's own arrogance may have contributed to its downfall. Companies flaunted their products as easily assembled firearms, then claimed in court that they weren't selling firearms. Gorsuch pointed to one popular kit titled \"Buy Build Shoot,\" whose seller insisted that its device did not \"expel a projectile.\" The justice was not convinced. \"Yes,\" Gorsuch wrote, \"perhaps a half hour of work is required before anyone can fire a shot. But even as sold, the kit comes with all necessary components, and its intended function as instrument of combat is obvious. Really, the kit's name says it all: 'Buy Build Shoot .' \" He also included damning photographs of allegedly unfinished \"frames or receivers\" that are indistinguishable from fully assembled weapons; a buyer need only pull off plastic tabs and drill several holes before they can start firing. \"An ordinary speaker,\" Gorsuch wrote, might well call this product a \"frame,\" even though \"a little work is required to complete it.\" He added: \"Just look again at the second photo. What else would you call it?\"\n\nVanDerStok is, without a doubt, a major victory for the gun safety movement. A troubling question looms, though: How will the Trump administration react? Donald Trump has appointed Kash Patel, his FBI director, as acting director of ATF, and Patel is deeply hostile to firearm regulations. The administration could attempt to repeal and replace the current rule with a watered-down version; in his dissent, Justice Samuel Alito implied that it could do just that. Gorsuch's opinion, however, does not leave a great deal of room for dilution.\n\nIt is true, as Alito stressed, that the majority did not say all gun kits are illegal; rather, it held that \"at least some kits\" qualify as \"firearms,\" so the rule is not invalid \"on its face.\" That means Trump's ATF could attempt to free some companies from regulation by swapping in a narrower regulation. On the other hand, federal courts no longer defer to agencies: There is now only one proper reading of the statute-the one federal courts adopt. And SCOTUS has announced that kits readily convertible into ghost guns are guns subject to federal regulation. So if ATF tries to weaken the rule, it will face a strong legal challenge that it is violating the statute.\n\nAnother question arises from Wednesday's decision: Why did Gorsuch, along with Justice Brett Kavanaugh, flip his vote after attempting to freeze the ghost gun rule less than two years ago? Kavanaugh wrote a concurrence to explain himself: He was worried that \"the line\" between legal and illegal kits \"is not entirely clear,\" and could ensnare an innocent gunsmith who \"was not aware that he was violating the law.\" But former Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar assured Kavanaugh during oral arguments that the Justice Department would \"decline to charge someone\" in that \"kind of situation.\" And in his concurrence, the justice took her word that the government \"will seek to avoid that potential fair-notice problem by adhering to\" Prelogar's promise.\n\nGorsuch is a harder read. Unlike Kavanaugh, he sounded somewhat skeptical of the regulation during oral argument , only to enthusiastically embrace it on Wednesday. Why? Perhaps the government's strong textualist argument simply persuaded him that he was wrong. Or maybe he was won over by factors that seemed to draw in Roberts and Barrett from the start: the brazen, egregious illegality of the ghost gun industry and the lethal consequences for its victims. Although Thomas and Alito ignored this fact, ghost guns make everyone less safe, depriving the federal government of key tools to stop, investigate, and solve violent crime. All the justices are more cognizant of security concerns following the Kavanaugh assassination plot , home protests , and other backlash to recent decisions. The court recently beefed up its security funding and started closing the building, as well as the street behind it, during oral arguments.\n\nPerhaps this new reality helped Roberts, Barrett, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh to see that ghost guns put everyone's lives at greater risk-including theirs and their families. Luigi Mangione's alleged use of a ghost gun, albeit one subject to different regulations, heightened the nation's awareness of these extraordinarily dangerous weapons. Striking down the ATF rule would have guaranteed the senseless killing of more Americans and hindered law enforcement's ability to solve crimes. And beneath all the textualism and linguistic analogies, that bleak truth may lie at the heart of the court's decision.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Black Gun Ownership Is Growing. Can It Make Black People Safer?\n\nGun violence kills thousands of Americans every year, and that pain is especially sharp in the nation's Black communities. For a generation, a lot of Black political leadership has called for more guns to be taken off the street and has been closely aligned with gun control advocates. But a growing number of Black Americans seem to be choosing a different approach. During the Trump administration, Black gun ownership rates rose, and in 2020, of all demographic groups, Black Americans saw the sharpest increase in gun purchases at the start of the year. For people like Kenn Blanchard, advocating for Black gun ownership has been a crusade for decades. After serving in the military and holding a series of jobs in law enforcement, Blanchard branded himself the \"Black Man With a Gun,\" with a book, a website, and now a podcast with that name. He rejects the idea that gun control will make Black communities safer and has made it his mission to encourage Black Americans to view gun ownership as an important element of self-defense. On Friday's episode of A Word , I spoke with Blanchard about how he reconciles his gun advocacy with his faith, and how he thinks Black gun owners can make themselves safer from police violence. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nJason Johnson: You're a military veteran, a former law enforcement officer, and guns have been a part of your work for years. What led you from law enforcement work to being a gun rights advocate?\n\nKenn Blanchard: Entrepreneurism, actually. I tried to figure out, what could I do that actually would make a difference? What could I do that I could do without batting an eye? So I thought in the beginning, all I was going to do was become a gun instructor. I was going to hang out near a range, I was going to put up a shingle, and whenever a mom and pop bought a firearm for their home, I was going to be the guy you can call. I was going to make every home safer. I was going to have family classes. I was going to make sure that the undercover gun owner didn't exist anymore, because we kill a lot of people in our homes because we don't know about the firearm that we have. Hidden in the closet does not secure it the proper way. We haven't gone through the education with our kids that tell them that unlike Elmer Fudd, if you point this thing at somebody, your face will not just turn black and you'll be OK tomorrow. There's an education that has to go on, and I was going to be that guy.\n\nBut once I got into it, I learned that everybody didn't grow up on a country farm. Everybody didn't know about the hunting aspects and the responsibility aspects, and I had to go way deeper than just being the shingle guy, being the entrepreneur. I had to go into gun rights and the gun history. I had to show my people first that you have the right to do this, that it has been prevented since the creation of this country. That African and Native Americans were not allowed to have one of these things, and that has caused us to have a purposed ignorance, and that has hurt us in the long run. So I wanted to demystify this thing, and it took me back-I became an activist before I became an entrepreneur. So the money never came. I became the Black Man With a Gun because I was always advocating for safety and reliability and responsibility, and then getting beat up for sticking up for the person who actually owned one. And that's what started it.\n\nKenn, you've heard statistics about how the U.S. leads industrialized countries in gun violence and deaths, how Black men are disproportionate victims of gun crime, and how even legal gun ownership can potentially increase the chances of suicide. If I have a gun in the house and I'm having suicidal thoughts, my chances of going through with it and being successful are greater than if I just have pills or if I have a paring knife. Why do you think it's important to advocate for gun ownership before the community figures out how to handle the guns out there that we already have?\n\nEducation got us off the plantation and education can keep us free. If you have a problem, the firearm is not going to solve it. We do it on both ends. Gun people, people who are pro-gun, think that if they buy this bazooka, that they will no longer have crime, and that's false. And the people who don't have a firearm think that all guns are evil, and that's false. So it's a two-way street, and there is no solution because we haven't fixed humanity yet. We still don't know \"love thy brother and sister.\" We still don't have that part down. So when we're looking at fixing things, it still is education, it's information, and there's no shortage of that right now.\n\nI want to talk about that, because you're also a pastor, and there are people who have some particular interpretation of the Bible where they think that advocating for guns is somehow anti-Christian. Talk a little bit about how have you been beaten up rhetorically. Were you getting criticized by other clergy? Were you being criticized by parishioners, if you ran a church? How were you getting beaten up for being the Black Man With a Gun?\n\nWhen I first started, I was the janitor of this big church in D.C. I was the guy who came at 4 o'clock, opened the place up, got ready for the choirs, cleaned up things. I was also security for the church, so while little folks was in there practicing the choirs and whatever, I was keeping the thing straight. But while I was there, I was actually writing my first book, Black Man With a Gun , a book for responsible gun ownership, and everybody thought that was a cool thing-until I became a minister. And then they thought, well, how can you advocate for gun ownership? And I said, \"Easy-guns do not equal murder.\" My grandmother was the first gun owner that I ever knew. She actually shot a water moccasin within feet of me. She became my hero. My grandmother celebrated freedom on watchnight service night, New Year's Eve, and she fired that thing off in the middle of the night in Suffolk, Virginia. And that was the first gun ownership that I saw.\n\nSo I had to be able to explain that in the church. And then as time went on, I got pseudo-famous, being a pro-gun Black preacher, and that didn't go over too well as I became a pastor. Folks would snicker and make jokes about it until I even had foreign press come over and they wanted to see this pistol-packing preacher. My deacons weren't too keen on my notoriety for that thing. But I was trying to tell them that I am still a peace-aholic, still a peacenik, still a hippie. I just have been trained how to protect people. I just know about this thing called a gun. It's the heart of man that is desperately wicked. It is not the tool that you use.\n\nWhen we think about the arc of you changing from law enforcement to being a writer to podcasts and now clergy, did the shooting at Mother Emanuel Church have any impact on your advocacy? That was an instance where, just six years ago, in Charleston, South Carolina, the white nationalist went in, killed nine people after doing Bible study with them. Did that change how you talked about gun advocacy? Did that change attitudes in the Black church? Because I know a lot of churches started bringing in armed security on Sundays after that incident. Did you see that, and how did that affect you?\n\nI actually learned how it feels to be Noah. When you want to build an arc and it never rains, and then when it rains, everybody's running to you. I had been saying this stuff to ministers, I had been talking to my fellow pastors, and they were like, \"Yeah, yeah, you do you, Kenn. I'm not going to do this thing.\" And then now they were, \"Oh, yeah, man, we're going to the range next week. You want to come with us?\" Or \"I just got this whole police detachment to work undercover in my church. What are you guys doing?\" And I thought, you guys are already just gone past the whole thing I was trying to do before. That's where we went. I mean, it went from, OK, nobody ever said \"You were right\" or \"Can we take a class from you now?\" They just went in their own direction, and sometimes it was an overkill.\n\nSomething that you and a lot of Black gun advocates talk about a lot is the history of gun control in this country and how it is completely wrapped up in white supremacy and limiting Black people's ability to protect themselves or liberate themselves from state-sponsored apartheid. What do you think is the key nexus moment in Black gun history that people should know about? What's the aha moment that people who are like, \"Oh, I don't think we should have guns,\" should know about Black people's history with guns in America that would transform their thinking?\n\nI used to think that if you knew that they were the Black Codes, that behind many of the whole civil rights and the gun issue that we talk about now-we assume it's some good ol' boy somewhere-has a basis in Black history. If you talk about the Dred Scott decision, they wanted to deny Dred Scott the right to keep and bear arms, the right to citizenship. If you want to go to Cruikshank , then you're talking about the Black gun rights, voting rights, of a crew of people who were denied. If you want to go and look at Louisiana and North Carolina and all the places where our people have originated from, after they were snatched in here and lived, and see how the laws were made to forbid them from even having a musket ball or even a pit bull. If you could defend yourself, then you were outlawed.\n\nThen you know about the Great Migration, of how our people left the South and went to Detroit and to New York and all those places where there was industry. And to be more civilized, our relatives, our matriarchs, didn't want us to get in any trouble, so they said leave the guns behind, and we started becoming these undercover brothers with our firearms. We still served in the military, we still were police officers, we still hunted. So because we couldn't keep a gun legally at mama's house, because she wanted us to be civilized, we have a culture of not teaching safety, responsibility. You'll never become a convert until it's you. You can hear our history all day, until you become a homeowner, you become a parent, you have something to defend, and now you need a fire extinguisher in case a fire comes, in case of trouble. You learn that you're your own first responder.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Gun Control Is an American Tradition\n\nListen to What Next:\n\nBefore Robert Spitzer grew up to be an expert on American gun policy, he watched a lot of Westerns. He was raised on stories of an America built by rugged men with six-shooters on their hips ... even though that image was mostly made up. Spitzer has written five books about gun policy in the U.S., and he says that in the actual Wild West, gun laws were strict.\n\n\" They didn't want people walking around their new town with a gun strapped to their hip,\" he said. \"So you'd have to check your gun at the town hall or the sheriff's office or the clerk's office or someplace. I'm still drawn into those old stories, but that was not typical at all.\"\n\nUnfortunately, mass shootings have become all too typical. Recent tragedies like the Covenant School shooting in Tennessee, two separate shootings in Louisville, Kentucky, and the shooting at a birthday party in Dadeville, Alabama, have prompted fresh calls for gun reform, though it's unclear how much will come of them.\n\nBut America's gun policy history seems to be more important to many courts than the present. Last summer, the Supreme Court struck down a New York state concealed carry law because, in the view of the court's majority, it went against the original intent of the Second Amendment.  That ruling set a precedent that all gun laws should be judged against \"historical tradition.\" And in the year since that ruling was made, more than 100 state and federal gun laws have been challenged.\n\nCourts have struck down limits on gun ownership for domestic abusers, accused felons, and young adults. They've overturned bans on guns with shaved-off serial numbers and guns made with 3D printers. All were overturned based on the notion that the U.S. of the 1700s didn't have gun control.\n\nBut Spitzer says that actually, the opposite is true. \"It's difficult to think of any kind of gun law that you can think of today that didn't exist in some form 150, 200, 300 years ago. In many respects, guns and weapons were more strictly regulated in our first 300 years of history than in the last 30 years.\"\n\nOn Wednesday's episode of What Next , I spoke with Spitzer about America's real history with firearms and how it could change the gun laws of our present-and future. Our conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nMary C. Curtis: This all started with the Supreme Court case New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen.\n\nRobert Spitzer: It was a legal challenge to New York state's pistol permit law, a law that had been challenged many times in the past and always held constitutional. It had been on the books since 1911, actually. But a new, more activist and conservative Supreme Court was clearly open to the idea of striking down at least a part of the New York state pistol permit law. And what they were particularly interested in was what's called the proper cause provision. It wasn't enough in New York to just not be a felon, not be judged incompetent, and other things. You had to actually say, \"Well, here is why I want to have a permit\" and go through a lengthy process to get that permit. And local officials could turn you down if they felt that you weren't a good person to have a pistol permit.\n\nSo the court struck that down in the Bruen decision last summer, but they went beyond that even though they didn't really have to. They said for the first time in history that the Second Amendment right to bear arms extends to a right to carry guns outside of the home for personal protection. And they said something else. They changed the standard for judging the constitutionality of current laws by saying, \"Are there similar laws in past history\"-this takes us to the 1700s and 1800s in particular-\"that are similar enough to the current law that you can argue that those laws should be constitutional?\" Part of the problem is, Well, similar based on what? How do you determine what old law is appropriate to compare to a modern gun law or weapons law?\n\nRight now, we are seeing a flood of cases-over 100-that have bubbled through the courts already, where judges have made rulings, and they're going all over the place. Some are saying, \"Yes, these old laws are consistent with the current gun law that's being challenged\" or \"No, it's not consistent with this historical tradition.\"\n\nI was going to ask you to follow up on something you talked about a little bit, which was the domino effect that this ruling has had on state gun laws. You said we've had a flood of rulings after that?\n\nYes. For example, about 10 states have assault weapons bans on the books, and those are being challenged. That's not a surprise. They've been challenged in the past and have been upheld before the Bruen case came along. But all kinds of other laws have been struck down. For example, a Texas three-judge federal panel in February struck down a law that prohibited people who were subject to domestic violence restraining orders from possessing guns and called that law unconstitutional. Why? Because 200 years ago, if you engaged in spousal abuse, for the most part, unless you left permanent damage to the abused spouse, you were not subject to criminal penalties. And indeed, domestic or spousal abuse wasn't even illegal in the United States until you get to the end of the 1800s. So, is that a sufficient way to judge modern gun laws? I think there's a host of problems there.\n\nThat's the thing when you go looking into history: Some folks were property. I'm curious what kinds of questions are typically being debated and come up in these cases.\n\nThere's been a lot of discussion and analysis of laws that restricted concealed carrying of weapons, for example. Laws that restricted the open carrying of weapons, laws that restricted the brandishing or display of weapons, laws that restricted various types of weapons that were used heavily in fights and in duels and in crimes, such as long-bladed thin knives, especially the famous Bowie knife. Now, a knife is not a gun, but a knife is an arm. It's a weapon, and it's a good example of how various kinds of weapons were essentially prohibited in order to solve a criminal problem.\n\nAnd you could certainly argue that that's very similar to what states are doing now in restricting assault weapons, precisely because assault weapons have been used in very specific criminal categories, even though they represent a small percentage of all the guns in the country-in mass shootings, in attacks on police, and in right-wing militant, anti-government groups and drug gangs. So, that's the criminological problem, and that's how some states have approached it.\n\nAre there any other recent rulings that really make you concerned?\n\nThere are a great many of them, and again, they're going in different directions. I'll mention one example: A federal judge in Texas ruled 18-, 19-, and 20-year-olds had a right to obtain guns, whereas Texas had a law saying you had to be 21 to get a handgun. But a federal judge said, \"No, based on this originalist legal history of gun laws, there's no basis for saying that if you're 18, 19, and 20, you cannot get a handgun.\" On the other hand, a federal court in Florida ruled the other way on that very question. It was a slightly different restriction, but it was a restriction saying that 18-, 19-, 20-year-olds could not obtain assault weapons or perhaps long guns, more generally-I don't quite recall. And they ruled the other way, saying, \"Well, history does support that restriction.\"\n\nIt turns out that from the late 1700s to the early 1900s, at least 44 states had minor-based restrictions-that is, laws saying that if you were a minor, you couldn't have access to various kinds of weapons, including guns. So in fact, virtually all of the states had laws barring or restricting minors from getting weapons. There is actually a history in weapons law and gun law supporting that idea.\n\nSo overall, what are some of the real-world ramifications of all these cases?\n\nThe immediate ramification is to put lots and lots of gun laws up for grabs, because we're seeing an unprecedented number and variety of challenges to gun laws. Secondly, the standard itself is so vague and amorphous that judges are going off in all different directions. So, you've got two pretty complicated and difficult activities going on as a consequence of the Bruen decision. My larger concern is that the standard they've laid out in Bruen is an ultimately nonfunctional and not very sensible standard for determining whether modern gun laws are constitutional or not.\n\nAmerica's love of firearms is newer than people think, right? The argument that the Second Amendment authors were generally against gun control partly comes from the idea that guns have been a fundamental part of American society from the very start. You say that's an exaggeration. There may have been fewer laws regarding military-grade weapons, but that was because hardly anyone owned guns meant to shoot people. Most guns were for hunting, and handguns were still a luxury item for the rich.\n\nOur images of frontier life have been badly distorted by popular culture. And that distortion of popular culture dates back to the time of frontier settlement by Eastern European settlers traveling across the West. The West wasn't settled by or with guns, primarily. The West was settled by farmers, ranchers, tradespeople, political leaders. And was there gun violence? Yes. Were there guns? Yeah. But it was nowhere the popular culture image that so many people have today.\n\nHow have our attitudes toward guns changed over the centuries?\n\nEarlier in our history, there certainly was a gun culture tradition. There was a hunting/sporting tradition and the militia tradition where men of militia age were required early in our history to have, keep, and maintain military-grade guns should they be called up for a militia service. That's why that phrase appears in the Second Amendment, to keep and bear arms, because the British would disarm men for obvious reasons during the Revolution and immediately before. And that was at a time when the main military bulwark of the country was the militia, these part-time yeoman farmers.\n\nWe don't do that anymore. That's not how we conduct national defense anymore. And even so, the states and the federal government had laws requiring men to have and maintain military weaponry at their own expense; however, those laws were widely ignored. They were resented by most men. Most men were not interested in doing that or expending the money or the time or the effort to do those things. And these laws, generally speaking, had no enforcement mechanism. Today, there's still hunting and sporting, part of a tradition that goes back hundreds of years. But in addition, the gun has kind of been fetishized and politicized in a way that we really didn't see in our past.\n\nYou're right. The gun issue has become a proxy for so many other things that it's a symbol as well as an actual gun.\n\nThat is exactly right, and that's why you've even seen some members of Congress starting to wear lapel pins that are a pin of an assault weapon. And that's their political statement. Even as shooters continue to commit mass shootings using assault weapons because it's a favorite weapon of mass shooters.\n\nWe've seen this surge in mass shootings this year. There have been more than 100 mass shootings in the first 63 days of the year, which is more mass shootings than days. You've said in the past that when there were periods of high gun violence, politicians put more regulations in place. So what changed? Why can't we do that?\n\nWell, we could, of course. What's changed is the political landscape of the country. We are in an era of high polarization, of sophisticated, well-organized lobby groups that are able to exert a great deal of pressure on government behavior. That has resulted in the polarization of the states as well, where conservative states are going in a deregulatory direction and liberal states are going in a regulatory direction when it comes to gun laws. This gap is widening, and in the context of a time where the courts have been populated by a large number of very conservative judges with one of the litmus test standards for being promoted through the conservative judicial establishment being opposition to gun laws. That has buttressed these sorts of arguments and the outcome that we are seeing in our current politics.\n\nWhat lessons do you think we can learn from how America has dealt with guns in the past?\n\nOne takeaway I would emphasize is that when weapons in America collided with criminological or public safety concerns or problems, governments responded by enacting regulations. When problems arose that involved firearms, governments stepped in and imposed new regulations to protect the public and dampen criminality.\n\nWhat do you think will be the result of this historical interpretation of gun laws in the states, in the courts, and in our community?\n\nThe historical approach that the Supreme Court has laid out is so vague and incompletely defined, and so much tied to the past, that I think that standard will have to be amended in some important respects in the future. I don't know who, how, or in what manner exactly, but it's pretty clear already that the cascading numbers of cases that are popping up, raising all kinds of questions, are just not going to be satisfactorily answered until these standards are clarified. And that includes the history standard too.\n\nGet more news from Mary Harris every weekday.\n\nI don't know quite how to ask this, but do you think it will result in more violence, more mayhem?\n\nIt's hard to say. It depends on how this all comes out. Will laws ultimately be sustained or not? We do know that there is a strong correlation between more gun laws, lower gun violence, and death on the one hand, versus few gun laws and more gun violence. There's a direct-line correlation between more gun laws and less gun violence. And if those gun laws are really torn down, I would expect that there would be more gun violence.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Into the Woods\n\nLast year, on a beautiful fall day in the North Maine Woods, I sat next to my father's friend-really, my friend, by this point in my life-looking for ruffed grouse and moose. I'd known Jack for nearly 30 years, ever since my father won a coveted moose permit in 1994 and invited some work acquaintances along on our hunt. On this day, Jack and I rumbled over the dirt tracks sitting side by side in Jack's truck, scanning the road and the wood line. The conversation had been pleasant and trivial, but I knew what was coming. He knows I study mass shootings and gun violence in my job as a criminologist, and he wanted to know my take on it. When not wanting to tread into muddy political waters, \"It's complex\" is usually a useful, neutral insight in these conversations. That's what I offered Jack that day. \"You know, as I always say,\" he said, \"if I put one of my guns on the coffee table, I can guarantee you it isn't going to shoot anyone. It's the people, not the gun.\"\n\nI'm willing to bet that most people who care about the great gun debate in our country have had a conversation like this, whether they are the gun defender or speaking to one. I admit I'm generally frustrated by the gun debate because these kinds of \"logical\" arguments-on both sides-overlook so many shades of gray. No, guns on their own don't kill people, but they do allow a person intent on killing an easy way to do so. No, no other country has mass shootings on the scale that the U.S. does, but that doesn't automatically mean it's \"the guns.\" The U.S. is vastly different from any other country, even those on our continent.\n\nBut in this case, I considered my father's friend and what we were doing at the time. We had weapons lying next to us. Yet I could no more imagine this man being out of control or harming someone unjustifiably than I could imagine my dog suddenly asking me how I am doing. This man grew up around guns and has fired about any type you can think of; he and his late wife kept guns in the home for defense. But he is also a hunter, one who deeply appreciates and respects the weapons he has, and has undergone the training all hunters must in order to pursue the sport. Does that make him, for lack of a more precise descriptor, a \"better\" kind of gun owner? One less likely to contribute to our gun violence problem in this country?\n\nThis type of distinction is one that I've considered quite a bit when reflecting on the gun control/gun rights debate in the U.S., especially as hunting, as a practice, has declined in popularity, year after year. As a person who both studies gun violence and enjoys hunting, I find it interesting to consider what the relationship between gun violence and hunting might be. However, untangling this relationship is more difficult than one may think. In large part, arguments about guns and gun control focus on the number of guns in the country or state and attempt to correlate those numbers with crime rates. There is logic to both sides of the argument, of course. On one side, pro-gun people say that if there are more guns (particularly concealed handguns), then would-be ne'er-do-wells may be deterred from attacking strangers who they cannot be sure are unarmed. On the other side, pro-gun control voices say that the excess of guns in particular places means more opportunity for deadly events, whether accidental or intentional.\n\nBut these debates miss a lot. Owning a gun for the purposes of hunting is a fundamentally different thing than owning one for the purpose of killing another person. When I talked to media outlets a few years ago, and then in the aftermath of last year's mass shooting in Lewiston, Maine (where I work), puzzling over why the state has a high rate of gun ownership but (generally speaking) low rates of gun crime, I was overlooking the reality that a large portion of those guns are likely meant for killing wildlife.What's the difference? I would argue quite a lot.\n\nFirst, virtually all hunters must take a safety or education course. I distinctly remember mine, sitting next to my father, leafing through the fluorescent orange hunter safety book and listening to the presenter. I was impressed by the danger of guns and the importance of ensuring they are kept locked up when not in use.\n\nSecond, there are laws that apply to hunting that do not apply to other types of gun carrying. For example, in Maine, when driving the logging roads looking for game, I cannot have a weapon loaded in my vehicle. If we spot a partridge, we must stop the vehicle, step outside of it, load, and then fire. The purpose of this regulation is, of course, to promote safety, a concept that is of utmost concern for hunters. But if you are carrying a gun for nonhunting purposes? Then it's fine to have it loaded in your car. It's literally written into the legislation on guns and vehicles in Maine. So if you want to shoot a deer, you have to be safe about it. If you want to shoot a person, throw caution to the wind.\n\nThird, there is a symbolic difference between owning weapons for hunting and owning weapons for sport or defense. The former is not infused with the implication of violence against humans. The latter carries with it that possibility. There are attitudinal and practical reasons why this matters. When I buy a gun for hunting, the potential that a human being may be harmed by that weapon is a horrifying thought. When not hunting, the gun hangs in a carrying case, with a lock. Contrast that with a handgun bought for the purposes of self-defense. By definition, that gun is purchased with the thought that another human may be its target. And for a gun possessed for self-defense purposes, having the weapon locked and out of reach may defeat those purposes.\n\nWhat about the data? As mentioned, many analyses of guns and crime assess gun ownership overall, often using estimates or surveys to determine how many guns are in a particular area. For example, in a recent study on mass public shootings , I, along with several colleagues, used a proxy to measure household gun ownership-the proportion of the total number of local suicides that were carried out using a gun. The use of such proxies is not uncommon but is clearly a blunt way to measure gun ownership. There are some more fine-grained analyses, using survey data that focus on particular types of firearms, such as handguns. But there is no national registry of guns in the U.S., nor up-to-date data on the amount and type of guns in the country.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, an argument can be made that hunting would be related to a higher propensity to commit crime. After all, hunters kill animals and are used to handling weapons. Perhaps a willingness to take a life translates to a greater willingness to cause pain across species.\n\nDo the data show a connection between hunting and crime? Surprisingly, there is very little scholarly research on this topic. Some animal rights activists have purported to show that hunters are more likely to harm people because of their \" dominionism \" (enjoyment of mastery and control). Others, coming from obviously ideological positions, have used anecdotal examples to argue that hunting is linked to mass violence, suggesting that the sport teaches a sort of blood lust. Most of this work is of highly questionable quality. For example, the study on dominionism is full of suppositions and logical stretches. The argument put forth is that hunters are more likely to sexually abuse children because of this need for domination, despite research on child abuse pointing to other influential factors such as economic stress and previous maltreatment. Importantly, these studies were not published in peer-reviewed academic journals.\n\nThere are few academic studies that seek to determine whether individual hunting interests are correlated with criminal behavior. To legally hunt, a license or permit is required. This allows an evaluation of whether places with high rates of hunting licenses have lower or higher crime rates. The essay on dominionism argued that higher rates of hunters in New York counties were correlated with higher child molestation incidence, though later reanalyses showed no relationship . Prior to that work, the criminologist Chris Eskridge found that across the U.S., hunting rates were linked to lower murder, rape, robbery, and assault rates. Eskridge speculated that hunting may provide an \" emotional release \" for individuals, making them less likely to attack humans instead. Then there is some scholarship that finds no connection between a person's hunting background and their likelihood of committing violence against people. It is very difficult to make sense of these competing studies, but the general thrust of this earlier academic work is that hunting is not linked to higher rates of violence.\n\nOne recent study led by the widely respected violence researcher Patrick Sharkey found that shootings increased during the first week of deer hunting season. The purported connection was that more people are out and about with guns. However, most fatal shootings of people are done with handguns and virtually all deer hunters use rifles; in fact, in supplementary analyses, the authors found that the increase in shootings during the first week of hunting season was driven by handgun shootings. So it is a bit unclear what the study findings mean-but I find it hard to take away much from them about hunters' tendency to interpersonal violence.\n\nI recently tried to see this relationship in a new way. Current data on hunting licenses can be found within the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service website . I collected these data and transformed them into rates per 100,000 population using census data. Then I combined the data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on gun violence (again, using rates). In 2021, across the 50 U.S. states, there was a negative but not statistically significant correlation between hunting and gun homicide. However, there was a positive and statistically significant correlation between hunting rates and gun suicide rates across states. Of course, there are a number of factors, such as population density, political views, and religiosity, that need to be taken into account in fleshing out these findings. However, they highlight the main point here-not all gun ownership is the same, and any discussion of how the volume of guns in the U.S. is related to violence needs more nuance.\n\nTrends over time are also relevant in this discussion. Since 1982, the raw number of hunters has declined in the U.S. According to the General Social Survey , in 1977, 29 percent of people in the U.S. said that they, their spouse, or both hunted. In 2022, that number fell to 14.5 percent. Gun ownership and household presence of a gun has also declined since this time. However, the raw number of guns in circulation has been estimated to have steadily increased since the mid-20 th century. What does this mean for crime? Has there been a change in the meaning of gun ownership, from hunting and sport to identity and defense?\n\nOne thing seems clear: The incidence of mass public shootings has increased in the past 40 years, and 2021 was the worst year for American deaths by gun of any year on record. The decline in hunting means that many of the guns people own now are meant for something different than they did in the past. The vast majority of gun owners in the U.S. say the major reason they have a weapon is for protection, not hunting or collecting. Whether that means more violent gun crime or not remains to be seen, but it is a distinct possibility.\n\nIn the end, much more research is needed on the link between hunting and crime. But one thing is clear: The current state of the debate on guns and crime is in need of more context regarding the types of guns in circulation and the reasons why people own them. My friend Jack is right that a gun lying on a coffee table won't commit a crime. The real question is whether a gun used for hunting is less likely to be used for a crime than other types of weapons. There is sufficient reason to believe it would be.\n\nUpdate, Oct. 15, 2024: This piece was updated to clarify the date of the mass shooting in Lewiston, Maine.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Supreme Court Could Strike Down One of the Most Effective Gun Safety Measures in Recent Memory\n\nNext week, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in Garland v. VanDerStok , a case with life-and-death implications for gun violence in the United States. The justices will consider a rule issued by the Biden administration cracking down on \"ghost guns\"-fully functioning firearms that are disproportionately used to commit murder, domestic abuse, and terrorism . For years, ghost gun companies sold kits online to consumers that contained the parts necessary to build a handgun or AR-15-style rifle. Customers could purchase the kit without a background check, then build the weapon in as little as 20 minutes with the help of a YouTube video. These guns had no serial number, making them nearly impossible for law enforcement to trace when used in crimes.\n\nThe Supreme Court allowed new restrictions on the sale of ghost guns to take effect in August 2023, albeit by a 5-4 vote , with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joining the liberals. Now the court will decide whether to uphold the rule on the merits. On a new episode of Amicus , Mark Joseph Stern discussed the high-stakes case with Eric Tirschwell, executive director and chief litigation counsel of Everytown Law, the litigation arm of Everytown for Gun Safety. Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nMark Joseph Stern: Just to get one thing straight: The rule we're talking about here doesn't ban ghost guns outright, correct? It just says that if you're going to sell ghost guns, you have to follow all the rules that other gun dealers follow.\n\nEric Tirschwell: That's right. The rule requires that anyone who's selling kits that can be readily made into an operable firearm has to follow the most important regulations under the Gun Control Act, including putting serial numbers on every gun and doing background checks on every purchaser.\n\nLast year, a federal report revealed that the use of ghost guns in crimes has risen more than 1,000 percent in recent years. Can you talk about the sudden proliferation of these guns and their impact on violent crime?\n\nBack in 2017 and 2018, law enforcement was recovering 1,000 or maybe 2,000 of these ghost guns nationwide. We saw the number of recoveries start to jump around 2019, and by 2021, the number had risen to 19,000. By 2022, law enforcement was recovering something like 25,000 of these ghost guns at crime scenes across the nation. The industry's business model is fundamentally premised on circumventing gun laws, selling to people who otherwise could not purchase firearms. We're talking about violent felons, minors, and domestic abusers, who can go online and buy \"a pistol in a box,\" which is the term the industry used to describe these kits. Not surprisingly, these became the weapon of choice for people who couldn't get their hands on a firearm legally and wanted to put them to ill use.\n\nIt seems like the sellers frequently boasted about the fact that they were skirting the law or exploiting a loophole. The briefs in this case feature websites that told consumers: \"Normally you might not be able to buy a gun, but from us, you're in the clear.\"\n\nAbsolutely. A large number of sellers online were promoting the fact that there's no background check, no paper trail. One ghost gun seller actually put an image on the receiver-the core component of an AR-15-that had an image of a hand with a middle finger up. It said: \"Here's your serial number.\" I think that says it all about what the industry thinks about whether it should be subject to regulation.\n\nLower courts initially blocked the ghost gun rule, but the Supreme Court allowed it to take effect last year. It's been enforced for some time now. What has the impact been on the ground?\n\nThe early data that has emerged just over the past six to nine months shows that the number of recoveries of ghost guns has started to come down, sometimes in significant ways. It clearly shows that this new rule-along with other pressure on the industry, including some lawsuits that my firm filed against some of the biggest players in the industry-is working. These things have basically shut down this industry right now. The question in front of the Supreme Court is: Are they going to keep it shut down and keep use of ghost guns in crimes on a downward trajectory? Or are they going to open that box up? If they do reopen that box, it will have really tragic public-safety implications.\n\nI feel like most gun cases reach the Supreme Court with primarily theoretical implications. Nobody knows exactly what will happen if the court strikes down this or that law. But here, we have a real-world experiment where there is a rule that has taken effect and it had an immediate and meaningful impact on reducing violent crime. It is reducing crime in cities that had seen a surge of murders and other violent offenses committed with ghost guns. Now the stakes for the Supreme Court are, or should be, very clear and concrete. We have very clear evidence that if the court strikes down this rule, it will essentially revive some of the companies that have been basically put out of business. It will allow these companies to keep flooding the streets with ghost gun kits and will all but ensure that people will needlessly die being shot by weapons that should have remained illegal if SCOTUS had done its job right.\n\nThat's absolutely right. We are talking about tens of thousands of these guns per year recovered at crime scenes at their peak. They have a heavy impact on teenagers in particular because a teenager can go online from the comfort of their bedroom and, with just a credit card or even a gift card, they can get a gun-building kit delivered to their doorstep. They can put it together without much skill at all, and suddenly they have a functioning pistol that they could not walk into a gun store and purchase because they're too young. Predictably, before the rule, we saw teenagers doing terrible things with these weapons. We represented two families who each lost a son to a ghost gun shooting; another teenager showed up to what was supposed to be a fistfight to settle a beef, but he showed up with a ghost gun that he ordered online and murdered two teens.\n\nWe've also seen law enforcement being targeted by criminals with ghost guns. We had a case in California where two Los Angeles deputy sheriffs were ambushed while sitting in their patrol car by someone with a long criminal record. Yet he was able to get a ghost gun and inflict grievous injuries on these officers. This is really a law-and-order issue. You know, when the Biden administration announced the new rule in 2022, the NRA claimed it would do nothing to address violent crime. That was a preposterous assertion-it was absolutely wrong. All the evidence shows that this rule has helped reduce violent crime and will continue to do so if the Supreme Court lets it.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "It's Fine for Kids to Play With Pretend Guns\n\nIllustration by Robert Neubecker\n\nMy 4-year-old can turn almost anything into an imaginary gun. A piece of wooden toy railroad track? Sure, it'll take care of the bad guys. Although my son isn't always acting out battle scenarios, he does it enough to make me wonder: Is this kind of play normal? Given this country's devastating record of gun violence, should I be stopping him? Does allowing gun play somehow increase the risk that he will one day become a victim or an instigator of gun violence?\n\nFirearms were the second leading cause of death in 2014 for American children between the ages of 1 and 19. On average, eight kids were shot every day . Most children who are killed by firearms die in their homes, having been shot by their parents' guns. Worse, research suggests that no matter how adamantly parents talk to their kids about staying away from any real guns, most will jump at a chance to play with them anyway. Regardless of where we live or how safe we feel, parents need to take steps to protect their kids from gun violence. But the good news is that it is perfectly normal for kids to pretend to play with guns from time to time. Aggressive play is not just part of growing up-research suggests that it can even help kids self-regulate better in real life.\n\nLet's start with real guns, which are the true threat to your child's safety. If you keep a gun in your home, store it in a locked place, unloaded, with the ammunition stored in a separate location. That's because more than three-quarters of kids-even young ones under the age of 10-know where parents keep their guns, even when parents don't think they do. If you're thinking, But the whole point of having a gun is to keep it loaded and easily accessible in the event of a home invasion, consider that for every one time a gun in the home is successfully used for self-defense, guns in the home will have caused four unintentional shootings, seven criminal assaults or homicides, and 11 attempted or completed suicides. In other words, a gun kept unlocked and loaded for self-defense is much, much more likely to hurt family members than protect them. (For more on how guns kept in the home threaten children, read Evan DeFilippis and Devin Hughes 2014 Slate piece .)\n\nEven if you don't own a gun, you still need to take steps to protect your kids while they're in other people's homes. Certainly, talking to them about guns-how dangerous they are, why they should never be played with-is not a bad idea, but it's simply not enough. Marjorie Sanfilippo, a psychologist at Eckerd College in Florida, has conducted a series of terrifying experiments illustrating that boys and girls simply don't listen when you warn them about guns. In her first study , published in 1996, she let pairs of 4- to 6-year-old children play in a room with various toys including real and toy guns. Then she and a local police officer spent 30 minutes educating one of the children in each pair about the dangers of guns-among other things, that they are never to be touched without a parent's permission and that kids should always find an adult if they come across one. A week later, she put the pair of children back together in the same room again to play. \"What we found is that the children who had the lessons played with the guns just as much as the children who didn't-and they didn't leave the area to get an adult, and they didn't stop the friend from playing with it. It was as if they'd gotten no lessons whatsoever,\" she recalls. In a subsequent experiment , she enrolled one group of preschool children in a weeklong firearm-education session while another group of kids had no training. Again, the intervention had no effect on the children's likelihood of playing with guns. \"There's no amount of teaching that can overcome that natural curiosity about guns,\" she concludes.\n\nSo if you don't want your kids to play with guns, you have to make sure they don't find any. And this means that when your child goes into another person's home, you need to ask whether any guns they have are stored safely. If the thought of posing this question makes you uneasy-maybe you worry about offending the other person-consider that \"people who own guns are often more comfortable having these conversations than people who don't,\" says Jennie Lintz, director of public health and safety at the nonprofit Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence. If you still feel weird, try it this way: \"Call the parent and say, 'My son is fascinated with guns-he's going through a phase-so I just want to make sure that you don't have any real guns accessible.' Because then you're saying, 'I want to protect your child, too,' \" Sanfilippo says. If guns aren't stored in a way that makes you comfortable, invite the child over to your home instead.\n\nLet's move on to how kids play. Although both boys and girls display aggression in their play, the fact is that boys do it much more, particularly when they're playing with other boys. (The causes for these differences are debated.) Most of the time, this kind of play is normal and may even be useful. In a 2013 study , researchers observed how preschoolers played by themselves with various objects and then watched these same children in their classrooms. They found that the more oral aggression the kids displayed-for example, pretending that stuffed animals bit or ate each other-the less aggressive their behavior was in the classroom. The researchers speculate that when kids incorporate violence into their pretend play, they may learn how to control real violent impulses and regulate their emotions. Another recent paper penned by academic psychologists went so far as to argue that preventing kids from play fighting could interfere with their social, emotional, physical, cognitive, and communicative development. Although we can't be certain that this relationship is causal-it's possible that kids who are more socially mature simply tend to play more aggressively-one thing is clear: \"Aggressive behavior in pretend play is different than actual aggressive behavior in real life,\" says co-author and Case Western Reserve University child psychologist Sandra Russ.\n\nCertainly, though, not all aggressive play is normal or healthy. If your child actually hurts other kids when he plays, that might be a sign of an impulse-control problem and may be worth discussing with a pediatrician. It also matters whether your child uses his imagination. If he simply takes one toy and uses it to bash another toy for five minutes straight, and there doesn't seem to be any kind of narrative, then that could be a cause for concern, too.\n\nIndeed, the more creative a child's pretend play is, the better-so it's not necessarily good for your child to play out the same scripted scene from The Lego Movie over and over again. Instead, encourage her to improvise. Ask her questions and prompt her to create new stories. \"Imitation is not really play, and when it's not really play, children are not really working on the things they need to work on,\" says Diane Levin, an early education specialist at Wheelock College in Boston and the author of The War Play Dilemma. Levin adds that if there are aspects of your child's play that make you uncomfortable-maybe your kid is always talking about \"killing\" bad guys and that makes you cringe-try to engage and perhaps even redirect your child, although it may not always work. \"Say, 'It sounds like [the bad guy] did something really bad-what did he do?' Or 'Is there anything else you can do besides killing?' Or 'Is there anything we can do to help the bad guy become good?' Take the lead from your child, but if he dismisses you, then accept it.\"\n\nAs for gun play specifically: \"Kids are going to make guns out of sticks and clay and that's fine-that's pretend,\" Russ says. It's best not to stop them, because doing so might shame them. Plus, Sanfilippo says, \"if you make it too big of a deal about it, they're going to want to do it more, and they're going to do it behind your back.\"\n\nAnd while most experts say that toy and squirt guns are fine, Russ points out that for the small subset of children who have difficulty separating play from reality, or who have impulse-control problems, realistic-looking toy and squirt guns may not be such a good idea.\n\nSo pretend gun play is generally A-OK and might even make kids less violent-hooray, one less gun-related thing to worry about. And in fact, it might be something to celebrate for another reason. When your kid is fighting \"bad guys,\" he's probably pretending to be a good guy, even a superhero, and that's empowering and heroic. \"It's the way boys deal with being in a group and deal with the anxiety of being little boys,\" says child psychologist Michael Thompson, co-author of Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys . \"They want to be strong and big, and they want to do it with a stick or a sword.\" Or, obviously, a gun.\n\nIn addition to the sources mentioned, The Kids would like to thank Alex Dubroff.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Originalism Is One Reason Why America Has Such a Gun Problem\n\nThis is part of How Originalism Ate the Law , a Slate series about the legal theory that ruined everything.\n\nBy the end of June, the U.S. Supreme Court will issue its decision in United States v. Rahimi , a case in which a man subject to a domestic violence restraining order says he has a constitutional right to keep his gun and that a federal law disarming abusers violates the Second Amendment. The court will also decide Garland v. Cargill , a challenge to a law classifying semiautomatic weapons equipped with bump stocks as machine guns because they enable automatic fire.\n\nLast year, more than 40,000 people were killed by guns in the United States. Gun violence is now the No. 1 killer of children in America, and every month, about 70 American women are murdered by gun-wielding intimate partners. If her abuser has a gun, an abused woman is five times more likely to be killed by him.\n\nAmericans support commonsense gun control measures, with more than 80 percent of adults-including 79 percent of gun owners-saying that guns should be removed from people under domestic violence restraining orders. Close to the same percentage of Americans back laws that require gun owners to lock up their weapons. The United States is the only wealthy, functional peacetime state not plagued with gang violence that still has gun violence rates this high. The reason is our shockingly lax gun laws and the number of guns that have been allowed to proliferate as a result.\n\nWhy are we stuck with such lax gun safety laws when stricter regulation is so popular? Congress and state legislatures have struggled to do much about these pervasive and deadly problems in large part because of our current Supreme Court-and in particular its past 16 years of radical pro-gun jurisprudence. Since 2008, the court has radically departed from centuries of case law on gun regulations and the Second Amendment, making it astoundingly difficult for lawmakers to implement even the most basic and commonsense of gun laws. The departure had to do with the rapid rise of originalism , the legal theory that claims to interpret the Constitution according to its \"public meaning\" at the time of ratification. When it comes to guns, this effort stems largely from a 2008 case that has proved to be the original sin of originalist constitutional theory: District of Columbia v. Heller .\n\nHeller centered on a (frankly poorly written) D.C. law regulating handgun ownership that functionally made it difficult for private individuals in the District to own handguns. A police officer, who wanted a handgun both on the job and at home, sued. And for the first time, the conservatives of the Supreme Court discovered an individual right to bear arms within the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution-and had the gall to call this a return to the founders' intent.\n\nClaiming that there is a singular, discoverable intent or meaning that can be derived from the founders' words is bizarre. If you have ever followed the passage of a law through a statehouse or Congress, you have seen that many different people have many different ways of understanding and interpreting the very words they are putting into legal effect; if you have ever read the Federalist Papers or even recall much of your high school American history class, you may remember that there was robust conflict and compromise over the Constitution, including serious disagreement as to what various words and ideas might actually mean. Scholars still argue over the meaning of the Ten Commandments, which are ostensibly the word of God himself. Historical political leaders, just like present ones, were not a unified bloc in full agreement over the limitations and entire meanings of the laws they were passing. They were human beings using the English language, with all of its limitations. The founders were also keenly aware that they were setting forth rights that would govern not just in their today but, they hoped, in a faraway tomorrow, and that they would need to be interpreted in an ever-changing country.\n\nAll of this undercuts the justification for originalism itself, as does the work of the actual judges who implement it. Much has been written about the utter historical illiteracy of originalist federal judges, who uniformly cherry-pick convenient bits and pieces of the past while simply disregarding the parts of the historical record they dislike. The real scam-other than the theory itself-is the way in which conservative activists have convinced much of the public that originalism is a careful, buttoned-up theory that vows fealty to the Constitution.\n\nHeller remains perhaps the most influential originalist decision of all time, penned by the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. To take a step back, the Second Amendment itself reads: \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" As historian and author Joshua Zeitz wrote in Politico , historians are clear that \"in the 18th century, when Congress passed and the states ratified the amendment ... the right to bear arms was inextricably connected to the citizen's obligation to serve in a militia and to protect the community from enemies domestic and foreign.\" Rights that were more individualized-to speak freely, to practice one's religion without state interference-were separated out and included no note of reciprocal community obligations. James Madison himself, Zeitz writes, \"twice introduced state legislation in Virginia that would impose penalties on any individual who 'bear[s] a gun out of his inclosed ground, unless whilst performing military duty.' \" In other words, the guy who wrote the Constitution didn't think it proscribed infringing upon an individual right to bear arms.\n\nIt is only through an intentional ignorance of this history that one might hold, as Scalia did in Heller , that the Second Amendment \"guarantee[s] an individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation.\"\n\n\"I think the best way of thinking about Heller is it's a classic pincer movement, where you have a well-coordinated effort among what I affectionately call the originalism-industrial complex, which includes the Federalist Society and libertarian and right-wing think tanks like Heritage and AEI and Hoover, and then a very popular grassroots movement for gun rights,\" Fordham University professor and legal historian Saul Cornell said. \"Together, the combination of having this super well-funded, super-organized group of lawyers and activists is one part of the foundation for how you can have a decision like Heller .\"\n\nLawyers, Cornell said, often work backward, looking for historical evidence to bolster one claim or another, rather than starting with the historical record itself. Originalists, he said, \"have no historical rigor, very few of them have any serious training in history, and they really do seem to think, The Constitution is written in English, I'm a lawyer , and then we're off to the races.\" By the mid-2000s, judges like Scalia and other conservative originalists saw their cause bolstered by a well-funded effort to inject a new individual-right interpretation of the Second Amendment into various law reviews. Many of these articles were written by the same small number of pro-gun academics, many of the law reviews they appeared in were not particularly prestigious, and none were peer-reviewed. But once an idea is in the law review ecosystem, Cornell said, it starts to matter because \"you can cite it\" and it looks legitimate. Toward the tail end of the 20 th century, the National Rifle Association was also pushing aggressively into American politics, and gun rights had become an ascendant issue in many conservative think tanks, often thanks to funding from the NRA. Within the network of right-wing advocacy organizations, think tanks, politicians, and legal training grounds, a novel and radical theory was taking hold that gun rights should be virtually unrestricted.\n\nFor all that Heller did to rewrite the modern interpretation of the Second Amendment, Scalia's opinion still didn't go quite far enough for the most aggressive gun rights activists. It did not, for example, offer a clear path for courts to evaluate (and strike down) other gun laws. So lower courts implemented a test for those new laws, looking at what legislatures intended with any particular gun law and whether the burdens that that law imposed were out of proportion to the important public safety interests at hand. But this, an even more conservative Supreme Court said in 2022's New York Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen , was wrong; instead, the court held that \"to justify a firearm regulation the government must demonstrate that the regulation is consistent with the Nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation.\" In addition to establishing this new, almost-impossible-to-meet standard, the Bruen case struck down the New York law, which was from 1911. A 111-year-old law was, apparently, not itself evidence of the nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation. (The court didn't bother to tell us what time frame does count, except that everything after 1900 is irrelevant.)\n\nAnd so this is where we are: Any efforts to regulate 21 st -century weapons in 21 st -century America must have very old historical equivalences: \"A distinctly similar historical regulation\" is evidence that a gun law may be constitutional. But \"if earlier generations addressed the societal problem, but did so through materially different means,\" that might be evidence that new gun regulations are not in fact constitutional. This is crazy-making and stymies any effort to create better laws to address long-standing problems, such as the proliferation of semiautomatic weapons that kill so many Americans each year. The court seems to be saying that the apocryphal Einstein adage about the definition of insanity-doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results-is apparently now the only legitimate way to regulate guns in the U.S.\n\nThe other problem with this hardcore originalist interpretation? It confines much of lawmaking to an era in which most Americans had no say in the political process and forecloses upon commonsense and popular legislation, threatening public trust in the Supreme Court. These problems, among many others, are particularly apparent in Rahimi , involving gun rights for accused domestic abusers found dangerous enough to merit a restraining order. At the time the Constitution was ratified, women couldn't vote, let alone petition the courts for a domestic violence restraining order. As far as anyone can tell-and Supreme Court litigators have certainly looked-there were no laws in 18 th - or 19 th -century America stripping gun ownership rights from accused domestic abusers, in part because wife-beating was not generally considered a serious crime. \"Under Bruen's originalist test, Rahimi should be an easy case,\" Nelson Lund, a professor at George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School, wrote in the New York Times. \"The government has not informed the Supreme Court of a single pre-20 th -century law that punished American citizens, even those who had been convicted of a violent crime, for possessing a gun in their own homes. Not one.\"\n\nBack then, the government did disarm people it deemed dangerous, including tax protesters and Quakers. Abusing your wife, child, or another member of your household, though, was not exactly a hotly contested act. It was sometimes frowned upon but often allowed.\n\nHolding that people under domestic abuse restraining orders can still possess guns would be wildly unpopular. It could reveal this Supreme Court, and originalism itself, to be unserious, vacuous, and ill-suited for the task of interpreting legal meaning and determining the laws that apply nationwide today .\n\nLuckily for the conservatives of this court, they have already determined that originalism can be fudged. Just look at Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization , which overturned Roe v. Wade and ended the era of legal abortion nationwide. At the time of the country's founding and under English common law, abortion was, in fact, generally permitted until \"quickening,\" or when a pregnant woman felt her fetus move-which tends to be somewhere between 15 and 20 weeks of pregnancy. States did not begin to ban abortion until 1828. And yet, in Dobbs , the majority opinion held \"that the right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nation's history and tradition.\"\n\nMany court watchers expect to see similar originalist gymnastics in Rahimi . The thing about cherry-picking historical data points, after all, is that in a vast country with 50 states and several centuries of legislating and lawmaking, a highly motivated and historically untrained judge can find a lot to rely on to support just about whatever conclusion they would like to draw. But a reasonable outcome in Rahimi -the court's determining, for example, that \"dangerousness\" has enough historical precedent to be a legitimate basis for regulating an individual's right to have a gun-does not mean rejecting originalism. It's just further evidence of its convenient malleability.\n\n\"This court is not going to give up the new religion,\" Cornell, the legal historian, said. \"Originalism is not a theory. It's an ideology. And there are no historians who are originalists, which should tell you something.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Two Guns Per Person\n\ntomass2015/iStock\n\nThe 27 words of the Second Amendment don't say anything about how many guns someone can own in America. Neither do the other 7,564 words in the Constitution . Yes, this is a facile point to make. A lot of things-including rights, responsibilities, and government powers we take for granted-aren't itemized in the Constitution. While saying you can't find something doesn't necessarily mean anything, conservatives use this trick all the time. Consider marriage equality, a precept protected by the Constitution's Equal Protection and Due Process clauses. That's the case even though the Constitution doesn't include the words, There shall be no discrimination by government in recognition of any marriage on the basis of race or sexual orientation.\n\nThis means a couple of things in the gun debate. First, the Constitution and its text are a starting point, not an end point, for determining what gun regulations federal, state, and local governments may pass. Second, though the Constitution's open-ended provisions are rooted in the time of their drafting, the task of understanding them and applying them has been left to later generations. Federal courts have taken tentative, though momentous, steps in recent years to decide what the Second and 14 th amendments mean in terms of gun laws. But in the wake of the slaughter in Las Vegas, some commentators appear to have lost their minds about just how far the courts have gone. No, we don't have to repeal the Second Amendment to pass strong gun laws- Section III of the Supreme Court's landmark 2008 Heller decision is all you have to read to figure that out.\n\nWhat we need are tougher and smarter rules that keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people, while still allowing law-abiding, rule-following people to arm themselves. Perhaps the most startling fact about the Las Vegas shooter's means of mass murder is that he stockpiled 33 firearms in 12 months, \" most of which were rifles .\" Why is this legal? I'm not talking about why we don't require reporting multiple sales of long guns to federal authorities ( which we don't ). I'm not talking about the bump stocks the shooter used to make his semi-automatic weapons fire like machine guns. I'm talking about why people are allowed to own more than, say, two firearms without a really good reason.\n\nThe easy answer is because that's how it's always been. We've never had a federal law that says you can only own so many guns. But is there a logical, policy-based justification for unlimited gun ownership, especially when weighed against the public safety risk of allowing someone to arm himself with weapons that are capable of shooting nearly 600 people in 10 minutes? I don't think there is one.\n\nThe Constitution certainly doesn't mandate that Americans be allowed to own an unlimited number of guns. In the Second Amendment, a gun enthusiast might latch onto the words \"shall not be infringed\" and ( ironically ) \"militia,\" and argue that any restriction on his ability to possess any gun he wants violates his constitutional rights, while also making it harder to wage war against the government if it becomes tyrannical. Neither of these arguments is persuasive. As Justice Antonin Scalia of all people wrote in Heller , \"[T]he right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited.\" Scalia also justified laws that ban \"dangerous and unusual weapons\"-such as machine guns-even if such bans make it harder to fight back against a tyrannical government.\n\nConsider the recent survey showing that just 3 percent of adults own half of America's guns , with the Washington Post reporting that those individuals \"own, on average, 17 guns apiece.\" Another 19 percent of Americans own the other half of the nation's guns, leaving 78 percent of the American people who don't own any firearms at all.\n\nThe Second Amendment uses the word arms , plural. There is also compelling 14 th Amendment scholarship on the Reconstruction-era history of newly freed slaves, who used guns to defend themselves against racist marauders. But here in 2017, how many firearms does the average American need to competently defend her residence? For whom would, say, a 10-shot semi-automatic pistol and a six-round 12-gauge pump action shotgun not suffice for home defense?\n\nLet me put that another way: Why shouldn't we require someone who wants to own more than two firearms, and who isn't legally in the gun business, to file an application? Send some paperwork to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; submit fingerprints and a photo; and send in a $200 fee along with the make, model, and number of additional weapons you'd like to purchase (and eventually their serial numbers). You would agree to undergo a thorough criminal, domestic violence, and mental health background check, knowing that if a permit to purchase additional firearms were granted, such a background check would be performed every six months (to ensure the applicant hadn't fallen into a prohibited category of gun owner). Finally, and most important, the reason for requesting additional firearms would be stated on the application.\n\nWhat would qualify as a legitimate reason? Maybe you own a huge ranch in Wyoming and need to supply your staff members with bolt-action rifles. Maybe you own a courier business that ferries valuables for clients and you need to arm your guards. As long as they're all properly trained and vetted, and safe-storage precautions are taken, certain business exceptions like these probably make sense. You can likely think of other potential reasons. How many of these outweigh the public safety purpose of preventing someone like the Las Vegas shooter from amassing a personal arsenal? I suspect the answer is \"very few.\"\n\nUnder such a two-guns-per-person law, would anyone be prevented from owning a firearm to defend themselves in their home? Clearly not. Whether or not you agree with this idea, it's plainly correct that neither the Second Amendment nor any other part of the Constitution stands in the way of policy proposals like this one. There are countless other ideas already in circulation for reducing the horrific toll that gunfire takes on America. What's lacking is a constant, thunderous groundswell of public demand for these and other strong regulatory steps.\n\nApart from our Constitution's stated purpose to promote the general welfare, as well as the Declaration of Independence's inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness-which can as easily encompass the freedom from gunfire as the freedom to shoot-neither the Founding Fathers nor their post-Civil War successors have much to say to us in our modern campaign against gun violence. It is up to us to honor both our Constitution and those who are gunned down every day by preventing as many of our fellow Americans as possible from sharing their tragic fate.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Should I Cave on My \"No Toy Guns\" Policy?\n\nCare and Feeding is Slate's parenting advice column. Have a question for Care and Feeding? Email careandfeeding@slate.com or post it in the Slate Parenting Facebook group .\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nWe are the parents of a 6-year-old boy. As a family we are very anti-gun and, frankly, anti-weapons of any kind. Since our son was little, our philosophy has been to avoid any toy weapons. However, our son always sees kids at the park with water guns and it's become a bit of an obsession for him. If someone offers to let him play with a water gun, I let him. But now he's been begging for a water gun. The problem is all the water guns I find are very gunlike. I've found myself wondering if we need to let go of our \"no toy weapons\" policy. How do we let him be a kid but also balance our desire to avoid fighting and violence-oriented toys?\n\n-Don't Shoot\n\nDear Don't Shoot,\n\nI hate guns, and I think it's a symptom of a broken society that we have turned them into toys. You don't see candy cigarettes around anymore. I suppose we're at peace with teaching kids that violence is part of our character.\n\nYou're right that toy water guns look quite a bit like actual guns. Indeed, when the police kill brown children holding such toys, they're quick to point that out. That's why I cannot bear to buy a toy gun for my household. But every family is different.\n\nI don't think playing with a water gun will warp your son or really have any effect beyond helping him stay cool this summer. You could buy him a water gun and tell him it's the only one he'll ever get, so enjoy it. Also: There are animal-shaped toys that spray water. I get that they're a pale substitute. Kids want to cool off but they also want to fit in. I've bought those for my own children, my own way of splitting the difference: letting them play in a way I feel I can sanction.\n\nParenthood-and life generally, I guess-means constantly trying to figure out what you truly believe and how to live accordingly. This is one of those moments.\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nMy boyfriend and I plan to have children in the next few years-we both agree that our early 30s is the right age to do it. During a recent conversation, he told me that since he'll be in the middle of medical residency when we are both 30, working 80 hours a week, I should expect to take on a greater share of child care duties. We could wait until after he is out of residency (he'd also be making a lot more money then), but that means waiting five extra years to have a kid.\n\nPrior to this conversation, I assumed that child care duties would be shared as close to 50-50 as possible. That now seems unrealistic. I don't think my boyfriend said this due to any internalized belief that it's the woman's job to take care of kids. I have never had any issues with him when it comes to equally sharing housework like laundry and doing the dishes.\n\nWhat are the best strategies to navigate parenting if one parent works 80 hours a week? I still want him to take on a fair amount of child care duty, but how do we determine a fair amount? I will be working full time as well. He will try to apply for residency in a city where we have family members who can help us out.\n\n-Worrying About That Second Shift\n\nDear WATSS ,\n\nYou sound like someone who likes to plan. You also sound like someone confronting the fact that some things are difficult to plan.\n\nI don't think family life ends up being about equal share; I think it is more a matter of equitable share. If one parent is working 80 hours a week, it stands to reason that the parent who works 40 hours will end up picking up some slack. I'm not saying this is fair-it's merely a fact.\n\nIt's easy to feel irritated about always being the one to pay the electric bill or schedule the dentist appointments, and it's fine to feel cautious about such a lopsided division of labor. But I think it's also important to remember that it might feel quite different than it sounds to you now. You'll be older, in a different place in your life, hopefully happily ensconced in a relationship strong enough that you're not worried about keeping score, and conscious of the fact that family life is always shared endeavor.\n\nNo one can determine what \"fair\" means in the theoretical scenario you describe, because life isn't a happy ending but an ongoing negotiation. It takes communication and compromise to get to the point where family life feels happy and satisfying, and that point shifts every so often, just to make things more interesting. The fact that you're talking about this now, before you're actually parents, is a good sign, I think! Keep talking candidly. He'll probably be frustrated about being pulled away by his job, and you'll probably be frustrated about being on kid duty. Keeping those lines of communication open ensures neither one of you slips into resentment. Good luck!\n\n• If you missed Wednesday's Care and Feeding column, read it here .\n\n• Discuss this column in the Slate Parenting Facebook group !\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nI am a thirtysomething American married to an Argentine, and we live in Mexico City. We are Caucasian and bilingual, and we do not have children. I am interested in knowing what you think of international or interracial adoption, and if it is possible/positive with the right approach.\n\nMy sister-in-law is Haitian, and my mother goes to Haiti annually to do service work there. They have both talked to me about the possibility of adopting from Haiti, and I am interested. Given my family connection to Haiti, I envision being able to give at least sporadic cultural context to the child. I would also make an effort to expose the child to French and Creole, as well as Spanish and English.\n\nMy husband and I strive to be open and sincere people, and we are cognizant of white privilege and racism and try to combat them where possible. We are cross-cultural nomads and the product of a globalized world, so we tend to think our dream of adopting internationally/interracially and raising the child to be a good and well-adjusted citizen of the world is a feasible one, but then doubts creep in about this just being pie-in-the-sky, about confusing the hell out of a child with exposure to four languages and four cultures, and about ruining their sense of identity and belonging.\n\n-Adoption Options?\n\nDear Adoption ,\n\nYou're framing a very specific question (\"Can I adopt a child from a different race and culture?\") as a very general one (\"Is it OK to adopt a child from a different race and culture?\").\n\nYou declare yourself a cross-cultural nomad, just another citizen of the new globalized order, but surely you understand how even that declaration is one of privilege.\n\nBecause the fact is that the old order is very much with us. That is not to say that no one can parent and love and nurture a child of a different race, color, background, what have you; many people do this everyday. Nor is it to say that no child could manage thinking of herself as belonging both to her race and culture and her immediate family; many people do this, too, everyday. It is simply to say that the child in question will likely experience a world her parents can only guess at.\n\nThere is no governing body to weigh your intention and judge you fit or unfit. There's no particular badge you earn for being conscious of racism. You're not accountable to some advice columnist, or racist distant relatives, or the meddling passerby on the street. You're accountable, only, to your child. Being a parent-whether by adoption or by biology-means there are many, many ways to mess the whole thing up.\n\nWe definitely need more good and well-adjusted citizens of the world. Whether you can raise one is a question only you can answer.\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nIf you discovered a neighbor (with whom you've had successful play dates in the past) had a radically different political philosophy from you, would you allow the play dates to continue?\n\nI believe our political philosophy, on some level, shows who we truly are deep down. The person we are when no one is looking-and that is what gives me pause. I know that this mother would never hurt my child deliberately, and she is a sweet person, but I just can't seem to reconcile who I thought she was and what she stood for with this recent discovery. What are your thoughts?\n\n-Politics as a Window to the Soul?\n\nDear PaaWttS ,\n\nWe term our politics a \"philosophy\" when we need to establish distance between our immediate, everyday life and the things we sanction with our vote. Some things are not philosophy but pathology, and I have a feeling you're not talking about someone with whom you disagree on, say, interstate commerce.\n\nI'm sure you're right that this neighbor would never hurt your child. And I don't think you need to make a scene or some big point: \"Jenna can't come over to play because we disagree about the Affordable Care Act.\"\n\nPersonally, I would not have a play date with someone I believed was racist, sexist, homophobic, or any variation of intolerant. There are those who would claim this is merely \"political philosophy\" (and decry me as intolerant for rejecting them), but as you yourself said, what we believe politically shows who we are deep down. You're allowed to choose with whom you and your child spend time according to whatever metric you like.\n\n-Rumaan\n\nI enjoyed many sleepovers as a child, and now as a parent I am happy for my elementary-age kid to do the same with families we know well and trust. However, she's been invited to several weeknight sleepovers-during the school year-which sounds wild to me. Am I wrong to think these are weird ?\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe long, forgotten history of pro-gun left-wing groups.\n\nby Kim Kelly\n\nRight-wingers have held an unearned monopoly on gun culture for too long. Whether it's in the halls of legislative power or in the comments under \"gun bunny\" photos on Instagram , there is a prevailing narrative that pegs guns and armed self-defense exclusively to Republicans, racist libertarians, and other generally Constitution-obsessed weirdos. It maintains that those on the left want to take away everyone's guns and swathe the entire country in bubble wrap. But I'm an anarchist , and I call bullshit.\n\nI'm of the firm opinion that it's time to not only arm the left but challenge the narrative that all leftists are anti-gun. Many are, and that's a position I can understand and respect. But there is also a long history of armed community self-defense among the radical left that is often glossed over or forgotten entirely in favor of the Fox News-friendly narrative that all liberals hate guns. That's simply not the case - though as history has proven, the only thing that scares the reactionary right more than the idea of losing their guns is the thought of us having them.\n\nI grew up with guns , and my familiarity with them is a big part of why l view things the way I do. My family hunts for sustenance, and gun safety was taught to me before I was tall enough to see over my dad's workbench. I can understand why people who weren't raised around them would view firearms with fear and loathing, but for me, a gun in the hands of someone I trust is a comforting sight, because I know the power it holds.\n\nWhen I was in Charlottesville, Virginia, protesting the Unite the Right rally in 2017, the only time I truly felt safe was when members of Redneck Revolt - a working-class, anti-fascist, anti-racist armed community defense group - showed up open-carrying and secured the park where a number of us were gathered.

As the black militant liberation group the Black Panthers showed back in the 1960s, as the Zapatistas showed in the '90s, and as anarchists in New Orleans showed during the aftermath of Katrina , when cops and other fascists see that they're not the only ones packing, the balance of power shifts, and they tend to reconsider their tactics.\n\nTo be honest, the thought of a world in which the state and their running dogs are the only entities with access to firearms sends a shudder down my spine.\n\nNot everyone should have access to guns - domestic abusers, for example, have proven by their actions that they cannot be trusted with that kind of responsibility - and not everyone needs it. No one without a significant amount of training should be handling a firearm at all, which is why I think designated community patrols made up of well-trained, highly trusted individuals who are chosen by and held accountable to said community (and who do not hold any or less power than anyone else due to their position) is a far better and more equitable defense model than messy \"everyone gets a gun!\" rhetoric.\n\nI'm also not interested in creating a parallel cultural universe wherein balaclava-clad \"gun bunnies\" pose for the 'gram (I'd much rather shore up support for Rojava's all-women YPG Women's Defense Unit ).

As author and anarchist scott crow notes , \"our current gun control laws disproportionately hobble poor communities and communities of color.\" As far as the state is concerned, black people were never meant to own guns at all; the Second Amendment was intended in part as a means of controlling the enslaved black population and suppressing possible uprisings.\n\nThat sentiment has proven to have quite a bit of staying power. In 1967 , the Black Panthers staged an armed demonstration on the steps of the California state courthouse and launched an occupation in protest of the Mulford Act, which banned open carry in the state. Said law was written by a Republican Assembly member in response to the Panthers' cop-watching \" police patrols\" ; shortly after the protest, state legislators rushed to enact tougher gun control laws, with the full support of Republican President Ronald Reagan and the National Rifle Association.\n\nIn a stark contrast to its current bloodthirsty propagandizing, the NRA was once a firm proponent of gun control, and was a key component of the passage of 1934's National Firearms Act , which imposed restrictions on machine guns. That began to change in the 1960s; the NRA continued to support gun control, but its members - who had begun buying guns more for protection than for hunting - started to protest. The shift crystallized in 1977 with the ascent of Harlon Carter, a former immigration agent who'd killed a Mexican teenager in his youth and went on to shape what still fraudulently insists on referring to itself as \"the oldest civil rights organization in the country\" in his racist image.\n\nNow the NRA's insistence that it fights for the civil rights of legal gun owners rings hollow.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe long, forgotten history of pro-gun left-wing groups.\n\nby Kim Kelly\n\nRight-wingers have held an unearned monopoly on gun culture for too long. Whether it's in the halls of legislative power or in the comments under \"gun bunny\" photos on Instagram , there is a prevailing narrative that pegs guns and armed self-defense exclusively to Republicans, racist libertarians, and other generally Constitution-obsessed weirdos. It maintains that those on the left want to take away everyone's guns and swathe the entire country in bubble wrap. But I'm an anarchist , and I call bullshit.\n\nI'm of the firm opinion that it's time to not only arm the left but challenge the narrative that all leftists are anti-gun. Many are, and that's a position I can understand and respect. But there is also a long history of armed community self-defense among the radical left that is often glossed over or forgotten entirely in favor of the Fox News-friendly narrative that all liberals hate guns. That's simply not the case - though as history has proven, the only thing that scares the reactionary right more than the idea of losing their guns is the thought of us having them.\n\nI grew up with guns , and my familiarity with them is a big part of why l view things the way I do. My family hunts for sustenance, and gun safety was taught to me before I was tall enough to see over my dad's workbench. I can understand why people who weren't raised around them would view firearms with fear and loathing, but for me, a gun in the hands of someone I trust is a comforting sight, because I know the power it holds.\n\nWhen I was in Charlottesville, Virginia, protesting the Unite the Right rally in 2017, the only time I truly felt safe was when members of Redneck Revolt - a working-class, anti-fascist, anti-racist armed community defense group - showed up open-carrying and secured the park where a number of us were gathered. The police may have stood by and done nothing as a neo-Nazi murdered one of us, but Redneck Revolt was there to offer protection - and the fascists steered clear of that park because of it.\n\nIn Stone Mountain, Georgia, when a group of us marched through the streets to celebrate the cancellation of a Klan rally on February 2 , we were accompanied by local activists with rifles and ARs slung over their shoulders; the police kept their distance, which was an extraordinary sight for someone used to New York City's ultra-aggressive, hyper-militarized NYPD.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nWe are living through an inflection point in America's relationship with guns. There may be no going back.\n\nby Marin Cogan\n\nPhotos by Sebastián Hidalgo for Vox\n\n\"Threat!\"\n\nIn a flash, 50 people pull replica handguns and raise them above shoulder height, careful not to point the mock weapons at the heads of those sitting in front of them.\n\nIt's a Saturday morning on the South Side of Chicago, and the heat is rising in the classroom as firearms instructor Mike Brown leads students through gun-handling drills. They hold the model guns aloft until he yells, \"Chest!,\" which is their cue to draw the weapons back to their bodies. He drills them over and over, so pointing the gun feels like pure instinct, a reflex each time they hear him shout, \"Threat!\"\n\nA few hours earlier, just before 8 am, the students began lining up with coffee cups and water bottles outside of Brown's storefront office, where they've committed to spending 16 hours of their weekend learning about gun safety.\n\nIt's a diverse group: Over half are women and the majority are Black, but there are white and Hispanic students, too. Some are as young as 18, and a handful are older, but most of them are 20- and 30-somethings. Several are new to firearms or are planning to get their first gun soon. Everyone is there for a common reason: to complete Illinois's required training to get a concealed carry license, which will allow them to bring their guns in public.\n\nBrown teaches these classes most weekends. For the past few years, he says, they've been packed.\n\nThat's partly because Brown, a charismatic 43-year-old with a large social media following , offers something different from the dry legalese you might expect from a firearms safety course. His class is more like standup comedy meets group therapy meets self-defense seminar, taught by a drill sergeant.\n\nBut there's another reason why Brown's classes are full, week after week.\n\nThe beginning of the 2020s marked a significant shift in America's relationship with guns and gun violence. The Covid-19 lockdowns, combined with nationwide protests and a police reckoning following the killing of George Floyd, worsened an ongoing breakdown of trust in institutions and society.\n\nIn 2020, violent crime increased across the United States, with the homicide rate rising faster than at any time in more than 100 years . Guns became the leading cause of death for children and teens , rising 50 percent over two years. In 2021, a year that began with more political unrest and a violent insurrection , more Americans died of gun-related injuries than in any year on record . The rise in gun deaths was a major factor in Surgeon General Vivek Murthy's decision this summer to declare gun violence a public health crisis .\n\nAmid the violence, millions of Americans made a potentially life-altering decision: They decided it was time to buy their first gun.\n\nOne in 20 American adults bought a gun for the first time between March 2020 and March 2022, according to survey data from independent research organization NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\nAfter reading the available research about the spike in Americans purchasing their first gun during the pandemic, I was fascinated. Having so many new gun owners - not to mention the millions of guns acquired by existing gun owners - would certainly have a major impact on society, one that would only compound with the Supreme Court ruling affirming a constitutional right to carry guns in public. I wanted to find out where the new gun owners were from and what was driving their choice.\n\nKnowing that would help answer how guns became normalized in American homes in such a brief period. It might also reveal what all these new guns would mean for everyday life. I spent weeks emailing researchers about different ways I might find that answer, but I soon realized there wasn't good data about their locations. I needed to reframe my question. I looked at the FBI's background check system and noted a huge jump in background checks in Illinois from 2019-2021. Illinois is one of only a few states that requires a special license to own a gun. I reached out to the Illinois State Police to see how many people applied in 2020 and saw that they also experienced a surge of new applications. I began reaching out to people in Chicago, and a few weeks later, I was attending Mike Brown's concealed carry class and meeting new gun owners to hear their experiences.\n\nPreviously, American gun sales were driven by a small number of people: overwhelmingly white men adding to their existing gun collections.\n\nThe people who bought their first guns during the pandemic were different.\n\nNORC's study found that 69 percent were people of color. According to a separate study by researchers at Northeastern and Harvard Universities, 20 percent of new gun buyers between 2019 and 2021 were Black and 20 percent were Hispanic. Half were women - a massive shift given that, between 1980-2014, only 9 to 14 percent of women owned guns.\n\nListen to the students in Brown's class and to others who became gun owners during this period and a clear picture emerges of what drove so many people to get their first gun. As crime soared and trust in the police faltered, a grim kind of logic took hold: If everyone else is going to have a gun, then I need to have one, too .\n\n\"Everybody's got guns, so it's only right to have one,\" says Leslie Bullard Jr., 31. \"I've got to make sure my family and my kids are safe.\"\n\nLike so many Americans, Brown's students watched guns proliferate in their community and country in real time. Brown is clear-eyed about why they come to him for training.\n\n\"They don't want to die,\" he says. \"They're scared of the violence.\"\n\nThat fear - and the decisions Americans made because of it - speaks to an important new reality around the nation's relationship with guns: Prior to the pandemic, the US already had more privately owned firearms than civilians in the other top 25 gun-owning countries combined . It was hard to imagine that the country's internal arms race could escalate any further.\n\nBut it has.\n\nMillions more guns, both legal and not, flooded into the country during the pandemic. Recent Supreme Court decisions made meaningful regulation all but impossible. No one is completely immune from the risks of this new era of gun violence, not even the former president of the United States.\n\nAnd though homicide and violent crime have dropped from their pandemic spike, guns are not like iPhones. They don't outlive their purpose after a few years, and they're extremely difficult to get rid of safely . They can be deadly for generations to come.\n\nThe rise in the number of new gun-owning households \"really changes all kinds of policy and political calculations,\" says John Roman, author of the NORC survey. Beyond the safety risks of owning a gun are the deeper implications for society: for policing , crime , medical services , and public health .\n\n\"We're definitely not in the same place we were in 2019,\" says Roman.\n\nWe are living through an inflection point in America's long love affair with guns. \"People were given the message that they were on their own. The government was not functional,\" says Patrick Sharkey, a sociology professor at Princeton University who studies urban inequality, public policy, and violence.\n\n\"That feeling when institutions break down, I think, played a role in contributing to the major surge of gun sales and the rise in violence. When you feel like no one is in charge, that's a recipe for violence to emerge.\"\n\nBy different measures, other cities might be thought of as the nation's old gun heartland: Billings, Montana, a predominantly white city in the state with the highest average rate of household firearm ownership ; or Houston, Texas, a large southern city in the state with the highest estimated number of gun sales .\n\nBut as the greater Chicago area - home to more than half of Illinois's population - faced increasing violence during the pandemic, it became emblematic of the changing realities around American gun ownership. Rising interest in guns took place in a racially diverse city, long known as a Democratic stronghold, in a state with some of the toughest gun laws in the United States.\n\nOther Democratic cities saw similar increases in gun permits and concealed carry applications. In New York, applications to the NYPD to own a handgun doubled, from 2,892 in 2019 to 5,820 in 2020, according to reporting by Gothamist , a nonprofit news organization. Pennsylvania does not require a permit to purchase a gun, but applications to carry a firearm exploded in 2021: State police that year issued 384,522 permits to carry, a 24 percent increase over the year before, with the increase coming almost entirely from Philadelphia, according to an analysis by the Philadelphia Inquirer .\n\nThose trend lines in cities powered the nationwide surge in gun sales, but it's difficult to determine where exactly the estimated 17 million people newly exposed to firearms in their homes live. Neither the NORC study nor the Northeastern study published data on their locations, and there's no federal registry of gun owners that can offer insight.\n\nThe FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check system, though, suggests a sharp increase in gun purchases in Illinois during the pandemic: The number of background checks performed in the state spiked from 4.9 million in 2019 to 7.4 million in 2020 and 8.4 million in 2021. Illinois performed more background checks during those years than any other state.\n\nOther signs also point to the Midwest's largest city as a hotspot for new gun owners.\n\nIllinois is one of only three states that requires a license to own a firearm. The number of new applications the state received for a license to legally own a firearm rose to historic highs in 2020, according to data provided by the Illinois State Police.\n\nApplications for the state's Firearm Owner's Identification, also known as FOID cards, rose 56 percent between 2019 and 2020, resulting in a significant backlog in the approval process .\n\nThe number of applications climbed as the city and the country experienced a precipitous rise in violent crime. Murders rose across the US in 2020, but in Chicago, the violence was especially acute: The number of killings in the city that year jumped 55 percent, compared to 30 percent nationally . In 2021, the city saw more homicides than any other metropolis in the United States. And though other cities had higher murder rates, it was the deadliest year for Chicagoans since 1996, with more than 3,500 shooting incidents.\n\nThe danger wasn't spread equally across the city: The worst gun violence was concentrated in economically segregated neighborhoods that were predominantly Black or Latino and already struggled with high levels of crime, perpetuating what Sharkey calls the \" rigid geography of violence .\"\n\nThe lingering effects of that violence can be felt in Brown's classroom.\n\n\"Any Chicagoan is probably suffering from PTSD,\" says Cynthia, one of the attendees in Brown's class.\n\nCynthia is a retired parole officer, there to renew her concealed carry license. (Vox has agreed to withhold her last name for safety reasons.) \"You worry about going out,\" she says. \"If you have to put gas in the car - and it doesn't matter what time of day, it doesn't matter if it's 7 o'clock in the morning or 5 o'clock in the morning - we have to keep our heads on a swivel. Why do we have to live like this?\"\n\nInterest in getting a gun in her state spiked after periods of unrest: According to an investigation by the local CBS News station, on June 2, 2020, following days of rioting and looting in Chicago, 4,916 people applied for a license to own a gun on a single day - more than had applied in the previous eight days combined. Today, Cook County, home to Chicago and its suburbs, has more FOID card holders than any other county in the state.\n\nHomicides in the city and across the United States have since dropped, but some forms of violent crime, including robberies, continued to rise in Chicago last year .\n\nFor those who spend a lot of time traveling throughout the city and suburbs, the risks feel especially pronounced.\n\nFrank Brown, a student in the class (who bears no relation to Mike Brown), first purchased a gun in 2020 but decided to get a concealed carry license this year to protect himself while working as a ride-hail and delivery driver. \"With the increasing amount of violence that's been happening to those drivers nowadays, it caused me to have a bit more concern for my personal safety,\" he says.\n\nMike Brown's class is calibrated to his students' experiences of living in Chicago these last few years. Many of his students are there because they live in communities deeply affected by the violence.\n\n\"Everybody is talking, but ain't nobody hearing the kids. But guess what?\" Brown asks them. \"When they shoot your ass out there, you hear them now. And that's why your ass is in here.\"\n\nAs the number of guns grows, Brown is of two minds about what it all means. He believes in the rights of law-abiding gun owners to carry weapons, especially given the number of people carrying them illegally. And his students are trying to do things the right way. But owning a gun doesn't mean much and can be really dangerous if the carriers aren't trained in how to use them.\n\nEven with state-mandated training, he thinks a lot of people aren't fully prepared for the responsibilities of owning a firearm.\n\n\"What I see here is a powder keg, a lot of frustration, a lot of anger, a lot of bad relationships,\" Brown says. \"And all those factors can motivate people to come into my class and get what they think is going to be the fixer of their problems.\"\n\nWhen Brown speaks about the forces that drive gun violence, he echoes what the experts say. \"People pick up guns to solve a problem,\" turning mundane conflicts into lethal ones, says Alex Piquero, a sociology and criminology professor at the University of Miami and former director of the Bureau of Justice Statistics.\n\nBrown wants his students to understand that carrying a gun is not going to solve their problems. It could just make those problems worse.\n\n\"Pressing the trigger is easy,\" he says. \"The hard part is going to be the aftermath of all the other things you didn't factor for: the police investigation, then whoever you shot, somebody loves that person, so now they're coming for you, and you still got to live here.\"\n\nHe bookends his lessons with this message.\n\n\"Everybody's a gangbanger until it's time to actually gangbang,\" he tells his students as he stands in front of a framed target with the center shot out. \"There's people out there waiting for you to fuck around and find out.\"\n\n\"Should everyone have a gun?\" he asks them.\n\n\"No!\" they call out in response.\n\nAnd yet, the 50 people in the room - and thousands of others who've gone through Brown's classes - have decided that they should.\n\nLike their teacher, Brown's students are not card-carrying NRA members who treat gun ownership as an identitarian issue. They're different, and it's obvious after spending a minute in the class.\n\nMost of them are women. They speak rarely about politics and hardly at all about their Second Amendment rights. Instead, they describe a sense of fear for their children in a society awash with guns. When they speak about gun ownership, they speak primarily about safety and responsibility. They are driven by a desire to exert some control in what feels like a chaotic and uncertain time.\n\n\"I have two boys at home, and I'm a single mom, so getting concealed carry was important to me because it's just me,\" says Zakiya Robinson, 32.\n\nIt's Saturday afternoon, on the first day of the concealed carry class. After a lunch break, Brown's students reconvene at Eagle Sports Range, at the southern end of Cook County. Brown, wearing a bulletproof safety vest with a patch that reads \"Black Guns Matter,\" is joined by another instructor to lead students through setting up their targets and preparing to shoot.\n\nInside the range, bullet casings bounce off the walls and floors; paper practice targets flutter as students draw them in on automated pulleys to see where their bullets hit.\n\nRobinson says she is worried about how to keep her family safe. She feels tremendous pressure figuring out how to raise her son in a dangerous world while balancing his need to be a child. \"I can't express that to my son enough, and it's hard because they're in kid mode. They don't know that the world is crappy. They don't know that they have to be aware of their surroundings. He just wants to go to the park and play. It's a hard thing.\"\n\nHer concerns are shared by other mothers in the city, including those at a gathering the night before organized by Vanessa Longoria, a concealed carry instructor, in Humboldt Park, a neighborhood on the West Side of Chicago. Three weeks before, the police killed 26-year-old Dexter Reed in the same neighborhood during a traffic stop, in a case that sparked local protests and captured national attention . And just three days earlier, Longoria pointed out, a 4-year-old child had been shot while traveling in a car several blocks away. Hearing about those shootings has spurred their protective instincts.\n\nLongoria, 35, decided to become a firearms instructor in 2020, when her gun teacher told her there were plenty of women who wanted to learn to shoot but would prefer to be taught by someone like them.\n\nShe finds that other women relate to her reason for weapons training. \"I want to protect myself but also my family,\" she says. The women she's worked with want to feel that, too.\n\nGenerational shifts have almost certainly played a role in their relationships to guns. In 1990, according to the Urban Institute, women were the heads of household - or the main breadwinner - in about a third of US households. By 2019, women were the heads of household in half of American homes .\n\nThese women were used to doing it all, including taking on the traditionally male roles of providing and protection.\n\n\"I got divorced, so then it was just me and my daughter by ourselves. There's no man in the house anymore,\" says Lynda Gilly, 46, who got a gun in 2020. \"So now I have to just keep it there in case of anything. Thank God nothing's ever happened to where I've had to pull it out.\"\n\nIn Black homes, the share of families with women as heads of household is even higher, at 60 percent . The concerns about safety are compounded by the knowledge that the rate of gun deaths among Black children in the US is more than five times higher than for other children, and the danger can come both from the community and also from the police . Sixty-one percent of victims of gun homicide in 2020 were Black, with the largest increases in deaths among Black boys and men ages 10-44.\n\nFor that reason, LaSinda Thompson, 32, and her husband have decided they would rather their children learn about guns from them. \"When they both turn 8, we will be teaching them about gun safety and taking them to the range,\" she says.\n\n\"With me having a child, it's like, I can't imagine letting him just be out by himself,\" says Sade Adejumo, 33, who grew up with Longoria. \"It just makes you feel fearful because my one job in this world is to protect this child and make sure nothing happens to this child.\"\n\nThe problem, experts say, is that having a gun in the home can be extremely dangerous, substantially increasing relative risk. While most people safely and responsibly own firearms, those who have guns in their homes are more than twice as likely to be shot and killed than people who don't.\n\n\"It's conclusive that buying a gun doesn't make you safer,\" says Roman, an expert on firearms data. \"If you're a woman in a household with a gun , your chance of being the victim of a firearm homicide goes way up . If you're a teenage or 20-something boy or man, your chance of committing suicide goes up fourfold. We underestimate the cost of gun ownership, in terms of risk of somebody in our household being seriously injured or killed by that gun.\"\n\nMatthew Miller, an epidemiologist who studies the links between gun access and violent injury and death, and who authored the Northeastern study, puts it more starkly. \"The people who are now exposed to guns in their home for the first time, they are several-fold more likely to die a violent death\" by suicide or other gun-related injuries, he says. Guns increase risk because easy access to a firearm makes violent impulses especially lethal.\n\nGilly, whose daughter is now in college, says she's aware of the risk of her gun being used against her or her family. \"It's not like my gun's out in the open,\" she says. But, she says, \"If I'm pulling it out - oh my God, I better be able to defend myself.\"\n\nFor policymakers already concerned about the dangers guns pose, their proliferation is a troubling development.\n\n\"We haven't helped people feel safe enough. We need to step up and do more to help people feel like they don't need a gun,\" says Rep. Robin Kelly, a Democrat whose district includes parts of Chicago's South Side and suburbs. \"I can't tell people how to feel, especially when they see things on the news.\"\n\n\"I'm disappointed that people have more guns, and that it's spreading to different populations,\" she says. \"But I'm not surprised.\"\n\nA number of factors make it difficult for those who, like Kelly, are working to reduce gun violence.\n\nIllinois is surrounded by states , including Kentucky, Indiana, and Missouri, with some of the nation's least restrictive gun laws and worst firearms mortality rates , making regulation more difficult to enforce. Following a mass shooting in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park in 2022 that killed seven people and injured 48 others, the state passed the first assault weapons ban in the Midwest.\n\nA 2022 US Supreme Court decision, New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, upheld the right of Americans to carry guns in public and placed the burden on the government to prove that their regulations were consistent with historical gun laws. As a result, almost all restrictions on guns became vulnerable to legal challenges . Illinois's law banning assault weapons was immediately contested by gun rights groups. In July, the Court declined to take up the challenge , leaving the Illinois law in place.\n\nThe Court's recent decisions didn't happen in a vacuum. Before Bruen, several states had passed laws making it easier for people to carry guns in public . At the same time, gun manufacturers increased production of weapons , and methods for illegally obtaining a gun became easier. Those factors, experts say, almost certainly contributed to an increase in demand from people looking to get weapons for protection.\n\nThe explosion in new guns has created other concerns about public safety, Roman says. The fact that more people have guns and that they're increasingly carrying them in their cars and on their persons, as well as at home, creates more opportunities for guns to be stolen.\n\n\"That means that the homeowner's gun has a higher chance of becoming a crime gun,\" Roman says. \"We see that in the data: The time from purchase to a gun showing up at a crime scene has fallen. Newer guns are ending up as street guns quicker than they did in 2019 .\"\n\nA recent investigation of FBI crime data from Everytown, an organization that supports stronger gun safety regulations, also found that the rate of guns stolen from vehicles has tripled in the last decade, with an average of one gun stolen from a car every nine minutes.\n\nComplicating matters further, the millions of guns the government estimates were sold legally almost certainly undercount the total number of weapons that flooded the US during the pandemic.\n\nThe number of ghost guns - homemade guns that aren't traceable because they don't use serial numbers the way gun manufacturers do - that were recovered from crime scenes increased 1,083 percent between 2017 and 2021 , according to an analysis by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\n\n\"What we're seeing in the official records about purchases is one thing. To me, that number is the floor. There are more above that,\" Piquero says.\n\n\"How many more? We don't know.\"\n\nWhile many of the new gun owners are obtaining their guns legally, experts worry that the spread of even more firearms will make the nation more deeply entrenched in the problems that come with a highly fractious society with too many guns. These factors, Roman says, make efforts to reduce America's gun violence epidemic exceedingly difficult.\n\nSo the American arms race continues.\n\n\"With this many guns in civilian hands, it's unlikely that we are going to be able to do much better than we are today\" on gun violence, Roman says. \"Firearms make fist fights into gun fights, and there's always going to be some fist fights.\"\n\nThis last part is what concerns Brown.\n\nOn the second day of his class, he leads the students through different hypothetical encounters, each involving the threat of violence. After giving a short description of the situation, he asks the students a question:\n\n\"In this instance, do you have to shoot, or do you want to shoot?\"\n\nThe students debate different possibilities, many of them ripped from local headlines and social media: One is based on a recent case in New York City , where a neighborly dispute over apartment noise escalated into a double homicide caught on camera. Another is about the murder of 24-year-old Aréanah Preston , a Chicago police officer, during an armed robbery attempt outside her home. Each scenario sparks intense discussion and disagreement about the best course of action.\n\nThere's a reason Brown walks students through these scenarios. \"I don't consider myself to be a die-hard Second Amendment community member,\" who believes that guns are a solution to every problem, he says. Instead, he considers himself a \"part of the intellectual branch of the conflict-avoidant group, who happens to carry guns.\"\n\n\"I can use violence. I'm not afraid of it,\" he says. \"But do we have to?\"\n\nIt's a question that grows more urgent as more Americans take up guns.\n\nSo Brown is trying to drill his message home, again and again. In several of his scenarios, he tells students the best thing to do is to back down, disengage, even let yourself be a victim. It might save your life.\n\n\"Just because you have a gun,\" he says, \"doesn't mean you've got to use it.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

My father was a police officer in my hometown of Fort Wayne, Indiana, for 25 years, and he had not only a service weapon but several guns on top of it. I was given my first BB gun when I was 7 or so. I practiced with it a lot. I grew up believing that gun ownership was perfectly normal and, in certain circumstances, a personal responsibility.\n\nI'm still a gun owner.\n\nLike many Americans, my family history is closely tied to firearms. I was raised with a sense of duty to protect my loved ones. Danger wasn't something that was abstract or imaginary in my family history or my upbringing, and so we had to learn to deal with it.\n\nI'm not a Second Amendment absolutist, and I am open to changes to our gun laws. But gun ownership is important to me, and responsible individuals must be allowed to make the choice for themselves and their families if they want to own firearms.\n\nWhen my father died, the police found a loaded pistol in his bedroom. He'd suffered a heart attack after trying to shovel snow in a blizzard. He was a stubborn 83-year-old man who'd survived several heart attacks and two quadruple bypasses already.\n\nAmerica's gun problem, explained\n\nAustralian comedian perfectly sums up why other countries think US gun laws are crazy\n\nThis chart proves that the United States has failed at protecting its citizens from guns\n\nThe gun belonged to my grandfather.\n\nMy grandparents were born in Mississippi in the late 19th century and were part of the Great Migration that came north during Jim Crow. But although Fort Wayne was well north of the Mason-Dixon Line, segregation was a fact of life, if not a fact in law, in many Northern cities. Black people were only permitted to live in a small area in Fort Wayne, and that's where my family went.\n\nDuring the early part of the 20th century, the KKK were a social and political force in Indiana. They would march in town and through the black neighborhood where my father's family lived. Growing up, I was told about my grandfather standing at the door of the house with his gun drawn, calling the kids home while the Klan marched up the street.\n\nAs far as I know, my grandfather never had to fire his gun in defense of his family, but like many blacks in the years following emancipation, he believed firearms were a necessary part of protecting them. Particularly in the South - but in fact throughout the United States - blacks could not rely on the government to protect them from crime or terrorism. Many free blacks took up arms to defend themselves, and some of them died fighting. When given the choice, many blacks preferred self-defense to submitting to crime and terrorism. Indeed the right of blacks to own guns factored heavily into the congressional debates surrounding the drafting and ratification of the 14th Amendment.\n\nI didn't know my grandfather. He died 40 years before I was born. I didn't know my grandmother well, either. She was the victim of a violent home invasion when I was very young, and she had trouble communicating after that.\n\nMy father was a police officer, and he was proud of it. Like many officers, Dad valued his police-issued pistol and was commended for his marksmanship while he was on the force.\n\nHe used his gun in nonprofessional capacities too. He was off duty one night when an 18-year-old kid tried to rob him. Dad happened to be carrying his pistol under his jacket, thwarted his own mugging, and arrested the guy. (I still have the newspaper clipping.)\n\nWhen I was growing up, it was not unusual to see gun violence and other crime on the local news. Parts of Fort Wayne were violent places, including my childhood neighborhood, though most of the violence didn't involve guns.\n\nWhen I was still very young, a drunk man threatened me outside a roller rink. His friends beat up the man who was going to give my friends and me a ride home, and when a few of us ran to a payphone to call for help, he broke a beer bottle and told us to hang up. I was too young to process the mortal threat he was making, but I remember being scared.\n\nAt school, fights were a normal part of life. I remember two instances where teachers were the targets of physical assault by students -the first time I was in fourth grade, and the second time I was in middle school. In high school, teachers and administrators were sometimes injured trying to break up fights.\n\nDad didn't keep his father's gun loaded because he was going to the range. He was protecting himself and his home. I got in my first fight in the summer after third grade. I didn't get out of a kid's way, and we brushed shoulders near the baseball diamond. He took offense and wanted to throw down. My mother always told me to walk away from fights, so I tried to do just that. The kid kicked me in the back and beat me up.\n\nI learned my lesson - don't turn your back on a threat - and afterward asked my father what I should do.\n\nDad told me that I should learn to defend myself but never to start fights. He explained, then and in other lessons over the course of my life, that while I should call authorities when possible, they wouldn't always be there to help me out when trouble was imminent. Personal safety was ultimately up to each individual, and a responsible person makes adjustments when other people break the rules. To paraphrase something he said to me: \"There are plenty of people who were in the right who are in the cemetery now.\"\n\nThe threat of violence is a part of life. In time, I became resigned to the fact that I could get beaten up for looking at someone the wrong way, or jumped because I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\nI didn't grow up in the most violent place in America; far from it. But the threat of crime and violence was real, and we had to learn to cope with it. Dad didn't keep his father's gun loaded because he was going to the range. He was protecting himself and his home.\n\nBoth my father and grandfather's guns are mine now. And I will fight in order to keep them.\n\nFortunately, I've mostly been able to avoid confrontations where a firearm would be necessary. But there have been times that I was glad to have my father's gun at the ready.\n\nGun violence in America in 17 maps and charts\n\nWhat no politician wants to admit about gun control\n\nGuns killed more Americans in 12 years than AIDS, war, and illegal drug overdoses combined\n\nSeveral years ago, I lived in Bloomington, Indiana, with my then-girlfriend. She had a colleague I'll call Diane. Diane waited tables at the bar my girlfriend worked at to support her oft-out-of-work husband, a man I'll call Bobby. Bobby was an exuberant working-class tough guy who loved to show off.\n\nBobby was also abusive. One night, my girlfriend called me to ask if Diane could stay with us because Bobby had beaten her up (again). Diane said she was finally fed up with the abuse and was going to leave. She was scared for her life and needed a place to stay.\n\nI didn't hesitate to say yes, but I understood that this positioned my girlfriend and me for a potential conflict with a terribly violent man. (Not to mention a man more than capable of hurting us: The first time I met Bobby, he picked me up and fireman-carried me up a full flight of stairs on a lark. Then, as now, I was 6 feet tall and weighed more than 200 pounds. I hadn't been picked up so easily by anyone since I was a child.)\n\nBobby knew where we lived and, because controlling abusers often limit the number of people allowed in their victims' personal lives, almost certainly knew where Diane sought shelter. I couldn't take him in a fight if I wanted to, and any non-firearm weapon I could use would require close contact and increase my risk of being overpowered, endangering everyone.\n\nWe kept the door locked, but it opened directly from the outside. A man as strong as he was could conceivably break down the door before any police responded to a 911 call. Beyond that, being in a ground-floor apartment, there were several windows he could break into.\n\nI loaded my gun and kept it out all night. All I could think about was the weight of the responsibility I had to protect Diane and my girlfriend, the possibility that I would need to kill another human being. I couldn't stand Bobby as a person, but the thought of taking his life was not something I relished or wanted to do. Still, I was prepared to do it.\n\nThankfully, I didn't have to use the gun that night - Bobby never showed up. But that gun was my best - and, frankly, only - weapon against someone who had already proven himself willing and able to hurt me and those I care about.\n\nIf I hadn't had my gun, I might not have been able to take in my friend. I would have felt less confident about my ability to protect my girlfriend and myself - let alone the person we were taking in for her protection.\n\nSecurity isn't only valuable when the worst-case scenario actually happens I've never brandished my gun in self-defense. Thankfully, I've never had to. Nobody should point a firearm at another person unless he is truly willing to kill that person, and I've been fortunate enough to never be in quite that much danger. But that doesn't mean that keeping my gun has never been justified. Guns offer a sense of protection. It isn't foolproof protection, but precious little in life is. The night Bobby didn't come, my gun wasn't useless. It was security. Do you lock your doors? Keep an alarm system in your home? Security isn't only valuable when the worst-case scenario actually happens.\n\nI recognize that many of the pro-gun blowhards who fight against any new gun laws say a lot of ridiculous things. In the wake of the Charleston, South Carolina, shooting , for example, some suggested said that the people in the church should have been armed. That's absurd. While I believe in the right to self-defense, and indeed that all rights are effectively meaningless if you don't have control over your own life, body, and personal safety, we still live in a society where we should be able to move freely - and go to church, of all places - without a rational fear of being murdered.\n\nAnd I am sensitive to the very real problem of gun deaths in this country. I know the shocking, numbing sadness of losing someone to gun violence or suicide. I know the helpless terror of watching the news when an old friend is involved in a hostage situation. I even know what heartbreak it is to read about childhood friends who were imprisoned for murders they committed when they were adults. I just thought, \"My god! What happened to them?\"\n\nBut none of those deaths, tragic as they are, negate my fundamental right and duty to protect myself and my loved ones. We can debate new laws that may have an effect on the margins, but most gun deaths reflect broader problems in American society. Policymakers should address the underlying drivers of gun deaths - particularly suicide, drug prohibition, and domestic violence - on their own terms without abridging law-abiding Americans' fundamental right to self-defense.\n\nI never thought I'd write about my gun ownership. Part of that is the lesson my dad taught me: Never give out information that makes a break-in more likely. But the conversation in the media has been dominated by extremists and people who have no idea what they're talking about. I'm a man who fully understands that self-defense isn't an abstract concept, and that more can be done to reduce gun deaths. But the answer is neither gun bans nor simply giving more people guns. Years of personal and family experience have taught me that.\n\nJonathan Blanks is a criminal justice researcher and writer who lives in Alexandria, Virginia.

I would have felt less confident about my ability to protect my girlfriend and myself - let alone the person we were taking in for her protection.\n\nSecurity isn't only valuable when the worst-case scenario actually happens I've never brandished my gun in self-defense. Thankfully, I've never had to. Nobody should point a firearm at another person unless he is truly willing to kill that person, and I've been fortunate enough to never be in quite that much danger. But that doesn't mean that keeping my gun has never been justified. Guns offer a sense of protection. It isn't foolproof protection, but precious little in life is. The night Bobby didn't come, my gun wasn't useless. It was security. Do you lock your doors? Keep an alarm system in your home? Security isn't only valuable when the worst-case scenario actually happens.\n\nI recognize that many of the pro-gun blowhards who fight against any new gun laws say a lot of ridiculous things. In the wake of the Charleston, South Carolina, shooting , for example, some suggested said that the people in the church should have been armed. That's absurd. While I believe in the right to self-defense, and indeed that all rights are effectively meaningless if you don't have control over your own life, body, and personal safety, we still live in a society where we should be able to move freely - and go to church, of all places - without a rational fear of being murdered.\n\nAnd I am sensitive to the very real problem of gun deaths in this country. I know the shocking, numbing sadness of losing someone to gun violence or suicide. I know the helpless terror of watching the news when an old friend is involved in a hostage situation. I even know what heartbreak it is to read about childhood friends who were imprisoned for murders they committed when they were adults. I just thought, \"My god! What happened to them?\"\n\nBut none of those deaths, tragic as they are, negate my fundamental right and duty to protect myself and my loved ones. We can debate new laws that may have an effect on the margins, but most gun deaths reflect broader problems in American society. Policymakers should address the underlying drivers of gun deaths - particularly suicide, drug prohibition, and domestic violence - on their own terms without abridging law-abiding Americans' fundamental right to self-defense.\n\nI never thought I'd write about my gun ownership. Part of that is the lesson my dad taught me: Never give out information that makes a break-in more likely. But the conversation in the media has been dominated by extremists and people who have no idea what they're talking about. I'm a man who fully understands that self-defense isn't an abstract concept, and that more can be done to reduce gun deaths. But the answer is neither gun bans nor simply giving more people guns. Years of personal and family experience have taught me that.\n\nJonathan Blanks is a criminal justice researcher and writer who lives in Alexandria, Virginia.

The plaintiffs in Garland v. VanDerStok ask the Court to effectively neutralize a federal law requiring gun buyers to submit to a background check, as well as a separate law requiring guns to have a serial number to allow law enforcement to track firearms.\n\nThe case involves \"ghost guns,\" weapons that are sold dismantled and in ready-to-assemble kits. Three Trump appointees on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit previously concluded that guns sold in these kits are exempt from the laws requiring background checks and serial numbers, thus making it easy for people with violent felony convictions to obtain guns simply by buying them in a disassembled state.\n\nGet the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.\n\nBy law, the background check and serial number requirements apply to \"any weapon ... which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive.\" They also apply to \"the frame or receiver of any such weapon,\" the skeletal part of a gun that houses other components, such as the barrel or firing mechanism. Thus, if someone purchases a series of firearm parts intending to build a gun at home, they still must face a background check when they purchase the gun's frame or receiver.\n\nGhost gun makers seek to evade these requirements by selling a kit with an incomplete frame or receiver - although, according to the Justice Department, it's often trivially easy to convert the kit's incomplete part into a fully functional frame or receiver. Some kits can be turned into a working firearm after the buyer drills a single hole in the kit's frame. Others require the user to sand off a small plastic rail.\n\nThe Fifth Circuit backed these attempts to evade the law. It claimed that frames missing a single hole are \" not yet frames or receivers .\" The three Trump judges also argued that ghost gun kits may not \"readily be converted\" into a working gun because this phrase \"cannot be read to include any objects that could, if manufacture is completed, become functional at some ill-defined point in the future\" - even if only a negligible amount of work is required to make the gun function.\n\nSo the question now is whether a majority of this Supreme Court, which often takes an expansive view of gun rights , will sign onto this attempt to neutralize the background check and serial number laws.\n\nThe good news for supporters of gun regulations is that the Court has already signaled that it will not do so. The Court first heard this case, albeit in an expedited process, in August 2023, and it voted to temporarily leave the background check and serial number requirements in full effect while the case made its way through the lower courts. The bad news is that the vote in that August 2023 decision was 5-4, with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joining the Court's three Democrats. So if just one justice flips, the VanDerStok plaintiffs could prevail.\n\nVanDerStok turns on the question of when a partially manufactured gun becomes sufficiently gun-like that it should be regulated as if it were a fully operational firearm. Congress, by applying the relevant laws to operational guns, frames, receivers, and items that \"may readily be converted\" into an operational gun, clearly intended that a gun need not be fully complete to be regulated.\n\nAt the same time, it's also clear that there is a point when an incomplete gun is not yet subject to the background check and serial number laws. For example, if someone buys a bucket full of raw steel and wood that a skilled gunsmith, after many hours of work using the proper tools, could turn into a firearm, that bucket does not need to come with a background check.\n\nUp until very recently, this question of \"at what point does a gun become sufficiently complete to trigger certain federal laws?\" would have been resolved by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). In Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council (1984), the Supreme Court held that, when an agency is given the power to issue regulations interpreting a federal law (and ATF has that power over the gun laws at issue in VanDerStok ), courts should typically defer to how the agency decides to resolve any ambiguities in that law.\n\nThus, in a less imperious Supreme Court, VanDerStok would be an easy case. ATF issued a regulation in 2022 that clarifies that the background check and serial number laws do apply to ghost guns. Under Chevron , that should be enough to resolve this case.\n\nLast June, however, the six Republican justices voted to overrule Chevron . Their decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (2024) establishes that henceforth, whoever controls a majority of the Supreme Court will have the final word on thousands of policy questions that, under Chevron , used to be resolved by federal agencies. So VanDerStok will give us an early window into how these justices intend to use their new, self-given policymaking authority.\n\nIf these justices concern themselves with the text of federal gun law, however, it's still difficult to see how they could affirm the Fifth Circuit's decision to exempt ghost guns from the background check and serial number requirements.\n\nThe reason why is that federal gun law does not simply announce a vague standard - that incomplete guns that \"may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive\" are still subject to federal regulation. It also provides an example of a particular kind of not-yet-ready-to-fire gun that is subject to the background check and serial number laws.\n\nThe relevant federal law explicitly states that a \"starter gun\" - that is, a gun with a plugged barrel that is designed to fire blanks, and that is typically used to begin track or swim races - does count as a gun that is subject to federal regulation. So if someone buys a starter gun, they must submit to a background check, even though starter guns cannot be used to shoot anyone without significant alterations.\n\nIn its brief, the Justice Department suggests that this reference to starter guns was inserted into the statute because of a \" do-it-yourself gunsmith \" who \"distributed firearms to gang members by buying starter pistols in bulk.\" He would then disassemble these starter guns and \"using an electric hand drill mounted in a drill press stand, bore[d] out the plugged barrel and enlarge[d] the cylinder chambers to accommodate .22-caliber cartridges.\"\n\nThat's significantly more work than is required to assemble many ghost guns. The fact that Congress intended to regulate devices that need to be disassembled and \"bored out\" using reasonably specialized equipment before they could be used as weapons suggests that Congress also intended for an already-disassembled gun that is missing a single hole in its frame or receiver to be subject to regulation. A ghost gun is much closer to being a fully operational firearm than a starter gun.\n\nStill, while VanDerStok should not be a difficult case, the fact that four justices previously voted to exempt ghost guns from background checks and serial numbers suggests that this Court will make this case more difficult than it needs to be.\n\nIn overruling Chevron , the Court declared that it should have far more control over US policy than it has had in recent decades.

      "text": "Sweden may have the answer to America's gun problem\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby Tom Heberlein\n\nTwenty years ago, I headed to Sweden for a sabbatical year to study the country's attitudes toward hunting. As a responsible hunter, I brought my own guns - an old 12-gauge shotgun and a Remington .30-06 - because I didn't want to miss a shot or wound an animal using unfamiliar, borrowed firearms.\n\nAs a sociologist I thought that bringing my own firearms would give me some firsthand experience with European gun laws. That happened sooner than I expected.\n\nMy employer, the Swedish Hunters Association, had filled out all the paperwork (including paying the tax), so there was no problem getting my guns into the country. But I couldn't take them to my apartment, as I would have in the United States.\n\nInstead, like all guns in Sweden, they had to be stored in a locked safe, so colleagues took them directly to the wildlife research lab that has a walk-in vault to store firearms.\n\nBefore I could hunt, there was the trip to the rifle range where my shooting scores were registered. While this is not required by law, I was told that landowners would not let me hunt moose, nor would a hunting team accept me, unless I showed I could hit a target - not just a paper target but a full-size plywood moose at 100 yards, standing and moving.\n\nMuch of what happened when I went hunting in Sweden was strange to me - hunting birds in the mountains with unloaded shotguns for example, stopping the moose hunt after a couple of hours to sit around a campfire roasting hot dogs, and then butchering a trophy moose without taking even one picture. ( Here's my report on the differences in Swedish and American hunting.)\n\nBeing in this new setting that was much like and yet so different from Wisconsin got me thinking about hunting in new ways. I began to think more about the responsibilities of gun owners rather than gun owners' rights. I also learned that it was possible to maintain a lively hunting culture along with mandatory gun registration and required safe storage.\n\nAs we face a firearm crisis in America today, it's time for hunters to stop hiding behind the Second Amendment and claim the moral high ground as our nation's responsible gun owners.\n\nThe nation demands some action, and we, more than 13 million gun owners who hunt, are in a unique position to lead the way. Firearm registration as part of our normal licensing process could both strengthen our hunting tradition and at the same time help break the national logjam of inaction.\n\nHere's how the Swedish system works: Only responsible people are trusted with firearms. Sweden licenses guns in much the same way we license cars and drivers. You can have up to six guns but can get more with special permission.\n\nTo apply for a firearm permit you must first take a year-long hunter training program and pass a written and shooting test. You can also apply for a gun permit if you've been a member of an established shooting club for six months.\n\nIn addition to undergoing training, Sweden's gun owners must store their firearms safely. Guns must be locked away in a vault, not stored beneath your car seat or in the nightstand where your kids can find them.\n\nResponsibility in Sweden goes further yet: Convicted of a felony? No guns for you. Beat your wife? No guns. Under a restraining order? No guns. Drive drunk? No guns.\n\n(The gun law does not spell out specific actions that cause a citizen to be \"unfit\" to have a gun permit. It does say that the police must have a \"reasonable cause\" to suspend a permit, and these kinds of things might signal that a gun owner is \"unfit.\")\n\nEven so, being responsible is not such a tough job. Sweden denies permits to only about 1,000 people a year (out of 600,000 permit holders), and they can appeal their rejection to the courts.\n\nAnd despite these restrictions, Sweden has a strong hunting culture. The heavily forested country is about the size of California but with one-fourth the people. Its moose population per acre is the world's largest, and moose hunting is front-page news. The king himself hunts moose, and small towns shut down for the season opener much like Wisconsin towns do for the state's deer season.\n\nSweden has nearly 300,000 hunters, which means it has a readily armed population should it need defense. And make no mistake: Guns are part of Sweden's culture, history, and national defense - even though it has enjoyed more than 200 years of peace.\n\nMany of my Swedish colleagues served in the military and are proficient with firearms. They can practice at shooting ranges all over Stockholm. When hiking in a city park, it's common to hear the measured shots of target practice nearby.\n\nAnd yet gun violence is low in Sweden. The country ranks 10th out of 178 countries in the world for per capita gun ownership but in 2014 had only 21 homicides by firearms. In contrast, the US is first in per capita ownership and had more than 8,000 gun homicides in 2014. Controlling for population, US firearms homicides are 700 percent higher than Sweden's.\n\nMy favorite place in the world is an old cabin in Wisconsin's Northwoods, where Heberlein relatives and friends have gathered every year for the past seven decades to hunt ruffed grouse and white-tailed deer. My fondest, proudest, and happiest memories of friendship, accomplishment, and even despair have occurred in the presence of firearms in that camp.\n\nAmerica's gun problem, explained\n\nBut in my hunting camp, gun rights don't exist - just gun responsibilities. Wally and Norman know that. Wally was walking down the nearby White City logging road with Dick at his side when his .30-30 lever-action rifle fired unexpectedly. If Dick had been walking ahead of him, Dick would have been the one who didn't show up at camp that next year instead of Wally, whose carelessness cost him his camp privileges.\n\nNorman, meanwhile, is one of the world's nicest guys, but he doesn't hunt with us anymore either. Twice his gun went off accidentally.\n\nI doubt most Americans understand how its hunters focus on gun responsibilities. Novice hunters are taught how to handle guns: Assume every gun is always loaded - even if you're sure it's not. Never point a gun at anything you would not shoot. The ground and sky are the exceptions, but not a house, a barn, or the neighbor's cat. If you find yourself looking into someone's gun muzzle, you're always right to call out the hazardous infraction.\n\nIn our public rhetoric we may talk about the right to bear arms, but in our hunting life we focus on our safe gun-handling responsibilities to our fellow hunters. We don't tolerate irresponsible hunters in the field, so why support the alleged rights of gun owners who make mass murders too common in America?\n\nThe author (left) at his hunting camp, reading from a log of past hunts. (Courtesy of Tom Heberlein)\n\nIt's time to show the world that we hunters are the responsible gun owners in America. We can't wait for Congress to pass new gun control legislation - it seems bound by money and lobbyists to never act. We hunters should use our own institutions, which we fund with license fees, to maintain safe and responsible gun ownership.\n\nWe don't have to wait for the nation to act. We can work state by state to incorporate hunting firearm registration as part of our normal licensing process. Today when you buy a hunting license, you must meet a number of requirements like being a state resident, being a certain age, and in most states providing evidence of hunter safety training.\n\nFor each animal, the type of weapon that is legal is already specified in the rules. It would be a simple step in the licensing process to require hunters to specify the serial number of all firearms they are using for hunting. Registering the weapon would make it legal for hunting.\n\nThis registration won't make hunting any safer - hunting will be just as safe whether the gun is registered or not. But it will signal to the vast majority of Americans who support responsible gun ownership that we hunters are willing to make a visible step as responsible gun owners.\n\nWildlife commissions set hunting rules in most states, so it's in their authority to require that any firearms used for hunting in that state be registered with the agency. It's as simple as listing the make, model, and serial number of the firearms you will use for hunting when you buy your license.\n\nHunters don't need expensive, time-consuming background checks - we are already trained. This proposal would apply only to firearms used for hunting. You wouldn't need to register the AK, AR, handgun, or MSR (modern sporting rifle) you keep in the closet for home defense; our wildlife agencies makes rules only for guns used in the hunt, not all guns. Non-hunting firearms should also be under control, but let's start first by registering the millions of firearms used for hunting.\n\nWe hunters have our own police - conservation wardens - who number 5,000 strong nationally. We even pay their wages through our hunting fees to make sure we obey the rules. When wardens check a hunter in the field, they determine if the firearm is the right caliber as determined by the hunting regulations. For waterfowl, the magazine is checked to make sure it can only shoot three shells rather than the five for which it was designed. The shells the hunters are carrying are checked to make sure they are nontoxic.\n\nIt would be a simple matter for the warden to check the serial number on the gun and compare those printed out on the back of the hunter's license or to query an electronic data base. If you're caught hunting with an unregistered gun, then you're hunting illegally and are subject to fines and lost hunting privileges. It is as simple as that.\n\nOf course this idea faces obstacles, including the biggest one of all: hunters' unwillingness to change. Anything. We love hunting so much that its traditions and practices create strong emotional ties that we defend instinctively and passionately. If you doubt it, just ask any wildlife manager how stubbornly hunters resist even minor changes to rules and quotas.\n\nMany will say self-registration won't save lives. They're right ... and wrong. Hunter involvement in mass shootings is so unusual that no one is keeping the statistics. Hunters very rarely inflict such evil on innocent lives.\n\nBut that's not the point. Self-registration of our hunting weapons would distinguish us from other gun owners, not in words but in deeds. We would be taking the first step toward universal gun registration by registering our hunting firearms. Non-hunting gun owners who want to prove that they are responsible might want to join the hunting registration system.\n\nRegistration could lead gradually to requiring safe storage by locking all hunting guns in gun vaults. That would prevent tragedies in our own homes, which does mean saving lives. Ask the hunter who has lost a child to an accident or horseplay with an unsecured rifle or handgun.\n\nOf course, we can expect to hear this mantra: \"If they know who owns guns, they can come and take them away.\" But \"they\" already know. Computerized lists of licensed hunters are in government offices in all 50 states, and many of those lists are public information. One must assume they figured out that licensed hunters have guns.\n\nWon't self-registration of guns reduce hunter numbers? I've spent much of my career studying hunter population dynamics , and I'm concerned about declines in hunting. But I don't think the dropout group will be large.\n\nMany hunters claim they'll quit hunting when license fees go up, and, yes, license numbers often dip the first year, but most return the next. Hunting matters that much to us. And, yes, some might keep their hunting firearms secret and give up hunting instead. Personally, I'm willing to see them go. I want to hunt with men and women who responsibly register their hunting firearms.\n\nWhy do this? The answer is obvious, isn't it? How many more mass shootings must we watch with helpless impotence while asking, \"What I can do?\" To protect what we love - our hunting life - we must differentiate ourselves from other gun owners.\n\nBy choosing to register our guns with our wildlife agencies, we would follow a long history of putting restrictions on ourselves for the greater good: bag limits, season lengths, blaze orange clothing, and so on. We will be recognized as the responsible registered gun owners.\n\nSweden shows it's possible to have a serious hunting culture with firearms restrictions . With rights comes responsibility. Let's show the way. Who will be the courageous, visionary sportsmen and women who establish the first hunter registration system in Vermont, or New York, or in my home state of Wisconsin, and take a step forward to sensible gun use in America?\n\nThomas Heberlein is professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin Madison and was a guest professor in the Department of Wildlife, Fish, and Environmental Studies at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nWhy the Supreme Court just smacked down one of the judiciary's worst GOP partisans.\n\nby Ian Millhiser\n\nLate Monday afternoon, the Supreme Court handed down a very brief order establishing that sellers of \"ghost guns,\" weapons that are sold dismantled in ready-to-assemble kits , must comply with the same gun safety laws and anti-crime laws as any other gun seller.\n\nAt this point you may be experiencing déjà vu , because in August the Supreme Court also handed down a brief order establishing ghost gun sellers must comply with these laws. The more recent case, known as Garland v. Blackhawk Manufacturing Group , arrived on the Court's docket after federal district court Judge Reed O'Connor, a former Republican Capitol Hill staffer known for handing down dubiously reasoned opinions that benefit Republican causes , effectively tried to neutralize the Supreme Court's August 2023 decision.\n\nNotably, while the Court's August order was a 5-4 decision , with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joining the Court's three Democratic appointees, no justice publicly dissented from the order handed down on Monday - which suggests that even the four justices who dissented in August may have viewed O'Connor's most recent ruling in favor of ghost gun sellers as an act of defiance that needed to be quashed.\n\nThe 2023-2024 SCOTUS term features a growing list of cases that could transform the US, its government, and our right to free speech and public safety. We're tracking them here .\n\nIan has covered the Supreme Court extensively as a senior correspondent for Vox. Read more of his reporting here .\n\nThe decision is revealing not just because it potentially indicates that the Court ran out of patience for O'Connor's antics. Monday's decision also suggests that there is a solid majority on the Court against ghost guns, something that was at least somewhat in doubt after the Court's August decision.\n\nGhost guns are kits that, at least according to O'Connor, open up a giant loophole in federal gun law.\n\nFederal law requires gun buyers to submit to a background check before they can purchase a gun, and it also requires all guns to have a serial number that can be used to track them if they are used in a crime. These laws apply to \"any weapon ... which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive .\" It also applies to \"the frame or receiver of any such weapon,\" the skeletal part of a firearm that houses other components, such as the barrel or trigger mechanism.\n\nThus, even if someone purchases a collection of firearm parts intending to assemble the gun at home, they will still face a background check when they purchase the gun's frame or receiver, and that frame or receiver must have a serial number.\n\nGhost guns, meanwhile, are typically sold as a collection of parts that can easily be assembled into a functional gun. Often, the frame or receiver in this kit is sold in a slightly unfinished condition. According to the Justice Department , these incomplete frames and receivers are often very easy to finish. In some cases, a ghost gun buyer can build a working gun after drilling a single additional hole in the kit's frame. In other cases, they merely need to sand off a small plastic rail.\n\nNevertheless, O'Connor initially ruled in June 2023 that ghost gun kits are exempt from the federal background check and serial number laws, even though these laws apply to \"any weapon\" that can be \"readily converted to expel a projectile.\" O'Connor reasoned that \"weapon parts ... are not 'weapons,'\" only a fully complete firearm is. And thus the kit as a whole does not count as a \"weapon.\"\n\nSimilarly, O'Connor also claimed that the nearly complete receivers sold in ghost gun kits are immune from the law because \"that which may become or may be converted to a functional receiver is not itself a receiver.\"\n\nIn any event, in its August order the Supreme Court seemed to disagree with O'Connor's conclusion that gun manufacturers may evade federal law by simply not drilling a single hole in a single gun part. But that order was just ambiguous enough that O'Connor tried to get around it in a new decision he handed down in September .\n\nTo understand why O'Connor may have thought he could get away with a second court order ruling in favor of ghost gun manufacturers, after the Supreme Court already smacked down his first decision in their favor, it's helpful to understand an ongoing debate among the justices about how much power individual federal judges should have to set nationwide policy.\n\nIn his initial June decision, O'Connor held that all ghost gun manufacturers nationally are immune from the background check and serial number laws. Some members of the Supreme Court have complained that federal trial judges should not have this power to set national policy - or at least that they should use that power only rarely. As Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in a recent concurring opinion, \"a district court should 'think twice - and perhaps twice again - before granting' such sweeping relief .\"\n\n(Notably, Gorsuch has not actually done much to rein in nationwide orders targeting the Biden administration - though he was quite alarmed when judges issued such orders blocking Trump administration policies . Gorsuch dissented from the Court's August decision blocking O'Connor.)\n\nThe Supreme Court's August order, meanwhile, was only one paragraph long . And it did little to explain why the Court disagreed with O'Connor. So O'Connor appears to have bet that a majority of the justices didn't actually disagree with his attempt to create a loophole that swallows up two major gun laws - they just didn't want him to issue a nationwide order.\n\nAnd so, in his September order, O'Connor once again ruled that ghost gun makers may defy federal law, but he applied that order only to two ghost gun companies that were actually parties to this lawsuit . Other companies that wish to sell ghost guns were beyond the scope of O'Connor's September order, and so were still obligated to comply with federal law.\n\nAs a practical matter, O'Connor's more limited September order would still have had a nationwide effect. If just one company is allowed to sell ghost guns without background checks, then criminals and other individuals who would fail a background check may buy guns from that company. And, as the Justice Department points out, the two companies that do benefit from O'Connor's order \"are commercial distributors selling their products over the internet,\" so O'Connor's September order would have let anyone in the country obtain a ghost gun without a background check.\n\nIn any event, that won't happen. Monday's Supreme Court order puts O'Connor's latest decision on ice, at least temporarily while this case is still being litigated. The case will be heard next by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, a far-right court with a history of affirming partisan judges like O'Connor, even when the Supreme Court has previously indicated that the Fifth Circuit should not do so .\n\nBut regardless of what the Fifth Circuit rules, Monday's order suggests that there are five solid votes on the Supreme Court against O'Connor's approach to ghost guns, and not merely five votes who thought that O'Connor's June order should not have applied to every company in America.\n\nAnd the fact that no justice publicly dissented from the Monday order also suggests that the Court wanted to send a message to O'Connor - and possibly to other judges like him - that they cannot defy the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nTrump's lawyers asked the Supreme Court to reinstate his ban on trans military service, after a lower court blocked it.\n\nMany of the justices seemed eager to impose impossible burdens on schools.\n\nThe two Republican justices appeared open to an attack on Obamacare, but ultimately seemed likely to reject it.\n\n﻿In an unusual overnight order, most of the justices voted to halt several illegal deportations.\n\nHow can you punish Trump officials for violating the law, when federal law enforcement is controlled by Trump?\n\nThe Oklahoma charter school case is one of two April cases seeking to remake schools in the religious right's image.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

      "text": "New study shows up to 43% of US households are not storing guns securely\n\nHere are some secure storage tips that can help save lives.\n\nFirearms are the leading cause of death in the United States for children aged 0-19 years, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reporting over 4,700 pediatric gun-related deaths in 2021.\n\nMany of those deaths are unintentional.\n\nA new study published by the CDC described how often guns are stored in different U.S. states. Up to 43% of households store loaded guns, which is not considered safe, while half of the households that store guns loaded with ammunition do not put them in locked containers, according to the study.\n\nLoaded guns that are not locked can be easy for children to find and accidentally fire.\n\nHouseholds from eight states were surveyed for this high-quality report; including Alaska, California, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio and Oklahoma. The percentage of households who had guns and stored guns securely varied widely between states.\n\nNorth Carolina, Oklahoma, and Nevada had the highest rates of households storing loaded guns, the report said.\n\nPediatricians and advocates say one simple strategy could dramatically reduce the number of children who are killed: Secure firearm storage.\n\nThis means storing a firearm locked, unloaded and with the ammunition stored separately from the firearm. Though it sounds simple, there are a range of options for storing your gun securely at home.\n\nOptions include cable locks, lock boxes, trigger locks and gun safes. Most can be found for purchase on large retail websites, such as Amazon, or through stores like The Home Depot or Dick's Sporting Goods.\n\n\"It really comes down to what does the family want or need,\" Dr. Sandra McKay, an associate professor of pediatrics at UTHealth Houston and nonresident fellow at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University, told ABC News.\n\nThe bottom line is too many children are in harm's way, according to McKay.\n\nThis sentiment was also shared by Dr. Eric Sigel, a pediatrician, adolescent medicine specialist, and co-chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Firearm Injury Prevention Special Interest Group who highlighted a recent study estimating that 1 in 3 middle and high schoolers have access to a firearm.\n\nThrough statistical modeling, another study calculated that if 20% of parents changed their current storage practices to storing firearms unloaded and with the ammunition locked away separately \"there would be an estimated decrease of up to 122 pediatric firearm-related fatalities and 201 injuries annually.\"\n\nFour common types of secure storage devices include:\n\nLike a bike lock, but for a firearm. A cable lock is a flexible cable that loops through an empty firearm, making it impossible to load or fire. These range in price from $5-50 and are oftentimes available for free through both local and national community organizations.\n\nSmaller, portable versions of a gun safe. A lock box is made of metal or durable plastic. It has a lock on it to keep it shut. They are perfect for storing a single gun to make sure it's secure but available for quick access. They cost between $25-$350.\n\nTrigger locks fit over the trigger mechanism of a firearm to keep it from being pulled. They are small and compatible with most firearms, but not as safe as other options because a firearm can still be loaded with a trigger lock in place. And, if not put on correctly, a loaded firearm may accidentally fire. These cost between $10-$50.\n\nLarge, heavy safes that can store multiple guns, including rifles and shotguns. Made of tough metal, they have electronic or mechanical locks. Gun safes are one of the most secure places to store guns, but they are also the most expensive starting at $500.\n\n\"There are a lot of different places that families can go to learn about these various devices. I think one of the secret gems out there are going to your [Gun] Range Safety Officers,\" said McKay. Other resources include Hunter Safety Training, gun shops, and local law enforcement agencies.\n\nOutside of the home, McKay and Sigel encourage parents to discuss secure firearm storage with healthcare providers, family members, friends, and neighbors. McKay recommends using neutral language that emphasizes child safety, similar to how one would address food allergies, pool access and pets.\n\nMichelle March, MD, MPH, MEd is a general pediatrics research fellow at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.

Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas dissented.\n\n\"The Gun Control Act embraces, and thus permits ATF to regulate, some weapon parts kits and unfinished frames or receivers, including those we have discussed,\" Gorsuch wrote.\n\nIn 2022, the Biden administration cracked down on the self-assemble kits with a new rule subjecting them to the same checks as traditional firearms -- including background checks, age verification, serialization and more.\n\nChallengers of the rule, which included gun manufacturers and individual gun owners, contended the 1968 Gun Control Act didn't apply to weapon parts kits and that the administrative action was an overreach.\n\nJustice Gorsuch, writing for the majority, made a textual case for why gun parts kits can be subject to federal regulations in the same way as any other gun.\n\n\"The [Gun Control Act] authorizes ATF to regulate \"any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive,\" Gorsuch wrote.\n\n\"A person without any specialized knowledge can convert a starter gun into a working firearm using everyday tools in less than an hour.
