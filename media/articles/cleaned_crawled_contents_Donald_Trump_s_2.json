      "text": "'We are all living under an axe': DC insider explains how Trump will 'collapse' America\n\nDonald Trump\n\nAnalysts puzzling over the bizarre formula the Trump administration used to calculate its country-by-country tariff rates are wasting their time, U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy said in a response to the American president that has gone viral in recent days as global markets continue to nosedive.\n\n\"It's not economic policy, it's not trade policy,\" Murphy (D-Conn.) said in remarks recorded after Trump announced the sweeping tariffs last week. \"It's a political weapon designed to collapse our democracy.\"\n\nWhile President Donald Trump's universal tariffs on imports make no sense as an effort to rectify the failures of the status quo trade regime and bring back offshored U.S. jobs , they are comprehensible when viewed as \"a tool to try to compel pledges of loyalty, this time from companies and industries in the United States,\" Murphy argued.\n\n\"You have to understand that everything Donald Trump is doing is in service of staying in power forever-either him or his family or his handpicked successors,\" the Democratic senator continued. \"He's trying to destroy our democracy.\"\n\nSee on Instagram\n\nMurphy contended that the president designed the tariffs to be so widespread that corporations across private industry would have to come to the White House and \"make an agreement with Trump in which he gives them tariff relief in exchange for a pledge of political loyalty.\"\n\n\"What could that pledge look like?\" Murphy continued. \"Well, maybe they agree to champion his economic policy publicly. Maybe they agree to make contributions to his political campaign. Maybe they agree to police their employees to make sure that nobody that works for that company works for the political opposition.\"\n\nPolitico reported late last week that businesses across corporate America \"fear Trump's wrath\" and are thus declining to criticize the president's tariff policies even as they wreak havoc worldwide and threaten to spark a devastating recession.\n\n\"There is zero incentive for any company or brand to be remotely critical of this administration,\" one unnamed public affairs operative told Politico . \"It destroys your ability to work with the White House and advance your policies, period.\"\n\n\"While the United States has plenty of real problems to deal with, Trump is ignoring them to manufacture the fake emergencies he needs to further enlarge and centralize his power.\"\n\nMurphy is hardly alone in seeing Trump's tariffs as an instrument of power consolidation.\n\nRobert Reich, the former U.S. labor secretary, wrote Monday that \"we're turning into a dictatorship\" as Trump conjures \"fake national emergencies\" to jack up tariffs, deport people en masse without due process, gut efforts to combat the climate crisis, and dismantle large swaths of the federal government.\n\n\"As Trump declares emergency after emergency to justify his reign of terror, he's simultaneously eliminating America's capacity to respond to real emergencies,\" Reich wrote. \"Make no mistake about what's really going on here. While the United States has plenty of real problems to deal with, Trump is ignoring them to manufacture the fake emergencies he needs to further enlarge and centralize his power.\"\n\nOne analyst, Zack Beauchamp of Vox , argued the tariffs are more a symptom of the decline of U.S. democracy rather than a cause of it.\n\n\"Trump's tariffs will, if fully implemented, be remembered as their own cautionary tale. While he campaigned on them, he wouldn't have been able to implement the entire tariff package had he gone through the normal constitutionally prescribed procedure for raising taxes,\" Beauchamp wrote. \"The fact that America isn't functioning like a normal democracy, with public deliberation and multiple checks on executive authority, is what allowed Trump to act on his idiosyncratic ideas in the manner of a Mao or Putin.\"\n\n\"It's still possible that Trump steps back from the brink,\" he added. \"But even if he does, and the worst outcome is avoided, the lesson should be clear: The long decay of America's democratic system means that we are all living under an axe. And if this isn't the moment it falls, there will surely be another.\""

      "text": "'Get over it': Wall Street kingpin brutally mocked for flip flop on key Trump policy\n\nDuring a January 22 appearance on CNBC , JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon argued that tariffs could be used as \"an economic tool\" and told critics of President Donald Trump's tariff proposals to \"get over it.\"\n\nBut the Wall Street CEO had a much different tone on Monday morning, April 7, when he sent investors a letter warning that \"the economy is facing turbulence\" and admitting that a recession is quite possible.\n\nWith the stock market plummeting, Dimon told investors, \"Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth.\"\n\nOn X, formerly Twitter, Dimon is drawing vehement criticize and mockery for having so different a tone on April 7 than he had on January 22.\n\nThe Bulwark's Bill Kristol , a Never Trump conservative, tweeted, \"Less than three months ago, Jamie Dimon on Trump's tariffs: Probably no big deal. 'Get over it.' Now: Oops. We need better capitalists.\"\n\nX user John Collins wrote , \"No s---, Jamie.\"\n\nFormer MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan noted Dimon's comments on Trump in 2024: \"Just take a step back and be honest: He was kind of right about NATO. He was kind of right about immigration. He grew the economy quite well. Tax reform worked.\"\n\nWashington Post reporter Aaron Blake observed , \"Jamie Dimon on tariffs in Jan: 'If it's a little inflationary but it's good for national security, so be it. Get over it.' Dimon now: 'The quicker this issue is resolved the better because some of the negative effects increase cumulatively over time & would be hard to reverse.'\"\n\nJon Cooper , ex-Long Island, New York campaign chairman for former President Barack Obama, observed, \"Jamie Dimon has issued a blunt warning about Trump's tariff policy: It threatens to raise prices, drive the global economy into a downturn, and weaken America's standing in the world.\"\n\nEric Michael Garcia of The Independent and MSNBC tweeted , \"The financial world's top leaders have stayed silent. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase's chief executive said that people should 'get over' the threat of tariffs. He declined through a spokesman to be interviewed by the New York Times.\"\n\nJesse Rodriguez, vice president of editorial at MSNBC, posted , \"JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon says Trump tariffs will boost inflation, slow an already weakening U.S. economy, in shareholder letter.\"\n\nThe Daily Beast's Julia Davis noted , \"Dimon is the first CEO of a major Wall Street bank to publicly address Trump's sweeping tariff policy as global markets crash.\"\n\nConservative Charles Gasparino, a Fox Business correspondent and New York Post columnist, criticized Dimon for the lack of \"urgency\" in his April 7 letter.\n\nGasparino tweeted , \"BREAKING: As I reported @jpmorgan's CEO Jamie Dimon came out w his annual shareholder letter this AM, and he did in fact address tariffs as I said he might. But the urgency wasn't there. Reading it you would have no idea the markets are going through a massive upheaval. It shows, also as I reported, America's CEO class, at least in public, is still too scared to take on Trump directly.\""

      "text": "'This. Will. Not. End. Well': George Will slams Trump's 'fanciful assumptions' on economy\n\nGeorge Will speaking at the 2014 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland on March 6, 2014 (Gage Skidmore/Flickr)\n\nWhen President Donald Trump detailed his far-reaching tariff plans on Wednesday, April 2 - the day he touted as \"Libertarian Day\" - much of the criticism came from Democrats. But some Never Trump conservatives are speaking out as well, from MSNBC host Joe Scarborough to former GOP strategist/consultant Stuart Stevens. And Trump critics on both the left and the right are warning that his new tariffs will make a variety of goods much more expensive without yielding the economic boom that Trump is promising.\n\nAnother Never Trumper who is vehemently critical of Trump's tariffs is veteran Washington Post columnist George F. Will. In his April 4 column , however, Will emphasizes that tariffs are only one of the reasons why Trump is problematic on the economy.\n\n\"Donald Trump's economic agenda, from taxes to tariffs - which are themselves taxes - is variable because he believes in the immediate translation of whims into policy proposals, without an intervening pause for study,\" the 83-year-old Will argues . \"His conversation with a Las Vegas waitress quickly became his proposal to end taxation on tips. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick says Trump suddenly favors eliminating 'taxes' on people making less than $150,000 a year - in 2022, about 93 percent of Americans 15 and over.\"\n\nWill adds , \"Progressives want income taxation to be more progressive so the wealthy will pay 'their fair share.' Trump is more progressive still, wanting the wealthy to pay everyone else's share, too.\"\n\nTrump's economic agenda, according to Will , fails to take into account the size of the United States' federal deficit.\n\n\"As, second by second, the government borrows substantial sums to pay interest on the money it has borrowed, remember: The national debt was $20 trillion when Donald Trump began his first administration, having vowed to eliminate the debt in eight years,\" Will writes . \"It was $28 trillion when Joe Biden's presidency began. As Maya MacGuineas at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget notes, it reached $32 trillion on June 15, 2023; $33 trillion 92 days later; $34 trillion 105 days after that; $35 trillion in another 210 days; and $36 trillion in another 118. It will reach $37 trillion after Congress raises the debt ceiling sometime this summer.\"\n\nThe longtime Post columnist adds , \"All of these numbers reflect the optimistic, perhaps fanciful assumptions that the post-'Liberation Day' economy does not sag into a recession. In any case: This. Will. Not. End. Well.\"\n\nGeorge Will's full column is available at this link (subscription required)."

      "text": "Scarborough rips Wall St. and the GOP for being in denial about Trump's 'dangerous' policies\n\nJoe Scarborugh\n\nThe United States continued to be plagued by bad economic news on Monday morning, April 7, with the stock market in freefall, fears of a recession growing, and many economists warning that President Donald Trump's steep new tariffs will cause prices to soar for everything from fruits and vegetables to washing machines to computers to construction materials.\n\nQuite a few reporters are comparing this economic downturn 2020, when the United States experienced a brief recession and a rise in unemployment that were brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. But when Zanny Minton Beddoes, editor-in-chief of The Economist, appeared on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" on April 7, she had a different comparison: 2008.\n\nBeddoes argued that the economic turbulence of April 2025 is starting to feel like 2008, when Wall Street suffered a major meltdown and the Great Recession got underway.\n\nDuring the broadcast, MSNBC's Joe Scarborough had some scathing comments about Trump and his cheerleaders in right-wing media - accusing them of having a cavalier attitude about economic pain that is quite real.\n\nThe Never Trump conservative and former GOP congressman told fellow \"Morning Joe\" host Mika Brzezinski , \"Those trickle-down effects are going to be felt by working Americans who can afford it the least, and they're being told by billionaires that there's nothing to see here. They're being told by millionaire talking heads on other networks, 'There's nothing to see here. It's a war that we had to enter.'\"\n\nScarborough continued , \"No, no, let's be very let's be very clear here. Regardless of how you feel about tariffs, this is a self-induced war that we started. This is voluntary.\"\n\nThe \"Morning Joe\" host chastised Wall Street CEOs and fellow conservatives who were in denial about how far-reaching Trump's tariffs would be.\n\nScarborough told Brzezinski , \"I spent three months after the election warning Republicans they needed to be careful.... People on Wall Street are going, 'Oh my God, I'm so shocked. How could this ever happen? I supported him, but I really didn't think he was' - what do you mean? He's been saying tariffs are beautiful, beautiful things while the rest of the world has been saying no they're not, they're dangerous. This is what made the Great Depression extraordinarily bad and extended it.\"\n\nWatch the full video below or at this link.\n\n- YouTube www.youtube.com"

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1,719 points, or 4.3%, as of 1:08 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 4.9% lower.\"\n\nNoting the state of Wall Street this week, Groundwork Collaborative executive director Lindsay Owens declared in a Friday statement that \" Trump has officially brought the economy to its knees.\"\n\n\"The president single-handedly wiped out Americans' retirement savings overnight and subjected businesses to intense whiplash with his increasingly erratic and chaotic policies that continue to drive consumer and business uncertainty,\" she said. \"To call this an economic downturn is an understatement; Trump is marching us straight into a depression.\"\n\nPolitical and economic observers have been publicly wondering for weeks if Trump is intentionally crashing the economy. Further fueling those fears, he ramped up his trade war on Wednesday by announcing a minimum 10% tariff for imports, with higher levies for dozens of countries. Although he claimed those steeper duties are \"reciprocal,\" his math \" horrified \" economists and has been called \"crazy.\"\n\nResponding in a Thursday note titled, There Will Be Blood , head of global economic research Bruce Kasman and other experts at JPMorgan wrote that \"if sustained, this year's ~22%-point tariff increase would be the largest U.S. tax hike since 1968.\"\n\n\"The effect of this tax hike is likely to be magnified-through retaliation, a slide in U.S. business sentiment, and supply chain disruptions,\" states the note, which came before China's announcement.\n\nAs Bloomberg reported :\n\n\"We are not making immediate changes to our forecasts and want to see the initial implementation and negotiation process that takes hold,\" the JPMorgan note says . \"However, we view the full implementation of announced policies as a substantial macroeconomic shock not currently incorporated in our forecasts. We thus emphasize that these policies, if sustained, would likely push the U.S. and possibly global economy into recession this year.\"\n\nThe team also pointed out that the United States is in potential danger no matter how other countries are ultimately impacted, calling a \"scenario where rest of world muddles through a U.S. recession possible but less likely than global downturn.\"\n\nAs Common Dreams reported last week, in anticipation of Trump's tariff announcement, Goldman Sachs published a research note projecting that the odds of a recession in the next year are 35%, up from 20%.\n\nOther financial industry research firms that have recently warned of a possible recession include Barclays , BofA Global Research, Deutsche Bank, RBC Capital Markets, and UBS Global Wealth Management, according to Reuters .\n\n\"This is a game-changer, not only for the U.S. economy, but for the global economy. Many countries will likely end up in a recession,\" Olu Sonola, head of U.S. economic research at Fitch Ratings, said in a late Wednesday note about the levies. \"You can throw most forecasts out the door, if this tariff rate stays on for an extended period of time.\"\n\nExperts have made similar comments to the press in the wake of the president's Rose Garden remarks on Wednesday. Time on Friday shared some from Brian Bethune, a Boston College economics professor:\n\nAlso on Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the latest U.S. jobs data. Although the unemployment rate rose from 4.1% to 4.2% in March, the economy added 228,000 jobs, which was better than expected.\n\nHowever, economists warn of what lies ahead. As University of Michigan economics professor Betsey Stevenson put it , \"Today's jobs report is like looking at your vacation photos after you had a horrible car crash on the way home.\""

Analysis exposes 'idiotic' fallacy of Trump's tariff tax scheme\n\nPresident Donald Trump is acknowledging that his steep new tariffs will bring some economic pain in the United States, but he insists that short-term discomfort will be followed by a period of major prosperity and a renaissance in U.S. manufacturing.\n\nTrump is also claiming that money from tariffs will replace any federal revenue lost because of tax cuts for the United States' wealthiest Americans. And he is describing Wednesday, April 2 - the day his new tariffs are scheduled to take effect - as \"Liberation Day.\"\n\nBut The New Republic's Timonthy Noah, in a biting article published on April 2 , lays out some major flaws in Trump's arguments on tariffs and taxes.\n\n\"I'm starting to believe April 2 really will be Liberation Day,\" Noah argues . \"But instead of liberating us from foreign imports, it will liberate us from any lingering illusion that Trump's tariffs are about anything more than eliminating the progressive income tax.\"\n\nThe math in Trump's claims, according to Noah, doesn't add up.\n\n\"News accounts about President Donald Trump's tariffs routinely mention that raising revenue is one of Trump's stated goals,\" Noah explains . \"But they hurry quickly past this because it's totally idiotic to think tariffs could ever replace the income tax, even partially, as a meaningful source of federal revenue. And they're right: This idea is really, really stupid!\"\n\nNoah adds , \"Where the press goes wrong is in not plumbing the depths of Trump's commitment to this stupid idea. How stupid? Well, the Internal Revenue Service last year collected $2.96 trillion from income taxes on individual and corporate income, and the United States imported $3.3 trillion in foreign goods. You'll note these numbers are pretty close. To replace all income-tax revenue, you'd have to impose a tariff of nearly 100 percent on all foreign imports. Not gonna happen!\"\n\nTimothy Noah's full article for The New Republic is available at this link ."

      "text": "How Republicans Could Stop Donald Trump's Tariffs\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nSenior Politics Reporter, HuffPost\n\nWASHINGTON - President Donald Trump is crashing the global economy with arbitrary tariffs against countries around the world, but it doesn't have to be this way.\n\nCongress could stop the tariffs at any time.\n\nThe Constitution gives Congress the power to control tariffs, but lawmakers have over the decades ceded their power to the White House with laws expanding the president's trade powers, including authorities to impose duties in cases of emergency.\n\nTrump has claimed fentanyl and international trade itself are emergencies to justify taxes of 10% or higher not just on every U.S. trading partner but on friendly neighbors like Canada and even on uninhabited islands home to only seals or penguins.\n\nAlready, members of Congress have introduced legislation to roll back the president's tariff power. But Republican leaders have given no indication they will allow the bills to become law, as they work instead on passing trillions of dollars in tax cuts.\n\nStill, several rank-and-file Republicans have refused to go along with Trump's crazed napkin-math trade agenda that assumes the U.S. has been \"looted, pillaged, raped and plundered\" by any country where the value of its exports exceeds its imports from the U.S.\n\nIn the Senate, a bipartisan group of lawmakers led by Chuck Grassley of Iowa last week introduced legislation to reassert Congress' role over trade policy. That bill has the support of seven GOP co-sponsors, enough to overcome a filibuster. It's unclear whether Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) will ever bring it up for a vote since that would almost certainly anger Trump.\n\n\"I am a Republican. I am a supporter of Donald Trump. But this is a bipartisan problem,\" Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) explained in a Senate floor speech last week. \"I don't care if the president is a Republican or a Democrat. I don't want to live under emergency rule. I don't want to live where my representatives cannot speak for me and have a check and balance on power.\"\n\nThe White House has threatened to veto the legislation, which would require tariffs be approved by Congress within 60 days.\n\n\"This bill would dangerously hamper the President's authority and duty to determine our foreign policy and protect our national security,\" the White House said in a statement on Monday.\n\nIn the House, Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) said Sunday he would introduce a companion bill and that the legislation could become viable if the stock market keeps tanking for several weeks.\n\n\"It's time that Congress restores its authorities here,\" Bacon said on \"Face the Nation.\" \"And the Constitution is clear, the House and the Senate, Congress has the power of tariffs and taxes. And we gave some of that power to [the] executive branch. And I think, in hindsight, that was a mistake.\"\n\nGOP leaders snuck a provision into last month's government funding bill disallowing a privileged vote in the House on a measure overturning the tariffs, so lawmakers would need to force one via a so-called discharge petition, another obstacle to getting a bill to Trump's desk.\n\nAny bill that Congress passes reasserting its authority over tariffs would likely need a large, veto-proof majority, or a two-thirds vote in both the House and the Senate.\n\nThere's no indication yet that nervous Republicans will bail on Trump's tariff regime, but that could change if financial markets continue melting down. Billionaire fund manager Bill Ackman, a top Trump ally, warned Sunday that the world is on the precipice of \"self-induced, economic nuclear winter\" and urged the president to take a 90-day \"time out\" with his tariffs.\n\n\"What CEO and what board of directors will be comfortable making large, long-term, economic commitments in our country in the middle of an economic nuclear war?\" he asked in a post on social media.\n\nBut Trump has refused to back down, defending his policies.\n\n\"I don't want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something - and we have been treated so badly by other countries,\" Trump told reporters on Sunday after a weekend of golfing at his Florida estate.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Another element called gadolinium is used in MRI scans.\n\nChina's customs administration said it had suspended imports of chicken from two U.S. suppliers, Mountaire Farms of Delaware and Coastal Processing. It said Chinese customs had repeatedly detected furazolidone, a drug banned in China, in shipments from those companies.\n\nAdditionally, the Chinese government said it has added 27 firms to lists of companies subject to trade sanctions or export controls.\n\nAmong them, 16 are subject to a ban on the export of \"dual-use\" goods. High Point Aerotechnologies, a defense tech company, and Universal Logistics Holding, a publicly traded transportation and logistics company, were among those listed.\n\nBeijing also announced it filed a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization over the tariffs issue.\n\n\"The United States' imposition of so-called 'reciprocal tariffs' seriously violates WTO rules, seriously damages the legitimate rights and interests of WTO members, and seriously undermines the rules-based multilateral trading system and international economic and trade order,\" the Commerce Ministry said.\n\n\"It is a typical unilateral bullying practice that endangers the stability of the global economic and trade order. China firmly opposes this,\" it said.\n\nIn February, China announced a 15% tariff on imports of coal and liquefied natural gas products from the U.S. It separately added a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and large-engine cars.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

However, he reiterated his respect for the Supreme Court.\n\n\"If the Supreme Court said bring somebody back, I would do that. I respect the Supreme Court,\" he said.\n\n-ABC News' Katherine Faulders"

      "text": "Key moments and reaction to Trump's \"Liberation Day\" announcement of new tariffs\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  April 2, 2025 / 9:06 PM EDT / CBS News\n\nPresident Trump on Wednesday announced so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from about 90 nations, in addition to a 10% across-the-board tariff applied to all imports to the U.S. The president declared it a national emergency and said the new taxes are needed to erase a trade deficit between the U.S. and other countries, ranging from China to the European Union.\n\nThe reciprocal rates will become effective at 12:01 a.m. on April 9. The baseline 10% tariff goes into effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 5.\n\nNo new tariffs were placed on Mexico and Canada, the United States' two largest trading partners, sparing them from the minimum 10% baseline tariff added to most countries Wednesday.\n\nGoods and products that fall under the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement are still mostly exempt from tariffs. Automotive exports will still be subjected to a tariff set to go into effect April 3, while steel and aluminum will still be subject to a previously imposed 25% tariff.\n\nThe Senate approved a measure Wednesday aimed at blocking the Canada tariffs, as a handful of Republicans bucked President Trump.\n\nIn a 51 to 48 vote, four Republicans joined all Democrats in favor of the measure. But the House is unlikely to take up the resolution, making the vote largely a symbolic one.\n\nJoining Democrats in support of the measure were Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and former GOP leader Mitch McConnell, along with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a Republican who co-sponsored the legislation.\n\nRead more here.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney wrote on social media, \"During this crisis, we must act with purpose and force. My government will fight U.S. tariffs, protect Canadian workers and industries, and build the strongest economy in the G7.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters the Trump administration's tariffs amount to a \"huge tax on American families, all  to help billionaires get a tax cut.\"\n\nHe called Mr. Trump's plan \"even worse than we thought, because in addition to all the other tariffs, he's talked about 10% across the board on everything.\"\n\n\"So when the average American family sits down and tries to figure out how they're going to pay for things, and they hear they may pay $5,000 more than they've had to pay before, and they may not be able to buy a new car, they may not be able to support that new drug that grandma needs, they may not be able to take that vacation they were planning for for the year, they're going to be outraged and they should be outraged,\" Schumer said. These tariffs are a disaster for the average American.\"\n\nNew Trump administration tariffs on U.S. imports amount to a major blow for technology companies, many of which produce their products in countries set to face sharply higher levies.\n\nPresident Trump on Wednesday said the U.S. would impose a 34% reciprocal tariff on China, where Apple and many other tech players manufacture their products.\n\n\"Apple produces basically all their iPhones in China, and the question will be around exceptions/exemptions on this tariff policy if those companies are building more operations/factories/plants in the U.S. like Apple announced in February,\" Wedbush Securities equity analyst Dan Ives said in a note to investors.\n\nApple's stock price fell 6.7% in after-hours trading.\n\nThe U.S. is also hiking import duties on other nations with major tech production hubs. Imports from Taiwan, a key manufacturer of semiconductors, will be taxed at a rate of 32%; South Korea, 25%; Japan, 24%; and the European Union, 20%.\n\n\"For Nvidia and other chip players with significant exposure to China and Taiwan supply chains, the worry will be around pricing and margin impacts along with what this means for the global supply chain looking forward,\" Ives said.\n\nNasdaq, the tech-heavy stock index, has dropped more than 12% since hitting an all-time high in February amid investor concerns about the impact of tariffs on corporate profits and economic growth.\n\nSeveral European leaders reacted negatively to President Trump's tariff announcement.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni wrote on social media that she felt the tariffs were misguided and would not help either the U.S. or Italy.\n\n\"We will do everything we can to work towards an agreement with the United States, with the aim of avoiding a trade war that would inevitably weaken the West in favor of other global players. In any case, as always, we will act in the interest of Italy and its economy, also by discussing with other European partners,\" she wrote.\n\nSwedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson on social media wrote, We don't want growing trade barriers. We don't want a trade war ... We want to find our way back to a path of trade and cooperation together with the US, so that people in our countries can enjoy a better life.\"\n\nManfred Weber, president of The European People's Party Group, the largest party in the European Union, said on social media: \"Today isn't liberation day-it's resentment day. Donald Trump's tariffs don't defend fair trade they attack it out of fear and hurt both sides of the Atlantic. Europe stands united, ready to defend its interests, and open to fair, firm talks.\"\n\nIrish Prime Minister Micheal Martin called the tariffs \"deeply regrettable,\" adding, \"I strongly believe that tariffs benefit no one. My priority, and that of the government, is to protect Irish jobs and the Irish economy.\"\n\nPresident Trump announced a 10% tariff Wednesday on all countries and additional reciprocal tariffs on the \"worst offenders.\" The baseline tariffs go into effect on Saturday, April 5, and the reciprocal tariffs on Wednesday, April 9. Mr. Trump declared a national emergency due to the trade deficit, saying it \"threatens our security and our very way of life.\"\n\nCBS News' Weijia Jiang, Kelly O'Grady, Jo Ling Kent and Margaret Brennan break down the president's announcement and its likely impact.\n\nFree trade advocates blasted the Trump administration after it unveiled a 10% tariff on all U.S. imports from foreign countries and reciprocal tariffs on more than 90 countries.\n\nTrade experts Colin Grabow and Scott Lincicome of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said in a statement that the White House's barrage of new tariffs will raise prices for U.S. consumers, dent business investment, dampen broader economic growth and expose American manufacturers to retaliatory trade measures from other countries.\n\n\"The tariffs' only clear beneficiaries, meanwhile, will be corporate cronies, K Street influence peddlers and American adversaries who profit from the United States' tarnished international reputation,\" Grabow and Lincicome said.\n\nThe Cato analysts' warning aligns with the view of most mainstream economists, who emphasize that tariffs are paid by U.S. importers and that businesses typically pass along many of those costs to consumers.\n\nAfter a nearly hourlong speech, Mr. Trump signed two executive orders enacting the reciprocal tariffs and another closing a U.S. loophole that allows duty-free shipments of Chinese goods worth less than $800.\n\nPresident Trump on Wednesday announced so-called reciprocal tariffs on roughly 90 countries, along with a baseline 10% universal levy on all U.S. trading partners.\n\nA reciprocal tariff is a tax on U.S. imports that matches the duties that other countries charge on American exports.\n\nIn this case, the Trump administration said it will impose reciprocal tariffs at roughly half the rate of duties charged by other nations, a move economists said suggest a willingness by Trump officials to thrash out new trade terms.\n\nA key question moving forward is how long the White House intends to leave the reciprocal and new baseline tariff in place.\n\n\"[T]he point to emphasize is that if the purpose of the reciprocal tariffs is to bring countries to the negotiating table, then these tariffs could plausibly have a relatively short lifespan - compared to product-specific or any other blanket tariffs - in cases where trade partners are willing to negotiate,\" Simon MacAdam, deputy chief global economist with Capital Economics, said in a recent note to investors.\n\nThe president announced a baseline tariff of 10% on all countries. Mr. Trump said the tariffs would help \"rebuild our economy and to prevent cheating.\"\n\nThe baseline tariffs take effect on April 5.\n\nMr. Trump, listing off a long list of what he considers trade imbalances, said he would soon sign an executive order to institute reciprocal tariffs \"on countries throughout the world.\"\n\n\"Reciprocal. That means they do it to us and we do it to them,\" he said.\n\nThe president brought out a large chart labeled \"reciprocal tariffs\" that appeared to show the tariffs other countries impose on the U.S. and what the U.S. plans to institute on those countries.\n\nMr. Trump said China would be hit with a 34% reciprocal tariff, the European Union 20%, Vietnam 46%, Taiwan 32%, Japan 24%, India 26% and South Korea 25%. The chart showed Cambodia facing the highest reciprocal tariff, at 49%, followed by Laos at 48% and Madagascar at 47%.\n\nThe reciprocal tariffs will take effect on April 9.\n\n\"The United States can no longer produce enough antibiotics to treat our sick. We have a tremendous problem. We have to go to foreign countries to treat our sick. If anything ever happened, from a war standpoint, we wouldn't be able to do it. We import virtually all of our computers, phones, televisions and electronics. We used to dominate the field, and now we import it all from different countries,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\n\"Trade deficits are no longer merely an economic problem. They are a national emergency that threatens our security and our very way of life. It's a very great threat to our country,\" he continued. \"For these reasons, starting tomorrow, the United States will implement reciprocal tariffs on other nations.\"\n\nMr. Trump opened his remarks declaring, \"This is Liberation Day.\"\n\nHe said April 2, 2025, \"will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America's destiny was reclaimed and the day that we began to make America wealthy again.\"\n\nMr. Trump exuded confidence about dialing up tariffs despite warnings from economists that they will increase prices on American consumers who have already been hit hard by inflation.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly referred to the tariffs he is set to announce on April 2 as \"Liberation Day.\" But liberation from what? First and foremost, Mr. Trump wants to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign goods.\n\nMore broadly, and going back to his first term in the White House, Mr. Trump has long sought to reshape the global trade system. Underlying that goal is his view that other countries' trade policies, along with treaties such as the 1992 North American Free Trade Agreement and 2020 United States-Mexico-Canada agreement, harm American manufacturers and workers.\n\nTrump administration officials say that tariffs will spur both foreign and domestic companies to expand in the U.S.; lead to more balanced trade with economic allies; reduce the U.S. trade deficit with other countries; and generate federal revenue that can be used for other priorities.\n\n\"I will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families,\" Mr. Trump said in his Jan. 20 inaugural address . \"Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens.\"\n\nRank-and-file steelworkers and autoworkers are expected to be in the Rose Garden audience for Mr. Trump's announcement, as are most of Mr. Trump's Cabinet, including Vice President JD Vance, two White House officials told CBS News. No CEOs are expected.\n\nSome members of Congress were also invited, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, and Republican Sens. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee and Bernie Moreno of Ohio.\n\n- Sara Cook, Jennifer Jacobs\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said this week that the president's plan will place reciprocal tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, and that the reciprocal tariffs will go into effect \"immediately.\"\n\nThe president hasn't said what the tariff rates on foreign goods will be, and whether they will be global or affect products from specific countries. Leavitt said Tuesday that Mr. Trump was still finalizing the plan details with his trade team.\n\nThe president's new tariffs will bring back manufacturing jobs, Leavitt said, as well as \"improve American competitiveness in every area of industry, reduce our massive trade deficits, and ultimately protect our economic and national security.\"\n\nStocks hovered in positive terrain shortly before the close of trading as investors awaited word from President Trump on Wednesday afternoon about new matching tariffs the U.S. is expected to deploy against its trading partners.\n\nFinancial markets have retreated this year amid mounting concerns that Mr. Trump's economic policies could jar spending by American consumers and businesses, hurting economic growth.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose a modest 14 points, or 0.2%, to 5,6476, in afternoon trading, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively.\n\nFor investors, according to Wall Street analysts, key questions regarding the levies the U.S. is expected to unveil on Wednesday - known as \"reciprocal\" tariffs - include which countries and products will be targeted; what the tariff rates will be; and how long the levies might remain in place.\n\nMr. Trump announced last week that vehicles and auto parts imported into the U.S. will be subject to a 25% tariff rate.\n\nThe auto tariffs are expected to go into effect at midnight, just hours after the latest round of tariff announcements by the president Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe levies will lead to higher costs for auto manufacturers, and those costs are expected to trickle down to consumers. Some automakers have already announced higher car prices.\n\n-By Megan Cerullo, Sarah Lynch Baldwin\n\nAll car manufacturers will be impacted by the new tariffs, according to analysts, but some will be hit much harder than others.\n\nGeneral Motors is expected to be the most exposed to auto tariffs because it makes just 45% of the vehicles it sells to U.S. customers domestically, whereas Ford is expected to be better positioned to weather the tariffs given 80% of its vehicles are manufactured in the U.S.\n\nSee a breakdown of which cars may be most impacted here .\n\nMost Americans say Mr. Trump has focused too much on tariffs - which they believe will end up raising prices - and not enough on lowering prices, our latest CBS News poll found .\n\n-By Anthony Salvanto, Jennifer De Pinto, Kabir Khanna, Fred Backus\n\nDuring the first three months of 2025, the S&P 500 lost 4.6%, marking the worst quarter in two-and-a-half years. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite ended the first three months of the year with a 10.4% decline, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 2.2% over the same period.\n\nInvestors are anxious over a potentially toxic mix of worsening inflation and a slowing U.S. economy because households are afraid to spend due to a deepening trade war escalated by Mr. Trump.\n\nRead more here .\n\nThe president of the United Auto Workers Union has praised Mr. Trump's move to impose tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported into the U.S., while also noting that \"tariffs aren't the total solution.\"\n\n\"Tariffs are a tool in the toolbox to get these companies to do the right thing, and the intent behind it is to bring jobs back here, and, you know, invest in the American workers,\" Shawn Fain told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett in an interview that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday.\n\nRead more here .\n\nEconomists warn that the Trump administration's fusillade of tariffs on everything from foreign cars and Chinese-made goods to groceries could raise prices for Americans just as inflation is returning to normal.\n\nAnother widely used product that experts say could see higher costs: housing. The National Association of Home Builders recently estimated that U.S. tariffs on steel, aluminum and lumber imports could add more than $9,000 to the price of a typical home, while also driving up renovation costs.\n\nHomebuilders also face headwinds from the White House's crackdown on immigrants, which could lead to a shortage of labor in the construction sector.\n\n\"Trade protectionism will increase prices on key material construction inputs,\" Fitch Ratings said in an April 1 report. \"Foreign born, non-citizen workers represent an overwhelming share of key specialty construction occupations, and immigration restrictions are likely to raise labor costs.\"\n\nPresident Trump has argued that his tariffs could help the government raise over $1 trillion in the next year or so, helping to reduce the national debt and even potentially offset some income taxes.\n\nBut economists are skeptical that these tariffs can bring in as much as Mr. Trump claims, as consumers will likely reduce their spending on foreign goods when prices go up.\n\nThe president's trillion-dollar estimates are significantly higher than those provided by think tanks and even some of his own officials.\n\nRead more here .\n\nAlain Sherter is a senior managing editor with CBS News.

      "text": "Denver economics professor weighs in on Trump's 25% tariffs on imported vehicles\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nApril 7, 2025 / 6:57 AM MDT / CBS Colorado\n\nOne of the industries that will be impacted the most by President Donald Trump's tariffs is the auto industry. The president's 25% tariffs on imported cars took effect last week, with the tariffs also impacting imported car parts starting in May. That leaves a lot of questions for potential car buyers and people who already own vehicles.\n\nDr. Kishore Kulkarni, an economics professor at Metropolitan State University of Denver, said this is uncharted territory for the auto industry and will have a big impact on potential car buyers, who could end up paying thousands more dollars to buy a car in the months ahead.\n\n\"Without a doubt, cars will be more expensive next week than they are today,\" said Kulkarni.\n\nWhile Kulkarni said that while it's still hard to predict how much prices could go up, some other economists are saying car prices could rise $8,000 to $15,000 depending on if the car is made here or overseas.\n\nWith the tariffs, all cars will be impacted, including cars being imported to the United States and cars being made here in the country.\n\nKulkarni added that cars are very complex products, and the auto industry is likely the number one industry where parts come from different countries. He said there are very few cars that are completely American-made with nothing imported. For example, Tesla is considered American-made but does have several imported car parts.\n\n\"For many cars, assembly is somewhere, the engine is from somewhere, body parts are somewhere. So clearly, a car is a very complex commodity that needs a lot of imported stuff and imported inputs, and therefore, car companies will find a way to adapt to all this,\" said Kulkarni.\n\nKulkarni also said the prices of used cars will go up, too because of supply and demand. As the prices of new cars rise, some buyers might look into buying a used car instead, therefore raising prices in the used market too. The costs of getting your car serviced or repaired could also go up.\n\nWith the move, some U.S. automakers have already announced layoffs or delayed price hikes, while some overseas companies have paused car shipments to the U.S.\n\nKulkarni isn't surprised and said there would be supply chain impacts as too.\n\n\"As the cost goes up, there won't be as much responsive supply because other countries will be a little lethargic sending stuff to U.S. rather than some other countries,\" said Kulkarni. \"Outside countries will always find ways to channel their products to some other countries in the world than in the U.S.\"\n\nVehicles already on lots are not impacted by tariffs. So, if you're thinking about buying a car and can afford it, it's recommended to buy it sooner rather than later to avoid paying thousands of dollars more. However, don't rush to buy a car if you're not ready.\n\nAshley Portillo is a reporter for CBS News Colorado.

      "text": "Argentinian president doubles down on Trump support, attends Mar-a-Lago event as the world reacts to tariffs\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  April 5, 2025 / 11:16 AM EDT / CBS/AP\n\nEurope vowed retaliation . China plotted tariffs of its own . Mexico scrambled to blunt the blow. But while the world's leaders were wringing their hands over President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs on U.S. imports , Argentina's right-wing president was ebullient, feted at Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago club.\n\nAs part of his enthusiastic outreach to Mr. Trump, Argentine President Javier Milei flew from one of the planet's southernmost nations all the way to Palm Beach for 24 hours to receive an award honoring his libertarian agenda and, he'd hoped, to chat with Mr. Trump , who was also scheduled to attend the right-wing \"American Patriot\" gala.\n\n\"Make Argentina Great Again!\" Milei bellowed from the ballroom stage at at Mar-a-Lago late Thursday.\n\nIt would have been the fourth face-to-face meeting between the leaders since Mr. Trump's election victory last November as President Milei, who has imposed a sweeping austerity program to fix Argentina's long troubled economy, offers himself as one of Mr. Trump's strongest allies in the global culture war against the \"woke\" left.\n\nWhether Milei's staunch alliance with Mr. Trump can actually help crisis-stricken Argentina remains to be seen, analysts say.\n\n\"He has a special relationship with Trump that has been good for him politically, but he needs to translate that into being good for the country economically,\" said Marcelo J. García, director for the Americas at New York-based geopolitical risk consultancy Horizon Engage. \"He hasn't managed to do that yet.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Milei pulled Argentina out of the World Health Organization after the U.S. announced its own exit .\n\nHe threatened to quit the Paris climate accord after Mr. Trump did . He outlawed gender change treatments for minors after Mr. Trump banned transgender athletes from participating in women's sports. He even promoted a cryptocurrency token echoing the $Trump memecoin - at great political cost. In Milei's case, the cryptocoin Libra collapsed and left investors holding the bag, to the tune of $250 million. He later admitted that he posted about the coin without properly vetting the details.\n\nMilei has also slashed government spending, similarly to what Mr. Trump and Elon Musk have done with the Department of Government Efficiency. He has reduced government spending in Argentina by over 30% since taking office in 2023 by eliminating about a dozen government agencies, laying off 10% of the federal workforce and freezing state wages and pensions. While the cuts have lowered the country's hyperinflation, they have pushed up unemployment and poverty rates. Weekly protests have been held criticizing the cuts.\n\nThe cuts were something Milei promised while running for office, even wielding a chainsaw during his campaign. He then gifted Musk a giant chainsaw modeled after the power tool. Musk waved the chainsaw during remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\nRailing against socialism and feminism at speaking events all over the world - including at CPAC - Milei has fashioned himself into something of a MAGA celebrity.\n\nWhile U.S. partners and rivals alike were criticizing Mr. Trump's tariffs, a tux-clad Milei was holding forth beside a painting of Mr. Trump's pumped fist, reveling in the opportunity to prove himself a dogged champion of the American president.\n\n\"As you can see, we conduct policy with actions, not mere words, and on that we agree with President Donald Trump,\" Milei told the crowd at Mar-a-Lago, drawing cheers at the mention of the American president's name as he spoke in Spanish.\n\nIn Buenos Aires, Milei's government sought to reconcile Mr. Trump's major round of tariffs with its own radical libertarian ideology and fervent support for free trade.\n\n\"We do not believe this is an attack on free trade, quite the opposite,\" Milei's spokesperson, Manuel Adorni, said of Mr. Trump's announcement. \"I don't see why there should be so much concern about this.\"\n\nFor all the leaders' mutual flattery, Argentina was slapped with a 10% minimum tariff. But officials framed it as uniquely preferential treatment. The front page of Argentina's largest-circulation daily, Clarín, declared: \"Trump raises the tax on our products less than on other countries.\"\n\nIn Washington, Argentine Foreign Minister Gerardo Werthein on Thursday held what he described as \"highly productive\" meetings with top U.S. trade negotiator Jamieson Greer and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, releasing rosy statements promising that Argentina was on its way to negotiating a free-trade agreement with the U.S.\n\nMilei praised progress toward the free deal in his Mar-a-Lago speech. But far more important to the Argentine leader is a hoped-for $20 billion bailout with the International Monetary Fund. The badly needed cash would help Milei keep his ambitious economic reforms on track as pressure mounts on the country's sparse foreign currency reserves.\n\nMilei has already used executive powers to remove the need for Congress to approve a new IMF program. But the loan hasn't cleared the finish line, with negotiators still haggling over how much cash Argentina, a serial defaulter that owes some $44 billion to the fund, will be allowed to access up-front.\n\nIt was against this backdrop on Wednesday that Milei, accompanied by his economy minister, hopped on the plane to the U.S., the fund's biggest stakeholder. He told journalists he expected \"an informal meeting\" with Mr. Trump, who was instrumental during his first term in helping Argentina secure a major $56 billion loan from the fund in 2018.\n\nBut on Friday, Milei's much-anticipated photo-op with Mr. Trump was nowhere to be found in his publicist's slick montage of the Argentine president snapping selfies with fans on Mar-a-Lago's red carpet.\n\nThe president's office said nothing about his meeting - or, non-meeting - with Mr. Trump, and did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nMr. Trump arrived at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach very late Thursday evening after attending an event with professional golfers at one of his golf courses near Miami. The White House didn't say whether he and Milei met.\n\nMajor Argentine newspapers cited anonymous officials saying the leaders never met, drawing instant scorn from his political enemies.\n\n\"When I woke up, I thought I'd find on TV the photo-op with your 'friend' Trump that you went looking for,\" left-wing former President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner wrote on social media. \"What a way to mess around and spend money on nothing.\"\n\n© 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

She received certificates of competency in 2018 and 2019 but was never confirmed for the position.\n\nDemocratic senators discovered that, according to the Arizona Daily Star , she had a restraining order taken out against her for leaving a bullet-riddled target sheet in the office of an Arizona doctor she was upset with, and her nomination didn't proceed. Trump did not renominate her in 2020, according to a Democratic staff report for the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\nPresident-elect Trump on Jan. 6 announced he has selected Joseph Nocella Jr. for the role of U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York.\n\nThe eastern district includes each of the counties on Long Island, including Brooklyn's Kings County and Queens County, along with Staten Island's Richmond County. Nocella Jr.  has been the Nassau County District Court Judge since 2022.\n\n\"Judge Nocella has a strong record of bringing Law and Order to the incredible people of New York, serving as a Nassau County District Court Judge, and Family Court Judge,\" Trump wrote on social media. \"A proud graduate of Columbia Law School, he has also spent over ten years in private practice.\"\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump announced on Jan. 3 that he picked Roman Pipko to serve as ambassador to Estonia.\n\nPipko was born and raised in Estonia and immigrated to the United States in 1981, according to an article on Soviet law he co-authored. He worked at the W. A. Harriman Institute for the Advanced Study of the Soviet Union at Columbia University and has a law degree from Yale Law School.\n\nTrump said Pipko has extensive experience in dealing with foreign governments and represented U.S. interests in the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Russian American Enterprise Fund.\n\n\"As a legal immigrant, he has lived the promise of America, and I trust that he will advance American interests in his new role,\" said Trump.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump announced on Jan. 2 that he has selected Benjamin Leon Jr. to serve as ambassador to Spain.\n\nLeon is the founder of Leon Medical Centers, which provides care to Medicare patients in the Miami area.

He had previously worked as the Florida state director for Trump's 2020 reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee.\n\n\"Few understand Latin American politics as well as Kevin - He will do a FANTASTIC job representing our Nation's interests in Panama!\" Trump wrote on social media.\n\nTrump in recent days has suggested the U.S. should retake control of the Panama Canal, which has been fully operated by the Panama government-owned Panama Canal Authority since 1999, following the signing of a treaty by President Jimmy Carter in 1977.\n\nIn response, Panama President José Raúl Mulino said that \"every square meter\" of the canal \"belongs to Panama and will continue belonging to Panama.\"\n\n\"We'll see about that!\" Trump posted after Mulion's reply. In another social media post, Trump shared an image of an American flag planted in the canal with the caption \"Welcome to the United States Canal!\"\n\nAccording to the U.S. State Department, the U.S. uses the canal more than any other nation, with 72% of all ships going through the passageway heading to or from U.S. ports.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump announced on Dec. 4 he has picked ambassadors to Portugal and Malta.\n\nSomers Farkas, the wife of Jonathan Farkas, an heir to the Alexander's department store fortune , is Trump's choice to serve as the next United States ambassador to the Republic of Malta.\n\n\"Somers is a model, philanthropist, documentary producer, and very successful businesswoman,\" Trump wrote on social media .\n\nTrump also announced he's chosen automotive entrepreneur John Arrigo tol serve as the next United States ambassador to Portugal.\n\n\"John is a highly successful entrepreneur in the automotive industry, and a champion golfer.

Ketchel previously worked for the Republican Attorneys General Association and at the National Republican Congressional Committee.\n\nOne of Trump's transition team spokespeople, Brian Hughes, will be deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, according to sources. And James Hewitt, Waltz's congressional communications director, will serve in a communications role at Trump's new NSC.\n\nRead more here.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump announced on Dec. 22 he has chosen Mauricio Claver-Carone for the role of State Department special envoy for Latin America. Claver-Carone held several positions over the course of Trump's first administration, including senior director for Western Hemisphere affairs at the National Security Council. Trump said on social media that Claver-Carone would be focusing on immigration and fentanyl.\n\nClaver-Carone went on to serve as president of the Inter-American Development Bank.

Gingrich, the wife of Newt Gingrich, was ambassador to the Vatican during Trump's first term.\n\nTrump also said he will nominate Ken Howery for U.S. ambassador to Denmark. Howery was the U.S. ambassador to Sweden during Trump's first term. \"As a Co-Founder of PayPal and venture capital fund, Founders Fund, Ken turned American Innovation and Tech leadership into Global success stories, and that experience will be invaluable in representing us abroad,\" Trump wrote.\n\nHe also said, \"For purposes of National Security and Freedom throughout the World, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity.\"\n\nTrump in his first term had explored the idea of buying Greenland , which Denmark's leadership made clear was not for sale .\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump on Sunday, Dec. 22 announced several picks for Defense Department positions.\n\nTrump said he will tap Stephen Feinberg to serve as Deputy Secretary of Defense. Feinberg, the cofounder and CEO of Cerberus Capital Management, was the head of Trump's Intelligence Advisory Board during his first term.\n\nTrump also said he has selected Elbridge Colby for the position of under secretary of defense for policy. Colby was also part of Trump's first administration, serving as deputy assistant secretary of defense. Colby previously spoke with CBS News about how his belief that the U.S. needs to be better prepared to counter China's growing influence in Asia.\n\nMichael Duffey was announced for the role of under secretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment. \"Mike has been a strong advocate for our Warfighters and the American Taxpayer throughout his many years of public service, including in the Department of Defense, and the Office of Management and Budget of my First Administration,\" Trump wrote on social media.\n\nDuring Trump's first impeachment in 2019, then-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer pointed to an email Duffey had sent while serving as associate director for National Security Programs at the Office of Management and Budget - in which he informed the Pentagon of the freeze in aid to Ukraine -  as an example of why witnesses should be called during the impeachment trial. Ultimately, no witnesses were called.\n\nTrump also said he has selected former Uber executive Emil Michael for under secretary of defense for research and engineering. \"Emil will ensure that our Military has the most technologically sophisticated weapons in the World, while saving A LOT of money for our Taxpayers,\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump has selected billionaire Republican donor Tilman Fertitta as U.S. ambassador to Italy, the president elect announced on Dec. 21.\n\n\"I am pleased to announce that Tilman J. Fertitta has been nominated to serve as the United States Ambassador to Italy,\" Trump said in a post to his Truth Social platform.\n\nFertitta is owner of the NBA's Houston Rockets and CEO of hospitality group Landry's, Inc. Earlier this month, people familiar with the decision told CBS News that Trump would pick Fertitta for the post.\n\nIn Trump's first administration, Lewis Eisenberg served as his ambassador to Italy. If confirmed by the Senate, Fertitta would replace current U.S. Ambassador to Italy Jack Markell.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump announced on Dec. 21 he has tapped Mark Burnett as the special envoy to the United Kingdom, a newly-created post.\n\nA prolific television producer, The 64-year-old British native is best known for launching the reality show \"Survivor\" in the U.S. He also created and produced the show \"The Apprentice,\" which launched Trump back into the spotlight in the early 2000s.\n\nA source familiar with the decision told CBS News that Burnett was originally on the list for consideration as U.S. ambassador to the U.K., but as a dual national, that made the situation complicated. That selection ultimately went to Republican donor Warren Stephens, CEO of investment bank Stephens Inc.\n\nIt is unclear exactly what Burnett's envoy role will consist of.\n\n\"With a distinguished career in television production and business, Mark brings a unique blend of diplomatic acumen and international recognition to this important role,\" wrote Trump on social media. \"Mark will work to enhance diplomatic relations, focusing on areas of mutual interest, including trade, investment opportunities, and cultural exchanges.\"\n\nTrump added that \"Mark brings a unique blend of diplomatic acumen and international recognition to this important role.\"\n\n- Margaret Brennan contributed to this report.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump announced on Dec. 21 that he selected David Fink as the next Administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration.\n\n\"I am proud to announce that Highly Respected David Fink, a fifth generation Railroader, will be the next Administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). David will bring his 45+ years of transportation leadership and success, which will deliver the FRA into a new era of safety and technological innovation,\" Trump wrote on social media.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump announced on Dec. 21 that he selected Aaron Reitz as the next Head of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Policy.\n\n\"I am pleased to nominate Aaron Reitz to serve as the next Head of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Policy (OLP). Aaron will lead OLP to develop and implement DOJ's battle plans to advance my Law and Order Agenda and restore integrity to our Justice System. He will be working with Attorney General Nominee, Pam Bondi,\" wrote Trump on social media.\n\nReitz is currently the chief of staff for Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, who ran for president against Trump in 2016.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump announced on Dec. 21 that he picked Chad Mizelle to serve as the Chief of Staff at the Department of Justice.\n\n\"I am pleased to announce that Chad Mizelle will serve as Chief of Staff at the Department of Justice, where he will work with our wonderful Attorney General Nominee, Pam Bondi,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.\n\nPam Bondi , the former Florida attorney general, was chosen by Donald Trump to serve as U.S. attorney general hours after his first choice, Matt Gaetz , withdrew from consideration after a federal sex trafficking investigation and ethics probe made his ability to be confirmed dubious.\n\nTrump said during his first term Mizelle, \"helped to secure our Border, and stop the flow of illegal drugs and aliens into our Country,\" as the General Counsel and Chief of Staff at the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\"Chad is a MAGA warrior, who will help bring accountability, integrity, and Justice back to the DOJ,\" Trump wrote.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump announced Dec. 17 that he has selected former Republican Georgia Senate candidate Herschel Walker as his pick for U.S. ambassador to the Bahamas.\n\nWalker is a former college and NFL football star whose unsuccessful 2022 campaign in the runoff election against Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock was plagued by controversy.\n\n\"Herschel has spent decades serving as an Ambassador to our Nation's youth, our men and women in the Military, and athletes at home and abroad,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post announcing the selection.\n\nThe selection must still be confirmed by the Senate. Kimberly Furnish has served as the embassy's chargé d'affaires since June, and the U.S. has not had a sitting ambassador to the Bahamas since 2011. In 2017, Trump tapped billionaire Doug Manchester for the role, but the pick stalled, and a CBS News investigation in 2019 uncovered a possible pay-to-play scheme involving the Republican National Committee and Manchester, who eventually withdrew his name from consideration.\n\nDuring his embattled Senate bid, Walker - who ran on an anti-abortion rights platform - was forced to contend with allegations that he had previously paid for the abortions of two women, claims he vehemently denied on the campaign trail.\n\nThe race was closely watched because Warnock's victory gave the Democrats a thin 51-seat majority in the Senate. They lost that majority in the November election.\n\nDespite his 2022 loss, Walker remained a surrogate for Trump in the 2024 election, often stumping for him on the campaign trail.\n\nPresident-elect Trump announced on Dec. 17 that he will nominate Nicole McGraw for the role of U.S. ambassador to Croatia.\n\n\"Nicole is a philanthropist, businesswoman, and World renowned art collector. She opened her first art gallery in Palm Beach Gardens in 2006, and has since built a client base that spans the Globe, as well as a successful hedge fund specializing in fine art investments,\" Trump wrote on social media.\n\nTrump announced his picks for several more ambassadorships on Monday, Dec. 16.\n\nHe named Lou Rinaldi as his choice for ambassador to Uruguay. \"A successful businessman, entrepreneur, and longtime friend, Lou brings a lifetime of experience and unique perspective to this important role,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. \"Having grown up in Uruguay, he possesses an intimate understanding of the Country's culture and history.\"\n\nLeah Francis Campos, Trump's pick for ambassador to the Dominican Republic, previously served as a CIA case officer and then a senior adviser for the Western Hemisphere for the House Foreign Affairs Committee. She is also the sister of Fox News host Rachel Campos-Duffy, and Campos' brother-in-law, former congressman Sean Duffy, is Trump's pick for secretary of transportation.\n\nTrump chose Arthur Graham Fisher, founder of a real estate firm in North Carolina, for ambassador to Austria. \"Art has been a staunch supporter of America First Policies, and will make us proud in Austria!\" he wrote.\n\nAnd Stacey Feinberg was chosen for ambassador to Luxembourg. Trump said Feinberg worked with her father at his sports and entertainment law firm before becoming a Broadway producer, motivational speaker, and serving on the board of the Women Founders Network.\n\nTrump announced on Monday, Dec. 16, that George Glass is his choice for U.S. ambassador to Japan. Glass' likely pick was first reported by CBS News last week.\n\nGlass served as ambassador to Portugal during the first Trump administration. Prior to that he worked in investment banking and real estate.\n\n\"Highly respected man. That's right,\" Trump said when asked at a news conference if Glass was his pick. \"Hghly respected. He's been an ambassador before did a fantastic job. We consider Japan very important. He's very highly respected.\"\n\n- Jennifer Jacobs, Ed O'Keefe and Fin Gómez\n\nTrump on Dec. 14 announced that he has selected Richard Grenell as his presidential envoy for special missions, a new position.\n\nThe 58-year-old Grenell, a longtime Trump loyalist, served as both acting U.S. director of national intelligence and U.S. ambassador to Germany during Trump's first term.\n\nGrenell, however, resigned his ambassadorship in June 2020 after he strained relations with Germany over his public stances on a number of issues, including expressing support for Europe's right-wing political movements, and threatening to withdraw U.S. troops from Germany amid the first Trump administration's ongoing criticisms of NATO .\n\nIn early 2020, previous political consulting work he had allegedly done for foreign entities brought scrutiny from Senate Democrats over allegations that it may have presented a conflict of interest with his positions as ambassador and acting DNI director.\n\nGrenell also served as a State Department spokesman to the United Nations during George W.

She worked in the White House during Trump's first term as assistant press secretary.\n\n\"Karoline is smart, tough, and has proven to be a highly effective communicator. I have the utmost confidence she will excel at the podium,\" Trump said in a statement on Nov. 15.\n\nThe 27-year-old previously ran an unsuccessful race for Congress in New Hampshire.\n\nTodd Blanche was picked to serve as deputy attorney general, the second-highest position in the Justice Department.

Burgum was also in attendance.\n\nBurgum ran against Trump for the Republican nomination before dropping out in December and endorsing Trump the following month . He was also at one point on a shortlist to be Trump's running mate.\n\nWhen asked by reporters ahead of the gala about the possibility of joining the Trump administration, Burgum responded, \"There's been a lot of discussions about a lot of different things. And...like I said...nothing's true till you read it on Truth Social.\"\n\nTrump made the announcement official in a statement on Nov. 15 and said Burgum would also lead \"the newly formed, and very important, National Energy Council.\" Trump said the council would include all the departments and agencies involved in \"the permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, transportation of ALL forms of American Energy.\"\n\nTrump announced that he has selected former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard to serve as his director of national intelligence.\n\n\"For over two decades, Tulsi has fought for our country and the freedoms of all Americans,\" he said in a statement on Nov. 13.\n\nGabbard served in the Army National Guard and represented Hawaii in the House from 2013 to 2021 before becoming an independent in 2022.

They will all serve as assistants to the president and deputy chiefs of staff overseeing specific areas.\n\n\"Dan, Stephen, James, and Taylor were 'best in class' advisors on my winning campaign, and I know they will honorably serve the American people in the White House,\" Trump said on Nov. 13. \"They will continue to work hard to Make America Great Again in their respective new roles.\"\n\nScavino will serve as deputy chief of staff and is described by Trump as one of his \"longest serving and most trusted aides.\" He served as deputy chief of staff for communications and director of social media during Trump's first term.\n\nMiller, who also worked in the White House for Trump during his first four years in office, will return as deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security adviser.

The post requires Senate confirmation.\n\n\"Mike has been a great public servant, governor, and leader in faith for many years,\" Trump said in a statement on Nov. 12. \"He loves Israel, and the people of Israel, and likewise, the people of Israel love him. Mike will work tirelessly to bring about Peace in the Middle East!\"\n\nHuckabee served as Arkansas' governor from 1996 to 2007 and unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 and 2016.

Elise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter,\" Trump said in a statement on Nov. 11.\n\nStefanik withdrew from the race to be conference chair, confirming in a letter to her GOP colleagues she had spoken with Trump and \"shared how deeply humbled I am to accept his nomination.\"\n\nThe role of U.N. ambassador requires Senate confirmation.\n\nRep. Michael Waltz , a Florida Republican, was named national security adviser. Trump praised his military record and expertise on China, Russia, Iran and global terrorism.\n\n\"Mike has been a strong champion of my America First Foreign Policy agenda, and will be a tremendous champion of our pursuit of Peace through Strength!\" the president-elect said in a statement on Nov. 11.\n\nWaltz, a Green Beret veteran who served multiple combat tours in Afghanistan, the Middle East and Africa, was elected to Congress in 2018, replacing Ron DeSantis who had been elected Florida's governor.\n\nWaltz, a China hawk, serves on the House China Task Force that aims to develop solutions to address the Chinese Communist Party's influence.

During the conversation, he said Trump's plan for mass deportation would be implemented.\n\n\"I hear a lot of people say, you know, the talk of a mass deportation is racist. It's- it's- it's threatening to the immigrant community. It's not threatening to the immigrant community,\" Homan said. \"It should be threatening to the illegal immigrant community. But on the heels of [a] historic illegal immigration crisis. That has to be done.\"\n\nWithin a day of winning the election, Trump announced his campaign co-chair Susie Wiles would be his chief of staff. Wiles, an experienced Florida-based political operative based, will be the first woman in U.S. history to fill the role. Chief of staff isn't a Senate-confirmed position, but it's a prestigious position often considered to be part of the Cabinet.\n\nKathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital, based in Washington, D.C.\n\nCopyright ©2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "Congress could stop Trump's tariff plan, but they probably won't\n\nEven though new bills are being proposed to rein him in, don't hold your breath waiting for Congress to stop President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff plan .\n\nRepublican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa and Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington on Thursday introduced a Senate bill to limit a president's power to impose tariffs. The bill would allow Congress to vote to end any tariff at any time, require the president to provide Congress with 48 hours' notice before imposing any new duties, and require Congress to explicitly approve any new tariffs within 60 days.\n\nFour additional Republicans - Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, and Jerry Moran of Kansas - have signed on as co-sponsors to the bill. Republican Rep. Don Bacon has also said he'll introduce a companion House bill with similar provisions.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to four political scientists who each said that, while the bills proposed by the Republican lawmakers represent the first time some members of the president's party have split with him publicly since the election, the proposals are largely symbolic objections and are all but guaranteed not to pass because, even with the support of Democratic lawmakers, the bills simply won't have enough votes.\n\n\"Congress has the ability, but Congress, as it's currently constituted, does not have the will,\" Justin Crowe, a professor of political science at Williams College, told BI. \"There's virtually no chance, at least in the near term. Were we to be in a fuller-blown trade war and we had some kind of economic downturn of a serious magnitude over the next number of months, potentially, you could see Congress trying to step in. But in the near term, that seems remarkably, vanishingly unlikely.\"\n\nJustin Buchler, an associate professor of political science at Case Western Reserve University, told BI that, technically, the proposed bills shouldn't even be necessary since the Constitution grants Congress the exclusive power to levy tariffs and duties. However, in recent years, lawmakers have taken a less active role in doing so, instead allowing the executive branch to execute tariff policies within the guidelines defined by Congress.\n\nSix different statutes exist to control how the president can use tariffs . Only three carve-outs exist to allow the president to impose tariffs without a congressional investigation. Still, only one has ever been used: the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, which allows the president to declare an emergency under the National Emergency Act to regulate or prohibit imports.\n\nTrump cited that power on Wednesday when he announced sweeping 10% tariffs on goods imported from almost every country into the United States and even higher tariffs for 60 trading partners with a persistent trade deficit with the US.\n\nAccording to the National Constitution Center , the other two presidential tariff carve-outs, which have never been used, stem from the Trade Act of 1974 and the Tariff Act of 1930. Portions of these laws allow the president to enact temporary tariffs to address balance-of-payments deficits and tariffs on goods from foreign countries that discriminate against US commerce in certain ways.\n\nBut the political scientists told Business Insider not to expect Congress to try to claw back its trade power in any real way.\n\n\"We're in this weird position where, constitutionally, no legislation should be necessary because what Donald Trump is doing is so far beyond the bounds of what the Constitution permits that nothing should be happening at all,\" Buchler said. \"But the courts aren't going to stop him, and given that there's no way that Congress is going to reach a veto override point - and probably can't even get anything through the House, given that Mike Johnson is not likely to let anything come up for a vote - it's probably a moot point.\"\n\nSupply chain experts and economists previously told Business Insider that Trump's wide-reaching \"Liberation Day\" tariffs are expected to result in higher prices for everything from pantry staples like coffee and sugar to apparel and larger purchases like cars and appliances. The market has tanked in response to global trade uncertainty, with stocks suffering their worst single-day loss in five years on Thursday.\n\nAnd while members of Congress are no doubt aware of the economic turmoil stemming from Trump's aggressive trade strategy , there's little incentive to risk using up their political cache on a losing battle - at least for now.\n\n\"I think they're going to wait to see whether their constituents complain,\" Susan McWilliams Barndt, a professor of politics at Pomona College, told BI. \"I think they're really going to wait to see if their constituents tie their complaints to the tariffs, and then I think it's going to be a couple of weeks before we really see any real response from Congress.\"\n\nPatricia Crouse, a professor of political science at the University of New Haven, agreed, telling BI she expects \"The only real pushback may come if it costs Republicans seats in the 2026 election.\"\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Donald Trump is serving a second presidential term. Here's the lowdown on his personal life, career, and politics.\n\nDonald Trump is president - again.\n\nAfter his inauguration on January 20, 2025, the businessman and former reality television star commenced his second term. Long a fixture of the American cultural scene and now the 45th and 47th president of the United States, he will continue to have untold political influence.\n\nTrump first entered politics in June 2015 when he descended an escalator at Trump Tower in New York City and announced he was entering the 2016 presidential race. Trump's presidency altered the very fabric of the Republican Party, bucking some traditional conservative values and ushering in the MAGA - Make America Great Again - era.\n\nHere's a closer look at Trump's personal history and wide-ranging career.\n\nStarting on his very first moments in office, Trump signed a flurry of day one executive orders and rescinded many of former President Joe Biden's executive actions.\n\nTrump's earliest actions built on themes from his campaign, from an immigration crackdown , to increasing oil and gas production, to shrinking the federal workforce and calling employees back to the office. He signed a series of orders rolling back diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, demanding that government-run diversity offices shut down and green-lighting probes into private companies' DEI efforts. He also issued around 1,500 pardons for January 6 -related offenses included six commutations in the package, including for individuals who had been charged with seditious conspiracy.\n\nTrump also used an executive order to form the Department of Government Efficiency , Elon Musk's cost-cutting and deregulatory body. Despite saying the group would exist outside of government during the campaign, the executive order brought DOGE inside the White House.\n\nTech and corporate leaders beyond Musk have also featured prominently in Trump's second term, with some formally serving in his administration. Silicon Valley leaders, including Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos , had prime spots at his inauguration.\n\nCongress also confirmed a number of Trump's more controversial Cabinet picks , including Pete Hegseth for defense secretary. Marco Rubio soared to confirmation as the secretary of state in a unanimous vote. One of Trump's most contentious nominees, former Rep. Matt Gaetz for attorney general, withdrew from consideration amid allegations of sex-trafficking.\n\nTrump announced his third presidential bid just after the 2022 midterms, and almost two years before election day in 2024. He easily beat his primary rivals and prepared for a rematch against Biden.\n\nTrump complained when Biden dropped out of the presidential race at the end of July and former vice president Kamala Harris soared to the top of the ticket. Polls showed Trump and Harris closely tied in the final days of the race, though Trump ultimately pulled off a comfortable victory, sweeping the seven swing states and winning 312 electoral votes to Harris' 226. He also won the popular vote - the first time a Republican has done so in 20 years.\n\nWhile surveys suggested Biden's unpopularity may have proven unsurmountable for Harris, other stats showed how younger voters tilted red, Latino voters increasingly backed Trump, and economic frustrations likely pushed the needle in his favor, too.\n\nAdditionally, Republicans regained Senate control and maintained control of the House, paving the way for Trump to make judicial appointments and fill any vacancies on the Supreme Court.\n\nThe election cycle was defined by political violence: There were two alleged assassination attempts against Trump , one in Pennsylvania and the other in Florida. The then-candidate survived both.\n\nOn July 13, Thomas Matthew Crooks shot at Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, nicking his ear using an AR-style rifle. A Secret Service sniper killed Crooks, whose motive for the shooting remains unclear. The first assassination attempt quickly became a rallying cry for Trump supporters, and Elon Musk endorsed the former president shortly after.\n\nThe second assassination attempt occurred on Sept. 15 in Palm Beach, Florida at a golf course. Ryan Wesley Routh , the suspect, may have staked out the course for 12 hours. Law enforcement officials said that Routh got close to Trump but didn't have a clear line of sight of the former president. They also said that a Secret Service agent spotted Routh's rifle through a fence and immediately opened fire, at which point the suspect fled. On September 16, Routh was charged with two firearms counts.\n\nGiven the two candidates' wildly different politics, the competition turned nasty at times, with Trump questioning Harris' race and continuing a pattern of misogynistic comments toward female opponents.\n\nIn terms of the economy, a top issue for many voters, Trump promised to extend his hallmark 2017 tax cuts and eliminate taxes on tips. He also threatened broad 10 to 20% tariffs on imported goods , which economists predicted would fuel inflation.\n\nTrump's views on abortion were a sticky subject in the post-Roe environment. He took credit for overturning Roe v. Wade during the race but tempered his stance to appeal to rising pro-choice sentiment. Trump said that states should decide the laws around abortion and didn't publicly supported a federal ban. In August, Trump said that the federal government should pay for costly IVF treatments .\n\nTrump criticized Israel's actions in Gaza at times but portrayed himself as a strong defender of the Israeli state and hosted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago. A temporary cease-fire between Israel and Gaza went into effect days before Trump took office for the second time.\n\nWith respect to the war in Ukraine, Trump repeatedly said he could end the war on Day One , though did not do so on his first day in office. He avoided explicitly saying that he wants Ukraine to win during the campaign.\n\nDonald Trump's legal troubles stretch back to the very beginning of his business career. In 1973, the US Justice Department sued Fred and Donald Trump for allegedly violating the Fair Housing Act in various New York City apartment buildings. The parties settled the suit two years later and the Trumps did not admit to any wrongdoing.\n\nTrump's political rise is backlit by controversy as well, from the personal scandals that have plagued his candidacies to his new status as the first former president convicted of a federal crime . The FBI investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election , but ultimately concluded that there wasn't sufficient evidence to prove that \"members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government.\" Yet the report did find \"numerous links\" between the two groups.\n\nWhile in office during his first term, Trump was impeached twice by the House of Representatives, but the Senate acquitted him both times.\n\nThe chamber first impeached him in 2019 on articles charging him with abuses of power and obstruction of justice. He is accused of offering Ukraine a quid-quo-pro: dig up dirt on Biden in exchange for military aid.\n\nThe second impeachment articles relate to his ongoing efforts to overturn the 2020 election and actions on January 6, 2021 , when a violent mob stormed the Capitol. As lawmakers convened to certify the election results, Trump encouraged his supporters to attend a rally in DC to protest the joint session of Congress. Thousands showed up, including some from white supremacist groups and right-wing militias.\n\nWhen speaking to the crowd, Trump did not explicitly call for violence, but encouraged his followers to \"fight like hell\" - many of those same followers stormed the Capitol moments later, overwhelming police and forcing lawmakers to flee. Five people died during or shortly after the event, including a Capitol police officer.\n\nCongress reconvened to certify the election results in the early hours of January 7 and Biden was inaugurated on January 20, 2021. Meanwhile, Trump continues to deny that he lost the election in 2020 , refusing to admit defeat.\n\nAfter he left office, an avalanche of lawsuits against Trump piled up, many of which are stalled or are no longer being pursued after the election.\n\nThe former president has been charged in four criminal cases: a federal election interference case, a classified documents case, a Georgia election interference case, and a hush-money case. Trump had used money from two of his PACs to pay his legal fees.\n\nIn the federal election interference case , special prosecutor Jack Smith accused Trump of engaging in a broad effort to undermine Biden's 2020 win. Smith argued that Trump amplified false claims about voter fraud , pressured elected officials, and organized fake electors. He dropped the case after the 2024 election, but filed a report shortly before the inauguration saying that Trump would have been convicted if he hadn't won another term.\n\nSmith also led the charge on a federal case accusing Trump of storing sensitive national security documents at Mar-a-Lago after removing them from the White House, and impeding the government from retrieving the documents. A Trump-appointed judge in Florida dismissed the case over highly controversial allegations that Smith's special counsel appointment was unconstitutional , a finding Smith's office appealed. The case was also ultimately dismissed after the election.\n\nOn May 30, 2024, Trump was convicted of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to hush-money payments made to Stormy Daniels , a porn star who alleges she had an affair with Trump. With the guilty verdict, Trump became the first former president to be convicted of a crime.\n\nOn January 10, 2025, the judge in that case sentenced Trump , cementing his felon status. The president did not receive any punishment, but the decision set off a new slate of legal questions, as Trump has pledged to appeal his criminal conviction.\n\nGeorgia's election interference case focused specifically on Trump's alleged attempts to overturn Biden's win in the state. District Attorney Fani Willis charged Trump and allies in August of 2023, though the case shrunk in scope and a judge dismissed several counts against Trump . The case was mired in scandals involving Willis' personal life , and her team was eventually disqualified. Willis is appealing the decision, which could take months. If Willis wins the appeal, she'll have to wait until Trump finishes his second term to re-start the case.\n\nIn addition to the criminal trials, a jury found Trump guilty of sexual abuse in a civil case brought by E. Jean Carroll . The saga, which has extended over two suits, related to Carroll's allegation that Trump raped her in a Manhattan department store and subsequently made defamatory statements. Together, they resulted in a verdict granting Carroll damages of $88.3 million. Trump appealed the cases but a jury upheld one of the verdicts in December, 2025 . A spokesperson for Trump told BI he plans to keep appealing the verdict, which could keep the $5 million that Trump owes Carroll through that case frozen.\n\nAn ubiquitous presence in American life since the 1980s, Trump floated running for president since his early days as a businessman. People generally didn't take him seriously, and his political affiliations flip-flopped - he went from being a registered Democrat, to a registered Republican, to the front man for a remade American conservatism.\n\nIn 2012, Trump gained prominence in Republican circles for popularizing the \"birther\" theory - the racist and false claim that former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. And in the summer of 2015, the prospect of a Trump presidential bid became much more real when he announced his candidacy at a campaign rally in New York City.\n\nThroughout the 2016 campaign, Trump positioned himself as a political outsider and built his platform around economic prosperity, immigration, and a newly combative rhetoric. His campaign was mired in controversy - from the Access Hollywood tape where he bragged about groping women to his failure to quickly denounce the KKK - but he appealed to a wide swath of Americans.\n\nDespite doing poorly in the early Iowa caucus, Trump triumphed in a series of primary wins and had a strong performance on Super Tuesday. After becoming the Republican nominee, Trump trailed Hillary Clinton in the polls but ended up victorious on November 8, 2016. He lost the popular vote by more than 2.8 million but won 304 electoral votes to Clinton's 227.\n\nOnce in the White House, Trump was quick to issue a slate of executive orders based on his campaign promises, including building a wall on the southern border and implementing his proposed \"Muslim ban,\" which quickly faced legal challenges.\n\nWhile running for office, Trump promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but doing so proved difficult and contentious, so he instead chipped away at the law. He also repealed many Obama-era environmental policies and withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement because he said it damaged the economy.\n\nTrump took an isolationist approach to foreign policy, imposing tariffs and withdrawing from revising long-standing trade agreements. On the economy, Trump pushed a $1.5 trillion tax cut package through Congress. Regarding the Supreme Court, he appointed three conservative judges and took credit for overturning Roe v. Wade .\n\nBy his final years in office, Trump was both president and candidate - he launched his reelection bid in June 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic upended both the election and spelled the end of Trump's presidency. President Joe Biden had accused him throughout the election of ignoring the crisis. Trump came down with COVID-19 himself during the final weeks of the campaign and received treatment at Walter Reed Medical Center.\n\nWhen election day finally rolled around, Trump eventually lost both the popular and Electoral College votes. The race was extremely close in key states and took days to call. Trump declared victory one day after the election, before all the votes were tallied, and thus inaugurated his months-long campaign contesting the election results.\n\nAfter leaving office in January 2021, Trump and Melania moved to Mar-a-Lago, where he has lived since leaving the White House.\n\nDonald Trump has a marital history marked by various divorces and alleged affairs.\n\nHe met his first wife, Czech model Ivana Marie Zelníčková, in 1976 when she was in New York City for a fashion show. The two got married in 1977 and remained a fixture of the city's tabloid scene. They had three children together: Ivanka , Donald Jr., and Eric.\n\nRumors about Trump having affairs swirled throughout the marriage, including with American actor Marla Maples. Ivana and Trump divorced in 1992.\n\nOne year later, Maples had Trump's fourth child, Tiffany. The couple got married two months later but split up in 1999.\n\nTrump's current wife, Melania Trump (née Knauss), is a Slovenian-American former model whom he met in 1998 at a mutual friend's party. The two dated on and off before tying the knot in 2004 at Mar-a-Lago. The star-studded guest list included the Clintons and Billy Joel.\n\nTrump's fifth child, Barron Trump , was born in 2006. When Trump moved into the White House, Melania and Barron waited months before joining him at the residence.\n\nIn addition to his five children, Trump has 10 grandkids . The oldest, Kai, has already stepped onto the political scene and even spoke at the 2024 Republican National Convention.\n\nDonald John Trump was born on June 14, 1946, in the Queens borough of New York City . At 78 years old, he was the oldest person to run for president . Compared to other former presidents, Trump has released relatively little information on his physical health.\n\nIn November 2023, his personal physician said measures of his physical health were within the normal range but did not provide details about his medication, blood pressure, or cholesterol. Standing at a reported height of 6 feet 3 inches, some have expressed concern about Trump's weight in the past.\n\nHis parents, real estate developer Fred Trump and Mary MacLeod, met at a party and got married in 1936. They had five children, with Donald Trump being their fourth. He attended a Presbyterian church as a child but doesn't appear to regularly attend church services.\n\nFred Trump made much of his fortune in New York City real estate and was the subject of a US Senate investigation related to taking advantage of a federal loan program.\n\nAs a teenager, Donald Trump attended New York Military Academy, a private military school. After graduating, he attended Fordham University in the Bronx for two years before eventually switching to the Wharton School of Finance and Economics at the University of Pennsylvania. Trump graduated from Wharton with a bachelor's degree in economics and talks about his time at the prestigious institution often.\n\nAfter graduating from college, Trump began working for his father and eventually became the president of a collection of family-owned companies that he later turned into the Trump Organization . Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Trump expanded his father's business and invested in Manhattan hotels. He was buoyed along by financial and social help from his father, whose New York connections ran deep.\n\nIn 1983, Trump opened Trump Tower on 56th Street and 5th Avenue, where he later had an apartment. That same decade, Trump started investing in casinos and bought Mar-a-Lago , his resort in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nThe 1990s recession harmed Trump's businesses and he was forced to sell various assets, as well as commit to a personal budget. His luck largely changed by the end of the 1990s, though his casinos continued to struggle.\n\nTrump profited from his name throughout his long business career, selling everything from branded cologne and steaks to putting his name on an online education company. In 2018, The New York Times published a lengthy investigation detailing how Fred Trump funneled money to his son. The outlet reported Donald Trump received the equivalent of $413 million from his dad by the early 2000s. (Trump declined the Times's request for comment on the article at the time; a Trump spokesman at the time said there had been no fraud or tax evasion.)\n\nIn 1996, Trump teamed up with NBC to buy the Miss Universe Organization, which encompasses the Miss Universe, Miss USA , and Miss Teen USA beauty pageants. Trump then starred in a reality television show of his own - \" The Apprentice .\" The Emmy-nominated program made him nearly $200 million over 16 years and boosted his image as a self-made billionaire.\n\nTrump's net worth was $3.8 billion as of September 2024, according to Forbes's calculations.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Trump's new tariffs are poised to hit an already-battered economy\n\nCompanies have warned of rising prices . Markets have plunged. Bad vibes are back. President Donald Trump's tariff plans might not be in full force yet - but Americans are feeling the strain.\n\nTrump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" is here. It's the name he gave April 2, when he's expected to unveil a range of broad tariffs on key trading partners. Leading up to the announcements, the University of Michigan's consumer survey in late March found that Americans' outlook on the economy took a dive - consumer sentiment was down 11.9% from February and 28.2% from one year ago.\n\nInflation fears largely drove the downturn, and consumers are worried about \"the potential for pain amid ongoing economic policy developments,\" the survey said. One of those developments is Trump's tariff plans; Trump has maintained that his trade policies would bring in revenue and restore jobs but acknowledged in February that Americans would feel \"some pain\" as a result.\n\nThat pain has already started taking shape. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said during a March press conference that American consumers' gloomy outlook - particularly around high grocery prices - \"probably has to do with turmoil at the beginning of an administration that's making big changes in policy.\"\n\nPowell also said that \"a good part\" of the Federal Open Market Committee's latest inflation projections, which showed higher inflation than its December forecast, was a response to Trump's shifting tariff announcements.\n\n\"I do think with the arrival of the tariff inflation, further progress may be delayed,\" Powell said.\n\nTrade policy experts have said companies might absorb some of the cost of Trump's planned tariffs, but Americans are likely to see higher prices on goods like groceries and cars. While Trump has also said that his plans would promote production in the US, the uncertainty is leaving markets, businesses, and Americans on edge.\n\nAlex Jacquez, an advisor on the National Economic Council under former President Joe Biden, told reporters on a Tuesday press call that uncertainty around Trump's trade policy makes it \"hard for the American people to see that they are going to have a strategy long term for how they should be spending their money and investing.\"\n\n\"When the president doesn't have a clear strategy or direction, it is extremely difficult for businesses in particular and consumers as well, to plan for the future, and that's why you're seeing so much uncertainty in the consumer market right now and so much uncertainty in the business community,\" Jacquez said.\n\nKush Desai, a White House spokesperson, told Business Insider that \"fearmongering by the media and Democrats about President Trump's America First economic agenda isn't going to change the fact that industry leaders have already made trillions in investment commitments to make in America.\"\n\n\"President Trump used tariffs to deliver historic job, wage, and economic growth with no inflation in his first term, and he's set to restore American Greatness in his second term,\" Desai said.\n\nJoseph Dennis, 73, voted for Trump but previously told BI he was concerned about the administration's decisions on tariffs and federal job cuts and wished they were less extreme. He's one of many retirees watching their investments fluctuate in value under Trump.\n\n\"I hope he knows what he's doing, but I'm not so sure,\" Dennis said.\n\nStock markets worldwide have swung wildly in anticipation of Trump's Liberation Day. Major US stock indexes dropped sharply to start the week before staging a rebound and ended Tuesday's session mostly higher as investors braced for the tariff announcement.\n\nIt's not just Liberation Day - markets have been fluctuating for weeks in response to Trump's shifting tariff announcements. Additionally, some companies have been preparing to raise prices in anticipation of Trump's tariff plans. Target CEO Brian Cornell told CNBC in early March that Trump's tariff policy could lead the company to raise prices on produce.\n\nTrump has previously said a range of tariffs would go into effect on April 2, including levies on goods from Canada and Mexico, automobiles, and reciprocal tariffs on the countries that have imposed tariffs on US goods. However, the president told reporters on March 23 that he \"may give a lot of countries a break.\"\n\n\"I don't change. But the word flexibility is an important word,\" Trump said.\n\nThat \"flexibility\" is making it difficult for businesses and consumers to prepare for the future, Heather Boushey, an economist who served on former President Joe Biden's Council of Economic Advisors, told reporters.\n\n\"Both businesses and consumers are getting shaken by this approach,\" Boushey said. \"They see it as chaotic. They don't see what the plan is, but there's a concept of a plan, and that expectations are falling and falling rapidly.\"\n\nHave a tip or story to share?

      "text": "Why Canada and Mexico are missing from Trump's tariff chart\n\nPresident Donald Trump's latest round of tariffs had two surprising omissions: Mexico and Canada.\n\nMany countries, including China, were slapped with large reciprocal tariffs on Wednesday. After Trump's announcement, CNBC reported that Chinese goods could receive a 54% tariff when combining the new tariffs (34%) with ones that have been previously announced. European Union goods will be subject to a new 20% tariff.\n\nAccording to the White House, this doesn't mean the US's neighbors are off scot-free. Preexisting 25% tariffs on most Mexican and Canadian goods will remain.\n\nUnder Trump's previous order, a 25% tariff was applied to all Mexican and Canadian goods that aren't compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\n\nThe White House has said the tariffs are necessary because the two countries aren't doing enough to stop illegal immigration and the smuggling of fentanyl into the United States from the northern and southern borders. Leaders of both countries have disputed this claim.\n\nThe USMCA trade deal, which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement in 2020, maintains NAFTA's zero-tariff treatment for most agricultural products, textiles, apparel, and other goods that meet the trade agreement's rules of origin.\n\nNon-compliant energy and potash from the bordering nations remain subject to a 10% tariff; the latter was viewed as the White House bowing to pressure from the farm industry worried about a key ingredient in fertilizers.\n\nChris Tang, a UCLA professor who's an expert in global supply chain management and the impact of regulatory policies, told Business Insider the Trump administration's choice to leave Canada and Mexico off the tariffs list on Wednesday might be a symbol that the president recognized the neighboring nations' significance to the US economy - but it was also probably a negotiation tactic .\n\n\"So, for example, right now, the products that comply with the USMCA are still tariff-free,\" Tang said. \"But that's temporary. Trump has said, 'Well, that may adjust.' And that gives him still some wiggle room to negotiate.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the White House told BI that if Trump's prior order were terminated, all non-USMCA-compliant goods would be reduced to a 12% tariff.\n\nMargaret Kidd, an instructional associate professor of supply chain and logistics technology at the University of Houston, told BI, \"It's not in our best interest for the United States to alienate our two closest trading partners.\"\n\nShe added that there was about $945 billion in trade between Mexico and the US in 2024, with most of the products exchanged flowing through Texas. The tariffs on the southern country, she said, have an outsize effect on the border states, which rely on the local economy built around international trade.\n\n\"It's all intermingled,\" Kidd said.\n\nTang said he was hopeful that the omission of Canada and Mexico from Wednesday's tariffs could act as a sort of olive branch with the nation's allies to soothe the trade tensions that had increased since Trump took office.\n\n\"Really, our economies are interlinked,\" Tang said. \"So, hopefully, they can really sit down and work it out because these are our allies, our neighbors - this is very important. So I hope there is a possibility that these three countries can work together.\"\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Markets are tumbling, but at least the tariff memes are gold\n\nDonald Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" means that tariffs are suddenly everywhere. That means tariff memes are also everywhere.\n\nThe US president on Wednesday signed an executive order imposing a 10% baseline tariff on all countries, taking effect Saturday, and adding reciprocal tariffs.\n\nGlobal markets plummeted on the news.\n\nBut if there's one thing you can count on amid any turmoil - financial or otherwise - it's that some people will always have a sense of humor about it, even if it's a little dark. So, social media users have been expressing their economic fears and anxieties the modern way: with memes.\n\nHere are some of the best ones:\n\nEnjoy, for example, the picture showing Trump yelling, \"Pay the tariffs!\" at a group of penguins.\n\nTariffs memes are the hottest thing right now, so post your favorites👇🏻 pic.twitter.com/WQphddVZPo\n\nTrump's tariffs include the Australian territory of the Heard Island and McDonald Islands - a pair of sub-Antarctic remote islands uninhabited by humans but home to penguins, sea birds, and seals.\n\nThe meme refers to one that originated in 2017, in which Trump appeared as if he was yelling at an 11-year-old boy who had asked to mow the White House lawn.\n\nAnother meme shows Marvel superhero Wolverine lying in bed, looking longingly at a Studio Ghibli-fied picture of former US Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin and his wife, Louise Linton, holding a sheet of new $1 bills. Mnuchin was Treasury Secretary during Trump's first term in office.\n\nUsers of OpenAI's ChatGPT have recently started a trend of using the AI chatbot to turn regular photos into pictures in the distinctive style of Studio Ghibli , the animation studio behind films like \"Spirited Away\" and \"Howl's Moving Castle.\"\n\nIn the original photo in 2017, Mnuchin was at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in Washington, D.C., to see the first run of $1 bills featuring his signature. At the time, the image of the chicly dressed couple posing with money quickly drew comparisons to James Bond-esque villains, but the new image makes it seem like the person who posted it might have preferred that to today's market chaos.\n\nA different meme shows Patrick Schwarzenegger as Saxon Ratliff in season 3 of \"The White Lotus,\" a zeitgeisty - and heavily memeified - HBO show. He plays a toxic finance bro on a family vacation.\n\n\"Look, the prices of goods going up and my portfolio going down isn't necessarily a bad thing, because I love working and that just means I need to grind even harder now,\" the person captioned the photo.\n\n\"Look, the prices of goods going up and my portfolio going down isn't necessarily a bad thing, because I love working and that just means I need to grind even harder now\" pic.twitter.com/xVxhCfepPd\n\nAnd who could forget the famous \"Arrested Development\" meme of rich matriarch Lucille Bluth estimating a banana costs $10? The joke is supposed to highlight how wealthy and out-of-touch Bluth is, but \"unironically this is what's happening in America right now,\" one person wrote on X .\n\n\"Just got off the phone with my financial advisor, he just told me my 401k is now a 400k,\" a different person tweeted , alongside a photo of late comedian and actor Rodney Dangerfield.\n\nAnd finally, one user tweeted an image of a stock heatmap almost entirely red with a superimposed image of Vice President JD Vance asking, \"Have you said thank you once?\"\n\nHave you? #stockmarketcrash #tariffs pic.twitter.com/dZFInpG5ff\n\nVance was photoshopped to appear to have a larger face, which has been a trending meme in recent weeks. The question is a reference to Trump and Vance's contentious meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February. In that meeting, Vance chastised Zelenskyy for not wearing a suit and asked him, \"Have you said thank you once?\" regarding American aid to the country, which Russia invaded in 2022.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Big Law's biggest players are absent from brief opposing Trump's attacks on law firms\n\nMore than 500 law firms - including some of the country's most prominent - signed onto a legal brief Friday to oppose Donald Trump's executive orders attacking law firms that hired his political enemies.\n\nAbsent from the list, however, were America's 27 highest-grossing law firms.\n\nFrom Kirkland & Ellis, which reported $8.8 billion in revenue last year and has about 3,800 lawyers, to Paul Hastings, with more than $2 billion in revenue, corporate America's legal team was largely silent.\n\nThe 27 firms that didn't sign collectively brought in over $74 billion in revenue last year.\n\nThey are: Kirkland, Latham, DLA Piper Baker McKenzie, Skadden, Sidley, Gibson Dunn, Ropes & Gray, White & Case, Morgan Lewis, Hogan Lovells, Jones Day, Simpson Thacher, Greenberg Traurig, Norton Rose, Goodwin Procter, King & Spalding, Quinn Emanuel, Cooley, Davis Polk, Paul Weiss, McDermott, Mayer Brown, Sullivan & Cromwell, Holland & Knight, Weil, and Paul Hastings.\n\n\"The largest law firms are extraordinarily powerful, and in this instance, that power actually cripples them. I'm disappointed that they didn't join,\" said Nathan Eimer, one of the lawyers who wrote the brief.\n\nThe above 27 firms did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider about why they didn't sign onto the brief.\n\nThe brief was filed in support of Perkins Coie, a law firm whose attorneys Trump effectively deemed a national security threat in an executive order that barred them from federal buildings, stripped them of security clearances, and required government contractors to disclose whether they used the firm.\n\nSeveral former partners at Perkins Coie represented some of Trump's political adversaries, but most of the firm's political lawyers have left.\n\nSome big firms did sign on to the brief, as did some top class-action lawyers and trial lawyers who often represent plaintiffs suing big corporations.\n\nThe US arm of Freshfields, a UK-founded corporate law firm that last year was reported to do about 20% of its business in the United States, signed the brief. Arnold & Porter, a big DC-based firm that represented federal workers accused of being communists during the \"Red Scare\" of the 1950s, also included its name. Arnold & Porter was one of eight firms among the country's 100 highest-earning that signed, according to Law.com .\n\nOther firms targeted by Trump's orders rallied behind Perkins. Covington & Burling, which gave legal advice to a prosecutor who went after Trump, as well as WilmerHale and Jenner & Block, which have sued the Trump administration over executive orders that targeted them, all put their names on the brief.\n\nBut the lack of America's largest firms was frustrating, said Eimer, who told Business Insider he didn't know whose names would be included until shortly before the legal papers were filed because the process was treated with extreme confidentiality.\n\n\"I understand, from the management side, why they feel that jeopardizing their business is their overriding concern. But in my view, at the end of the day, lawyers have an obligation to the courts,\" he said, \"and the constitution that overrides our business interest.\"\n\nLaw firms, including Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom, Milbank, and Willkie Farr & Gallagher, have cut deals with the Trump administration to collectively devote hundreds of millions of dollars worth of lawyers' time to causes that dovetail with the president's interests - like veterans' rights and fighting antisemitism.\n\nBloomberg reported the conservative group The Oversight Project wrote a letter to law firms asking them to donate up to $10 million of legal advice to it and other \"center-right\" groups to help satisfy their commitments.\n\nThe first firm to cut a deal with the Trump administration was Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison, whose chairman, Brad Karp, and senior lawyers are known for being political progressives. Karp defended the agreement with the Trump administration in an email sent to the firm late last month, saying that competing law firms immediately started trying to poach Paul Weiss clients and attorneys.\n\n\"The resolution we reached with the Administration will have no effect on our work and our shared culture and values,\" Karp wrote.\n\nPaul Weiss's name is not on the brief.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "6 charts show the chaos in markets after Trump's sweeping trade war escalation\n\nPresident Donald Trump's trade war has sparked chaos in markets.\n\nThe president plowed ahead with sweeping tariffs, rolling out a fresh slate of new and reciprocal duties on America's top trading partners.\n\nThe latest tariffs include a 10% baseline tariff on all countries, as well as an additional 34% reciprocal tariff on China and an additional 20% tariff on the European Union.\n\nHere are six charts that capture the impact on markets.\n\nThe reaction on Wednesday evening was immediate, and futures were down sharply Thursday morning. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite dropped more than 3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted as much as 1,200 points.\n\nMarkets fear that earnings growth will take a dire hit in the coming months, as multinational companies with large global supply chains struggle. Apple was one of Thursday's biggest losers, down 8% before the opening bell.\n\nSome of the market's biggest names were taking a beating at midday on Thursday. The mega-cap Magnificent Seven stocks were all down sharply. Here are the moves at 12:10 p.m. ET:\n\nThe 10-year US Treasury yield continued to slide, dropping 13 basis points early Thursday to its lowest level since October.\n\nThe reason behind the move is twofold. First, investors are fleeing the chaos for the relative safety of US government bonds. Second, the plunge in yields shows investors see the Fed lowering interest rates to stimulate the economy while tariffs create headwinds to growth.\n\nOil prices also dropped sharply on Thursday. West Texas Intermediate crude fell as much as 7% in the early morning, while Brent crude , the international benchmark, also dropped 6%.\n\nOil markets have been weighed as traders assess the impact of Trump's tariffs. The decline in prices accelerated on Thursday after an announcement that eight OPEC+ countries plan to accelerate their pace of output hikes starting May, adding to supply expectations.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Trump's reciprocal tariffs announcement shakes up global trade\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nFind live coverage of President Donald Trump's tariff policies here.\n\nShannon Pettypiece\n\nTrump's so-called reciprocal tariffs, which are paid by U.S.-based companies importing products into the United States, vary by country, ranging from a minimum of 10% to more than 40%. To determine the amounts of those reciprocal tariffs, the U.S. Trade Representative's Office used a formula to calculate the tariff rate necessary to balance trade deficits between the United States and its trading partners, according to a statement posted on the trade representative's website.\n\nThe formula took into account a variety of factors that can put U.S. products at a disadvantage, like regulatory requirements, environmental reviews, differences in consumption tax rates and currency manipulation, the statement said.\n\n\"If trade deficits are persistent because of tariff and non-tariff policies and fundamentals, then the tariff rate consistent with offsetting these policies and fundamentals is reciprocal and fair,\" it said.\n\nThe calculation assumes that America's trade deficits with its trading partners - which occur when the United States imports more than it exports to those countries - are the result of tariffs and trade barriers that limit U.S. exports to them. The tariffs are intended to reduce imports from that trading pattern to balance out the trade deficit.\n\nShannon Pettypiece\n\nThe sweeping tariffs Trump announced today stretched around the globe, including the remote Heard and McDonald Islands, which are populated by zero humans but lots of seals and penguins.\n\nDespite having no apparent exports or imports, the sub-Antarctic islands, which are an external territory of Australia, will be subject to a 10% tariff, according to a document the White House provided during Trump's tariff announcement today.\n\nOther tiny nations and territories were also hit with 10% tariffs, including Tokelau, a dependent territory of New Zealand, with a population of around 1,600 people, and the Cocos Islands, another territory of Australia, with a population of around 600 people.\n\nKate Santaliz\n\nJulie Tsirkin\n\nNnamdi Egwuonwu\n\nA handful of Republican senators told NBC News tonight that Trump's decision to place tariffs on more than 180 countries and territories could lead to short-term pain for U.S. consumers in the form of higher prices.\n\n\"Sometimes in business you have to have short-term pain to have long-term gain, and we don't think this is even going to be that long of a short term, if it is at all. We trust the president,\" Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., said.\n\nSen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., said Trump acted \"pretty responsibly\" in implementing the tariffs but still acknowledged \"there could be short-term pain\" in response to the import penalties.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to seeing how they work. We already have countries that have approached the president to say: 'We want to work with you. We'll lower our tariffs, if you lower yours,'\" Lummis said.\n\nSen. John Kennedy, R-La, said he's confident Trump will reconsider the tariffs if there's a significant impact on U.S. consumers.\n\n\"If they make things better, they should want more. If it makes things worse, they should want to recalibrate,\" Kennedy said. \"If the tariffs end up hurting America, I think you'll see President Trump recalibrate.\"\n\nSteve Kopack\n\nJP Morgan chief economist Michael Feroli said in a note that Trump's tariffs would bring in considerable revenue but at the expense of higher prices that could hit consumer purchasing power.\n\n\"On a static basis, today's announcement would raise just under $400 billion in revenue, or about 1.3% of GDP, which would be the largest tax increase since the Revenue Act of 1968,\" he wrote. \"We estimate that today's announced measures could boost PCE prices by 1-1.5% this year, and we believe the inflationary effects would mostly be realized in the middle quarters of the year.\"\n\nHe continued: \"The resulting hit to purchasing power could take real disposable personal income growth in 2Q-3Q into negative territory, and with it the risk that real consumer spending could also contract in those quarters. This impact alone could take the economy perilously close to slipping into recession.\"\n\nJason Abbruzzese\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned countries hit by Trump's new tariffs not to retaliate.\n\n\"I wouldn't try to retaliate,\" Bessent said in an interview this evening with Bloomberg Television. \"As long as you don't retaliate, this is the high end of the number.\"\n\nHe repeated the sentiment on Fox News, telling \"Special Report\" host Bret Baier that any retaliation would result in heightened tariffs from the United States.\n\n\"Do not retaliate,\" he said. \"If you retaliate, there will be escalation.\"\n\nChristine Romans\n\nThe CEO of Business Roundtable, a lobbying group made up of chief executives of major U.S. companies, said in a statement that Trump's universal tariffs risk damaging the economy.\n\n\"Business Roundtable supports President Trump's goal of securing better and fairer trade deals with our trading partners, including by lowering tariffs on U.S. exports and expanding market access,\" CEO Joshua Bolten wrote. \"However, universal tariffs ranging from 10-50% run the risk of causing major harm to American manufacturers, workers, families and exporters. Damage to the U.S. economy will increase the longer the tariffs are in place and may be exacerbated by retaliatory measures.\"\n\n\"We urge the Administration and our top trading partners to swiftly reach agreements that level the playing field for American goods and services and remove these tariffs. While negotiations are underway, we strongly encourage the Administration to implement additional reasonable exemptions and put in place a transparent, predictable exclusion process.\"\n\nSteve Kopack\n\nThe major stock indexes in Asia dropped sharply just minutes into their trading days.\n\nJapan's Nikkei 225 index plunged more than 4.1%, and South Korea's Kospi stock average fell more than 2.5%. Australia's ASX 200 dipped about 2%.\n\nETFs (exchange-traded funds) that track specific countries, such as India, tumbled about 3%, while one that tracks Europe slid 2%, and the China ETF fell 3.8%.\n\nJason Abbruzzese\n\nRob Wile\n\nMike Pence, Trump's former vice president, came out forcefully against Trump's new tariffs, saying on X that they constituted a major tax hike.\n\n\"These Tariffs are nearly 10x the size of those imposed during the Trump-Pence Administration and will cost American families over $3,500 per year,\" Pence wrote, pointing to an analysis from Advancing American Freedom, a nonprofit group he founded to advocate for conservative policies and values.\n\nFrank Thorp V producer and off-air reporter\n\nScott Wong\n\nSahil Kapur\n\nA pivotal group of Senate Republicans delivered a rebuke to Trump's tariffs on Canadian products as he escalated his broader trade war today.\n\nThe Senate voted 51-48 to pass a Democratic resolution to block Trump's Canadian tariffs from taking effect. Four Republicans - Susan Collins of Maine; Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky; and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska - joined all 47 Democrats in supporting the measure.\n\nThe resolution, authored by Tim Kaine, D-Va., is not expected to go anywhere in the House. But it was notable several Republicans broke with Trump the day he announced a new set of sweeping tariffs , which the White House billed as \"Liberation Day.\"\n\n\"If these tariffs go into effect, it will be so harmful,\" Collins said in a speech on the Senate floor before the vote. \"And as price hikes always do, they will hurt those the most who can afford them the least.\"\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nChristine Romans\n\nBrian Cheung\n\nPresident Donald Trump has favored tariffs for years. His expanding trade war is sure to ripple through the global economy for a long while, too.\n\nThat's because ramping up tariffs on foreign governments frequently draws retaliation - a likelihood that even industries Trump aims to support are already bracing for. While he has been rolling out an ever-shifting series of import taxes for months, the sweeping \"reciprocal\" tariffs he announced Wednesday are opening salvos in what could become drawn-out tit-for-tats with potentially dozens of governments.\n\nUnlike the narrower, targeted tariffs Trump imposed on certain countries and products in his first term, his latest duties are set to rewrite the rules of global trade on a far broader level - and in an environment in which inflation is running hotter .\n\n\"This is a game changer, not only for the U.S. economy but for the global economy,\" Olu Sonola, head of U.S. economic research at Fitch Ratings, said in a note Wednesday evening.\n\n\"Many countries will likely end up in a recession. You can throw most forecasts out the door, if this tariff rate stays on for an extended period of time,\" she said, adding that the levels Trump is introducing haven't been seen since 1910.\n\nAlready, the administration is signaling it's uninterested in diplomacy, raising the odds that foreign leaders will hit back with more levies of their own rather than press for talks.\n\n\"This is not a negotiation,\" a senior White House official told reporters Wednesday evening. \"It's a national emergency.\"\n\nThe European Union has threatened countermeasures by mid-April, and Canada warned last week that it was preparing retaliatory moves to respond swiftly to any trade actions the United States were to unveil Wednesday.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nBrian Cheung\n\nOlu Sonola, head of U.S. economic research at Fitch Ratings, wrote in a note that Trump's tariffs threaten to push much of the world into an economic recession.\n\n\"The U.S. tariff rate on all imports is now around 22% from 2.5% in 2024. That rate was last seen around 1910,\" Sonola wrote. \"This is a game changer, not only for the US economy but for the global economy. Many countries will likely end up in a recession. You can throw most forecasts out the door, if this tariff rate stays on for an extended period of time.\"\n\nJ.J. McCorvey\n\nLori Wallach, director of Rethink Trade, an advocacy group within the American Economic Liberties Project, a think tank, said in a statement following Trump's tariffs rollout that he \"must take immediate action to stop corporations from using the pretext of these tariffs to price-gouge the very Americans already slammed by decades of bad trade policy and corporate greed.\"\n\nWhile tariffs on certain countries could \"help restore America's capacity to produce more of the critical products needed for American families to be healthy and safe,\" she said, they should be accompanied by \"tax credits to build demand for U.S.-made goods, incentives for investment in new production capacity and bans on stock buybacks, and easier union formation so gains go to wages, not just profits.\"\n\nJason Abbruzzese\n\nIn a somewhat cryptic post on X, Poland Prime Minister Donald Tusk wrote: \"Friendship means partnership. Partnership means really and truly reciprocal tariffs. Adequate decisions are needed.\" He added the E.U. and U.S. flag emojis.\n\nTrump's reciprocal tariff on the E.U. is set to be 20%.\n\nReuters\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, seen as close to Trump, said today that tariffs introduced by his administration were \"wrong\" and would not benefit the United States.\n\n\"We will do everything we can to work towards an agreement with the United States, with the goal of avoiding a trade war that would inevitably weaken the West in favor of other global players,\" she said in a statement on Facebook .\n\n\"In any case, as always, we will act in the interest of Italy and its economy, also engaging with other European partners,\" she added.\n\nRob Wile\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed to Bloomberg News that goods brought in from China would now face an effective tariff rate of 54% - the sum of its newly imposed 34% rate plus the 20% rate Trump had already instituted in his new administration.\n\nSteve Kopack\n\nAsked whether he was concerned by the market moves, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg Television that he has \"learned not to look at what goes on during after-hours markets.\"\n\nBessent added that the Nasdaq has a \"'mag7' problem, not a MAGA problem,\" referring to seven large tech stocks often called the \"magnificent 7.\"\n\n\"I would advise none of the countries to panic,\" he added.\n\nGlobal markets reacted sharply and swiftly after Trump revealed his much-anticipated tariff plans today, with investors fleeing U.S. stock indexes and stocks of companies that rely on global supply chains plummeting.\n\nThe ETF (exchange-traded fund) that tracks the S&P 500 plunged more than 2.7%. The fund that tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 slid more than 3.5%, and fund tracking the Dow indicates it would drop more than 415 points at tomorrow's opening bell.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nRob Wile\n\nA group Bloomberg News has described as having \"links to steel\" has hailed Trump's tariffs announcement.\n\n\"Today's trade action prioritizes domestic manufacturers and America's workers,\" Alliance for American Manufacturing President Scott Paul said in a statement. \"These hardworking men and women have seen unfair trade cut the ground from beneath their feet for decades. They deserve a fighting chance. Our workers can out-compete anyone in the world, but they need a level playing field to do it. This trade reset is a necessary step in the right direction.\"\n\nJason Abbruzzese\n\nTo put today's announcement in perspective, Douglas Irwin, a Dartmouth professor who is a leading expert on the history of economic policy, said on X that Trump's tarrifs are \"bigger than Smoot-Hawley.\"\n\nA Senate webpage describes the Smoot-Hawley tariffs, put in place in the 1930s, as \"among the most catastrophic acts in congressional history.\"\n\nShannon Pettypiece\n\nThe tariffs Trump announced today will range from 10% to 49% country by country, according to a handout provided to reporters listing tariffs on 25 countries.\n\nTrump said the level of tariffs the United States will charge on imports from those countries was determined by calculating the level of tariffs and trade barriers those countries have in place on U.S.-made products, though it remains unclear how the White House arrived at those numbers.\n\nCambodia had the highest tariff rate of 49%, followed by a 46% tariff on goods coming to the United States from Vietnam. The European Union faces a 20% tariff, and China would have an additional tariff of 34%.\n\nRob Wile\n\nNational Foreign Trade Council President Jake Colvin said in a statement after Trump's announcement that consumers \"should expect to see higher prices for everything from groceries to home renovations to auto insurance as construction and repair costs rise.\"\n\n\"While the price of imported goods will undoubtedly rise, the president's tariffs will also tack on added costs to American manufacturing, assembly and farming,\" he said. \"There is simply no way to mitigate all of the added costs of inputs to finished goods from the administration's complex and growing web of tariffs.\"\n\nJ.J. McCorvey\n\nEconomic experts are already bemoaning the vague and widespread nature of Trump's new tariff policy, especially concerning the still-thawing U.S. housing market .\n\n\"If these tariffs were more targeted and on specific goods, I wouldn't be so sure we would have stagflation,\" Redfin chief economist Daryl Fairweather said in a post on X. \"But these appear to be extremely broad, so I expect higher inflation and lower or even negative economic growth.\"\n\n\"Home construction was already going to be weak this year,\" she continued. \"But these tariffs (combined with labor problems from immigration policy) will mean fewer homes built.\"\n\nJustin Wolfers, an economics professor at the University of Michigan who has been a critic of Trump's tariffs plans, posted on X that the duties would equate to \"a flat tax.\"\n\n\"A huge hit to the budgets of working- and middle-class Americans,\" he wrote .\n\nBrian Cheung\n\nReporting from New York\n\nTrump is basing the reciprocal tariff rates on how much other countries tax U.S. exports, \"including currency manipulation and trade barriers.\"\n\nIn its last report published November 2024, the U.S Treasury did not designate any countries as currency manipulators, let alone those published on the list shown by Trump in the Rose Garden. Even during Trump's first administration, China was designated as a currency manipulator before being de-designated as one due to \"enforceable commitments to refrain from competitive devaluation.\"\n\nIt's unclear how the White House translated \"currency manipulation and trade barriers\" into tariff rates, but the White House told reporters those numbers were calculated by the Council of Economic Advisors, headed by Stephen Miran.\n\nSteve Kopack\n\nMarkets plunged in after-hours trading, as Trump held a poster up listing various tariff levels for U.S. trading partners.\n\nThe ETF (exchange-traded fund) that tracks the broad-based S&P 500 dropped more than 2.3% and the ETF tracking the Nasdaq 100 plunged more than 3.1% in volatile trading. The Dow ETF also slid more than 420 points.\n\nRob Wile\n\nThat will apply to countries that the administration has said has lower monetary and \"nonmonetary\" barriers than most of America's largest trading partners.\n\nRob Wile\n\nBut by including \"nonmonetary\" tariffs, Trump is charging new tariff rates of as much as 49% on other nations. That rate is being charged to Cambodia.\n\nFor China - 34%.\n\nFor India - 26%.\n\nFor the European Union - 20%\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether those tariffs would be applied on all products or targeted at products on which those countries levy tariffs against the U.S.\n\nRob Wile\n\nThe president is going on an extended monologue touching on grievances, history and frustration, but has yet to divulge much about the new tariffs.\n\nRob Wile\n\nTrump had foreshadowed those duties last week . Tariffs on foreign-made auto parts are also expected.\n\nRob Wile\n\nTrump said tit-for-tat tariffs would be coming to counter not just other countries' tariffs but \"nonmonetary\" barriers like currency manipulation and \"pollution havens.\"\n\nRob Wile\n\nTrump's speech is under way and he's started off with some of his most assertive rhetoric.\n\nTrump said it will be the day American industry \"will be reborn,\" touting a new \"golden age of America.\"\n\nJason Abbruzzese\n\nWe're just a few minutes away from Trump's Rose Garden announcement, which was scheduled to start at 4 p.m. ET.\n\nCristian Santana\n\nAs the White House prepares to impose a tariff on all automobile imports, manufacturers are going on a messaging offensive to consumers.\n\nAutomotive News reports that German conglomerate Volkswagen of America is halting vehicle shipments from Mexico, which typically come by rail. In addition the German automaker plans to notify customers of the upcoming tariffs by placing an \"import fee,\" notice on its vehicles.\n\nChristine Romans\n\nReporting from New York\n\nWe're probably closer to the beginning of this trade war than we are to the end of it, whether President Trump takes a more nuanced approach to his tariffs or makes a big, simple move.\n\nThat's because of the resulting negotiation and retaliation, with other countries firing back. An all-out trade war between America and its allies could mean recessions for everybody. After a while, it could become a loop of retaliation, and it could just go on from there.\n\nThat would hurt U.S. producers and consumers, as well.\n\nAlexandra Byrne\n\nMost people might know the notorious Hawley-Smoot tariff best from a scene in \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off,\" where a teacher attempts to explain the 1930 bill to a classroom of bored high school students.\n\n\"Did it work? Anyone?... Anyone know the effects?\" the teacher asked. \"It did not work, and the United States sank deeper into the Great Depression.\"\n\nThe Senate's webpage about the famous tariff references the scene to explain how the bill was \"among the most catastrophic acts in congressional history.\"\n\nEconomists say that history is pretty correct. In an attempt to collect more revenue for the government, the government started a trade war, said Maurice Obstfeld, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\n\"At the time, it was a huge shock to the system and led to a very destructive trade war between the U.S. and its trading partners, which helped deepen the Great Depression,\" Obstfeld told NBC News in October. Since then, the U.S. has mostly promoted cooperative trade relations and largely strayed from tariffs and isolationist policy. That is, until Donald Trump's first term in 2018, when he implemented tariffs on China and steel and aluminum.\n\nAlexandra Byrne\n\nTrump is scheduled to announce reciprocal tariffs at 4 p.m. ET today in the Rose Garden. That also happens to be when major stock markets close in the U.S.\n\nSome economists surmise that might be because the administration fears investors' negative reactions to tariff news.\n\n\"Tariffs are the centerpiece of the Trump administration's economic program and they are so nervous about its market impact, they have to announce it after the markets have closed,\" Lawrence Summers, an economist at Harvard University who has served as Treasury secretary and director of the National Economic Council, told Bloomberg TV . \"It seems a bizarre strategy.\"\n\nTariff uncertainty has rocked investor confidence. Markets took a dive in the first quarter of 2025, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq facing their worst three-month losses since 2022. On Sunday, Goldman Sachs raised its recession and inflation forecast and lowered its GDP outlook.\n\n\"We continue to believe the risk from April 2 tariffs is greater than many market participants have previously assumed,\" the firm said.\n\nRob Wile\n\nDemocrats are lining up to oppose Trump's tariffs.\n\nIn an afternoon press conference, Sens. Chuck Schumer (N.Y.), Tim Kaine (Va.), Pete Welch (Vt.) and Angela Alsobrooks (Md.) argued the tariffs would harm American families and businesses.\n\nTrump, Schumer said, wants to spark \"an absurd, crazy, chaotic trade war\" to raise revenues that would subsequently offset tax cuts Schumer said would primarily benefit billionaires.\n\n\"What kind of bubble is this man and his billionaire cohorts in?\" Schumer said.\n\nKaine has introduced a bill to oppose across-the-board tariffs on Canada - and has received support for it from some moderate Republicans. However, it is unlikely to come up in the House, which has moved to block the ability of Congress to force a floor vote on the national emergency Trump has invoked to impose the Canadian duties .\n\nOther Democrats weighed in today. Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., called the tariffs \"madness\" in a post on X .\n\n\"In Congress, and as Mayor of Long Beach, I've seen firsthand how his senseless and unstable tariffs throw our trade and shipping infrastructures, like the Port of Long Beach, into chaos,\" he wrote.\n\nSamantha Subin, CNBC\n\nUncertainty surrounding Trump's tariff policy has created panic for smaller businesses grappling with the likelihood of added operational costs and potential supply chain bottlenecks.\n\n\"I'm going to run out of appliances,\" said Robin Liss, founder of kitchen gadget company Suvie, ahead of her two-week trip to Taiwan and Vietnam to work out a new business plan. \"I've got to figure this out.\"\n\nTrump slapped additional tariffs on China and is threatening to strain America's relationships with other longtime trading partners.\n\nRead the full CNBC story here.\n\nReuters\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump's 25% automobile tariffs are due to take effect at 12:01 a.m. ET on Thursday, according to a post in the Federal Register.\n\nTrump's 25% tariffs on auto parts are due to take effect no later than May 3, according to the Federal Register.\n\nRob Wile\n\nAhead of Trump's tariffs announcement, Wall Street traders are reducing the odds that the Federal Reserve will cut rates in June - a sign they believe price growth could accelerate.\n\nThe probability that the Fed will hold its key federal funds rate at its current target range of 4.25% to 4.5% through its June meeting has now climbed to 35%, up from 24% just yesterday and 19% a month ago.\n\nIn other words, the traders now believe the Fed is more likely to keep lending activity at bay for longer, in order to contain inflation, by keeping borrowing rates higher.\n\nHowever, is not clear whether the inflation concerns are in response to the tariffs themselves, which by definition will cause prices for goods to increase; or because the traders now believe the impact from the tariffs will not be as severe as feared, something that would cause economic activity to pick up and also put upward pressure prices.\n\nAlexandra Byrne\n\nVoters in Waunakee, Wisconsin, had tariffs top-of-mind on Tuesday as they lined up for the state's Supreme Court election .\n\nThe race drew national attention as an early test of Donald Trump's policy, which has prominently featured tariffs. Susan Crawford, who was backed by Democrats in the technically nonpartisan election, won with 55% of the vote.\n\nWaunakee residents were conflicted about what tariffs would mean for American-made goods, but many admitted it could hit their wallets. Economists say that's a justified concern, since tariff costs are generally passed along to consumers. Voter Lynn Cook said she just bought a new car for her family because she worried tariffs would make it more expensive.\n\n\"We were thinking of all the tariffs and everything, and how everything was going to go up,\" she said.\n\nEric Bundy, who voted for Brad Schimel, the more conservative candidate, grew up in Pennsylvania and attributes factory closures there to free trade agreements. He's willing to take a bit of a financial hit in the short term if it means bringing jobs back.\n\n\"I'm optimistic and I'm hopeful, he said, adding: \"Yes, I will accept some, but obviously we all have our limits when it comes to our pocketbook.\"\n\nOthers weren't so sure the trade-off was worth it.\n\n\"I don't know if the good is outweighing the harm that is being done,\" said voter Andrew Dodge, who works in education. \"I think we're isolating ourselves as a country and not in a good way.\"\n\nRebecca Shabad\n\nChristina Wilkie, CNBC\n\nThe Trump administration is imposing 25% tariffs on beer and empty aluminum cans, according to a notice published today by the Commerce Department.\n\nThe notice said that the U.S. would begin collecting duties on the tariffs starting at 12:01 a.m. on Friday.\n\nThe move is part of a modification made to previously imposed tariffs by the Trump administration on aluminum imports.\n\nRob Wile\n\nMajor stock indexes recovered Wednesday afternoon from earlier flat trading as investors awaited the final form of Trump's tariffs announcement this afternoon.\n\nThe S&P 500 was up about 1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq was 1.3% higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.8%.\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nThe trade war that U.S. President Donald Trump has escalated in his second term is a challenge for all Asian economies, large and small, in an era when the most populous region of the world is expected to drive global economic growth.\n\nExport manufacturing and free trade helped transform China and other Asian countries into economic powerhouses over the past decades. Trump's barrages of tariffs , aimed at compelling companies to keep or set up their factories in the United States, are rupturing trade agreements often made at great political cost to trading partners.\n\nDespite some decrease in trade since Trump launched a trade war with China during his first term in office, the U.S. trade deficit has continued to climb, hitting $295.4 billion last year.\n\nChina, the world's No. 2 economy, has leaned heavily on exports to make up for weak demand at home. The ruling Communist Party has made exports of autos , especially electric vehicles, and batteries a priority, but 27.5% tariffs on auto exports and 102.5% duties on EVs have in effect closed the U.S. market for its automakers. China is the second-largest supplier of auto parts to the U.S. behind Mexico.\n\nDuring Trump's first term, higher tariffs led leader Xi Jinping to champion a shift to high-tech production. That will likely continue as U.S. pressure intensifies, causing job losses due to changes in manufacturing rather than direct damage from the tariffs themselves, Raymond Yeung of ANZ Research said in a report.\n\nAs Trump has rolled out rounds of tariff hikes that have piled on an extra 20%, China has raised its own import duties, targeting U.S. farm goods. It also expanded export controls, especially on strategically important minerals used in high-tech electronics.\n\nU.S. exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to China have fallen since the beginning of the year, and are expected to fall further after Beijing imposed a 15% tariff on U.S. LNG imports.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nBrian Cheung\n\nKayla Steinberg\n\nSome consumers are racing to dealerships in search of a fresh set of wheels to avoid expected price hikes from the Trump administration's auto tariffs .\n\nSeveral major automakers reported double-digit U.S. sales growth in the first quarter, but industry analysts say the momentum is likely to hit the brakes soon.\n\n\"Concern among consumers regarding the future of tariffs and the economy - a new economic uncertainty - is holding back the market,\" Cox Automotive analysts wrote last week .\n\nAt a Honda dealership in Hempstead, N.Y., on Tuesday, shoppers said they were motivated to buy vehicles now to avoid paying more later.\n\n\"Before the storm actually drops, I want to get in and just get out,\" said Floyd Wallace, who purchased a used 2019 Honda Pilot.\n\nDealership manager Ravel Mejia said uncertainty is running high, and he's short on solid advice to offer customers who turn up asking about tariffs. But he expects he'll have to pay more for his next shipment of vehicles after selling through his existing inventory over the coming month.\n\n\"It's a little bit unsettling to come in tomorrow and not know what's going to happen,\" Mejia said.\n\nRead more here.\n\nAnnika Kim Constantino, CNBC\n\nTrump has said tariffs on pharmaceutical products imported into the U.S. were coming soon, but it is not clear if they will be announced at the White House event.\n\nThose potential tariffs would likely drive up U.S. drug prices for patients because even if companies moved to produce those medications domestically, it would take years and cost more than producing medicines abroad, Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said in a note last week.\n\nPredicting the potential impact of tariffs on pharmaceutical companies is difficult since they have vast and complex manufacturing networks with multiple steps, sometimes in different geographies, TD Cowen analyst Steve Scala said in a note.\n\nBut Scala said Eli Lilly , Bristol Myers Squibb and AbbVie appear better positioned than others to weather tariffs because they have more major manufacturing plants in the U.S. than internationally.\n\nThe majority of their sites responsible for producing the active ingredients in drugs are also in the U.S., he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Novartis and Roche \"look more at risk\" because they have few U.S. plants and a higher share of active ingredient sites that are international, Scala said.\n\nRead more from CNBC here.\n\nCNBC Staff\n\nSome tequila makers have been warning about how tariffs could hit their businesses , but Colorado-based Suerte Tequila said it won't raise prices to offset tariffs.\n\n\"Tequila margins are stronger than ever,\" said Laurence Spiewak, Suerte Tequila's CEO.\n\nStill, the industry could see a hit with tariffs on Mexico.\n\nIn 2024, the U.S. imported $5.2 billion worth of tequila and $93 million worth of mezcal from Mexico, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S.\n\nRead more from CNBC here.\n\nShannon Pettypiece\n\nRob Wile\n\nTrump administration officials have argued that the higher costs from tariffs are worth it for the increase in manufacturing jobs that would be created over the long-term.\n\n\"I'm less concerned about the short term,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters last month. \"We've got strategic industries that we've got to have. We want to protect the American worker, and a lot of these trade deals haven't been fair.\"\n\nSince Trump took office, several companies have said they will increase their manufacturing in the United States, though some of those plans were already underway before Trump was elected and others will take years to come to fruition.\n\nBut while tariffs could increase U.S. manufacturing for certain products, the jobs that are created could be offset by jobs lost in other areas that faced higher costs from the tariffs - which happened during Trump's first term, according to a study by the Federal Reserve .\n\nBringing manufacturing to the United States can also increase the cost of production, because labor, regulatory and building costs are higher in the United States, which in turn could raise the prices of end products for consumers. If companies do bring production to the United States, the number of jobs could also be limited because manufacturing has become more automated. Auto plants or steel mills that once employed tens of thousands of workers now employ just several thousand.\n\nBuilding manufacturing plants in the United States could get even more expensive as a result of the tariffs, because it would cost more to import the building materials, parts and equipment needed for the plants.\n\nIt could be nearly impossible to make other products, like shoes or T-shirts, in the United States at competitive prices because the United States doesn't have the available labor or supply chains to make them on a large scale.\n\nSahil Kapur\n\nThe Senate is expected to vote today on a resolution of disapproval on Trump's tariffs on Canadian imports, led by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., which could mark a significant rebuke to the president.\n\nThe measure, which would terminate the national emergency Trump used to pursue the tariffs, needs a simple majority of 51 votes to pass. The chamber is split between 53 Republicans and 47 Democrats. If Democrats unify, then they need just four Republicans to pass it.\n\n\"Many of my Republican colleagues in Congress have already expressed concerns about these tariffs, so the Senate's upcoming vote on our legislation provides senators with the perfect opportunity to show Americans that they will stand up for their constituents and reverse the President's disastrous economic policies,\" Kaine said.\n\nAlexandra Byrne\n\nSteel and aluminum industry groups have praised the Trump administration's targeting of cheap imports from China. But they're cautioning against doing the same to those from Canada , which is facing blanket 25% tariffs on all goods except energy products and potash, which the United States is set to tax at 10%.\n\nCanada supplies over half of U.S. aluminum imports and about 20% of the nation's imported steel. Foreign-made aluminum is especially crucial for downstream manufacturing, Charles Johnson, the CEO of the Aluminum Association, recently told NBC News .\n\n\"Without those import inputs, we won't be able to continue to expand,\" he said of the domestic industry.\n\nCurrent U.S. smelting capacity simply doesn't produce enough aluminum to meet the nation's needs, Johnson added. \"We need metal.\"\n\nThe United Steelworkers labor union has also urged \"a measured approach that both strengthens our manufacturing sector and accounts for our relationships with our allies, like Canada, who play by the rules,\" the group said in a Feb. 10 statement .\n\nBill Oplinger, the CEO of Alcoa, which owns two of the four remaining aluminum smelters in the United States, said last month that he's aligned with the administration's desire to boost manufacturing jobs. But \"the best way to do that,\" he said, \"is to be able to bring Canadian metal into the U.S. to support our downstream customer.\"\n\nRob Wile\n\nTrump's tariffs proposals have faced opposition from business groups, criticism from economists and resistance from consumers.\n\nBut they are receiving support from some key U.S. sectors.\n\nAmong the most enthusiastic supporters has been United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain. Though he endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, Fain issued a statement last week praising Trump's plans to impose 25% tariffs on all autos and auto parts entering the U.S.\n\n\"The UAW has been clear: We will work with any politician, regardless of party, who is willing to reverse decades of working-class people going backwards in the most profitable times in our nation's history,\" he said . \"These tariffs are a major step in the right direction for autoworkers and blue-collar communities across the country, and it is now on the automakers, from the Big Three to Volkswagen and beyond, to bring back good union jobs to the U.S.\"\n\nThe head of the steel manufacturers' association has also hailed Trump's plan to impose 25% duties on steel and aluminum imports, writing in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette last month that the levies were \"saving the American steel industry.\"\n\nAnd the Coalition for a Prosperous America, which represents certain domestic producers and workers, has long favored the use of tariffs to bolster U.S. industry.\n\n\"Those who warn of tariff problems exaggerate the price costs and ignore the positive effects that come from expanded domestic manufacturing,\" CPA economist Andrew Eichenberg wrote recently . \"That's unfortunate because the overall goal should be to create good-paying jobs throughout the U.S. economy.\"\n\nHe continued: \"For too long, economists have ignored the real-world benefits of protecting and rebuilding America's industry. Instead, they have exaggerated globalization's ability to keep prices low. They've also disregarded the collateral damage from decades of rising imports - including millions of lost jobs and volatile inflation from overseas supply chain disruptions.\"\n\nChristine Romans\n\nReporting from New York\n\nWith the White House offering only breadcrumbs in the hours leading up to Trump's tariff announcement, uncertainty is weighing on both consumers and businesses .\n\nAt a Subaru dealership in Skokie, Illinois, the pace of sales over the past week has more than doubled as people rush in to buy cars before new tariffs go into effect, according to general manager Jeremy Gleason.\n\nMeanwhile, in Pomona, New York, Stuart Leventhal, owner of the Down to Earth Living furniture store, is already ordering for Christmas but isn't sure what it's going to end up costing.\n\n\"Doesn't that sound stupid?\" Leventhal told NBC News. \"It's an uneasy time because there seems to be no certainty. No certainty with respect to what the costs of goods are, and no certainty as to where the policies are taking us.\"\n\nShannon Pettypiece\n\nRob Wile\n\nTariffs raise the cost of doing business outside the United States. Yet even firms that manufacture in the United States can be affected, since many rely on foreign parts and materials as intermediate goods.\n\nWhether consumers ultimately feel the impact of those higher costs can vary by industry and product.\n\nLots of negotiation occurs among a U.S. importer, an overseas producer and any middlemen before a tariff is collected, said Craig Fuller, CEO of FreightWaves, a supply-chain consultancy.\n\nSome companies, including Target, Best Buy and Hyundai, have said they would pass some of the higher costs of the tariffs along to their customers. Walmart, meanwhile, has sought to pressure its Chinese suppliers to lower their costs in anticipation of the tariffs - and has been met with resistance.\n\nOther companies, especially luxury-goods sellers, charge enormous markups on goods they import into the United States and may ultimately decide they can live with hits to already-high profit margins, Fuller said. Other firms that enjoy large market shares will also decide whether they will absorb higher costs to maintain their dominant positions.\n\nEven for companies that absorb the cost of the tariffs and don't raise prices, there will still be a cost. Those companies will have less money to invest in growing their businesses, which can have a negative impact on the labor market if it leads to laying off workers or not adding jobs.\n\nTrump has downplayed any impact tariffs would have on prices. Asked about foreign automakers' raising the price of their vehicles after he announced a 25% tariff on auto imports, Trump said : \"I couldn't care less. I hope they raise their prices, because if they do, people are going to buy American-made cars. We have plenty.\"\n\nRob Wile\n\nAfter an initial burst higher in the wake of Trump's election in November, stocks have shifted acutely downward as investors began to digest that Trump was planning to make good on significantly increasing trade duties.\n\nIt represents a stark contrast to the gains usually enjoyed by presidents shortly after taking office - including the ones Trump himself saw during his first term.\n\nThis time around, Trump has indicated he is less concerned about short-term market moves .\n\n\"If you look at China, they have a 100-year perspective,\" Trump told Fox News last month. \"We have a quarter. We go by quarters.\"\n\nKevin Breuninger, CNBC\n\nSam Meredith, CNBC\n\nSlovakia, the landlocked country east of Austria, could suffer the most from the new auto tariffs that Trump said will take effect Thursday.\n\n\"Germany's car industry is in the eye of the storm and by far most exposed in terms of value, with major players like Volkswagen , BMW , Mercedes , and Porsche likely getting hit by tariffs,\" economists Inga Fechner and Rico Luman of Dutch bank ING said in a recent research note.\n\n\"But Slovakia - home to several car plants - is most exposed in terms of total US export volume,\" they said.\n\nThe nation of 5.4 million people produces more cars per capita than any other country in the world. And the \"Detroit of Europe\" relies heavily on U.S. trade, with autos comprising a major chunk of its U.S. exports.\n\nRead more from CNBC here.\n\nPeter Alexander\n\nReporting from the White House\n\nThe guest list for Trump's Rose Garden tariffs announcement today will include \"steel workers, autoworkers, oil and gas workers, steam fitters, truck drivers, and hardworking Americans from a variety of trades,\" according to a senior White House official.\n\nNBC News\n\nConsumer sentiment has dipped as people brace for possible price increases due to Trump's tariffs.\n\nLaya Neelakandan, CNBC\n\nSen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., said the tariff disagreements between Trump and Democrats go beyond typical party differences, calling it a \"very, very serious situation.\"\n\n\"We believe what President Trump is doing is, in many cases, lawless and really beyond any norms,\" he said on CNBC's Squawk Box.\n\nWelch believes Congress has tariff authority that can be traced back to the Constitution.\n\nTrump's actions are an \"overreach\" in service of a personal agenda, he said.\n\n\"There's a real abdication by Congress of its own authority.\"\n\nRead more from CNBC here.\n\nShannon Pettypiece\n\nRob Wile\n\nTrump and his top officials have given a variety of reasons and mixed messages for their plans to ratchet up the tariffs charged on goods coming into the country.\n\nIn Trump's early weeks in office, he said he was using tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China to punish them for not doing more to stop the flow of fentanyl into the United States. Trump has also used tariffs as a negotiating tool to get concessions out of countries, like threatening Colombia with a tariff if it didn't accept deportation flights of its citizens.\n\nTrump has said the most recent tariffs are a form of retaliation against countries that put their own tariffs on U.S. goods. He has said the so-called retaliatory tariffs will give companies incentives to move manufacturing to the United States by punishing companies that produce their products overseas. He has also said tariffs are a way to raise revenue for the federal government and suggested tariffs could replace income taxes .\n\n\"I think it's going to be something that's going to bring a lot of wealth back to our country,\" Trump said Monday.\n\nShannon Pettypiece\n\nRob Wile\n\nAlex Ford\n\nTariffs are fees U.S.-based companies pay the federal government when they import affected products into the United States. Since the money is collected by the government, it is considered a tax.\n\nIf a big-box retailer, for instance, is importing sneakers from China, it must pay a tariff to Customs and Border Protection officials at a port of entry before it can bring the shoes into the country to sell at its American stores. The same process applies to a manufacturer bringing in parts or raw materials to make a finished product at a U.S. plant or a food distributor importing fresh produce to sell to U.S. grocery stores.\n\nThe tariff is calculated as a percentage of the declared value of the good before it entered the United States, not its retail value. The money collected from tariffs goes to the Treasury Department, similar to tax revenue.\n\nSteve Kopack\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford, speaking this morning on CNBC, said he recently spoke to U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick about Trump's looming tariffs.\n\n\"I spoke to him the other night and asked him, 'What are we expecting April 2?' and he said he wasn't sure,\" Ford said on CNBC. \"Now I don't know if he was blowing smoke or he really didn't know what to expect. Maybe it's the latter.\"\n\nFord said the U.S. and Canada needed to \"get rid of these tariffs and focus on our real enemies around the world.\"\n\nRob Wile\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury bond dropped to as low as 4.13% today as investors looked to safer assets ahead of the tariffs announcement.\n\nTraders increase demand for bonds when they believe growth will slow - and analysts are increasingly warning that Trump's tariffs will reduce economic output in the short term. When bond demand increases, yields drop.\n\nYields represent the annualized percentage payoff a trader can expect from owning the bond. The 10-year yield is closely watched because it serves as a benchmark for demand for other fixed-income assets in the rest of the economy. For instance, mortgage rates are closely tied to the 10-year yield.\n\nTrump has been looking to bring the 10-year yield down to make it cheaper for businesses and consumers to borrow. Until recently, that's been difficult to accomplish, as fears about stickier inflation - something tariffs would compound - have kept yields elevated.\n\nMike Calia\n\nTariffs aren't the only big business story for the Trump administration this week. The president will meet with Vice President JD Vance and other aides today to talk about a potential deal for the U.S. operations of the Chinese-owned social media app TikTok.\n\nPresident Joe Biden signed a TikTok ban into law last year, citing national security concerns, but his administration refrained from enforcing it. Then, as Trump took office in January, he signed an order that extended a deal deadline until this weekend. He's said he could extend the deadline yet again.\n\nBut Trump also said that he could tie TikTok negotiations to trade talks with China. A week ago, the president floated a potential \"little reduction in tariffs\" if China's government agreed to a deal. China has so far been Trump's biggest trade war target, layering 20% tariffs on top of already-active duties on the nation's imports into the U.S.\n\nJason Abbruzzese\n\nAnalysts for the financial services firm Wedbush Securities said it's becoming \"crystal clear this tariff/U.S policy will cause pure chaos to the global auto industry and will raise the prices of a typical car to a U.S. consumer by $5k to $10k out of the gates.\"\n\n\"We stress that the concept of a US car maker with parts all from the US is a fictional tale that does not exist and would take years to make this concept a reality,\" the analysts said in a note sent out this morning.\n\nSteve Kopack\n\nCEO confidence in the economy has been falling ahead of Trump's tariff announcement.\n\nData shared by Apollo Global Management found that corporate leaders' confidence in the economy has declined to levels not seen since 2012.\n\nTorsten Slok, chief economist of investment giant Apollo, points out that chief financial officer confidence has also ticked down in recent months, both in terms of how they feel about their own companies and the national economy.\n\nJason Abbruzzese\n\nWith a little more than an hour to go before U.S. markets open, major stock indexes are set to open lower.\n\nFutures for the tech-heavy Nasdaq were down 0.9%, while S&P 500 Futures were off 0.7%. Dow futures were lower by 0.5%.\n\nThe S&P 500 and the Nasdaq just finished their worst quarter in more than two years .\n\nAstha Rajvanshi\n\nFrench Industry Minister Marc Ferracci said today that Europe would respond to Trump's tariffs in a proportionate manner but would not escalate tensions under any circumstances.\n\n\"Europe has always been on the side of negotiation and calming things down, because trade wars, you know, only produce losers,\" Ferracci told the French broadcaster RMC radio .\n\nArata Yamamoto\n\nReporting from Tokyo\n\nJapan's government said today that it had expressed to \"various levels\" of the Trump administration that it should not unilaterally implement new tariffs against the country.\n\n\"We will carefully examine the details of these tariff measures and their potential impact on our nation while also continuing to strongly urge the U.S. to reconsider its actions,\" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters today, adding that Japan would continue to hold close consultations with the U.S.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba told reporters a day earlier that his country would continue to examine the impact of U.S.-levied tariffs on domestic industries and employment.\n\n\"We will immediately set up special consultation offices in approximately 1,000 locations throughout Japan as a short-term response,\" to the measures, he said, adding that these offices would aim to address the concerns and anxieties of small- and medium-sized businesses.\n\nJ.J. McCorvey\n\nMuch uncertainty remains about whether Trump's promise to slap a 10% tariff on Canadian imports will include the natural gas and electricity that flow cross-border into some U.S. states and into households.\n\nCombined with reciprocal tariffs, such duties could spike utility bills in those areas by as much as 20% - especially in the New England region, where many homes are heated by fuel oil - according to projections by the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, which represents state administrators of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program.\n\nConsumer advocates say the Trump administration has also made it more difficult for some households to shoulder such an increase by eliminating the staff responsible for managing LIHEAP in its purge of the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\"For those who are already struggling to cover their bills, the additional costs will be burdensome and many will have to make tough choices between paying for their home energy bill or paying for their medicine, food, and other essentials,\" NEADA said in a release last week.\n\nMithil Aggarwal\n\nPeter Guo\n\nReporting from Hong Kong\n\nA self-prescribed deadline by a Hong Kong private conglomerate to sell off its two ports along the Panama Canal came to pass today, after Communist Party newspapers blasted the plan as undermining Beijing's interest.\n\nCK Hutchison, owned by tycoon Li Ka-shing, was expected to finalize \"definitive documentation\" which was to be signed on or before today, according to a joint March 4 announcement by the firm and the U.S. investment firm BlackRock, which would be taking over the ports.\n\nThe apparent delay came as Beijing's market regulator last week announced it will review the port sales \"to protect fair market competition and safeguard public interests.\" The Beijing-controlled newspaper Ta Kung Pao and others also published several articles last month criticizing the sale.\n\nTrump has called the critical waterway, through which 15,000 ships transit each year, \"vital\" to national security and wrongfully claimed that China is \"operating\" the canal .\n\nMounting pressure may have contributed to the sale of the ports in a deal that would see CK Hutchison's 90% interest in the Panama ports, and its 80% controlling interest in 43 ports worldwide, except those in mainland China and Hong Kong, sold off to a U.S. consortium for $22.8 billion.\n\nSahil Kapur\n\nMelanie Zanona Melanie Zanona is a Capitol Hill correspondent for NBC News.\n\nZoë Richards\n\nA number of congressional Republicans are publicly voicing concern over the potential for a prolonged trade war and its effect on American farmers as Trump prepares to announce a new wave of tariffs.\n\nHouse Agriculture Committee Chair Glenn Thompson, R-Pa., told NBC News that he has asked the White House to exempt certain goods that are important to the U.S. agricultural industry, such as fertilizer and peat moss.\n\n\"I've kind of pointed out the things that I'm hoping\" will be excluded, he said. \"I talk with anybody who will listen to me. ... They've been really good about input.\"\n\nThompson also said he hopes Congress won't need to bail out farmers with an emergency aid package, as it did during the first Trump administration . But, he said, \"we'll be prepared to do that\" again if needed.\n\nBracey Harris\n\nReporting from BAYOU LA BATRE, Ala.\n\nIt has been four months since Henry Barnes, the mayor of Bayou La Batre, a struggling fishing village in southern Alabama, wrote to Trump for help.\n\nA flood of cheap imported shrimp is killing the local seafood market , he wrote, thanks to \"low and non-existent tariffs.\" He invited Trump, for whom he voted, to come visit Bayou La Batre, known as Alabama's Seafood Capital.\n\nBut thus far he hasn't heard back. \"He'll eventually get around to us,\" said Barnes, a third-generation net-maker. \"I mean, we're just a small town.\"\n\nKristen Welker\n\nAlexandra Marquez\n\nAsked what his recent message to automotive industry CEOs was and whether he had warned them against raising prices, Trump said : \"The message is congratulations, if you make your car in the United States, you're going to make a lot of money. If you don't, you're going to have to probably come to the United States, because if you make your car in the United States, there is no tariff.\"\n\nPressed about whether he told CEOs not to raise prices, as The Wall Street Journal reported, Trump added: \"No, I never said that. I couldn't care less if they raise prices, because people are going to start buying American-made cars.\"\n\nSteve Kopack\n\nMexico has promised to retaliate, but President Claudia Sheinbaum, who has held frequent talks with Trump, has not yet imposed any tariffs. Sheinbaum said she wants to maintain \"cool heads\" as she seeks to avoid a trade war.\n\nSteve Kopack\n\nCanada imposed a 25% tariff on U.S. steel and aluminum products worth nearly $16 billion. It also hit back with 25% tariffs on U.S. computers, servers and sports equipment.\n\nThe European Union has promised to retaliate against U.S. beef, bourbon, peanut butter and denim products, but it delayed those tariffs until mid-April. The bloc's top trade official said he was holding talks with the United States about avoiding tariffs. European capitals have been pushing to avoid an all-out trade war between the 27-nation union and the United States.\n\nSteve Kopack\n\nAs the threat of tariffs looms large in capitals around the world, many trading partners have already retaliated or vowed to respond to Trump's tariffs. China has imposed retaliatory tariffs as high as 15% on some U.S. agricultural products, such as chicken, wheat, soybeans, pork, fruits and dairy products.\n\nSteve Kopack\n\nJ.J. McCorvey\n\nConsumers' economic pessimism is worsening as inflation stay s hot and a series of new reports flash alarms before the White House expands its trade war.\n\nIn February - with much of Trump's tariff agenda announced but not yet implemented - stubborn inflation collided with tepid spending, a closely watched federal report showed Friday. The data indicated many households are paring back on hotel stays and dining out to cover pricier groceries and health care.\n\nThe financial firm ING called the new numbers \"ugly\" and flagged ongoing stagflation risks , saying \"we are moving in the wrong direction\" as Trump's trade war and spending cuts threaten to worsen things.\n\nWells Fargo analysts, who similarly warned of an \"ugly\" quarter ahead , said that if there's one \"silver lining\" to the report, it's that \"income growth was broad and supported by decent wage gains.\" But \"to judge from consumers' own reported inflation expectations, which have been rising, they are going to need the extra support,\" they wrote. Consumers' attitudes are indeed growing gloomier.\n\nAlexandra Byrne\n\nTrump's 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum took effect March 12, triggering a wave of countermeasures from foreign governments. The temporary carveouts he granted Canada and Mexico for those metals and other products are set to expire to day - when Trump is expected to unveil a vast new slate of tariffs on \"all countries,\" including \"reciprocal\" levies equalizing trade barriers around the world.\n\nThe European Commission said yesterday that it's preparing to reintroduce the retaliatory duties it imposed during Trump's first term as part of a broader series of levies on American products teed up for mid-April. Canada has already slapped 25% tariffs on various U.S. goods, including steel and aluminum.\n\nTariffs can give domestic business a short-term boost, economists say , but it gets more complicated once other countries retaliate - making it tough to game out the ultimate winners and losers in an ever-evolving global trade war .\n\nRob Wile\n\nJoe Murphy\n\nTrump's dizzying tariffs rhetoric has caught the economy flat-footed .\n\nWhile Trump has long lauded trade duties as a solution to a host of economic woes, it has been the tariffs' erratic rollout and shifting rationales that have alarmed investors .\n\nHere's a timeline of Trump's tariff efforts that began unfolding in February.\n\nSteve Kopack\n\nTrump's tariffs have been applied in an on-again, off-again way. So what tariffs are currently in effect? As of yesterday morning, a 25% tariff on goods not covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal are in effect. A 10% tariff on goods from China, on top of various tariffs already imposed on Chinese goods, plus a 25% tariff on worldwide steel and aluminum imports are in place.\n\nThe United States has more than 200 trading partners and 12,500 different tariff categories, so, according to analysts at UBS , there could be up to 2.5 million tariff and country combinations.\n\nRob Wile\n\nEven before today's announcement, the mere threat of the higher tariffs has caused business and consumer sentiment to plummet.\n\nThe most recent report from the Conference Board showed consumer expectations for the next 12 months plunged to a 12-year low , while talk of tariffs has exploded in recent corporate earnings calls . In parallel, stocks just had their worst quarter since the Covid pandemic.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images hide caption\n\nWorld economies are jittery ahead of President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" when he is set to unleash tariffs against multiple countries.\n\nIn President Donald Trump's telling, tariffs are the political equivalent of duct tape: you can use them to fix anything.\n\nFor example, they're a negotiating tool - he used the threat of tariffs to pressure Canada and Mexico to implement border policies he liked. He also sees tariffs as a revenue source that might help offset his proposed $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and as a shield to protect American manufacturing jobs from overseas competition.\n\nWith all of these potentially conflicting aims, and with another major round of tariffs expected to be announced on Wednesday, what is the strategy behind them?\n\nRana Foroohar, a Financial Times columnist and the author of Homecoming: The Path to Prosperity in a Post-Global World , says they're an \"experiment\" that could lead to a big change in the way the global economy works.\n\nFor sponsor-free episodes of Consider This, sign up for C onsider This+ via Apple Podcasts or at plus.npr.org .\n\nEmail us at considerthis@npr.org .\n\nThis episode was produced by Matthew Cloutier and Brianna Scott.

      "text": "Politics chat: 'Hands Off' protests in Washington, Trump's tariffs and Republicans\n\nBy\n\nAyesha Rascoe\n\n,\n\nMara Liasson\n\nPresident Trump's tariff regime puts him at odds with Congressional Republicans seeking to cut taxes.\n\nAYESHA RASCOE, HOST: President Trump hit the links this weekend while throngs of people hit the streets in cities around the country protesting him and his policies. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) Hey, hey. Ho, ho. Donald Trump has got to go. Hey, hey. Ho, ho... RASCOE: That's from yesterday here in Washington. And that's also where we'll start with NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Good morning, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning. RASCOE: The theme of those protests was hands off, and they were planned to express opposition to government downsizing, Trump's economic policies and more. Does that anger reflect the feelings of Americans in general? LIASSON: Yeah, I think it does. According to polls, voters disapprove of President Trump's handling of the economy. They don't like Elon Musk's dismantling of federal agencies. Right now, Trump's overall approval rating is lower than any other modern presidents at this point in his term. And it's not just the polls. It's voters. You know, we had three elections this week. And in Wisconsin, which was the swing state that was closest to 2024 - Trump won it by only about one point - the Democratic-backed state Supreme Court candidate won by 10 points. And the biggest takeaway from that race was turnout because the Republican-backed state Supreme Court candidate actually won more votes than any other state Supreme Court candidate in Wisconsin history, but the Democratic candidate turned out even more. She got more votes than any Republican candidate for governor in Wisconsin history. So we've had a lot of actual data from voters. There were two Florida special elections in very red congressional districts this week. The Republican candidates did win, but their margins of victory were cut in half from 2024. So anger is a very, very powerful motivator in politics, and it seems to be working against the president and his party right now. RASCOE: Well, Trump's tariffs have proven to be pretty unpopular also. What chances do you see of him backing off of them or getting reined in by Republican lawmakers? LIASSON: Well, he has backed off of tariffs in the past, but this time, he and his advisers have said he is standing firm. He posted, quote, \"my politics will never change.\" You know, the idea that trade deficits are a mortal threat to America's way of life is one of Donald Trump's longest-held and most deeply held core beliefs. You know, in order to enact these tariffs, he had to officially declare that the U.S. trade deficit was a national emergency. That declaration might be challenged in court, but it shows you how seriously he takes this. And, you know, there used to be a theory that the financial markets were a kind of guardrail for Donald Trump, that he really cared about what Wall Street thinks. But so far, he doesn't seem to care. The stock markets have cratered. They are registering their fear and loathing of his trade policies. More and more economists are talking about stagflation, which is slow growth plus inflation. But Donald Trump seems undeterred. And the message from the White House is that consumers should expect some, quote, \"short-term gain for long-term pain.\" And the question is, will voters react to that message the way they reacted very negatively to Joe Biden telling them that inflation was just transitory? And as far as Republicans reining in Trump, I think that's unlikely. Congress ceded its power over trade policy to the president long ago. There is a small handful of Republicans in the Senate and House who have co-sponsored bills to claw back that power, but I think it's very unlikely that they will pass. RASCOE: And that's short-term, that the - the White House is saying expect short-term pain for long-term gain. That's what they're telling people to expect. LIASSON: That's what they're telling people. RASCOE: Yes. And is the goal of these tariffs to bring countries to the table one by one to negotiate them down or away, or is it a way to generate revenue for the government and to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.? In which case, these tariffs would need to stay in place, right? LIASSON: Right. That's a very good question. The White House and the president have laid out so many different goals for these tariffs, and some of those goals contradict others. The White House says tariffs will bring in $600 billion a year. They'll pay for tax cuts. They'll balance the budget. But that would mean that they would be permanent. Sometimes, the White House says, they're just negotiating tactics in order to force other countries or industries to come to the president and make concessions. We know that that's something that the president likes. He talks about people coming hat in hand to him asking for exemptions, but those goals are in contradiction. RASCOE: And the Senate budget plan passed early yesterday morning. What's in it, and what's next? LIASSON: Well, what's in it are the Trump first-term tax cuts made permanent. That's about $5 trillion of tax cuts plus another 1.5 trillion of new tax cuts. Presumably, that's to fulfill Trump's promises to eliminate taxes on tips and overtime. What happens next is the Senate budget has to be reconciled with the House version, which includes very deep spending cuts, including what might have to be $880 billion of Medicaid cuts, and that could affect lots of Trump voters in red states.

The stock markets have cratered. They are registering their fear and loathing of his trade policies. More and more economists are talking about stagflation, which is slow growth plus inflation. But Donald Trump seems undeterred. And the message from the White House is that consumers should expect some, quote, \"short-term gain for long-term pain.\" And the question is, will voters react to that message the way they reacted very negatively to Joe Biden telling them that inflation was just transitory? And as far as Republicans reining in Trump, I think that's unlikely. Congress ceded its power over trade policy to the president long ago. There is a small handful of Republicans in the Senate and House who have co-sponsored bills to claw back that power, but I think it's very unlikely that they will pass. RASCOE: And that's short-term, that the - the White House is saying expect short-term pain for long-term gain. That's what they're telling people to expect. LIASSON: That's what they're telling people. RASCOE: Yes. And is the goal of these tariffs to bring countries to the table one by one to negotiate them down or away, or is it a way to generate revenue for the government and to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.? In which case, these tariffs would need to stay in place, right? LIASSON: Right. That's a very good question. The White House and the president have laid out so many different goals for these tariffs, and some of those goals contradict others. The White House says tariffs will bring in $600 billion a year. They'll pay for tax cuts. They'll balance the budget. But that would mean that they would be permanent. Sometimes, the White House says, they're just negotiating tactics in order to force other countries or industries to come to the president and make concessions. We know that that's something that the president likes. He talks about people coming hat in hand to him asking for exemptions, but those goals are in contradiction. RASCOE: And the Senate budget plan passed early yesterday morning. What's in it, and what's next? LIASSON: Well, what's in it are the Trump first-term tax cuts made permanent. That's about $5 trillion of tax cuts plus another 1.5 trillion of new tax cuts. Presumably, that's to fulfill Trump's promises to eliminate taxes on tips and overtime. What happens next is the Senate budget has to be reconciled with the House version, which includes very deep spending cuts, including what might have to be $880 billion of Medicaid cuts, and that could affect lots of Trump voters in red states.

RASCOE: That's from yesterday here in Washington. And that's also where we'll start with NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Good morning, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning. RASCOE: The theme of those protests was hands off, and they were planned to express opposition to government downsizing, Trump's economic policies and more. Does that anger reflect the feelings of Americans in general? LIASSON: Yeah, I think it does. According to polls, voters disapprove of President Trump's handling of the economy. They don't like Elon Musk's dismantling of federal agencies. Right now, Trump's overall approval rating is lower than any other modern presidents at this point in his term. And it's not just the polls. It's voters. You know, we had three elections this week. And in Wisconsin, which was the swing state that was closest to 2024 - Trump won it by only about one point - the Democratic-backed state Supreme Court candidate won by 10 points. And the biggest takeaway from that race was turnout because the Republican-backed state Supreme Court candidate actually won more votes than any other state Supreme Court candidate in Wisconsin history, but the Democratic candidate turned out even more. She got more votes than any Republican candidate for governor in Wisconsin history. So we've had a lot of actual data from voters. There were two Florida special elections in very red congressional districts this week. The Republican candidates did win, but their margins of victory were cut in half from 2024. So anger is a very, very powerful motivator in politics, and it seems to be working against the president and his party right now. RASCOE: Well, Trump's tariffs have proven to be pretty unpopular also. What chances do you see of him backing off of them or getting reined in by Republican lawmakers? LIASSON: Well, he has backed off of tariffs in the past, but this time, he and his advisers have said he is standing firm. He posted, quote, \"my politics will never change.\" You know, the idea that trade deficits are a mortal threat to America's way of life is one of Donald Trump's longest-held and most deeply held core beliefs. You know, in order to enact these tariffs, he had to officially declare that the U.S. trade deficit was a national emergency. That declaration might be challenged in court, but it shows you how seriously he takes this. And, you know, there used to be a theory that the financial markets were a kind of guardrail for Donald Trump, that he really cared about what Wall Street thinks. But so far, he doesn't seem to care.

RASCOE: And that's short-term, that the - the White House is saying expect short-term pain for long-term gain. That's what they're telling people to expect. LIASSON: That's what they're telling people. RASCOE: Yes. And is the goal of these tariffs to bring countries to the table one by one to negotiate them down or away, or is it a way to generate revenue for the government and to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.? In which case, these tariffs would need to stay in place, right? LIASSON: Right. That's a very good question. The White House and the president have laid out so many different goals for these tariffs, and some of those goals contradict others. The White House says tariffs will bring in $600 billion a year. They'll pay for tax cuts. They'll balance the budget. But that would mean that they would be permanent. Sometimes, the White House says, they're just negotiating tactics in order to force other countries or industries to come to the president and make concessions. We know that that's something that the president likes. He talks about people coming hat in hand to him asking for exemptions, but those goals are in contradiction. RASCOE: And the Senate budget plan passed early yesterday morning. What's in it, and what's next? LIASSON: Well, what's in it are the Trump first-term tax cuts made permanent. That's about $5 trillion of tax cuts plus another 1.5 trillion of new tax cuts. Presumably, that's to fulfill Trump's promises to eliminate taxes on tips and overtime. What happens next is the Senate budget has to be reconciled with the House version, which includes very deep spending cuts, including what might have to be $880 billion of Medicaid cuts, and that could affect lots of Trump voters in red states.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nRASCOE: The theme of those protests was hands off, and they were planned to express opposition to government downsizing, Trump's economic policies and more. Does that anger reflect the feelings of Americans in general? LIASSON: Yeah, I think it does. According to polls, voters disapprove of President Trump's handling of the economy. They don't like Elon Musk's dismantling of federal agencies. Right now, Trump's overall approval rating is lower than any other modern presidents at this point in his term. And it's not just the polls. It's voters. You know, we had three elections this week. And in Wisconsin, which was the swing state that was closest to 2024 - Trump won it by only about one point - the Democratic-backed state Supreme Court candidate won by 10 points. And the biggest takeaway from that race was turnout because the Republican-backed state Supreme Court candidate actually won more votes than any other state Supreme Court candidate in Wisconsin history, but the Democratic candidate turned out even more. She got more votes than any Republican candidate for governor in Wisconsin history. So we've had a lot of actual data from voters. There were two Florida special elections in very red congressional districts this week. The Republican candidates did win, but their margins of victory were cut in half from 2024. So anger is a very, very powerful motivator in politics, and it seems to be working against the president and his party right now. RASCOE: Well, Trump's tariffs have proven to be pretty unpopular also. What chances do you see of him backing off of them or getting reined in by Republican lawmakers? LIASSON: Well, he has backed off of tariffs in the past, but this time, he and his advisers have said he is standing firm. He posted, quote, \"my politics will never change.\" You know, the idea that trade deficits are a mortal threat to America's way of life is one of Donald Trump's longest-held and most deeply held core beliefs. You know, in order to enact these tariffs, he had to officially declare that the U.S. trade deficit was a national emergency. That declaration might be challenged in court, but it shows you how seriously he takes this. And, you know, there used to be a theory that the financial markets were a kind of guardrail for Donald Trump, that he really cared about what Wall Street thinks. But so far, he doesn't seem to care. The stock markets have cratered. They are registering their fear and loathing of his trade policies. More and more economists are talking about stagflation, which is slow growth plus inflation. But Donald Trump seems undeterred. And the message from the White House is that consumers should expect some, quote, \"short-term gain for long-term pain.\" And the question is, will voters react to that message the way they reacted very negatively to Joe Biden telling them that inflation was just transitory? And as far as Republicans reining in Trump, I think that's unlikely. Congress ceded its power over trade policy to the president long ago.

The stock markets have cratered. They are registering their fear and loathing of his trade policies. More and more economists are talking about stagflation, which is slow growth plus inflation. But Donald Trump seems undeterred. And the message from the White House is that consumers should expect some, quote, \"short-term gain for long-term pain.\" And the question is, will voters react to that message the way they reacted very negatively to Joe Biden telling them that inflation was just transitory? And as far as Republicans reining in Trump, I think that's unlikely. Congress ceded its power over trade policy to the president long ago. There is a small handful of Republicans in the Senate and House who have co-sponsored bills to claw back that power, but I think it's very unlikely that they will pass. RASCOE: And that's short-term, that the - the White House is saying expect short-term pain for long-term gain. That's what they're telling people to expect. LIASSON: That's what they're telling people. RASCOE: Yes. And is the goal of these tariffs to bring countries to the table one by one to negotiate them down or away, or is it a way to generate revenue for the government and to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.? In which case, these tariffs would need to stay in place, right? LIASSON: Right. That's a very good question. The White House and the president have laid out so many different goals for these tariffs, and some of those goals contradict others. The White House says tariffs will bring in $600 billion a year. They'll pay for tax cuts. They'll balance the budget. But that would mean that they would be permanent. Sometimes, the White House says, they're just negotiating tactics in order to force other countries or industries to come to the president and make concessions. We know that that's something that the president likes. He talks about people coming hat in hand to him asking for exemptions, but those goals are in contradiction. RASCOE: And the Senate budget plan passed early yesterday morning. What's in it, and what's next? LIASSON: Well, what's in it are the Trump first-term tax cuts made permanent. That's about $5 trillion of tax cuts plus another 1.5 trillion of new tax cuts. Presumably, that's to fulfill Trump's promises to eliminate taxes on tips and overtime. What happens next is the Senate budget has to be reconciled with the House version, which includes very deep spending cuts, including what might have to be $880 billion of Medicaid cuts, and that could affect lots of Trump voters in red states.

There were two Florida special elections in very red congressional districts this week. The Republican candidates did win, but their margins of victory were cut in half from 2024. So anger is a very, very powerful motivator in politics, and it seems to be working against the president and his party right now. RASCOE: Well, Trump's tariffs have proven to be pretty unpopular also. What chances do you see of him backing off of them or getting reined in by Republican lawmakers? LIASSON: Well, he has backed off of tariffs in the past, but this time, he and his advisers have said he is standing firm. He posted, quote, \"my politics will never change.\" You know, the idea that trade deficits are a mortal threat to America's way of life is one of Donald Trump's longest-held and most deeply held core beliefs. You know, in order to enact these tariffs, he had to officially declare that the U.S. trade deficit was a national emergency. That declaration might be challenged in court, but it shows you how seriously he takes this. And, you know, there used to be a theory that the financial markets were a kind of guardrail for Donald Trump, that he really cared about what Wall Street thinks. But so far, he doesn't seem to care.

RASCOE: And the Senate budget plan passed early yesterday morning. What's in it, and what's next? LIASSON: Well, what's in it are the Trump first-term tax cuts made permanent. That's about $5 trillion of tax cuts plus another 1.5 trillion of new tax cuts. Presumably, that's to fulfill Trump's promises to eliminate taxes on tips and overtime. What happens next is the Senate budget has to be reconciled with the House version, which includes very deep spending cuts, including what might have to be $880 billion of Medicaid cuts, and that could affect lots of Trump voters in red states.

      "text": "Trump closes loophole used by American shoppers to buy Chinese goods tariff-free\n\nBrian Mann\n\nPresident Donald Trump's new trade levies include a broadside against e-commerce.  His executive order extinguishes a tariff exemption for packages from China and Hong Kong worth less than $800. Bloomberg via Getty Images/Bloomberg hide caption\n\nWhile President Donald Trump was levying massive tariffs on goods from around the world this week, he also moved to pinch off a popular trade loophole that allows American shoppers to buy low-cost goods directly from retailers in China and Hong Kong.\n\nPopular e-commerce companies, including giants Shein and Temu, use the so-called \"de minimis\" exemption to ship tens of millions of packages - everything from end tables and lamps to shoes and underwear - to U.S. consumers every year.\n\nSo long as each individual package is worth $800 or less, they aren't required to pay import fees or go through typical customs inspections.  But under an executive order signed by Trump Wednesday, that loophole will close on May 2.\n\nThese lower-value shipments will now face a tariff of 30% of the \"value of the postal item containing goods for merchandise\" with a minimum fee that will eventually rise to $50.\n\nA package from Shein.  Experts say roughly 1.4 billion small packages worth less than $800 are now being shipped by international retailers directly to American consumers every year. About 40% of those shipments come from China and Hong Kong. After May 2 they'll face stiff tariffs and inspections. NurPhoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images/NurPhoto hide caption\n\n\"We are really pleased,\" said Kimberly Glas, president of the National Council of Textile Organizations, a trade group that lobbied for the de minimis shipments to end, in part to protect U.S.-based manufacturers. \"We think this was a huge step forward.\"\n\nCritics of the de minimis exemption say it offered foreign firms backdoor access to American consumers. Over the last decade, international retailers have exploited the rule aggressively, growing the number of direct-sale deliveries to U.S. consumers roughly ten-fold from 2014 through last year.\n\nBut some trade experts say closing the loophole and adding what amounts to a hefty tax to low-cost goods will come at a steep cost for many shoppers.\n\nA study published last year by the National Bureau of Economic Research , a non-partisan think tank based in Massachusetts, concluded Americans will wind up paying $10.9 billion to $13 billion more for purchases each year.\n\nIn an email to NPR, one of the paper's co-authors, Amit Khandelwal, predicted higher prices would fall most heavily on people with lower incomes who have used e-commerce purchases to lower expenses.\n\n\"We find that lower-income consumers take advantage of de minimis shipments disproportionally more than richer consumers,\" said Khandelwal, a professor of global affairs and economics at Yale University.\n\nBut while many of Trump's tariffs are controversial, efforts to close the de minimis loophole have drawn bipartisan support, with the backing of U.S. public safety , consumer protection and trade groups.\n\nLast year, 126 House Democrats sent a letter to then-President Joe Biden urging him to use an executive order to apply inspections and duty fees to all direct shipments.\n\n\"We had 1.4 billion de minimis shipments last year,\" Glas said. \"These [imported] items don't pay a tariff. There's no scrutiny. Which essentially equates to four million boxes coming in a day, with little information and no one to hold accountable.\"\n\nIndustry groups in the U.S. believe the direct, duty-free shipments have meant unfair competition for American factories and textile plants that make garments.\n\nSome activists and U.S. government officials also believe the roughly 4 million packages now entering the country daily have become a significant source of smuggled street fentanyl and other contraband.\n\n\"Bad actors are exploiting this explosion in volume to traffic counterfeits [knock-off products that resemble name brand], dangerous narcotics, and other illicit goods including precursor chemicals and materials such as pill presses and die molds used to manufacture fentanyl and other synthetic drugs that are killing Americans,\" said U.S. Customs and Border Patrol officials in an October 2024 report .\n\nThe executive order signed by Trump this week  cites fentanyl as a major factor in his decision to close the trade loophole.\n\nThe Shein logo arranged against a Chinese flag in Shanghai, China, on Monday, Feb. 3, 2025.  China is retaliating against the U.S. after President Trump implemented tariffs that affect small purchases as well as whole industries. Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images/Bloomberg hide caption\n\nThis action only ends de minimis shipments from China and Hong Kong, which experts say will affect roughly 30 to 40% of these relatively low-cost international deliveries.\n\nAccording to Glas, her coalition will now lobby the White House and Congress to close the loophole for all low-cost shipments reaching the U.S., not only from China but also from nations like Bangladesh, India and Vietnam.\n\n\"Member of Congress on both sides of the aisle have been supporting of closing de minimis for China and the rest of the world,\" Glas said.\n\nOne unanswered question is how U.S. officials will actually process, inspect and levy tariffs on the vast number of low-value packages now entering the U.S.\n\n\"Putting the systems in place to collect tariffs on a billion shipments [per year] will require large investments in infrastructure,\" said Amit Khandelwal at Yale University.\n\nIndeed, Trump attempted to close this same trade loophole in February, but had to backtrack because U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials weren't prepared to handle the massive new task. White House officials say they're now ready.\n\n\"The Secretary of Commerce has notified me that adequate systems are now in place to process and collect tariff revenue for covered goods from [China and Hong Kong],\" Trump said in his latest executive order .\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "Is Your 401(k) Affected by Trump's Tariffs? Here's What to Know and What You Should Do\n\nReporter\n\nA trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, on April 4, 2025. Markets extended a global selloff on April 4 as countries around the world reeled from President Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\nReporter\n\nT he U.S. and global stock markets have been hit hard since President Donald Trump announced his latest tariffs on April 2. The so-called \"Liberation Day\" saw the introduction of blanket 10% tariffs on all imported goods, and additional import taxes placed on 60 other countries.\n\nIn the worst week for U.S. stocks since the markets crashed in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, Dow Jones closed on Friday 2,000 points down, the S&P Index plunged 6%, and Nasdaq dipped almost 6%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe volatility of the market has risen significantly, causing concern from investors and businesses alike, and sparking fresh fears that the U.S. may be heading into a recession.\n\nRead More : Is the U.S. Heading Into a Recession Amid Trump's Tariffs? 'Liberation Day' Fallout Sparks Fresh Fears\n\nThere has also been a surge in concerns being voiced by people worried about the impact on their 401(k), as many have noticed a dip in their investments.\n\nHere's what you need to know about how the economic turmoil resulting from Trump's tariffs will affect your 401(k) and what you should do moving forward.\n\nA 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement plan where a person has the option to make contributions that are deducted from their paycheck. In some cases, the company will match your contributions up to a certain percentage of your salary.\n\nThe value of 401(k) accounts is closely tied to fluctuations in the stock markets, as the portfolio allows you to invest in assets which are directly tied to the market's performance. As such, when the stock market fluctuates, so too does a 401(k). With a 401(k), you carry all the risk because the investment decisions are yours.\n\nWith such extreme dips in the stock market, some Americans are seeing their retirement savings take an intense hit.\n\nDuring an appearance on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday, April 6, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was asked about the market turmoil and the concerns regarding retirement savings.\n\nHost Kristen Welker said: \"More than 160 million Americans are invested in the market. Many of them have spent their lives saving for their retirement. What is your message to Americans who want to retire right now and who've just seen their lifetime savings drop significantly?\"\n\nResponding to the question, Bessent remarked that he thinks it's a \"false narrative,\" and suggested that people maintain a \"long-term view.\"\n\n\"Americans who want to retire right now, Americans who have put away for years in their savings accounts, I think they don't look at the day-to-day fluctuations of what's happening. And you know, in fact, most Americans don't have everything in the market,\" said Bessent. \"Most Americans in a 401(k) have what's called a '60/40 account.' 60/40 accounts are down 5 or 6% on the year. People have a long-term view. They have a program that the reason the stock market is considered a good investment is because it's a long-term investment. If you look day-to-day, week-to-week, it's very risky. Over the long term, it's a good investment.\"\n\nBessent's remarks mirror those made by Trump. On April 3, when aboard Air Force One, Trump was asked by a reporter about the rising concerns among Americans and whether he has checked his own 401(k) since his tariff announcements stunned the stock market.\n\nTrump said: \"I haven't checked my 401(k).\" The President also doubled down on his belief that though the markets look bad now, his tariffs will ultimately be a good thing for the economy. \"I think our markets are going to boom; we've got to give it a little chance,\" he said.\n\nThe President once again shared his optimism about the economy in an update he posted on his social media platform, Truth Social, on Saturday, April 5. \"This is an economic revolution, and we will win. Hang tough, it won't be easy, but the end result will be historic. We will Make America Great Again,\" he said .\n\nHowever, experts have their concerns.\n\nTeresa Fort, associate professor of business administration at Dartmouth, says: \"The U.S. market has outperformed everywhere for the last couple of decades, but I don't know if it's clear that this is going to continue... the entire world economic order has been shifted, and people are going to need to rethink what [their] optimal allocations should be.\"\n\nBrad Clark, founder and CEO of Solomon Financial, says that this is not the time to panic and take your money out of savings. \"It's scary,\" he admits, but the response to fear, in his professional opinion, is to stay the course-especially if you are a younger investor preparing for future retirement.\n\n\"When you're flying somewhere and you're in the worst turbulence you've ever been in, all you can think is, 'I've just got to get off this plane,'\" says Clark. \"But the plane was built to handle this. That's kind of like your portfolio.\"\n\nFor people two or three years from retirement, Clark says their portfolios should already be less risky, and they should not have full market exposure to their investments.\n\nHowever, for those who are still 10 or more years away from retirement, there could be positives to note. \"What a great buying opportunity,\" Clark argues. \"This is how the Warren Buffetts of the world make money. Greedy when everyone else is fearful, and fearful when everyone else is greedy.\"\n\nClark's advice to those people-who are a decade or more away from retirement- is to \"continue to invest like you've always invested,\" and he is confident that this will pay off in the long run.\n\nIn a column for the Washington Post , personal finance columnist and author Michelle Singletary echoed this sentiment. \"If you're in your 20s, 30s, or early 40s, don't let what's happening now scare you away from the stock market. Keep investing,\" she said .\n\nRead More : How to Prepare For the New Social Security ID Policy Ahead of Its Initiation in April\n\nLaurence Kotlikoff, professor of economics at Boston University, takes a more cautious approach for people of all ages.\n\nHe recommends not investing in anything risky now, instead starting back from a safe investment position and eventually building your investment portfolio back into something more risky. By starting conservatively and building up, Kotlikoff says that investors can save themselves from pain later on.\n\n\"There's no reason to believe that the market will reverse itself,\" he says. \"Leave only in the market what you can afford to lose and don't spend outside of it.\"\n\nHe also recommends people consider doing what he and his wife did soon after Trump's Inauguration Day. In preparation of potential market fluctuations, they built a TIPS ladder , which is a portfolio of Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities.\n\nTIPS are U.S. government bonds that adjust for inflation, ensuring that the bond's principal increases with inflation and decreases with deflation.\n\n\"It's a combination of spending and investing behavior that is called 'upside investing' that leads you just to have upside risks,\" Kotlikoff says. \"You're losing that downside because you're never spending out of anything that's risky, you're just spending out of this TIPS ladder.\"\n\nFort echoes Kotlikoff's caution, noting that while some economists are saying to stay the course as usual, these are not usual times, and she thinks that it is likely that the markets are only going to dip further. For her own mother, who relies on her 401k, Fort has reduced her exposure to the market as much as possible.\n\n\"This is a fundamental shift in the world order,\" Fort emphasizes once more. \"If you are close to retirement age, you'll want to look for the safest assets if you cannot afford another 20% to 30% decline in the market.\"\n\nOverall, it's worth noting that expert advice varies depending on the age of the person with the 401(k) and what stage they're at in their working lives. For example, Fort did not take the same measures for her own financial portfolio as she did for her mother's, since she is younger and has more time until retirement. Across the board, expert guidance tells us not to panic and not to make any rash financial decisions.\n\n© 2025 TIME USA, LLC. All Rights Reserved.

      "text": "Do Donald Trump's approval ratings hold amid tariffs and trade war chaos? What polls say now\n\nHow are the exploding trade war and worst U.S. stock market drop in years affecting presidential approval ratings ?\n\nLaunching a historic global trade war, President Donald Trump announced at least 10% tariffs for 'all' countries with much higher rates for some countries or trading blocs on Wednesday. China was among the hardest hit with a 54% total tariff, to which they have since responded with retaliatory 34% tariffs on US goods.\n\nTrump's presidential approval ratings remained steady over the first two months despite the adminstration's chaotic start, even reached his all time highest rating in either of his terms. But a dip, a drop or a plunge is now showing the temperature of the American public's opinion has soured.\n\nThe most recent Harvard CAPS/Harris poll found 49% of registered voters approved of Trump's job performance, compared to 52% last month in same poll. Although the drop, he is still polling higher favorability over the 46% that disapprove.\n\nThis poll also found that 54% of voters think Trump is doing a better job than his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, noting that this figure is also lower than his 58% job approval last month over Biden.\n\nAccording to the most current Reuters/Ipsos poll , 42% of approve of Trump's job performance compared to 45% just a couple weeks prior. His overall rating remains higher than his first term and higher than what Biden polled during most of his administration.\n\nWhen asked about the general direction of the country, only 22% of those polled felt things were heading in the right direction while 61% felt they are off on the wrong track, although on the direction of the national economy and politics scene, the polls showed a more wait and see attitude - 30% right direction, 53% wrong track and 17% said they didn't know. Employment and jobs and inflation teetered in similar percentages.\n\nTrump is still getting higher marks on the direction of his immigration policy with 48% approval versus 44% that disapprove. On the topic of how Trump was handling Russia 48% disapproved and, on Ukraine, 46% disapproved, with many still not sure yet.\n\nOn the topic of tariffs, the poll asked \"In general, when the U.S. charges tariffs on imported goods, American workers come out ahead\" and the response was that 45% disagreed, while 31% agreed and 14% were unsure.\n\nAs for Vice President JD Vance, he has a 41% favorable view versus 49% unfavorable and special government agent Elon Musk showed a 39% favorable versus 57% unfavorable.\n\nHere's what the most current polls show about Trump's presidential ratings right now.\n\nIn the Economist/YouGov poll , Trump's favorability stood at 48% versus 49% unfavorable. Meanwhile Vice President JD Vance's favorability polled at 43% versus 46% unfavorable and House Speaker Mike Johnson had a 30% favorability versus 37% unfavourability.\n\nThis poll included approval ratings on some high profile Democrats as well, such as Minority Leader Chuck Schumer with a 24% favorability compared to a whopping 50% unfavourability.\n\nOf those polled , an overwhelming majority prioritized inflation and prices, followed by jobs and the economy and then healthcare above other issues.\n\nThe national NBC News poll shows Trump's approval rating at 47% with more registered voters seeing the US as heading in the right direction than at any point since early 2004. However, the majority of Americans still say the country is on the wrong track and he holds a higher rate of 51% that disapprove of his performance as president right now, according to the report.\n\nThe poll shows that despite the slightly higher disapproval numbers over Trump's overall presidential job performance, the margin is closer than at any other point during his first term. Other noteworthy results of the poll include an increased number of Republicans identifying with MAGA, more Americans \"have come around\" on his deportation-focused immigration policies and they like the general concept behind the Department of Government Efficiency and Trump's efforts to cut government jobs and spending.\n\nOne poll result in particular showed that voters are evenly split on the 2026 midterm elections as a divided Democratic party, facing record-low popularity , is trying to figure how to respond to Trump. That record low shows just 27% of registered voters viewing the Democratic party positively, among a total that included 59% of self identified Democrats.\n\nRealClear Polling which encompasses 13 different pollsters, including those mentioned above, shows Trump's overall favorability dropping to 47.6% versus 49.8% that disapprove, as of today.\n\nNote: Polls are constantly changing and different pollsters ask different varieties of the population. These numbers were reflected as of Firday, April 4, 2025 at 9:30 a.m."

      "text": "What is Donald Trump's approval rating? Here are the latest polls from US, Colorado\n\nAnother eventful week has President Donald Trump losing a little ground in national surveys, even as he publicly muses about running for a third term in office.\n\nOver the past week, Trump kicked off a global trade war with a slew of new tariffs , federal agencies continued to lay off workers and his administration continues to ponder restrictions on funding for universities that it believes are not doing enough to prevent antisemitism. The moves have outraged the left, but the GOP has largely stayed in lockstep with him.\n\nNot all recent polls captured those events, but there are a handful of snapshots of Trump's job approval. Here's a look at Trump's performance in national and state polls:\n\nPolling continued to show a divided country, although the results split as to whether Trump had slightly more or slightly less approval for his job performance.\n\nThe Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Trump's lowest rating in the survey this term - 43% approval and 53% disapproval. The survey was taken between March 31 and April 2 from 1,486 adults.\n\nThe Economist/YouGov poll found Trump upside down on job approval, with 49% disapproval and 46% approval. The survey was taken March 30 to April 1 with a sample of 1,626 citizens.\n\nThe Harvard-Harris poll had Trump ahead, 49% approval to 46% disapproval in a sample of 2,746 registered voters over March 26 to 27.\n\nIn an off year for elections and a state that has been solidly blue for several election cycles, Colorado has not seen much polling in 2025.\n\nIn the latest polling of Colorado by Civiqs , Trump's job approval climbed slightly to 39% approval and 57% disapproval, up from a 38%/60% split a week earlier. Drew Linzer, the director of Civiqs, told the USA TODAY Network the firm uses advanced and proprietary modeling to develop results from online surveys of around 200 to 250 registered voters daily across the country.\n\nUSA TODAY Network reporters continue to see small changes from the 2024 electoral map.\n\nIn South Dakota, Civiqs saw Trump with a 60% approval/38% disapproval rating for his job performance, based on surveys completed as of April 2.\n\nIn Michigan , a Marketing Resource Group poll found 51% of Michiganders disapprove of Trump's job performance, while 42% approved. The poll was taken conducted a poll in Michigan March 24-28 with a sample of 602 likely voters and a margin of error ± 4 percentage points.\n\nIt's important to note that each pollster has their own methodology, with responses gathered online, over the phone, through the mail or in person - with some using a combination of methods. They also draw from different cohorts. Registered and likely voters are more likely to be surveyed near elections, while responses may come from all Americans between elections.\n\nThose variations can make it difficult to compare one poll to another, even from the same pollster at different parts of the political cycle.\n\nThe Pew Research Center , which has conducted public opinion polls for more than two decades , says good polls can \"give everyone in the population - regardless of their wealth, age, education, race, knowledge of politics or experience with it - an equal voice about the issues of the day.\"\n\nNate Trela covers trending news in Colorado and Utah for the USA TODAY Network."

      "text": "Trump tariffs live updates: Sec. Bessent tells ABC deals could come 'very quickly'\n\nManage your account\n\nPresident Donald Trump's severe tariffs against virtually all U.S. trading partners continued to roil world markets on Monday.\n\nAsked if he would be open to pausing the tariffs to allow for negotiations, Trump responded, \"We're not looking at that.\" Trump said the U.S. has \"many, many, countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us.\"\n\nEarlier Monday, Trump threatened to veto a bipartisan bill introduced in the Senate last week that would require congressional approval of any tariffs the president would seek to impose. He also threatened to impose additional tariffs on China for retaliatory measures it took after Trump announced his plans last week.\n\nA senior White House official told ABC News that this would be in addition to the 34% reciprocal tariff Trump announced last week and the 20% already in place, making for a potential total of 104%.\n\nStocks in Europe and Asia partially rebounded Tuesday, buoyed by signals from the White House that it is open to talks on tariffs with countries. The UK's FTSE, Germany's DAX and the pan-European Stoxx 600 closed at 2.5% or above. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei jumped over 6%, while China's Shanghai Composite index closed at 1.4%. However, analysts warn further volatility is likely, with Trump's higher-rate tariffs due to go into effect Wednesday and the EU also preparing to impose its own retaliatory tariffs. The EU reportedly plans to impose import duties of up to 25% on a range of US goods, including diamonds, motorbikes, luxury boats, domestic appliances, tobacco, poultry and many other agricultural products. -ABC News' Patrick Reevell\n\nRepublican senators on the Senate Finance Committee admonished U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer over President Donald Trump's position against offering exemptions to his sweeping tariffs. \"I'm somewhat disappointed to hear that exclusions of some of these things are-- are being ruled out at this point in time,\" said Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson. \"They're very specific situations that I think you ought to consider exclusions for because, I don't often agree with the members on the other side of the aisle, but in many cases here today, particularly when they're expressing concern about small businesses in their states, I'm hoping ... you and the president are very sensitive about companies potentially going bankrupt by these actions,\" Johnson continued.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, also largely focused his questions on exemptions. \"Whose throat do I get to choke if this proves to be wrong?\" Tillis asked Greer about the sweeping tariffs \"alla prima\" approach. \"Well, senator, you can certainly always talk to me,\" Greer said. -ABC News' Fritz Farrow\n\nSen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said at the Senate Finance Committee hearing with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer that an unnamed Wall Street executive he spoke to described the market situation on Tuesday as \"a good day in hospice.\" U.S. stocks rose at opening after days of tumbling, a recouping some losses as the Trump administration says it is beginning to negotiate tariffs with some nations.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Maggie Hassan asked U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer if President Donald Trump will reverse course on tariffs if they were to lead to 10% inflation. \"The president is fixed in his purpose,\" Greer responded as he said trade deficits have persisted for too long.\n\nHassan then posed another scenario: Would the administration reverse course if the tariffs contributed to a 50% stock market crash? Greer said he took issue with Hassan's hypotheticals, arguing they're \"not consistent with the history we have seen with tariffs.\" \"My hypotheticals are based on the fact that a lot of Americans are looking at their 401(k)s today and wondering how much of a lifestyle change they are going to have to have or whether they're going to be able to retire when they plan to because of the recklessness and haphazard nature of the Trump administration's imposition of tariffs,\" Hassan said.\n\nU.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer was asked what the administration's status is with China as it begins to negotiate with other countries. China said Tuesday it will fight the U.S. taxes \"to the end\" after announcing its own retaliatory tariffs. \"I see a distinct difference between those countries who have come to us and they said, 'We understand your issues, we understand the deficit, we understand your desire for reciprocity and we want to work with you on this' and the Chinese approach, which has been, 'We are going to retaliate,'\" Greer said. Greer said he doesn't think a deal with China is \"in the very near term.\"\n\nDemocratic Sen. Ron Wyden asked U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer if President Donald Trump's steeper \"reciprocal\" tariffs are still set to go into effect early Wednesday.\n\n\"Senator, yes, they're scheduled to go into effect. We are having negotiations with all kinds of counties at this time,\" Greer responded, arguing the \"national emergency\" declared by Trump on trade deficits is \"something we can't wait on anymore.\" \"So we will have the president's plan go into effect and we're coupling that with immediate negotiations with our partners,\" Greer said.\n\nU.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, in his opening statement before the Senate Finance Committee, defended Trump's tariff as the most significant trade policy change since allowing China to join the World Trade Organization. \"These measures are aimed squarely at achieving reciprocity and reducing our massive trade deficit to restore production in the United States,\" Greer said. Greer said the trade deficit the U.S. faces is decades in the making and \"will not be solved overnight but all of this in the right direction, particularly as we start to negotiate with these countries.\"\n\nU.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will be testifying on President Donald Trump's trade agenda before the Senate Finance Committee. Greer will be tasked with defending Trump's tariff policy after days of market fallout, though stocks rose on Tuesday at opening after the Trump administration said it would negotiate with some nations. Greer's appearance before the panel comes one day before the administration's more targeted \"reciprocal\" tariffs go into effect against nations they've deemed the worst offenders in trade relations with the U.S.\n\nABC News Chief White House Correspondent Mary Bruce asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Tuesday morning how soon he thinks deals can be made with other nations as some tariff negotiations begin. \"Well, we have one of the Vietnamese officials coming in this week,\" Bessent responded. \"The Japanese are very eager to get it over and I think you are going to see a couple of big trading partners do deals very quickly.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Monday, when asked if his tariffs were negotiable or permanent, told reporters \"they can both be true.\" \"We're going to get fair deals and good deals with every country. And if we don't, we're going to have nothing to do with them. They're not going to be allowed to participate in the United States,\" Trump said.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters Tuesday that President Donald Trump's latest tariff salvo \"does not reflect the willingness to have a serious dialogue.\" Asked if Beijing would negotiate with Washington in a bid to bring down U.S. tariffs -- now potentially rising to 104% if Trump imposes the additional 50% measures threatened Monday -- Lin said, \"If the United States really wants to talk, it should adopt an attitude of equality, respect and reciprocity.\"\n\n\"If the United States ignores the interests of the two countries and the international community and insists on fighting a tariff war and a trade war, China will definitely accompany it to the end,\" Lin added, as quoted by China's CCTV state media. Earlier on Tuesday, Lin said there could be \"no winner in the trade war and the tariff war, and there is no way out of protectionism.\" \"Pressure, threats and blackmail are not the right way to deal with China,\" Lin continued. \"China will take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.\" -ABC News' Karson Yiu"

See the most recent polls\n\nManage your account\n\nPresident Donald Trump's approval ratings dipped to a new second-term low following a week of sweeping decisions impacting global trade, the U.S. stock market, libraries and health research institutes, among others.\n\nThis week Trump announced the most significant increase in tariffs in U.S. history - a sweeping 10% reciprocal tariffs on most goods coming into the United States. The announcement sent shockwaves across the globe, and caused stock markets in the country to see the biggest drop since the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nThat same day, Trump 's approval rating fell to 43%, the lowest since his return to office, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found , showing signs of a souring in the American public's eye.\n\nThe public's disapproval has also been expressed beyond poll numbers. A mass protest was expected to take place on April 5 at hundreds of locations around the country.\n\nThe Trump administration was also continuing to revoke visas from university students , among them were eight Arizona State University students. Leaders with the Trump administration have come down against pro-Palestinian advocates in particular, calling them \" anti-American \" and saying the administration has the right to revoke the privilege of studying in the U.S.\n\nMoreover, on Wednesday night and Thursday morning, libraries across the country were informed that grants approved last year ‒ and in many cases already spent ‒ are being terminated. As a result, all work on approving federal grants for state, local and academic libraries was immediately halted.\n\nDemocratic attorneys general in several states, including Arizona, were suing the Trump administration over its cuts to libraries' funding as well as the cancellation of research grants for the National Institutes of Health , which the group said were critical for life-saving medical research .\n\nHere's what to know about Trump's approval rating, including how they are decided and how Trump's ratings compare with his first term and past presidents.\n\nHere are the latest approval ratings released about Trump's administration:\n\nAccording to the most recent Gallup poll , Trump's job approval rating was averaging 45% since he took office in this second term. His first term overall average was a 41% approval rating. At any given time during both terms thus far, his lowest to highest approval ratings have ranged between 34%-49%.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll from reported that, as of April 2, 43% of those surveyed gave him a favorable approval rating -a new low since he returned to office. There's also reporting that public approval of his current job so far has remained higher than his first term in office and higher than former President Joe Biden overall.\n\nThe Economist shows that 47% of people are favorable of Trump and 50% are unfavorable of him, according to the latest update from March 27.\n\nTrump had a final approval rating of 34% when he left office in 2021. His approval average during his first term was 41%.\n\nJoe Biden - 40%\n\nDonald Trump (first term) - 34%\n\nBarack Obama - 59%\n\nGeorge W. Bush - 34%\n\nBill Clinton - 66%\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush - 56%\n\nRonald Reagan - 63%\n\nJimmy Carter - 34%\n\nGerald Ford - 53%\n\nRichard Nixon - 24%\n\nData agency Gallup notes that these approval ratings are a \"simple measure, yet a very powerful one that has played a key role in politics for over 70 years.\"\n\nA president's approval rating reflects the percentage of Americans polled who approve of the president's performance. Anything can impact a president's rating, such as legislation passed, actions and elections.\n\nAccording to ABC News , an approval rating doesn't just represent how well the administration is doing for the general public, but could determine the outcome of an upcoming election for a politician or how much they get done during their time in office.\n\nWhile these ratings are easy to understand, Quorum says some analysts believe they are not as useful as they once were due to extreme partisanship and the polarized political climate.\n\n\"Presidential approval ratings have always been partisan, with members of the president's party offering more positive assessments than those in the opposing party,\" according to the Pew Research Center . \"But the differences between Republicans and Democrats on views of the president have grown substantially in recent decades.\"\n\nUSA TODAY Network reporter Maria Francis contributed to this article.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Arizona Republic: Donald Trump's approval rating: See the latest polls"

      "text": "What is Donald Trump's approval rating? Here are the latest polls from US, Colorado\n\nManage your account\n\nAnother eventful week has President Donald Trump losing a little ground in national surveys, even as he publicly muses about running for a third term in office.\n\nOver the past week, Trump kicked off a global trade war with a slew of new tariffs , federal agencies continued to lay off workers and his administration continues to ponder restrictions on funding for universities that it believes are not doing enough to prevent antisemitism. The moves have outraged the left, but the GOP has largely stayed in lockstep with him.\n\nNot all recent polls captured those events, but there are a handful of snapshots of Trump's job approval. Here's a look at Trump's performance in national and state polls:\n\nPolling continued to show a divided country, although the results split as to whether Trump had slightly more or slightly less approval for his job performance.\n\nThe Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Trump's lowest rating in the survey this term - 43% approval and 53% disapproval. The survey was taken between March 31 and April 2 from 1,486 adults.\n\nThe Economist/YouGov poll found Trump upside down on job approval, with 49% disapproval and 46% approval. The survey was taken March 30 to April 1 with a sample of 1,626 citizens.\n\nThe Harvard-Harris poll had Trump ahead, 49% approval to 46% disapproval in a sample of 2,746 registered voters over March 26 to 27.\n\nMore: Conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer hints at more Trump firings on her claims of 'disloyalty'\n\nIn an off year for elections and a state that has been solidly blue for several election cycles, Colorado has not seen much polling in 2025.\n\nIn the latest polling of Colorado by Civiqs , Trump's job approval climbed slightly to 39% approval and 57% disapproval, up from a 38%/60% split a week earlier. Drew Linzer, the director of Civiqs, told the USA TODAY Network the firm uses advanced and proprietary modeling to develop results from online surveys of around 200 to 250 registered voters daily across the country.\n\nUSA TODAY Network reporters continue to see small changes from the 2024 electoral map.\n\nIn South Dakota, Civiqs saw Trump with a 60% approval/38% disapproval rating for his job performance, based on surveys completed as of April 2.\n\nIn Michigan , a Marketing Resource Group poll found 51% of Michiganders disapprove of Trump's job performance, while 42% approved. The poll was taken conducted a poll in Michigan March 24-28 with a sample of 602 likely voters and a margin of error ± 4 percentage points.\n\nMore: Who is the richest person in Colorado? These familiar names sit on Forbes billionaire list\n\nIt's important to note that each pollster has their own methodology, with responses gathered online, over the phone, through the mail or in person - with some using a combination of methods. They also draw from different cohorts. Registered and likely voters are more likely to be surveyed near elections, while responses may come from all Americans between elections.\n\nThose variations can make it difficult to compare one poll to another, even from the same pollster at different parts of the political cycle.\n\nThe Pew Research Center , which has conducted public opinion polls for more than two decades , says good polls can \"give everyone in the population - regardless of their wealth, age, education, race, knowledge of politics or experience with it - an equal voice about the issues of the day.\"\n\nNate Trela covers trending news in Colorado and Utah for the USA TODAY Network.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fort Collins Coloradoan: Trump approval ratings: Here are latest polls from US, Colorado"

      "text": "How were Donald Trump's tariffs calculated?\n\nUS President Donald Trump has imposed a 10% tariff on goods from most countries being imported into the US, with even higher rates for what he calls the \"worst offenders\".\n\nBut how exactly were these tariffs -  essentially taxes on imports - worked out? BBC Verify has been looking at the calculations behind the numbers.\n\nWhen Trump presented a giant cardboard chart detailing the tariffs in the White House Rose Garden it was initially assumed that the charges were based on a combination of existing tariffs and other trade barriers (like regulations).\n\nBut later, the White House published what might look like a complicated mathematical formula .\n\nBut if you unpick the formula above it boils down to simple maths: take the trade deficit for the US in goods with a particular country, divide that by the total goods imports from that country and then divide that number by two.\n\nA trade deficit occurs when a country buys (imports) more physical products from other countries than it sells (exports) to them.\n\nFor example, the US buys more goods from China than it sells to them - there is a goods deficit of $295bn. The total amount of goods it buys from China is $440bn.\n\nDividing 295 by 440 gets you to 67% and you divide that by two and round up. Therefore the tariff imposed on China is 34%.\n\nSimilarly, when it applied to the EU, the White House's formula resulted in a 20% tariff.\n\nMany commentators have pointed out that these tariffs are not reciprocal.\n\nReciprocal would mean they were based on what countries already charge the US in the form of existing tariffs, plus non-tariff barriers (things like regulations that drive up costs).\n\nBut the White House's official methodology document makes clear that they have not calculated this for all the countries on which they have imposed tariffs.\n\nInstead the tariff rate was calculated on the basis that it would eliminate the US's goods trade deficit with each country.\n\nTrump has broken away from the formula in imposing tariffs on countries that buy more goods from the US than they sell to it.\n\nFor example the US does not currently run goods trade deficit with the UK. Yet the UK has been hit with a 10% tariff.\n\nIn total, more than 100 countries are covered by the new tariff regime.\n\nTrump believes the US is getting a bad deal in global trade. In his view, other countries flood US markets with cheap goods - which hurts US companies and costs jobs. At the same time, these countries are putting up barriers that make US products less competitive abroad.\n\nSo by using tariffs to eliminate trade deficits, Trump hopes to revive US manufacturing and protect jobs.\n\nBut will this new tariff regime achieve the desired outcome?\n\nBBC Verify has spoken to a number of economists. The overwhelming view is that while the tariffs might reduce the goods deficit between the US and individual countries, they will not reduce the overall deficit between the US and rest of the world.\n\n\"Yes, it will reduce bilateral trade deficits between the US and these countries. But there will obviously be lots of broader impacts that are not captured in the calculation\", says Professor Jonathan Portes of King's College, London.\n\nThat's because the US' existing overall deficit is not driven solely by trade barriers, but by how the US economy works.\n\nFor one, Americans spend and invest more than they earn and that gap means the US buys more from the world than it sells. So as long as that continues, the US may continue to keep running a deficit despite increasing tariffs with it global trading partners.\n\nSome trade deficits can also exist for a number of legitimate reasons - not just down to tariffs. For example, buying food that is easier or cheaper to produce in other countries' climates.\n\nThomas Sampson of the London School of Economics said: \"The formula is reverse engineered to rationalise charging tariffs on countries with which the US has a trade deficit. There is no economic rationale for doing this and it will cost the global economy dearly.\"\n\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nThe US president says he fears the Russian leader is \"tapping me along\" given Moscow's strikes on Kyiv earlier this week.\n\nThousands have gathered in Rome to pay their respects to the late pontiff.\n\nThere may be opportunities for impromptu diplomacy at one of the largest gatherings of world leaders in years.\n\nThe US president's envoy meets Vladimir Putin in Moscow, while Ukraine calls for more pressure on Russia.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

Sort of.\n\nThe closing figures might not have looked dramatic, but there were big swings throughout the day - a sign that investors are still feeling very nervous about how White House policies might play out.\n\nIn early morning, for example, the S&P jumped more than 5% in a matter of minutes, amid rumours of a possible pause, which the White House quickly denied.\n\n\"That is enormous,\" notes Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones indices, who says he's rarely seen such dramatic turns during his more than 40-year career on Wall Street.\n\n\"There's a lot of uncertainty here and that's what's driving the market.\"\n\nMike Mussio, president of FBB Capital, says the situation - which has sent the S&P 500 back to levels last seen roughly a year ago - was \"frustrating\" for investors.\n\n\"This feels like kind of an unforced error in terms of policy.\"\n\nThe three major US markets have now closed after a tumultuous day of trading.\n\nWhen they opened in New York earlier today, all three were significantly down. Now, the picture is less clear. Here's where things stood at 16:00 local time (21:00 GMT):\n\nTrump now says the US is \"making tremendous progress with a lot of countries\" over tariffs.\n\nThe countries that \"really took advantage of us are now saying please negotiate\", he tells reporters.\n\nThis is the \"only chance\" they have to reset trade, and they will come out \"unbelievably well\".\n\nTrump adds that it will help reopen factories in America and strengthen their economy.\n\n\"We're not taking care of our enemies anymore but we do take care of our friends.\"\n\nUS President Donald Trump says he is not considering a pause on new tariffs to allow for negotiations with other countries.\n\nEarlier, there were reports that Washington would impose a 90-day pause, these claims were promptly refuted by the White House who called it \"fake news\".\n\nAsked directly about a potential pause, he tells reporters in the Oval Office: \"We're not looking at that. We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and there are going to be fair deals.\"\n\nThe US president went on to reiterate his threat of additional 50% tariffs on Chinese goods if Beijing did not walk back from its retaliatory plans by tomorrow (Tuesday).\n\nWe've been hearing from the White House economic adviser, Stephen Miran, who encourages nations hoping to escape reciprocal US tariffs to make offers to US President Donald Trump.\n\nMiran says the president would welcome moves to lower barriers to US exports, according to the Reuters news agency.\n\nSpeaking at the Hudson Institute think-tank, Miran says he believes a range of US policies, including deregulation, would keep inflation under control.\n\nHis remarks come amid global markets volatility for another trading day.\n\nMore from Trump now in the White House.\n\nHe says there could be both permanent tariffs and negotiations.\n\nIf China doesn't pull back on its reciprocal tariffs by midday on Tuesday, Trump reiterates that he will raise tariffs against them by 50%.\n\n\"We have $36 trillion debt for a reason\", he adds, and they will be talking to China among other countries to make a \"fair deal and a good deal\" for America.\n\n\"It's now America first,\" Trump says.\n\nThis video can not be played\n\nWatch: Netanyahu says Israel will 'eliminate' trade deficit with US\n\nWe've just been hearing an update from President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who as we've been reporting have been meeting in the White House today.\n\nThe Israeli PM says they will eliminate the trade deficit with the US, adding he thinks it's the right thing to do.\n\nNetanyahu says that they intended to take down trade barriers and that Israel can be a model of other countries.\n\nHe says he recognises the problems the US has with the system as it currently stands.\n\nYou can follow the latest updates on Trump's meeting with Netanyahu in our other live page , currently being run by our colleagues in Washington DC and New York.\n\nNatalie Sherman New York business reporter\n\nWhen President Trump entered the White House in January, about two thirds of goods sent from China to the US were already facing tariffs, as a result of actions he took during his first term.\n\nHis moves then hit items like solar panels, washing machines and other kinds of machinery. But many key consumer products, like iPhones, toys, and clothing, had been spared.\n\nThat has not been true this time around.\n\nA cargo ship piled high with containers sails from Qingdao in China\n\nStarting in February, Trump put in place a new, 10% levy on\nall goods from the country, which he increased to 20% in March. It has left businesses like the toymakers I spoke to in March reeling.\n\nAnd that was before last week, when he said he would raise the tariff to another 34\npercentage points.\n\nSome key strategic items, such as pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and lumber, were spared from the tariffs that action.\n\nBut the announcement means the vast majority of imports from China - which accounted for more than $400bn in trade last year, making it America's top source of imports after the European Union and Mexico - are facing a\ntariff rate of at least 54% - which Trump has now threatened to raise\nagain by another 50 percentage points.\n\nA table showing all the new US tariffs on countries was unveiled by President Trump on Wednesday\n\nFurther countries have been reaching out to the US in order to reach a deal before higher custom tariffs on roughly 60 nations are due start on Wednesday 9 April.\n\nBangladesh's interim leader Muhammad Yunus has written a letter to US President Donald Trump to ask for a three-month pause to the tariffs he has imposed on them, a statement from their government said on Monday.\n\nLast week, the US announced 37% tariffs on the country, which is the world's second largest garment manufacturer.\n\nIn the letter, Yunus also said his country \"will take all necessary actions to fully support [Trump's] trade agenda\".\n\nMeanwhile, Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has said he held a call with Trump in which \"both sides decided to designate cabinet members to take charge and continue discussions\". Currently, Japan faces 26% tariffs.\n\nUS Trade Representative Jamieson Greer is due to tell the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday that nearly 50 countries have reached out to him to discuss the new tariffs, according to a written testimony seen by Reuters news agency.\n\nGreer says Argentina, Vietnam and Israel are among these nations.\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says he has been tasked with opening trade negotiations with Japan \"following a very constructive phone discussion\" between both governments.\n\n\"Japan remains among Americaâs closest allies, and I look forward to our upcoming productive engagement regarding tariffs, non-tariff trade barriers, currency issues, and government subsidies,\" he writes in a post on social media platform X.\n\nBessent repeats his previous comments about over 50 countries reaching out to Trump in the past few days to engage in negotiations.\n\n\"We look forward to meaningful negotiations with them over the coming weeks,\" he adds.\n\nBy\nLucy Gilder\n\nIn\nresponse to sharp falls on global markets following his tariff announcements,\nPresident Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, earlier to praise the state of the US\neconomy.\n\nâOil\nprices are down, interest rates are downâ¦ food prices are down, there is NO\nINFLATION,â he wrote.\n\nItâs\ntrue that global oil prices , external have fallen steeply since the tariffs were\nannounced and interest rates on 30-year and 15-year fixed rate mortgages are\ndown too.\n\nLast month, food prices rose slightly â up by 0.2% â which\nwas a slower increase than the previous month.\n\nOverall inflation currently stands at 2.8% , external , down slightly from former President Bidenâs last month in office.\n\nMaros Sefcovic\n\nWhile we've been reporting on events in the US, EU trade ministers have been meeting in Luxembourg today to discuss how they will move forward.\n\nAs a reminder, the EU is facing a higher tariff rate of 20% after having been dubbed one of the \"worst offenders\" by Donald Trump.\n\nToday, European Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security Maros\nSefcovic says the EU is \"prepared to use every tool in our trade defence arsenal to protect [the] EU single market\".\n\nIrish Trade Minister Simon Harris has called today's meeting \"really useful\" as he underlines that unity within the group is \"extremely strong\".\n\nEarlier, we touched on some of the comments from the bloc's chief, Ursula von der Leyen , who says the EU is \"always ready for a good deal\".\n\nAnthony Zurcher Reporting from the White House\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu is visiting the White House right now, just four days after\nDonald Trump shocked the global economy with his aggressive tariff announcement\nâ which includes 17% on Israeli exports to America.\n\nThis meeting gives the Israeli prime minister a chance to make an\nin-person case that those tariffs should be lower.\n\nIsrael recently dropped its own tariffs on American imports,\nalthough that move did not prevent it from being targeted in the presidentâs\nnew trade policy.\n\nIf Trump is willing to listen â and cut a deal with Israel -\nit could provide an early example of how, through concessions and personal\nappeals, a country could extricate itself from the ongoing American trade\nwarfare.\n\nIf thereâs some kind of big announcement,\nhowever, it wonât happen in a formal press conference. The one scheduled for\nthis afternoon was cancelled by the White House â without explanation â about\nan hour before its scheduled start time.\n\nInstead, the two men will answer\nquestions from the smaller press pool during their sit-down in the Oval Office.\n\nThe White House has said more than 50 world leaders have reached\nout to Trump in the past few days to engage in negotiations. With just two days\nuntil those US tariffs go into effect, they are sure to be watching closely to\nsee if anything concrete comes from todayâs US-Israel talks â and what lessons\nthey can learn from them.\n\nWhen did this start? After Trump announced a large increase in US tariffs last Wednesday.\n\nAnd a tariff is... A tax paid to the government to bring goods into the country. Most countries have some tariffs. The US's were relatively low, but Trump has increased them significantly.\n\nWhy did he do this? Trump's been saying he wants to do this for decades. The US buys more physical goods than it sells, and he claims this is unfair and threatens security. Tariffs, he says, will bring more jobs to the US.\n\nBut most experts disagree... Most economists argue trade barriers such as tariffs reduce growth, and that such a quick and dramatic shift in tariff policy will make trade and investment harder.\n\nAnd how do other countries feel? Not great. Many have threatened to retaliate by increasing tariffs on US goods entering their countries.\n\nThis affects stock markets because... Companies are facing higher costs to move their products across the world. There's also great uncertainty - it's not clear what Trump, or the countries he's putting tariffs on, will do next, making investment decisions more challenging.\n\nAnd stocks are what exactly? To own a stock is to own a share of a company - the more you have, the more of the company you own. A stock market is where people buy and sell these shares. So when a stock market index falls, it means the value of those companies have dropped.\n\nMitchell Labiak BBC Business reporter\n\nThe FTSE 100 has just had three pretty awful days of trading.\n\nOn Thursday, investors in the UKâs biggest listed firms began to react to what Trumpâs tariffs will mean for them. Shares continued to slip on Friday and today.\n\nAll told, the index has recorded a 10.5% slump since 'Liberation Day' - wiping out just shy of Â£250bn in value.\n\nThat may sound mind-boggling, but for context it means the FTSE 100 is now back where it was around this time last year. So the loss is significant, but pension funds invested in the FTSE 100 over the long term shouldnât be too hurt.\n\nAnd investors are always keen to pour back in if they sense good news.\n\nThe index saw a spike this afternoon after reports that Trump was considering a 90-day pause to the tariffs, but that turned out to be false .\n\nMexico wants to avoid imposing reciprocal tariffs on US goods but it does not rule it out, President Claudia Sheinbaum says.\n\nSheinbaum says that her country wants to continue talks with Washington before taking on any other measures, whilst protecting Mexican industries and companies.\n\nMexico and Canada were spared the further tariffs announced for most other economies on 2 April.

      "text": "Trump's tariffs are a longtime goal fulfilled - and his biggest gamble yet\n\nDonald Trump's politics have shifted considerably over his decades in the public sphere. But one thing he has been consistent on, since the 1980s, is his belief that tariffs are an effective means of boosting the US economy.\n\nNow, he's staking his presidency on his being right.\n\nAt his Rose Garden event at the White House, surrounded by friends, conservative politicians and cabinet secretaries, Trump announced sweeping new tariffs on a broad range of countries - allies, competitors and adversaries alike.\n\nIn a speech that was equal parts celebration and self-congratulation, regularly punctuated by applause from the crowd, the president recalled his longtime support of tariffs, as well as his early criticism of free trade agreements like Nafta and the World Trade Organization.\n\nThe president acknowledged that he will face pushback in the coming days from \"globalists\" and \"special interests\", but he urged Americans to trust his instincts.\n\n\"Never forget, every prediction our opponents made about trade for the last 30 years has been proven totally wrong,\" he said.\n\nNow, in a second term in which he is surrounded by like-minded advisers and is the dominant force in a Republican Party that controls both chambers of Congress, Trump is in a position to turn his vision of a new America-focused trade policy into reality. These policies, he said, had made the United States into a wealthy nation more than a century ago and would again.\n\n\"For years, hard working American citizens were forced to sit on the sidelines as other nations got rich and powerful, much of it at our expense,\" he said. \"With today's action, we are finally going to be able to make America great again - greater than ever before.\"\n\nIt is still an enormous risk for this president to take.\n\nEconomists of all stripes warn that these massive tariffs - 53% on China, 20% on the European Union and South Korea, with a 10% baseline on all nations - will be passed along to American consumers, raising prices and threatening a global recession.\n\nKen Rogoff, the former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, predicted that the chances of the US, the world's largest economy, falling into recession had risen to 50% on the back of this announcement.\n\n\"He just dropped a nuclear bomb on the global trading system,\" Mr Rogoff told the BBC World Service, adding that the consequences for this level of taxes on imports into the US \"is just mind-boggling\".\n\nTrump's move also risks escalating a trade war with other countries and alienating allies that America has otherwise tried to strengthen ties with. The US, for instance, sees Japan and South Korea as a bulwark against Chinese expansionist ambitions. But those three countries recently announced that they would work together to respond to America's trade policies.\n\nIf Trump is successful, however, he would fundamentally reshape a global economic order that America had originally helped to construct from the ashes of World War 2. He promises that this will rebuild American manufacturing, create new sources of revenue, and make America more self-reliant and insulated from the kind of global supply chain shocks that wreaked havoc on the US during the Covid pandemic.\n\nIt's a tall order - and one that many believe to be highly unrealistic. But for a president who seems fixated on cementing his legacy, whether through ending wars, renaming geographic locations, acquiring new territory or dismantling federal programmes and its workforce, this is the biggest, most consequential prize to be won.\n\nIt would be, he styled, America's \"liberation day\".\n\nWhat appears clear, however, is that Wednesday's announcement, if he follows through, is almost certain to mark a historic change. The question is whether it will be a legacy of achievement or one of notoriety.\n\nTrump's speech was triumphant - one that belied the potentially high costs his moves would impose on the American economy and on his own political standing.\n\nBut, he said, it was worth it - even if, at the very end of his remarks, a small shadow of presidential doubt may have peeked through the bravado.\n\n\"It's going to be a day that - hopefully - you're going to look back in years to come and you're going to say, you know, he was right.\"\n\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

      "text": "Americans could pay more for these everyday basics under Trump's new tariffs\n\nDonald Trump's plan to impose tariffs - or import taxes - for nearly every country in the world could push prices up on almost all the staples Americans routinely buy, from clothes to coffee.\n\nAfter declaring a national economic emergency on Wednesday, the US president announced new tariffs on billions of dollars of goods of at least 10%. For countries he has deemed the \"worst offenders\", the rates can go as high as 50%. They start taking effect on 5 April.\n\nEconomists have warned the new levies - and those that other countries impose in retaliation - could push prices up for Americans across the board, and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has said that they will increase inflation.\n\nThat's because the companies importing the goods may pass the costs of the tariffs on to customers or simply bring fewer products into the country, creating a limited supply.\n\nHere are six everyday items that could become more expensive for American consumers.\n\nThe \"worst offenders\" about to be hit with the highest tariffs include the clothing manufacturing hubs of Vietnam, China and Bangladesh. The three - among the top five largest apparel importers to the US - could soon see levies ranging from 34% to 46% charged on their products.\n\nThat means major US department stores like Target and Walmart, where Americans often turn for affordable clothing, and some familiar apparel brands may feel the pressure.\n\nThe Gap, an American clothing retailer that also operates Old Navy, Banana Republic and Athleta, sources about 21% of its clothing from Vietnam, according to an analysis by Prof Sheng Lu at the University of Delaware's Fashion & Apparel Studies department. Another 37% of its clothing comes from India, Indonesia and Bangladesh.\n\nH&M, known for its inexpensive fashions, manufactures most of its clothing in China and Bangladesh.\n\nThe tariffs could bring an \"unfair burden to American families, particularly lower-income households\", warned the US Fashion Industry Association in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nVietnam is open to working out a deal with the administration to avoid the tariffs, Trump has said. China, on the other hand, has retaliated with its own steep levies.\n\nAlmost all of the coffee consumed in the US comes from outside the country, meaning it could soon become a bigger burden on Americans' wallets.\n\nThe US mostly sources its coffee from Brazil and Colombia, which are subject to the baseline 10% tariffs. Vietnam is also a key exporter of certain varieties.\n\nWalter Haas, owner of San Francisco-based coffee roastery Graffeo, told the Washington Post that once tariffs hit, his company will feel it \"immediately\".\n\nIf they remain in place, those cost increases will be \"permanently baked into the price consumers pay\", he added.\n\nOther imported foods could similarly rise in price, especially those coming from European Union nations, who will all be hit by a 20% tariff. Prices of shelf staples such as olive oil, which is primarily imported from Italy, Spain and Greece, could rise further.\n\nShoes and trainers, among the most basic necessities and also one of Americans' biggest splurges, could become more expensive, including the popular Nike Air Force 1 and Adidas Samba trainers. Both sportswear companies rely heavily on Asian factory hubs for their inventories.\n\nAbout half of Nike and 39% of Adidas trainers are made in Vietnam.\n\nIn 2024, the US imported more than $27bn of footwear, mostly from China and Vietnam, which was subject to tariffs of about $3bn, according to data by Prof Lu.\n\nNow, that tax amount could nearly triple.\n\nUBS analysts told Reuters that, all in all, retailers may not be able to fully swallow the costs, and would need to raise prices by 10% to 12% to offset the levies on Vietnamese manufacturers.\n\nFrance is one of the biggest foreign suppliers of wine to the US, and its winemakers have expressed anxiety about what the 20% EU tariffs will mean for their business.\n\nThe Bourgogne Wine Board, which represents producers in the French region of Burgundy, said the US tariffs would deliver \"a serious blow\" to both exporters and American consumers.\n\n\"The risk with these additional tariffs is that they could push our wines past a psychological price threshold,\" warned Laurent Delaunay, president of the Bourgogne Wine Board - meaning above what buyers feel comfortable paying.\n\nPrice increases could be seen at restaurants, especially for imported beers or drinks using foreign spirits. Separately, Trump expanded an aluminium tariff to include all canned beer, which could also make it more expensive for those who stay home.\n\nUBS analysts told Reuters that large alcohol sellers would have to hike prices up to 5% to cover the tariffs if they choose not to absorb the costs themselves.\n\nCell phones, TVs and video game consoles tend to be big-ticket purchases, and the latest US tariffs could make them even bigger.\n\nChina, as well as Taiwan and South Korea, are all top exporters of electronics to the US.\n\nAlmost all iPhones are made in China, although some are also made in India (which, too, is on the \"worst offenders\" list with a 26% tariff). Samsung, meanwhile, has significant production operations in Vietnam.\n\nIt's still unclear how these major tech companies will respond to the new levies. But Japanese video gaming company Nintendo announced on Friday that it is delaying pre-orders of its Switch 2 console, saying it needs to \"assess the potential impact of tariffs.\"\n\nAmericans may soon find that loading up fast-fashion hauls from Chinese online retailers like Temu or Shein with a few swipes on their phones has gotten more expensive.\n\nAlong with imposing the country-level tariffs, Trump has signed an executive order ending an exemption that prevented charging the levies on small-dollar shipments from China.\n\nThe exemption is referred to as the \"de minimis\" loophole, and it had allowed shipments under $800 (£620) to enter the US duty-free. Experts say it was a big reason why Temu and Shein were able to keep their costs low.\n\nThe order means those companies may have to pay taxes for the first time on the clothes they often send directly to customers.\n\nIt is unclear just how much costs for these goods could rise with the elimination of the loophole, but the White House says small shipments sent to the US through the international postal network could be subject to a tax of \"either 30% of their value, or $25 per item.\"\n\nThat tax would then increase to $50 per item after 1 June, according to the White House.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nThe US president says he fears the Russian leader is \"tapping me along\" given Moscow's strikes on Kyiv earlier this week.\n\nThe prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein and the Duke of York has died at the age of 41.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "World leaders criticise Trump tariffs as 'major blow'\n\nDonald Trump's decision to impose new tariffs on all goods entering the US is a \"major blow to the world economy\", European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen has said.\n\nHer comments echo those of a number of other countries, including China, which has expressed its opposition to the move and has warned it will take \"resolute countermeasures\" against the US.\n\nTheir words of warning come after Trump announced a universal 10% tariff on all imports into the US from 5 April. Around 60 countries will also be hit with steeper tariffs from 9 April.\n\nThe US president said the measures were payback for unfair trade policies, adding that he had been \"very kind\" in his decisions.\n\nTrump has said the tariffs will be used to boost US manufacturing, saying on Wednesday that the move would \"make America wealthy again\".\n\nGiving a statement on Thursday morning, von der Leyen said the new tax imports will see \"uncertainty spiral\", causing \"dire\" consequences \"for millions of people around the globe\".\n\nShe emphasised the impact on the most vulnerable countries, pointing out that several of those nations are now subject to some of the highest US tariffs.\n\nVon der Leyen vowed that Europe would take a unified approach and warned that the European Union - which will be subject to a 20% tariff - is preparing countermeasures in case negotiations fail.\n\n\"If you take on one of us, you take on all of us\", she said.\n\nNegotiations between different EU member states will begin next week, Bernd Lange, who chairs the European Parliament's Committee on International Trade said.\n\nItaly's Giorgia Meloni, a Trump ally, said the decision was \"wrong\" but that she would work towards a deal with the US to \"prevent a trade war\".\n\nHer Spanish counterpart Pedro Sánchez said Spain would \"continue to be committed to an open world\", while in Ireland, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said Trump's decision was \"deeply regrettable\" and benefitted no-one.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has called the tariffs a \"brutal and unfounded decision\" that will have a \"massive impact\" on the European economy, adding that the US economy and consumers will emerge \"poorer and weaker\".\n\nGovernment spokeswoman Sophie Primas said that France was \"ready for this trade war\".\n\nPoland's leader Donald Tusk said the tariffs could cost his country losses of more than 10 billion zloty (£2bn; $2.6bn) and called it a \"severe and unpleasant blow\" on X.\n\nHungary , meanwhile, has laid blame for the tariffs on the EU, of which it is a member state.\n\nForeign Minister Peter Szijjarto urged the EU to \"get its act together\", lower its own tariffs on the US automotive industry and negotiate, warning if the situation continued it \"will be another blow to the European community\".\n\nUkraine's Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said his country was \"working to secure better terms\", adding it has \"much to offer\".\n\nOutside of Europe, China -  one of the countries deemed the \"worst offenders\" by the US president - was hit with a 34% tariff on goods, on top of an existing 20% levy, bringing total duties to at least 54%.\n\nThe ministry of commerce urged the US to \"immediately cancel\" the tariffs, adding that China would \"resolutely take countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests.\"\n\nTaiwan , which is set to face a 32% tariff for exports to the US, called the move \"highly unreasonable\".\n\nPremier Cho Jung-tai also said it would make \"serious representations\" to the US.\n\nSouth Korean acting President Han Duck-soo said the global trade war \"has become a reality\" and his government would be looking at ways to \"overcome the trade crisis\" after the East Asian country was hit with a 25% rate.\n\nJapan said its 24% levy was \"extremely regrettable\" and could violate World Trade Organization and US-Japan agreements, while Thailand said it would negotiate its 36% tariff.\n\nVietnam's Prime Minister Ông Phạm Minh Chính said he was setting up a task force to deal with the US tariffs.\n\nEconomic officials in Israel , which had scrapped all tariffs on American imports ahead of the announcement, were said to be in \"complete shock\" over its 17% tariff, local media reported.\n\n\"We were sure that the decision to completely cancel tariffs on imports from the US would prevent this move\", an official told local media.\n\nWhite House officials said its levies were reciprocal to countries, such as China, which it said charge higher tariffs on US goods, impose \"non-tariff\" barriers to US trade or have otherwise acted in ways the government feels undermine American economic goals.\n\nLeaders from countries subject to the 10% baseline rate have also reacted to Trump's measures, with Australia's Anthony Albanese saying Americans would end up paying the biggest price for what he called \"unjustified tariffs\".\n\nHis government will not impose reciprocal measures, he said, adding: \"We will not join a race to the bottom that leads to higher prices and slower growth\".\n\nA Downing Street source told the BBC that the UK's lower tariff \"vindicates\" the government's recent efforts towards a trade deal with the US.\n\nOn Thursday, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer reiterated that he would \"fight\" to secure a trade deal with the US but added that the government would respond with \"cool and calm heads\".\n\nLater, his business secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the UK was drawing up a list of US products that the UK could impose retaliatory taxes on if necessary. He added it would be consulting businesses on the possible action up until 1 May.\n\nIn Latin America, its biggest economy, Brazil , approved a law in congress on Wednesday - the Economic Reciprocity Law - to counter the 10% tariff imposed by Trump.\n\nThe foreign ministry said it would evaluate \"all possible actions to ensure reciprocity in bilateral trade, including resorting to the World Trade Organization\".\n\nShortly after Trump's announcement, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned countries not to \"retaliate\" and \"sit back, take it in\".\n\n\"Because if you retaliate, there will be escalation\", he told Fox News.\n\nNoticeably, the US's two biggest trade partners, Canada and Mexico , were not mentioned in Wednesday's announcements.\n\nRegardless, Canada will still be impacted by the tariffs, Prime Minister Mark Carney said. Measures such as the 25% tariff on automobiles starting at midnight on Thursday would \"directly affect millions of Canadians\", he added.\n\nHe vowed to \"fight these tariffs with counter measures\", adding that the US levies would \"fundamentally change the global trading system.\"\n\nRussia , and its ally North Korea , were also not seen on the list of countries to face new tariffs.\n\nThe White House said it would deal with both countries according to previous executive orders , which imposed 25% tariffs on the two nations as part of efforts to address fentanyl and border issues.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nThe US president says he fears the Russian leader is \"tapping me along\" given Moscow's strikes on Kyiv earlier this week.\n\nThe Bolsonaro supporter, who drew in lipstick on a statue during riots, has been jailed for taking part in an alleged coup\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Tariffs have shaken the markets - how worried should we be?\n\nThe sharp fall in stock markets across the world shows no sign of letting up after the US imposition of sweeping and swingeing tariffs and many are asking does this qualify as a stock market \"crash\" and what that could mean for them?\n\nThe word crash has been used sparingly over the decades and is usually reserved for a fall of over 20% from a recent peak in a day, or over the course of a couple of days.\n\nOn 19 October, 1987 - also known as Black Monday - the US stock market lost 23% of its value in a single day, and other stock markets had similar falls.\n\nThat was most definitely a crash.\n\nIn 1929, the US stock market lost over 20% of its value in two days - and 50% within three weeks. That was the famous Wall Street Crash that ushered in the great depression of the 1930s.\n\nBy comparison, the US stock market has lost around 17% of its value from its peak in February and is now down 2% from where it was this time last year.\n\nThe UK FTSE index has fallen sharply though not by as much.\n\nThis is partly because it closes earlier than New York, and so it often plays catch up with whatever happens in the US the next morning.\n\nFollow live updates\n\nNevertheless, these are the biggest and quickest declines we have seen in world markets since they were gripped by the panic of Covid-19 in early 2020.\n\nA decline of 20% from a peak is considered a \"bear market\" - a description of a market that appears to be more likely to go down than go up. We are very close to that description right now.\n\nWhile many people own stocks and shares directly, most people's exposure to stock markets come through their pension plans. There are two types - defined benefit schemes which guarantee a fixed pension income, and defined contribution where your pension pot rises and falls with financial markets.\n\nThat may sound like defined contribution plans are very vulnerable to this sell off - but not all of your contributions go into shares. Much of the money goes into safer investments such as government bonds. These tend to increase in value when stock markets fall as they are seen as a \"safe haven\" along with other assets such as gold.\n\nThat is exactly what has happened here.\n\nGovernment bonds have risen in value and that can offset some or all of the fall in shares depending on how your pension savings are allocated.\n\nThe closer to retirement you are, the higher percentage of your pension pot is likely to be invested in bonds - so the less affected you will be.\n\nThere have been many falls like this in the decades since the Wall Street Crash but in the long term, shares have turned out to be a good investment - and pension savings is a long term game.\n\nIt does matter. A company's share value is a measure of how profitable those companies are expected to be in the future. A plummeting market is an indication that most people think that most companies are likely to see their profits fall.\n\nThe markets believe that US President Donald Trump's tariff bombshell is expected to raise prices, lower demand and reduce profits, making companies less valuable and more inclined to cut investment and jobs.\n\nSo the real warning sign here is not about the value of your pension but about the health of the economy in which we live and work.\n\nFalls like this sometimes, often even, herald an economic downturn. That is more of a worry than the value of your pension, which has seen and will see volatility like this over the years.\n\nBut that's not to say this is not a very big moment for the world economy.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

He sees the sweeping new import duties as the starting point for a negotiation which could last several months.\n\n\"Maybe almost 70\" countries have reached out to the White House about negotiating tariffs, Bessent said on Fox Business, including Japan, whose Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba spoke to Trump on Monday.\n\nBessent expects Japan to \"get priority\" in negotiations in exchange for having come to the table quickly.\n\n\"It's going to be a busy April, May, maybe into June,\" he said.\n\n-Jesse Pound\n\nCorrection: Bessent spoke on Fox Business. An earlier version misstated the network he appeared on.\n\nElon Musk's younger brother harshly criticized Trump's tariffs , calling them a \"structural, permanent tax on the American consumer.\"\n\nKimbal Musk , who is a Tesla board member, also said in a tweet that Trump appears to be the \"most high tax American President in generations.\"\n\n\"Even if he is successful in bringing jobs on shore through the tariff tax, prices will remain high and the tax on consumption will remain the form of higher prices because we are simply not as good at making things,\" Kimbal Musk wrote.\n\nTesla, in a recent letter to the U.S. Trade Representative, warned of the potential effect on its bottom line of retaliatory tariffs from countries affected by Trump's tariffs.\n\nElon Musk is the CEO of Tesla, as well as the de facto head of DOGE, the Trump administration's project to slash federal spending.\n\n-- Lora Kolodny\n\nApple shares continued to get hammered, losing 3.7% as concerns mounted that the company would take a major hit from President Trump's tariffs .\n\nMonday's selloff brings Apple's three-day rout to 19%, a downdraft that's wiped out $638 billion in market cap .\n\nAnalysts say that Apple is one of the most exposed companies to a trade war, partially due to its reliance on China for manufacturing its computers and accessories. Although Apple has production in India, Vietnam, and Thailand, those countries also face increased tariffs as part of Trump's sweeping plan.\n\nAnalysts say Apple will likely either need to raise prices or eat additional tariff costs when the new duties come into effect. UBS analysts estimated on Monday that Apple's highest-end iPhone could rise in price by about $350, or around 30%, from its current price of $1,199.\n\n- Kif Leswing\n\nTrump is rejecting the European Union's offer of \"zero-for-zero\" tariffs with the U.S. for industrial goods.\n\n\"No, it's not,\" Trump said in the Oval Office when asked if the deal, which European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen floated earlier Monday, was enough.\n\n\"They're screwing us on trade,\" Trump said, criticizing the EU and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO.\n\nTwo Republican senators, Mike Lee of Utah and Wisconsin's Ron Johnson, have encouraged Trump to take von der Leyen's deal.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nA warning against retaliation tops a list of five steps countries can take to reduce the burden on the United States from the dollar being the world's reserve currency, the head of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers said.\n\nCEA Chair Stephen Miran, speaking at a Hudson Institute event, said that the U.S. dollar and Treasury securities \"make possible the global trading and financial system which has supported the greatest era of prosperity mankind has ever known.\"\n\nBut that, and the U.S. security umbrella, \"are costly for us to provide,\" Miran said.\n\n\"The best outcome is one in which America continues to create global peace and prosperity and remain the reserve provider, and other countries not only participate in reaping the benefits, but they also participate in bearing the costs,\" he said.\n\nHere are the five options for burden sharing Miran suggests:\n\nIsrael Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country will \"eliminate the trade deficit with the United States.\"\n\n\"We're going to also eliminate trade barriers, a variety of trade barriers, that have been put up unnecessarily,\" Netanyahu said in the Oval Office.\n\nTrump last week announced a 17% tariff on Israel , even after the Middle East ally said it would scrap its own tariffs on U.S. goods.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nThe White House is prepared to hold \"meaningful negotiations\" in the coming weeks with some of the more than 50 countries that have responded \"positively\" to Trump's tariffs, Bessent says in an X post.\n\nThe treasury secretary draws a contrast between these countries and China, which he claims has \"chosen to isolate itself by retaliating and doubling down on previous negative behavior.\"\n\n- Erin Doherty\n\nU.S. oil prices fell about 2% on Monday, adding to last week's steep losses on fears President Donald Trump's global tariffs would push the U.S., and maybe the world, into a recession.\n\nU.S .crude oil fell $1.29, or 2.08%, to close at $60.70 per barrel, while Brent lost $1.37, or 2.09%, to settle at $64.21. The latest price action comes after U.S. crude and Brent closed down more than 10% last week.\n\nFutures tied to U.S. West Texas intermediate crude hit a session low of $58.95 per barrel, the lowest level since 2021. Global benchmark Brent fell to an intraday low of $62.51.\n\n- Spencer Kimball\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will negotiate with Japan on Trump's tariffs, Bessent says in a new X post.\n\n\"Japan remains among America's closest allies, and I look forward to our upcoming productive engagement regarding tariffs, non-tariff trade barriers, currency issues, and government subsidies,\" Bessent writes .\n\nThe Japanese government's \"outreach and measured approach\" are appreciated, he adds.\n\n- Erin Doherty\n\nPrices of cars and trucks are expected to rise as a result of Trump's tariffs, according to a new analysis from industry experts at Cox Automotive.\n\nThe firm expects the already implemented 25% tariffs on imported vehicles and upcoming 25% levies on auto parts will add thousands of dollars to the costs of imported and domestic vehicles.\n\n\"We expect to see declining discounting and then accelerated price increases as the tariffs are passed through and supply tightens, leading to price increases on all types of most new vehicles,\" Cox Automotive Chief Economist Jonathan Smoke said. \"Over the longer term, we expect production sales to fall, newly used prices to increase, and some models to be eliminated.\"\n\nWhile the tariffs do not directly impact used car sales, changes in new vehicle prices, production and demand affect the used car market, which is how the majority of Americans purchase a vehicle.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n- Michael Wayland and Michele Luhn\n\nThe White House canceled a press conference with Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\n\nThe event had been scheduled for 2:30 p.m. ET.\n\nA meeting between Trump and Netanyahu at 2 p.m. will proceed as planned, the White House said. Reporters will be admitted into the Oval Office for that event.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink says that most other chief executives he speaks with \"would say we are probably in a recession right now.\"\n\nFink also says that he could see stock markets falling by another 20%.\n\n\"One CEO specifically said the airline industry is a proverbial bird in a coal mine - canary in the coal mine - and I was told that the canary is sick already,\" Fink said during an event at the Economic Club of New York.\n\n- Jesse Pound and Dan Mangan\n\nTrump plans to veto a bipartisan bill that would give Congress a say on his tariffs if it lands on his desk.\n\nThe White House's Office of Management and Budget, in a statement, said it strongly opposes the bill because it would \"severely constrain\" Trump's power to \"respond to national emergencies and foreign threats.\"\n\nThe legislation, dubbed the Trade Review Act of 2025, would empower Congress to either approve Trump's new tariffs or let them expire. Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., sponsored the bill.\n\nIf the act passes both chambers of Congress, Trump \"would veto the bill,\" OMB said.\n\nTrump previously vowed to veto a different bill that would effectively undo the tariffs he imposed on Canadian imports. The Senate approved that bill with the help of four Republican votes.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nTrump ordered the proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon Steel to undergo a new review after the deal was blocked by President Joe Biden .\n\nTrump directed the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to review the acquisition again to assist \"in determining whether further action in this matter may be appropriate,\" according to a presidential action issued by the White House.\n\nU.S. Steel shares spiked about 9% in reaction to the decision.\n\n- Spencer Kimball\n\nRestaurant stocks fell in afternoon trading as investors worry that the Trump tariffs will weigh on consumer spending.\n\nInvestors pulled back across restaurant segments, from fast food to full-service dining.\n\nShares of Starbucks fell more than 3%, following a downgrade to neutral from Baird, citing near-term economic headwinds. The coffee chain, which is already attempting to turn around its U.S. business, has seen its shares sink nearly 20% since Trump unveiled the new tariffs.\n\n\"Explanations for the drawdown we heard included higher coffee costs from tariffs, anti-American sentiment, and recession risk,\" Bank of America Securities analyst Sara Senatore wrote in a research note on Saturday.\n\nRead the full story.\n\n- Amelia Lucas\n\nU.S. airlines are expected to cut their outlooks for the year when they report earnings starting this week, analysts say.\n\nThe industry is seeing cracks in demand for travel. And airline stocks have fallen as investor concerns have grown about Trump's tariff policies, among other things.\n\n\"The level of sell-off is worse than the reality right now, but it doesn't necessarily mean it won't be the reality six months from now,\" Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said.\n\nTD Cowen, in a note Friday wrote, \"We expect a world of slower growth, higher inflation, and a more isolationist U.S. to significantly disrupt the competitive environment for airlines.\"\n\n\"We are concerned that the new economic paradigm causes another structural leg down in corporate travel while the negative wealth effect further dampens consumption, especially by Baby Boomers,\" TD Cowen said.\n\n- Leslie Josephs and Michele Luhn\n\nA large majority of CEOs surveyed by CNBC - 69% - said they expect a recession on the heels of Trump's sweeping, market-rupturing tariff plans announced last week.\n\nAnd more than half of them said they expect that the downturn will come this year.\n\n\"This is the Trump recession,\" said one of the 22 CEOs who received the flash survey.\n\n\"Disappointingly stupid and illogical,\" another CEO said of the tariffs.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nWhite House trade advisor Peter Navarro said that countries would have to do more than just reduce their tariffs on U.S. imports to zero for the Trump administration to back off its trade policy.\n\n\"Let's take Vietnam. When they come to us and say 'we'll go to zero tariffs,' that means nothing to us because it's the nontariff cheating that matters,\" Navarro said on CNBC's \" Squawk Box .\"\n\nThose nontariff policies include a value-added tax and the routing of Chinese products through Vietnam, Navarro said.\n\nTrump said in a Truth Social post on Friday that To Lam, general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, had offered to cut tariffs on U.S. products to zero. Later in the interview, Navarro described that offer as a \"small first start.\"\n\n- Jesse Pound\n\nTech stocks wobbled after Trump stood by his sweeping global tariff plans.\n\nApple shares have tumbled more than 5%, Tesla shares are down about 4% and Microsoft shares have slipped more than 1%. Shares of Google are mostly flat, but Amazon , Nvidia and Meta are all up around 1%.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks collectively shed more than $1.8 trillion in market value during a two-day market selloff last week. The Nasdaq Composite recorded its worst week since the onset of the pandemic and entered a bear market.\n\n--Ashley Capoot and Samantha Subin\n\nTrump is not concerned about the optics of him golfing over the weekend as stock markets fall on his tariff strategy, a White House official told NBC News.\n\nTrump's golf rounds in Florida are like \"going to a birthday party after a friend has had surgery,\" the official said.\n\n\"The economy will be fine,\" the official said.\n\n- Dan Mangan\n\nTrump is threatening to jack up tariffs on China by an additional 50% unless Beijing abandons its retaliatory duties on U.S. imports.\n\nTrump in a Truth Social post gave China until Tuesday to undo its 34% tariffs, imposed in response to the \"reciprocal\" duties unveiled at the White House last week.\n\nTrump also wrote that he will cancel all planned talks with China if they do not comply with his demand.\n\nChina's action came \"despite my warning\" that any country retaliating against the new U.S. tariffs \"will be immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs, over and above those initially set,\" Trump wrote.\n\n\"Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated! Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nTwo Republican senators urged Trump to accept an offer by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for zero percent tariffs on industrial goods imported from the U.S. in exchange for the same rate on imports from the EU.\n\n\"Let's take that deal,\" Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said in a tweet replying to a video of von der Leyen's offer. \"Much to gain.\"\n\nSen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., replied in a tweet, writing, \"Totally agree with @BasedMikeLee.\"\n\n\"At some point you have to take YES for an answer,\" Johnson wrote.\n\n- Dan Mangan\n\nCorrection: Ursula von der Leyen is president of the European Commission. An earlier version misstated her title.\n\nU.S. tariffs on China will total 104% if Trump's latest threat takes effect, a White House official confirmed to CNBC's Megan Cassella.\n\nTrump announced blanket 34% tariffs on Beijing last week, which come on top of existing 20% duties on Chinese imports.\n\nTrump's latest tariff action would slap an additional 50% tariff on Chinese goods, unless China drops its 34% retaliatory tariff on the U.S.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger and Megan Cassella\n\nBillionaire Richard Branson is warning that the U.S. \"will face ruin for years to come\" if the Trump administration does not immediately \"change course\" on its tariff policies.\n\n\"The US government can still turn things around, but it must act in the next few hours,\" the Virgin Group co-founder wrote on X.\n\n\"This is the moment to own up to a colossal mistake and change course. Otherwise, America will face ruin for years to come,\" he wrote.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nThe White House dismissed a wire headline that said Trump is considering pausing new tariffs for 90 days.\n\n\"Fake news,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNBC's Eamon Javers after a headline that cited Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council.\n\nTrump himself posted on social media a video of Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo saying, \"Rates are plummeting, oil prices are plummeting, deregulation is happening.\"\n\n\"President Trump is not going to bend,\" Bartiromo said in the video.\n\n- Dan Mangan\n\nTrump writes that it's \"not sustainable\" for the U.S. to \"lose $1.9 trillion on trade\" in a post just now on Truth Social.\n\nTrump's post includes a video of him talking to reporters, in which he also says that the U.S. can't lose money on trade \"and also spend a lot of money on NATO in order to protect European nations.\"\n\n- Erin Doherty\n\nTesla shares are trading around 20% lower than they were when Lutnick urged people to \"Buy Tesla\" last month.\n\nLutnick touted Tesla, whose CEO is the Trump administration DOGE chief Elon Musk, in a March 19 interview on Fox News.\n\n\"It's unbelievable that this guy's stock is so cheap,\" Lutnick said. \"It'll never be this cheap again.\"\n\nAs it turns out, it would be.\n\n- Dan Mangan\n\nCanada filed a dispute with the the World Trade Organization concerning Trump's 25% tariffs on automobiles and automobile parts imported from Canada into the U.S.\n\nCanada requested WTO dispute consultations with the U.S. concerning the new levies, the global trade organization said. The WTO says the request for consultations formally initiates a dispute in the organization.\n\nConsultations will give the parties an opportunity to discuss the matter without proceeding further with litigation. After 60 days, if consultations have failed to resolve the dispute, the complainant may request adjudication by a panel, according to the WTO.\n\nCanada claims the measures are inconsistent with the U.S.' obligations under various provisions of the \"General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\" of 1994.\n\n- Michael Wayland\n\nPeople who voted for Trump are more likely to own stock than those who voted for Kamala Harris in November's election - and they also tend to have more money tied up in the market.\n\nCNBC's All-American Economic Survey in December found that 51% of Trump voters have stock market investments, compared to 46% of Harris voters.\n\nAnd of those Trump voters, 53% had investments worth more than $50,000, while just 45% of Harris voters had that much money tied up in stock.\n\n- Dan Mangan\n\nTop White House trade advisor Peter Navarro is shrugging off Elon Musk's swipe at his qualifications, while suggesting there is daylight between the Tesla CEO's trade views and those of the Trump administration.\n\nNavarro told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that he has not spoken to Musk since he tweeted that Navarro \"ain't built s---.\"\n\nMusk appeared to delete that post.\n\nBut Musk kept up another post that said \"a PhD in Econ from Harvard is a bad thing,\" a shot at Navarro's alma mater.\n\n\"I'll probably see him today in the Oval. It's no big deal,\" Navarro told CNBC when asked about Musk's comments.\n\nNavarro praised Musk's work with DOGE on slashing government spending.\n\nHowever, he then took a swipe at the billionaire.\n\n\"When it comes to tariffs and trade,\" Navarro said, Musk \"is a car manufacturer - but he's not a car manufacturer, he's a car assembler.\"\n\nNavarro noted that parts of the Tesla cars assembled at its Texas plant are from overseas.\n\n\"What we want, and the difference in our thinking and Elon's on this, is that we want the tires made in Akron, we want the transmissions made in Indianapolis,\" he said.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\n\"Countries from all over the World are talking to us,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social, and \"tough but fair parameters are being set.\"\n\nTrump spoke to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba earlier in the day, and \"he is sending a top team to negotiate.\"\n\n\"They have treated the U.S. very poorly on Trade. They don't take our cars, but we take MILLIONS of theirs,\" Trump says in the post, adding, \"it all has to change, but especially with CHINA!!!\"\n\n- Erin Doherty\n\nEurope will establish a new import surveillance task force, as it looks to diversify its trade portfolio in the wake of Trump's sweeping tariffs.\n\n\"Further diversifying our trade relations is very critical for us, because this broadens the market opportunities and is crucial for our companies,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at a press briefing.\n\n\"So we will focus like a laser beam on the 83% of global trade that is beyond the United States, vast opportunities, and this is why we're deepening our relations with our trading partners.\"\n\nVon der Leyen mentioned existing deals with Mexico and Switzerland, and potential deals with India, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.\n\nEurope stands ready to respond to Trump's aggressive tariff agenda with counter measures if necessary, she said, but the region still stands \"ready to negotiate\" with the U.S. if possible.\n\n- April Roach\n\nTop White House trade advisor Peter Navarro is pushing back on concerns that Trump's plan to restore U.S. manufacturing through tariffs will take years to bear fruit, if it works at all.\n\n\"Investment can made in auto parts factories that are still there, and it won't take long,\" Navarro said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\n\nHe then pointed to the first Trump administration securing protective equipment faster than expected at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\"So don't tell me that America doesn't have the wherewithal to move things and we can do stuff,\" he said.\n\nA CNBC flash survey of CEOs contacted in the wake of Trump's sweeping tariff rollout last week was far less optimistic: 45% of respondents said that any reshoring would take minimum two years, and more likely three years or more.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon says Trump's tariffs will likely boost prices on both domestic and imported goods, weighing down a U.S. economy that had already been slowing.\n\nDimon addresses the tariff policy in his annual shareholder letter, which has become closely read.\n\n\"Whatever you think of the legitimate reasons for the newly announced tariffs - and, of course, there are some - or the long-term effect, good or bad, there are likely to be important short-term effects,\" Dimon writes.\n\n\"We are likely to see inflationary outcomes, not only on imported goods but on domestic prices, as input costs rise and demand increases on domestic products.\"\n\n\"Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth,\" he adds.\n\nDimon is the first CEO of a major Wall Street bank to publicly address Trump's sweeping tariff policy as global markets crash.\n\nHis remarks appear to backtrack from earlier comments he made in January, when Dimon said that people should \" get over \" tariff concerns because they were good for national security. At the time, tariff levels being discussed were far lower than what was unveiled last week.\n\n- Hugh Son\n\nElon Musk posted a video on X of Milton Friedman advocating for free trade, in one of the strongest examples yet of the billionaire SpaceX founder's break with Trump on tariffs.\n\nOver the weekend, Musk publicly criticized Trump's top trade advisor, Peter Navarro.\n\nHe also said said he hopes Europe and the U.S. can move \"to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free-trade zone,\" during a virtual appearance at a meeting of Italy's far-right League party.\n\nMusk's comments were at odds with Trump's hostility towards the European Union, which Trump has targeted with a 20% tariff on exports.\n\nMusk is Trump's biggest campaign donor and the leader of DOGE, Trump's massive effort to slash the federal workforce.\n\nTrump recently told Cabinet members that Musk would be leaving his post at DOGE in the coming months.\n\n- Erin Doherty\n\nMarkets across the globe continue to crash for a third day as a result of Trump's tariffs.\n\nTaiwan:\n\nJapan:\n\nChina:\n\nKuwait:\n\nNorway:\n\n- Adam Jeffrey\n\nAckman is apologizing for accusing Lutnick of being \"indifferent\" to a stock market crash because he stands to profit from it.\n\n\"It was unfair of me to lash out at @howardlutnick,\" writes Ackman.\n\n\"I don't think he is pursuing his self interest. I am sure he is doing the best he can for the country while representing the President as Commerce Secretary. It is not an easy job and we don't know how the sausage was made.\"\n\nThe new post comes nine hours after Ackman slung the accusation at Lutnick and his investment banking firm, Cantor Fitzgerald.\n\n\"I just figured out why @howardlutnick is indifferent to the stock market and the economy crashing. He and Cantor are long bonds. He profits when our economy implodes,\" Ackman wrote Sunday night.\n\n\"It's a bad idea to pick a Secretary of Commerce whose firm is levered long fixed income. It's an irreconcilable conflict of interest.\"\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nTrump is touting the steep drop in oil prices - driven by fears of reduced demand in the increasingly likely event of a recession - as a policy win.\n\n\"Oil prices are down, interest rates are down (the slow moving Fed should cut rates!), food prices are down, there is NO INFLATION, and the long time abused USA is bringing in Billions of Dollars a week from the abusing countries on Tariffs that are already in place,\" Trump writes in his latest Truth Social post .\n\n\"This is despite the fact that the biggest abuser of them all, China, whose markets are crashing, just raised its Tariffs by 34%, on top of its long term ridiculously high Tariffs (Plus!), not acknowledging my warning for abusing countries not to retaliate,\" he writes. \"They've made enough, for decades, taking advantage of the Good OL' USA!\"\n\nTrump also blames America's past leaders for \"allowing this\" to happen.\n\n- Christina Wilkie\n\nTrump has two significant public events on his schedule today.\n\n11:00 a.m. ET: Trump will host the World Series-winning Los Angeles Dodgers at the White House, according to his official schedule.\n\n2:30 p.m. ET: Netanyahu, one of Trump's closest allies, will participate in a joint press conference with the president at the White House.\n\nThe last time Netanyahu visited the White House was in February, as the U.S. worked to finalize the second phase of a cease fire deal in Gaza. It did not hold, however, and Israeli forces have since resumed ground operations in Gaza.\n\nCNBC's latest CEO survey finds that a majority of the CEOs polled say they now expect a recession before the end of the year. Of those, around half say that a recession, if it happens, will likely be moderate.\n\nOne in three of the CEOs say they expect that their companies will be forced to cut jobs in 2025 due to Trump's tariff policies.\n\n- CNBC Staff\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Trump's tariffs were expected to boost the dollar, but recession fears are dragging it down\n\nThe Wall Street conventional wisdom in November was that President-elect Donald Trump's tariff plans would boost the U.S. dollar. Instead, with the tariffs in place, worries about an impending recession have overwhelmed any positive benefit for the greenback.\n\nThe ICE U.S. Dollar Index traded as high as 104.31 on Wednesday, before Trump's tariffs were unveiled. It fell following the announcement and hit a low of 101.27 on Thursday, a 3% swing in roughly 24 hours. Even with a modest rebound on Friday, the index finished down for the week and the dollar is now weaker than it was before the presidential election in November.\n\n\"The blowback from Trump's tariffs are already kind of hitting the U.S. economy, and that's not what investors were expecting,\" said Chris Turner, global head of markets at ING. \"Investors were expecting that tariffs would be bullish for the dollar and bad for the rest of the world. But I think the U.S. economy wasn't in a strong enough position to take these maximum tariffs right now.\"\n\nWhile Trump has at different times spoken favorably of both a strong and a weak dollar, traders clearly took his election as a boost to the greenback. The dollar index rallied sharply following Trump's win on Nov. 5 and then continued to climb over the next two months, briefly trading above 110 in mid-January.\n\nSince then, the index has been retreating amid growing signs of economic weakness in the U.S. and as Trump's trade policies proved more aggressive than Wall Street bargained for.\n\nKathy Kriskey, head of alternatives ETF strategy at Invesco, is still hopeful for a \"short-term pain, long-term gain\" outcome from the Trump administration's economic plan, but says market confidence is shaken.\n\n\"The currency reflects the health of the economy, and so I think that right now we are very concerned. We sort of believe Trump has a plan but we don't know, definitively, what that plan is,\" Kriskey said.\n\nTo be sure, foreign currencies have not moved uniformly against the dollar lately.\n\nTraditional safe-haven currencies like the Japanese yen and Swiss franc have seen some of the biggest gains. But more economically sensitive currencies like the Australian dollar that are more closely tied to commodities have lost ground against the dollar, especially on Friday, which looked like a \"more traditional risk-off day,\" Turner said.\n\nThe flight to safety in other asset classes is also having a mechanical impact on the currency market. For example, the drop in U.S. Treasury yields makes it less attractive for foreign investors to hold dollars or U.S. bonds and collect interest, while dumping of U.S. equities likely includes foreign investors who are shifting that allocation to domestic stocks, selling the greenback along the way.\n\nThe euro has proven one exception to the risk-off trade, rising against the greenback this past week even though it's typically viewed as less of a safety play than the dollar. Kriskey said growing optimism around a potential peace deal in Ukraine and promises of more government spending from countries like Germany is helping to bolster the euro.\n\n\"It's been bizarre that this new [Trump] administration is actually helping Europe to get their house in order and for those currencies to look more attractive,\" Kriskey said. Betting on the euro to rise is one of the strategies used in the Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bearish Fund (UDN) .\n\nThe good news for investors is that the sharp move in currency markets this week doesn't appear to pose an immediate threat to the economy or financial system. Amol Dhargalkar, managing partner at Chatham Financial, said companies may look to be more aggressive in hedging their currency risk in the months ahead but that corporates typically do so in a conservative way, meaning there should be no major trading losses from this week's moves.\n\n\"Their main objective is not to take a view, for the most part, on the currency. The main objective is really to mitigate the risk,\" Dhargalkar said.\n\nWhile there may be hedge funds who were on the wrong side of the dollar move, the foreign exchange market is also enormously liquid, deep and actively traded around the world, meaning it should be able to withstand 3% moves in the dollar without too much issue.\n\n\"This is well within the range that the market can digest,\" said Ken Miller, portfolio manager of the Simplify Currency Strategy ETF (FOXY) and the firm's head of trading. He compared this past week favorably to the situation the currency markets faced in the 2008 financial crisis. \"That was a completely different animal in that banks were at risk and counterparties were at risk. I don't sense that here.\"\n\nGet Your Ticket to Pro LIVE\n\nJoin us at the New York Stock Exchange! Uncertain markets?

      "text": "Trump open to tariff negotiations, contradicting White House aides\n\nThis is CNBC's coverage of how U.S. trade partners, industries and employers responded to President Donald Trump's new tariffs.\n\nWhat you need to know\n\nCNBC's reporters covered the tariffs and their effects, live on air and online from our bureaus in Washington; London; Singapore; San Francisco; and Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.\n\nRead CNBC's continued coverage of Trump's historic tariff plan here.\n\nThe weekend is looking like a breeze for Trump - if not for stock market investors hammered by the fallout from his new tariffs.\n\nThe White House posted a tweet showing Trump walking with his hair, tie and suit jacket blown back from the wind, with the italicized message, \"Almost Friday.\"\n\nThe tweet's jaunty vibe contrasted with a metaphorical bloodbath on Wall Street, where the major stock indices all suffered big drops.\n\n- Dan Mangan\n\nNissan Motor's luxury Infiniti brand has indefinitely paused production of two Mexico-built crossovers for the U.S. in response to the newly imposed 25% tariffs on imported vehicles by Trump.\n\nIn a memo to the brand's retailers, Infiniti Americas Vice President Tiago Castro said QX50 and QX55 output for the U.S. is halted \"until further notice\" due to the tariffs, Automotive News reported Thursday.\n\nA company spokesman confirmed the actions Thursday afternoon to CNBC and said the Japanese automaker is reviewing its \"production and supply chain operations to identify optimal solutions for efficiency and sustainability.\"\n\n\"We will continue to evaluate the impact, as well as market needs, to make any additional adjustments to production,\" Nissan said in an emailed statement.\n\nSeparately, Nissan on Thursday confirmed it will maintain two shifts of production of the Nissan Rogue crossover at its Smyrna, Tennessee, plant that is free of the new auto tariffs.\n\nNissan had planned to scale back Rogue production in Smyrna to a single shift starting this month.\n\n- Michael Wayland\n\nThe European Union and Switzerland, two crucial markets for luxury goods, were hit with tariffs of 20% and 31%, respectively.\n\nCompared with their luxury peers, Swiss watchmakers stand to be most affected, JPMorgan analysts said in a note.\n\nAnalysts highlighted Swiss conglomerates Swatch Group, which counts Omega among its brands, and Richemont, owner of Piaget, noting their thin margins. The Swatch Group fell nearly 4% and shares of Compagnie Financière Richemont SA dropped 6.3% in trading.\n\nGucci owner Kering and Burberry are also vulnerable, according to the analysts, citing weak profits and \"less pricing power to mitigate some of the impact given their currently softer brand momentum.\" Kering and Burberry shares fell 7.5% and 9.2%, respectively.\n\nAs for luxury powerhouse LVMH , analysts estimated its wine and spirits division, which includes cognac brand Hennessy, would be most negatively affected.\n\nHermès faces the least damage before mitigation, estimated at roughly 3% to 5% by JPMorgan. Analysts said Hermès has less reliance on U.S. sales, high profitability and strong pricing power. LVMH ended down more than 3%.\n\n- Hayley Cuccinello\n\nCorrection: This post has been updated to reflect that Hermes is a separate, publicly traded company.\n\nAfter multiple White House aides insisted that the new tariffs were not a negotiation, Trump said he would be open to negotiating with other countries about the duties.\n\nTrump said he would be open to tariff talks with other counties if they offer something phenomenal, Reuters reported him saying on Air Force One.\n\nTop trade aide Peter Navarro told CNBC less than an hour earlier that the sweeping tariffs are \"not a negotiation.\"\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nSome big names in the market took the brunt of the punishment on Thursday, with Apple and Nike among the iconic American companies contributing in a major way to the S&P 500's worst day since 2020 .\n\nBut the tariff wall that Trump is building around the U.S. is estimated at nearly $1 trillion, according to data shared with CNBC by Trade Partnership Worldwide. They will have profound consequences throughout the market and global supply chain, across each American state and into the lives of every consumer. Trade experts are skeptical that negotiations will result in quick deals.\n\nAny manufacturing renaissance in the U.S. will come much later than an acute manufacturing crisis, experts told CNBC. U.S. CEOs, especially those in critical industries such as medical devices, are headed to Capitol Hill to plead their case.\n\nIn a nutshell, it \"isn't good news for the global economy,\" as shipping giant Maersk put it.\n\nRead the full story: Trump's other wall: $1 trillion in tariffs wrapped around U.S. economy - Lori Ann LaRocco\n\nTop Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro denied that Trump's new tariffs are being used as a tool to negotiate better trade terms with other countries.\n\n\"This is not a negotiation,\" Navarro said on CNBC's \"Closing Bell: Overtime.\"\n\n\"This is not that. This is a national emergency,\" he said.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nThe newly imposed tariffs pose a drag on growth, said Lindsay Rosner, Goldman Sachs head of multi-asset fixed income. The only question is how much.\n\nThe extent of the drag will depend on several factors, such as other countries imposing retaliatory tariffs and the Trump administration's willingness to negotiate, Rosner told journalists at a conference at Goldman Sachs' Manhattan headquarters.\n\nShe also noted that sectors and companies will not be equally affected by the tariffs.\n\nRosner is also waiting to see how the Federal Reserve responds. \"They've got to push back here because I think the big word of 'stagflation' is real here,\" she said.\n\nStagflation occurs when inflation rises as economic growth slows.\n\nFinally, Rosner said she believes Wednesday's tariffs were just the beginning and wonders what the Trump administration will impose next.\n\n\"I think we all know there is more to come,\" she said.\n\n- Hayley Cuccinello\n\nShares in top U.S. exporter Boeing tumbled 10% and other aerospace stocks such as engine maker GE Aerospace also fell, as companies assessed tariff effects on their global supply chains.\n\nGE has a joint venture with France's Safran, and together they provide parts and build best-selling engines under their shared CFM brand. Those engines power Boeing and Airbus narrow-body planes.\n\nAircraft are made with thousands of parts from all across the world. Even European plane maker Airbus, which has expanded its final assembly lines in Mobile, Alabama, over the past decade, relies on components made outside the U.S.\n\nBoeing, which assembles its 787 Dreamliner jets in South Carolina, has a supply chain spanning from Japan to Italy.\n\n\"There are still a lot of unknowns, such as how they are applied to aerospace, which tier of suppliers or customers will pay for them, and how trading partners will respond,\" Jefferies aerospace analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu wrote Thursday.\n\nShe noted that aircraft and defense products boost U.S. exports and have been \"insulated via The Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft, but raw [material] price inflation is unavoidable.\"\n\n- Leslie Josephs\n\nHousehold staples such as coffee, bananas and toilet paper will likely get more expensive as the Trump administration's tariffs go into effect.\n\nThe Consumer Brands Association, an industry trade group that represents Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble and other consumer giants, is asking for exemptions for key ingredients and inputs that cannot be produced at scale in the U.S.\n\nAs an example, the CBA pointed to the fact that the U.S. climate limits domestic production of tropical fruits, coffee and spices. The countries that do produce those goods, such as Guatemala and Madagascar, have been slapped with tariffs that range from 10% to 47%. Manufacturers and retailers will likely pass on the higher ingredient costs to shoppers.\n\nInedible staples, such as toilet paper and shampoo, could become more expensive, too, due to higher costs for inputs such as wood pulp and palm oil, the CBA said.\n\nRead the full story here .\n\n- Amelia Lucas\n\nFederal Reserve officials could get caught in a policy box if tariffs spike inflation and weaken growth, diminishing the chances of an interest rate cut anytime soon.\n\nA general consensus emerged on Wall Street that unless the announced duties are negotiated down, core inflation this year likely will run north of 3%, and economic growth could be flat or negative as unemployment rises. In that case, the Fed would find itself torn between its \"dual mandate\" of full employment and low inflation.\n\n\"The problem for the Fed is that they're going to have to be very, be very reactive,\" said Jonathan Pingle, chief U.S. economist at UBS.\n\n- Jeff Cox\n\nU.S. markets continue to fall as investors digest news of Trump's far-reaching tariffs. The selling has been accelerating into the close of trading at 4 p.m. ET. Read CNBC's full market coverage here.\n\n- Elisabeth Cordova\n\nThe formula used by the White House to determine its sweeping tariff policy looks like it could have come from artificial intelligence chatbots, according to The Verge , which on Thursday used some quick work done by journalist James Surowiecki and some commenters on X.\n\nSurowiecki wrote on X that it appears as if the Trump administration \"just took our trade deficit with that country and divided it by the country's exports to us.\" The Verge said its reporters got similar results when they asked popular AI chatbots - including ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude and Grok - for \"easy\" ways to solve trade deficits or to put the U.S. on an \"even playing field\" with other countries.\n\nThe four bots gave \"the same fundamental suggestion,\" the Verge said, though some of the details provided by each one differed.\n\n- CJ Haddad\n\nFederal Trade Commission Chair Andrew Ferguson warned companies against price fixing in light of tariffs.\n\nThe FTC \"will be watching closely to make sure American companies are vigorously competing on prices,\" he said in a post on social media site X .\n\n\"These necessary tariffs should not be interpreted as a green light for price fixing or any other unlawful behavior,\" Ferguson wrote. \"We will always protect American consumers.\"\n\n- Michele Luhn\n\nTrump said the response to his staggering new tariff plan is \"going very well.\"\n\n\"The markets are going to boom, the stock is going to boom, the country is going to boom,\" he told reporters as he departed the White House.\n\n\"The rest of the world wants to see, is there any way they can make a deal?\" he said.\n\nTrump pointed to investment pledges that some companies have made in recent weeks, claiming that it totals almost $7 trillion.\n\n\"You'll see how it's going to turn out. Our country is going to boom,\" he said.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nAltimeter Capital CEO Brad Gerstner said Thursday that Trump's tariff plan was more drastic than administration officials had signaled and will prove damaging if it is not scaled back. Speaking on CNBC's \" Halftime Report ,\" he said major business leaders in the U.S. share that opinion.\n\n\"I talked to probably 10 CEOs who are all in the Business Roundtable - these are CEOs of the largest companies in America - overnight, and [they all] think this is a huge mistake. They think this is too much, that it will have lasting and cascading negative repercussions for the United States and the global economy,\" Gerstner said.\n\nGerstner did not specify who spoke with him, but the members of the Business Roundtable include the CEOs of the biggest companies from multiple industries, including firms such as Apple, Bank of America, Boeing and FedEx.\n\nGerstner, who generally focuses on the technology sector as an investor, said Trump's tariff plan \"looks like protectionism\" as opposed to a step toward more equitable global trade.\n\n- Jesse Pound\n\nTrump is set to depart the White House and head to his Doral Golf Club in Miami, where he will attend a dinner for LIV, the pro golf tour that has previously held tournaments at Trump's properties.\n\nAfter the event, Trump will fly to his Mar-a-Lago resort home in Palm Beach, according to the White House.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nAltimeter Capital CEO Brad Gerstner said chipmaker Nvidia is positioned to weather Trump's broad tariffs.\n\nNvidia produces the graphics processing units, or GPUs, that power the artificial intelligence boom. The company may be better positioned to withstand the effect of tariffs because semiconductors, like GPUs, are on the list of exceptions - what Gerstner called a \"wise exception.\"\n\n\"The growth and the demand for GPUs is off the charts,\" he told CNBC's \"Fast Money Halftime Report.\"\n\nGerstner said he is concerned about the potential for a recession due to Trump's tariffs but is relatively bullish on Nvidia, saying the \"negative impact from tariffs will be much less than in other areas.\"\n\n- Ashley Capoot\n\nThe new wave of tariffs could have drastically different effects on the two leading U.S. dollar-store chains.\n\nDollar Tree 's stock dropped more than 10%, declining along with shares of other retailers that rely on manufacturing in China and Vietnam. But shares of rival Dollar General climbed more than 4%.\n\nTrump will slap an additional 34% tariff on imports from China, bringing new duties implemented on the nation's goods during his second term to 54%.\n\nThat is worse news for Dollar Tree because according to a note from UBS analysts this week, the company's exposure to China is about 32% of its cost of goods sold. Dollar General only has about 4% exposure.\n\nDuring an earnings call last month, Dollar Tree CEO Michael Creedon said the company could hike prices to help offset tariffs.\n\n- Jacob Pramuk\n\nLinkedIn co-founder and venture capitalist Reid Hoffman criticized Trump's tariffs policy, writing in a post on social media site X , \"This is a long game to hurt everyday Americans and consolidate power at the top.\"\n\nHoffman is a major Democratic donor and was an outspoken supporter of Kamala Harris during her presidential run. He has frequently criticized the Trump administration and previously expressed concern that Trump could retaliate against business leaders who did not back him.\n\nIn his post Thursday, Hoffman said the Trump administration has eroded trust in U.S. markets, \"first with crypto grifts\" and now with tariff policies \"drafted by a team that can't even do basic mathematics.\"\n\n- Annie Palmer\n\nSmall-cap stocks have entered bear market territory as markets reel in the wake of Trump's tariff announcement. Watch CNBC's market blog for all the key updates as they happen.\n\n- Sean Conlon\n\nGeneral Motors plans to temporarily increase pickup truck production at a plant in Indiana as the auto industry adjusts to Trump's 25% tariffs on imported vehicles .\n\nGM confirmed the plans without mentioning tariffs: \"General Motors will be making operational adjustments at Fort Wayne Assembly, including hiring temporary employees, to support current manufacturing and business needs. We continuously update and revise production schedules as part of our standard process of evaluating and aligning to manage vehicle inventory.\"\n\nThe increase in workers is in addition to the supplemental workers GM was already hiring to support summer breaks and time off for their regular employees, according to a person familiar with the plans.\n\nGM produces its crucial, highly profitable pickup trucks such as the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra at various plants in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe Detroit automaker has not cut production at any plants as a result of the tariffs, like its crosstown rival Stellantis is doing, according to the person, who was not authorized to speak to media.\n\n- Michael Wayland\n\nAmerican drinkers may be swapping out their Aperol spritzes for margaritas this summer.\n\nThe Trump administration's 20% tariff on goods imported from the European Union will hit European wines, spirits and beer, Reuters reports. Mexican-imported canned beer such as Modelo, the best-selling beer in the U.S., will also face a new 25% tariff.\n\nShares of Constellation Brands , which owns Mexican-brewed beers such as Modelo and Corona, are down less than 1% in afternoon trading. Investors have been anticipating the levies since Trump's election.\n\nBut the tariffs were not as harsh as the 200% duties Trump threatened on European wine, Champagne and spirits last month. The president also held off on imposing the 25% tariffs on Mexican tequila and Canadian whisky, lifting shares of Campari , Heineken and Diageo higher.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n- Amelia Lucas\n\nMatt Mittelsteadt, a tech policy research fellow at the Cato Institute, said in a statement that the new tariffs \"directly threaten American AI. These massive tax hikes are slamming during the exact window U.S. industry has to set the global standard - risking innovation and ceding the market.\"\n\nShares of CoreWeave , which recently became the first pure-play artificial intelligence company to IPO, were down more than 17% on Thursday. Nvidia stock was down nearly 7%, while shares of Microsoft and Google were both down more than 2%.\n\n- Hayden Field\n\nPershing Square CEO Bill Ackman encouraged foreign leaders to reach out to Trump \"immediately\" to negotiate, according to a post on social media site X on Thursday.\n\nAckman endorsed Trump in the 2024 election and has been a vocal supporter of the president on social media. In his post Thursday, he described Trump as a \"dealmaker\" and a \"tough, but fair negotiator\" who thinks about the world as a series of transactions.\n\n\"I expect Trump will reward the early dealmakers with fairer deals than those that wait to sit down at the negotiating table,\" Ackman wrote. \"Countries that respond with additional tariffs on our goods will be severely punished. The carrot and the stick writ large, Big Boy style.\"\n\n- Ashley Capoot\n\nCanada will impose 25% tariffs on vehicles imported from the U.S., Prime Minister Mark Carney announced, matching Trump's tariffs on imported vehicles that took effect today.\n\nThe tariffs will only apply to autos that are not compliant with the USMCA, the North American free trade agreement, Carney said. He said the tariffs will not affect auto parts or vehicle content from Mexico.\n\n\"We know the benefits of our integrated production system,\" Carney said.\n\nHe added that Canada is \"developing a framework for auto producers to avoid our counter tariffs, as long as they maintain their production and investment in Canada.\"\n\n- Michele Luhn\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Trump \"is not going to back off\" his newly announced tariffs.\n\n\"I don't think there's any chance\" that Trump will reverse course, Lutnick said in a CNN interview. \"This is the reordering of global trade, right? That's what's going to happen,\" he said.\n\nAsked to clarify, Lutnick said, \"the president is not going to back off.\"\n\nBut, he added, \"countries can fix their tariffs, their non-tariff trade barriers, which are much, much rougher.\"\n\nThe comments came as some Trump allies have expressed hope that the sweeping tariffs are negotiating tools to secure better trade relationships, rather than permanent import taxes.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nTrump's tariffs have boxed in retailers - and jeweler Pandora is not immune.\n\nThe Danish company said it expects an annual hit of 1.2 billion crowns, or roughly $178 million, from the new duties on U.S. imports, before it takes any steps to mitigate the effects. For 2025, it expects a hit of 700 million crowns, or about $103 million.\n\nPandora said it could raise prices or change its supply chain to help offset the levies.\n\nThe jeweler said U.S. tariffs of 36% on imports from Thailand will have the biggest effect on its business. Pandora said it made 92% of its jewelry at facilities in Thailand as of last year .\n\n- Jacob Pramuk\n\nA bipartisan bill introduced to the Senate seeks to require that Congress approve tariffs if they are to continue 60 days after their implementation, NBC News reported.\n\nThe bill also would require the president to notify Congress within 24 hours of announcing new tariffs.\n\n\"For too long, Congress has delegated its clear authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce to the executive branch,\" said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who is co-sponsoring the bill with Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash.\n\nIt is not clear when or even if the bill will be voted on.\n\n- Dan Mangan\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick pushed back on the looming prospect of grocery prices suddenly rising as a result of Trump's new tariffs.\n\n\"I don't think that's going to happen,\" Lutnick said on CNN when asked what he would tell Americans who voted for Trump and are about to face higher store prices.\n\nLutnick said that when the U.S. opens the markets that he says are blocked by other countries, \"our volumes grow, our farmers will thrive, and the price of groceries will come down.\"\n\n\"Let Donald Trump run the global economy. He knows what he's doing,\" Lutnick said.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nInvestors are seeking safety in fast-food chains, betting consumers will trade down to cheaper restaurant meals as tariffs weigh on their wallets.\n\nShares of McDonald's , Yum Brands and Restaurant Brands International are up more than 1%, while other publicly traded restaurant companies' shares take a beating.\n\nShares of Chipotle Mexican Grill and Texas Roadhouse are both down 3%. The two chains have reported stronger sales than the broader industry in recent quarters. Other eateries have seen even steeper declines in their share prices. Starbucks stock dropped 11%, Shake Shack's shares slid 13% and Sweetgreen's tumbled 16%.\n\nTypically, during economic downturns, fast-food chains report stronger sales than other restaurants, as price-sensitive consumers trade down from full-service dining and fast-casual lunches to less pricey combo meals at McDonald's or Burger King.\n\nThe restaurant industry is already anticipating that the latest wave of tariffs will mean higher menu prices for diners.\n\n\"The biggest concerns for restaurant operators - from community restaurants to national brands - are that tariffs will hike food and packaging costs and add uncertainty to managing availability, while pushing prices up for consumers,\" the National Restaurant Association said in a statement.\n\n- Amelia Lucas\n\nShares of GE HealthCare , which manufactures medical imaging, ultrasound and other health devices, tumbled more than 10% on Thursday following Trump's tariff announcement. GE HealthCare produces its products in more than 20 countries and serves customers in more than 160 countries around the globe, according to its website.\n\n\"Our top priorities are to make sure patient and customer deliveries for products and services are not interrupted under any circumstances and at the best quality and cost possible,\" a GE HealthCare spokesperson told CNBC.\n\n\"This is a dynamic issue,\" the spokesperson noted. \"Our teams are working on potential mitigation plans as these trade policies evolve. We will provide an update on our next earnings call.\"\n\nShares of Siemens Healthineers , a German med tech company, fell nearly 7% on Thursday. The company did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.\n\n- Ashley Capoot\n\nTrump's aggressive and sweeping \"reciprocal tariffs\" affected more than 180 countries, from major trading partners to even tiny islands and remote locations.\n\nThe tariff plan targeted numerous external Australian territories, including Heard and McDonald Islands, one of the most remote locations on earth, populated by seals and penguins.\n\nNorfolk Island, also an Australian territory with a population of nearly 2,000 people, was hit with some of the highest tariffs of 29%, despite Australia only facing 10% tariffs.\n\n\"I'm not quite sure that Norfolk Island, with respect to it, is a trade competitor with the giant economy of the United States, but that just shows and exemplifies the fact that nowhere on earth is safe from this,\" Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said, according to The Guardian.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n- Sawdah Bhaimiya\n\nChipmaking stocks dropped Thursday as markets sold off after Trump revealed wide sweeping tariffs.\n\nAlthough the sector was excluded from the latest levies, duties targeting the sector are still coming. Semiconductors, which typically come to the U.S. in finished products such as personal computers, are also under pressure due to fears that tariffs will quell demand for technology gadgets and electronics.\n\nAs of late morning trading, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF shed nearly 7%. Qorvo and Micron Technology plunged more than 12% each, while Qualcomm, Broadcom and Lam Research each dropped more than 7%. Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing slumped more than 6%, while Advanced Micro Devices fell about 5%.\n\n- Samantha Subin\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron urged companies in his country to pause investments in the U.S. after Trump's imposition of sweeping tariffs.\n\nHe said Trump's tariffs are a shock for international trade after his meeting at the Élysée Palace with representatives of industries affected by the heavy levies.\n\nTrump's plan sets a 10% baseline tariff across the board, while adding steep duties on many countries, including 34% on China and 20% on the European Union.\n\n- Yun Li\n\nFormer Trump Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he believed \"the market can adjust\" to the new 10% baseline tariff on nearly all other countries, but hoped the larger tariff rates will be \"negotiated down.\"\n\n\"I do hope there's the ability to negotiate them down, because, as we've seen for certain businesses, it is going to take a long time to move that manufacturing base,\" he said on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street.\"\n\n\"And we've seen the stock market, particularly in certain stocks, react pretty negatively,\" he said.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nIn another executive action signed Wednesday, Trump ended the so-called de minimis exemption on China and Hong Kong that allowed shipments worth less than $800 to enter the U.S. duty free.\n\nThe trade loophole has helped Chinese cheap-goods manufacturers such as Temu and Shein flood the U.S. with inexpensive products.\n\nIt will end May 2, according to the executive order .\n\nTrump had previously ended de minimis in early February but paused that move days later following concerns it could overwhelm U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nOn a brutal day for the stock market, shares of retailers - including Target and Nike - have been hammered particularly hard.\n\nTarget, Nike, Wayfair , American Eagle Outfitters , Ugg and Hoka parent Deckers , as well as toymaker Hasbro all hit 52-week lows.\n\nRetailers are expected to face tough choices in the weeks and months ahead, as they manage higher costs from broad tariffs on imports from nations including China and Vietnam, which are major manufacturing hubs for shoes, clothing, toys, furniture and more.\n\nSome, such as Steve Madden , were slashing their sourcing from China in recent years and moving more production to other countries such as Vietnam. Yet, now, even imports from many of those alternative countries are subject to tariffs. Goods from Vietnam, for example, will face a 46% tariff.\n\nSome sectors of retail are particularly exposed: Nearly a third of footwear imports in the U.S. came from Vietnam in 2023, the most recent full-year data available, according to the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, an industry trade group.\n\nBarclays retail analyst Seth Sigman said retailers will have a hard time absorbing all of the steep additional costs or sharing them with vendors.\n\n\"Unfortunately, some of it will result in higher prices,\" he said.\n\n- Melissa Repko\n\nCNBC's senior economics reporter Steve Liesman and on-air editor Rick Santelli held an impromptu debate about the effect of Trump's tariffs on global trade.\n\nThe spirited exchange on \"Squawk Box\" followed an appearance from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.\n\nWatch the full exchange below:\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nStellantis is idling production at two assembly plants in Canada and Mexico due to tariffs.\n\nRoughly 900 U.S.-represented employees at supporting plants will be temporarily laid off in addition to roughly 4,500 hourly workers at the Canadian plant. Workers at the plant in Mexico will still report to the plant but will not produce vehicles due to their contract terms, according to a company spokeswoman.\n\nThe downtime starts Monday and will last for two weeks at the automaker's Windsor Assembly Plant in Ontario, Canada, and the entire month of April at its Toluca Assembly Plant in Mexico.\n\n\"We are continuing to assess the medium- and long-term effects of these tariffs on our operations, but also have decided to take some immediate actions, including temporarily pausing production at some of our Canadian and Mexican assembly plants,\" said Antonio Filosa, Stellantis North American chief.\n\n- Michael Wayland, Michele Luhn\n\nVice President JD Vance argued that Trump's trade agenda, coupled with its deregulatory efforts and tax-cut plans, will ultimately bring down prices.\n\nBut \"we're not going to fix things overnight,\" he said in a Fox News interview Thursday morning when asked if costs will go up and for how long.\n\nHe framed the situation as one in which the Trump administration was tasked with fixing \"what was left to us\" by the Biden administration.\n\n\"You don't fix that stuff overnight. We know people are struggling. We're fighting as quickly as we can to fix what was left to us, but it's not going to happen immediately,\" Vance said.\n\nMany economists warn that Trump's sweeping tariff policies will raise prices and lower growth, and even some administration officials have acknowledged the import duties will cause at least temporary economic disruption.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nTariffs and economic uncertainty are threatening to slow construction of new hotels by driving up building-material costs, Baird's hotel analyst says.\n\nThe cost to build in the U.S. could now be as much as 10% higher because of tariffs, particularly on materials that are largely imported from China and Vietnam, Baird hotel analyst Michael Bellisario wrote. Construction of new hotels was already strained compared with before the Covid-19 pandemic because of higher costs and interest rates.\n\n\"Signings and starts could slow over the near term given heightened macroeconomic and trade policy uncertainties; projects' opening dates are likely to slip as well, in our view,\" he said in his Thursday note, adding that Hilton , Marriott and Choice Hotels International are the most exposed to U.S. construction headwinds.\n\nHotel stocks were all sharply lower in morning trading, and airline stocks, already battered this year, also fell. United was down more than 12% while American and Delta were each down more than 8%. Tariffs and economic weakness could add to both leisure and corporate bookings, while duties are set to drive up the cost of new aircraft.\n\n- Leslie Josephs\n\nPresident Trump's son Eric Trump says the first countries to negotiate a trade deal with his father \"will win,\" as he warned the world not to be among the last nations to cut such a deal.\n\n\"I wouldn't want to be the last country that tries to negotiate a trade deal with @realDonaldTrump ,\" Eric wrote in a post on social media site X.\n\n\"The first to negotiate will win - the last will absolutely lose. I have seen this movie my entire life,\" he wrote.\n\nBut Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick , in an interview with CNBC's \"Squawk Box,\" brushed aside the idea of countries winning exemptions from new tariffs on some products.\n\n\"I don't think the word 'exemption' is going to be a factor. I don't think that's such a thing,\" Lutnick said. \"I think what there's going to be is a world of fairness. Let's go try to figure out ways for the world to treat us more fairly and more properly.\"\n\n- Dan Mangan\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick brushed aside the idea that some imports from certain countries will win exemptions from the new U.S. tariffs.\n\n\"I don't think the word 'exemption' is going to be a factor. I don't think that's such a thing,\" Lutnick said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\n\n\"I think what there's going to be is a world of fairness. Let's go try to figure out ways for the world to treat us more fairly and more properly,\" he said.\n\nLutnick also said other countries would be making a mistake if they impose their own reciprocal tariffs on the U.S. in retaliation.\n\n\"I don't think it's effective in the world to retaliate,\" Lutnick said. \"I mean, those things are silly. \"\n\n- Dan Mangan\n\nNew tariffs will raise the price of shoes that Americans buy and lead to cheaper-quality merchandise, says a major trade group.\n\nTrump's tariff policy \"is catastrophic for American families,\" said Matt Priest, CEO of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America.\n\nThe massive new import duties will hit footwear-producing nations such as Vietnam and China especially hard.\n\n\"Our industry is already dealing with inflationary pressures, and this move will force families to think twice before making a purchase,\" Priest said in a statement.\n\nThe tariffs will \"drive-up costs, reduce product quality, and weaken consumer confidence,\" he added.\n\nNearly 100% of all footwear is imported to the U.S., according to the group. About 37% of footwear imports came from China in 2023, followed by about 30% from Vietnam, nearly 9% from Italy and 8% from Indonesia, according to data from the U.S. International Trade Commission.\n\n- Melissa Repko\n\nPershing Square CEO Bill Ackman wrote on social media site X , \"Sometimes the best strategy in a negotiation is convincing the other side that you are crazy.\"\n\nAckman, who endorsed Trump in the 2024 election, is a frequent defender of the president on social media.\n\nHe argued in a prior X post Wednesday that other countries should not retaliate against the new U.S. tariffs.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nCiting a \"changing economy\" and its position as the No. 1 U.S. producer of cars and trucks, Ford said it is putting most of its vehicles on sale.\n\nThe automaker is offering employee pricing to all U.S. customers from April 3 to June 2.\n\nThe promotion excludes some large vehicles such as the Ford Raptor, the 2025 Expedition and Navigator SUVs and Super Duty trucks.\n\n\"We understand that these are uncertain times for many Americans,\" the company said in a statement. \"We have the retail inventory to do this and a lot of choice for customers that need a vehicle.\"\n\nU.S. auto sales in the first quarter came in higher than expected as consumers flocked to buy cars ahead of auto tariffs taking effect, which many expect will lead to higher vehicle prices.\n\n- Michele Luhn\n\nThe White House on Wednesday listed tariff rates for 180 countries that, in most cases, were roughly half of what the Trump administration claims each country has \"charged\" the U.S.\n\nIt didn't take long for market observers to try and reverse engineer the formula - to confusing results.\n\nMany observers said the U.S. appeared to have divided the trade deficit by imports from a given country to arrive at tariff rates for individual countries.\n\nSuch methodology does not necessarily align with the conventional approach to calculate tariffs and would imply the U.S. would have only looked at the trade deficit in goods and ignored trade in services.\n\nThe U.S. also appeared to have applied a 10% levy for regions where it is running a trade surplus.\n\nThe Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has since laid out its approach, including a formula, on its website that appeared somewhat similar to the online chatter, barring a few differences.\n\nRead the full story here .\n\n- Neelabh Chaturvedi, Asriel Chua\n\nTrump quickly declared his \"reciprocal\" tariff rollout a success.\n\n\"THE OPERATION IS OVER!\" Trump wrote in an all-caps Truth Social post .\n\n\"THE PATIENT LIVED, AND IS HEALING.

      "text": "Trump's tariffs risk a global trade war, as leaders plan next steps\n\nThis was CNBC's coverage of President Donald Trump's April 2, 2025, announcement of new tariffs targeting dozens of U.S. trade partners. Read the continuing coverage of tariffs and their global impact.\n\nWhat you need to know\n\nCNBC's reporters covered the tariffs and their effect, on air and online from our bureaus in Washington; London; Singapore; San Francisco; and Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.\n\nThis live blog has closed. Read CNBC's latest coverage of President Donald Trump's tariffs and their global impact.\n\nThe latest U.S. tariffs could cost the Polish economy 0.4% of gross domestic product or roughly 10 billion zlotys ($2.64 billion), according to a preliminary estimate shared by Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk.\n\n\"A severe and unpleasant blow, because it comes from the closest ally, but we will survive it. Our friendship must also survive this test,\" he said in a Google-translated post on the X social media platform.\n\nAs a member of the European Union, Poland was hit with 20% of reciprocal levies under White House leader Donald Trump's latest set of levies disclosed on Wednesday, which have weighed on markets and dismayed the U.S.' trade counterparts.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund most recently assessed that the economy of Poland, which has historically maintained close relations with the U.S., would expand by 3.5% this year.\n\n- Ruxandra Iordache\n\nThailand's economic growth could be stunted to the tune of losing 1 percentage point because of the latest U.S. tariffs, Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira told reporters on Thursday, according to Reuters.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund most recently estimated that the gross domestic product of the country of 70 million people was due to expand by 2.9% this year.\n\nThailand was slapped with 36% in reciprocal duties, according to a chart shared by U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday.\n\nChunhavajira added that Bangkok will hike imports of U.S. goods and remove tariffs on certain U.S. products, among other steps taken to sustain exports. Thai exports to the U.S. amounted to $55.11 billion in 2024.\n\n- Ruxandra Iordache\n\nPharmaceutical companies breathed a sigh of relief Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump revealed that they would not be subject to reciprocal tariffs - but that reprieve could prove fleeting as the White House moves ahead with plans for the sector.\n\nThe Trump administration is considering launching a so-called 232 investigation into pharmaceuticals, among other industries, which could lead to import duties under the Trade Expansion Act, Bloomberg cited a senior administration official as saying on Wednesday.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for confirmation.\n\n\"The pharmaceutical companies are going to come roaring back, they are coming roaring back, they are all coming back to our country because if they don't they got a big tax to pay. And if they do, I'll be very happy,\" Trump said during his \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement.\n\nRead the full story here .\n\n- Karen Gilchrist\n\nIndia's Department of Commerce is \"carefully examining the implications\" and opportunities resulting from President Trump's broad tariffs announced on Wednesday, it said on Thursday .\n\nThe department said that the additional U.S. duties on India come to 27%. A list of reciprocal tariffs shared by Trump on his Truth Social media platform outlined a 26% levy imposed on the world's fifth largest economy.\n\nFollowing on Indian Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and Trump's February agreement to more than double the bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030, \"discussions are ongoing between Indian and U.S. trade teams for the expeditious conclusion of a mutually beneficial, multi-sectoral Bilateral Trade Agreement,\" the Department of Commerce said.\n\n- Ruxandra Iordache\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump will \"buckle under pressure\" and alter his tariff policies if Europe bands together, acting German economy minister Robert Habeck said Thursday.\n\n\"That is what I see, that Donald Trump will buckle under pressure, that he corrects his announcements under pressure, but the logical consequence is that he then also needs to feel the pressure,\" he said during a press conference, according to a CNBC translation.\n\n\"And this pressure now needs to be unfolded, from Germany, from Europe in the alliance with other countries, and then we will see who is the stronger one in this arm wrestle,\" Habeck said.\n\nGermany is widely regarded as one of the countries likely to be most impacted by Trump's tariffs, given its heavy economic reliance on trade.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n- Sophie Kiderlin\n\nU.S. tariff policies announced Wednesday would see U.S. gross domestic product take a 10% hit in the second quarter of 2025, High Frequency Economics Chief Economist Carl Weinberg said in a note Thursday, potentially pushing the world's largest economy into a recession after a predicted small contraction in the first quarter.\n\nWeinberg estimated that tariffs would take $741 billion out of U.S. household real incomes or corporate profits, or more if fully accounting for all tariffs on aluminum, steel and non-exempt trade with Canada and Mexico. His calculation of an average tariff rate on two-dozen countries of at least 30% is greater than expected, he said.\n\nThe U.S. economy will also be hit by price rises, Weinberg added, with the rate of an imported item such as softwood lumber higher by up to 25% - even if some of the inflationary impact is cushioned by downward pressure on the economy.\n\n- Jenni Reid\n\nGreek Finance Minister Kyriakos Pierrakakis said fresh U.S. tariffs represent a historic shift toward protectionism and a deviation from how the European Union sees economic and social progress.\n\n\"As a country, we are in favour of free trade,\" he said in a statement, reported by Reuters Thursday. \"We hope that this chapter will last as little as possible.\"\n\n- Holly Ellyatt\n\nSouth Africa seeks to negotiate a new \"bilateral and mutually beneficial trade agreement\" after being struck with 30% tariffs by the U.S. administration under Donald Trump's extensive levy campaign announced on Wednesday.\n\n\"The tariffs affirm the urgency to negotiate a new bilateral and mutually beneficial trade agreement with the U.S., as an essential step to secure long-term trade certainty,\" South Africa's presidency noted on Thursday , expressing \"concern\" over the newly imposed duties.\n\nThe African country has previously expressed willingness to meet with Washington to discuss the U.S. administration's separate 25% tariffs on automobile imports. South African vehicle exports to the U.S. top $2 billion, according to Reuters.\n\n- Ruxandra Iordache\n\nU.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer told business leaders in Downing Street on Thursday that while President Donald Trump had a \"mandate\" and right to act in the interests of his country, the U.K. had a right to respond.\n\nStill, he called for \"cool heads\" as he said that Britain would \"move now to the next phase of our plan.\"\n\n\"Decisions we take in the coming days and weeks, will be guided only by our national interest. In the interest of our economy. In the interests of the businesses around this table,\" he said at a meeting in his official office in No. 10 Downing Street, London.\n\n\"Clearly, there will be an economic impact from the decisions the U.S. has taken both here and globally.  But I want to be crystal clear - we are prepared,\" he said.\n\nThe U.K. has \"a fair and balanced trade relationship with the U.S.\" he noted after the White House imposed a baseline 10% duty on U.K. imports to the United States, reflecting the trading status of the relationship.\n\nStarmer said talks on an \"economic prosperity deal\" would continue but said he would only strike a deal if it is in the national interest.\n\n\"Our intention remains to secure a deal but nothing is off the table\" he remarked, saying Britain had \"a range of levers at our disposal,\" without going in to further detail.\n\nRead more on the story here: UK escapes worst of Trump's tariff wrath with 10% levy but warns of 'threat' to global economy\n\n- Holly Ellyatt\n\nThe White House on Wednesday listed tariff rates for 180 countries that, in most cases, were roughly half of what the Trump administration claims each country has \"charged\" the U.S.\n\nIt didn't take long for market observers to try and reverse engineer the formula - to confusing results.\n\nMany observers said the U.S. appeared to have divided the trade deficit by imports from a given country to arrive at tariff rates for individual countries.\n\nSuch methodology does not necessarily align with the conventional approach to calculate tariffs and would imply the U.S. would have only looked at the trade deficit in goods and ignored trade in services.\n\nThe U.S. also appeared to have applied a 10% levy for regions where it is running a trade surplus.\n\nThe Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has since laid out its approach, including a formula, on its website that appeared somewhat similar to the online chatter, barring a few differences.\n\nRead the full story here .\n\n- Neelabh Chaturvedi, Asriel Chua\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said the 20% tariff imposed on the European Union by the White House was \"wrong\" but said the bloc should try to avert a trade war.\n\n\"The tariffs are wrong and not in the interest of either party,\" Meloni said, Dow Jones reported Thursday. \"We will do everything we can to work on an agreement with the U.S., with the aim of averting a trade war that would inevitably weaken the West in favor of other global players,\" the premier reportedly added.\n\nOn Wednesday, she told business leaders involved in Italy's food and drinks industry that the EU may need to adopt \"appropriate responses\" to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs while stressing that a trade war should be avoided, if possible.\n\nThe EU should \"work in every possible way to avert a trade war, which would not benefit anyone, neither the United States nor Europe,\" she said, Italian news agency ANSA reported .\n\n\"This obviously does not rule out having to contemplate appropriate responses to defend our production, if necessary,\" she noted.\n\nThe prime minister warned that Italian food and drink exports could be hit hard by tariffs, noting that \"Italian agri-food products are in demand all over the world, starting of course with Europe.\"\n\n\"It must be remembered that the United States is the second-largest destination market, with exports rising by 17% in 2024. The U.S. market is fundamental for us.\"\n\n- Holly Ellyatt\n\nEurope's Stoxx 600 index was 1.6% lower shortly after the market open early on Thursday, as traders assessed the scope and impact of U.S. tariffs.\n\nBanks on the index were down 3.2% at 8:10 a.m. U.K. time, while technology stocks fell 2.6%.\n\nA range of European companies expected to be hit by the measures declined sharply, with German retailers Puma and Adidas down 9% and 8.6%, respectively. Swedish automaker Volvo Cars was down 9%, and shipping giant Maersk - viewed as a barometer for global trade - shed 7.4%.\n\n- Jenni Reid\n\nU.K. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the country faces a \"threat\" to its open economy from any global fallout from Trump's new tariffs regime, which included a baseline 10% \"reciprocal\" tariff on British goods exported to the States.\n\nThe U.K. has escaped relatively unscathed compared to many other nations, facing the lowest trade tariff that President Trump announced Wednesday thanks to its largely balanced trade in goods with the States .\n\nTrade deficits that the U.S. runs with many trading partners were used in large part by the White House to calculate which level of tariff should be imposed on specific countries or territories.\n\nRecognizing the U.K. was in a better position than many countries, Reynolds nonetheless said Britain was vulnerable to turmoil in other parts of the world hit with higher tariffs, such as the EU which will see a 20% levy on its goods exports to the U.S.\n\n\"Anything that disrupts the global trading system is a threat to the U.K. because we are a much more globally orientated trading economy than some partners,\" Jonathan Reynolds told Times Radio on Thursday, according to Reuters\n\nHe said the government would continue work to strike a trade deal with the Trump administration and would hope to get tariffs reversed. He didn't rule out counter-measures \"if we need to.\"\n\n- Holly Ellyatt\n\nSpain is prepared to take action and protect its companies and consumers from the impact of sweeping tariffs freshly announced by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, Spanish Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo said Thursday.\n\nHe added that Madrid remains eager to negotiate with the White House, but criticized the new U.S. measures - which involve 20% tariffs against the European Union, to which Spain is a member - as \"unfair and unjustified,\" according to Reuters reporting.\n\n- Ruxandra Iordache\n\nThe French government slammed U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday, with one official saying his slew of fresh tariffs reflected an \"imperialist posture\" toward the rest of the world.\n\nTrump is behaving as if he's \"master of the world,\" French government spokesperson Sophie Primas told RTL Radio, according to comments reported and translated by Reuters. Primas said the EU was likely to issue countermeasures initially in mid-April and then again in late April.\n\nTrump on Wednesday announced a blanket 20% tariff on all goods imported from the EU, purporting that the new tariff was roughly half of what the EU \"charged\" the United States.\n\nTrump said Wednesday that the U.S. would charge trading partners \"approximately half of what they are and have been charging us,\" noting \"so, the tariffs will be not a full reciprocal.\"\n\nThat halved figure includes \"the combined rate of all their tariffs, nonmonetary barriers and other forms of cheating,\" he said. The EU denies unfair trading practices with the U.S., though it has a long-standing trade surplus with the States. Trade deficits have been taken into account by the White House when calculating the \"reciprocal tariffs\" it would impose on other nations.\n\n- Holly Ellyatt\n\nNorway will try to negotiate with the U.S. regarding tariffs, Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre told public broadcaster NRK on Thursday.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that Norway would face a 15% duty on goods it exports to the States. The levy is lower than that placed on many other countries but Norway's leader said it could be very damaging for his country, \"which has a lot of exports and lives off exports.\"\n\n\"This is bad news, it is serious,\" Støre told NRK , adding that \"it will have consequences for many Norwegian companies and for jobs.\"\n\n\"If the opportunity to negotiate arises, we will definitely put our foot in the door and stand up for Norwegian interests,\" he added, in Google-translated comments.\n\n- Holly Ellyatt\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore said it was ready to curb excessive volatility in the Singapore dollar, following the market turmoil after the reciprocal tariffs announcement from the U.S. In a statement, the MAS said it will also ensure that Singapore's foreign exchange and money markets continue to function in an orderly manner.\n\n\"MAS is closely monitoring developments and assessing the implications for the Singapore economy.\"\n\n- Lim Hui Jie\n\nMalaysian government said in a statement Thursday that it is not considering reciprocal tariffs after U.S. President Donald Trump unleashed sweeping levies.\n\nThe Ministry of Investment, Trade & Industry said it is actively engaging with U.S. policymakers to seek solutions that will \"uphold the spirit of free and fair trade.\"\n\nTrump set a baseline 10% tariff on all exporters to the U.S. starting April 5, which is set to be levied on Malaysian goods.\n\nThe Southeast Asian country recorded a trade surplus of $24.8 billion with the U.S. last year, the ministry said, attributing the deficit in part to U.S. firms operating in Malaysia.\n\n- Anniek Bao\n\nNorway will try to negotiate with the U.S. regarding tariffs, Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre told public broadcaster NRK on Thursday.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that Norway would face a 15% duty on goods it exports to the States. The levy is lower than that placed on many other countries but Norway's leader said it could be very damaging for his country, \"which has a lot of exports and lives off exports.\"\n\n\"This is bad news, it is serious,\" Støre told NRK , adding that \"it will have consequences for many Norwegian companies and for jobs.\"\n\n\"If the opportunity to negotiate arises, we will definitely put our foot in the door and stand up for Norwegian interests,\" he added, in Google-translated comments.\n\n- Holly Ellyatt\n\nSouth Korea's acting President Han Duck-soo on Thursday ordered emergency support measures for industries and businesses that will be impacted by Trump's sweeping tariffs, according to a statement from the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy .\n\nHan urged the ministry to closely analyze the details and impact of the U.S. \"reciprocal\" tariffs and actively negotiate with Washington to minimize the impact of tariffs.\n\nSeparately, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters at a press conference that Trump's decision is \"not the act of a friend,\" while ruling out responding with counter-levies against the U.S.\n\n- Anniek Bao\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Ottawa will unveil on Thursday a full set of \"countermeasures\" in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's sweeping new tariffs.\n\n\"We are gonna fight these tariffs with purpose and with force,\" he told reporters ahead of a cabinet meeting to discuss Canada's response.\n\nThe U.S. Senate just passed legislation that would terminate new tariffs on Canada, shortly after Trump unveiled a raft of duties on foreign goods against global major trade partners.\n\n- Anniek Bao\n\nChina's Ministry of Commerce urged the U.S. to \"immediately cancel\" its unilateral tariff measures and vowed to take \"resolute counter-measures\" to safeguard its own rights and interests, after U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled what analysts described as the steepest tariff hikes in a century.\n\nThe Chinese official described the Trump administration's decision to impose reciprocal tariffs as a \"typical unilateral bullying practice,\" adding that many countries have expressed \"strong dissatisfaction and clear opposition.\"\n\nSeparately, the European Union is preparing further countermeasures against U.S. tariffs if negotiations fail, according to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\n\nSpeaking on a livestreamed broadcast, the EC president said that Trump's move was a \"major blow\" to the world economy. \"There seems to be no order in the disorder, no clear path to the complexity and chaos that is being created as all U.S. trading partners are hit,\" von der Leyen said.\n\n- Anniek Bao, Lim Hui Jie, Sophie Kiderlin\n\nTrump's 25% tariffs on imported vehicles to the U.S. have taken effect.\n\nAnnounced last week, the levies will be imposed on any vehicles that are not assembled in the U.S.\n\nThe auto industry is awaiting more clarity on potential upcoming tariffs on some auto parts such as engines and transmissions.\n\nEven if vehicles are produced in the U.S. - meaning the final assembly takes place in the country - the tens of thousands of parts for new cars and trucks come from a global supply chain.\n\n- Michael Wayland and Michele Luhn\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order shutting the de minimis trade loophole, effective May 2.\n\nTrump in February abruptly ended the de minimis trade exemption, which allows shipments worth less than $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free. Within days, Trump reversed course and delayed the cancellation of the provision.\n\nGoods that qualify under the de minimis exemption will be subject to a duty of either 30% of their value, or $25 per item. That rate will increase to $50 per item on June 1, the White House said.\n\nThe U.S. Customs and Border Protection has said it processed more than 1.3 billion de minimis shipments in 2024, up from over 1 billion shipments in 2023.\n\nShares in PDD Holdings, parent company of the Chinese online marketplace Temu, dropped 8.45% in after-hours trading.\n\n- Annie Palmer\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Ottawa will unveil on Thursday a full set of \"countermeasures\" in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's sweeping new tariffs.\n\n\"We are gonna fight these tariffs with purpose and with force,\" he told reporters ahead of a cabinet meeting to discuss Canada's response.\n\nThe U.S. Senate just passed legislation that would terminate new tariffs on Canada, shortly after Trump unveiled a raft of duties on foreign goods against global major trade partners.\n\n- Anniek Bao\n\nSouth Korea's acting President Han Duck-soo on Thursday ordered emergency support measures for industries and businesses that will be impacted by Trump's sweeping tariffs, according to a statement from the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy .\n\nHan urged the ministry to closely analyze the details and impact of the U.S. \"reciprocal\" tariffs and actively negotiate with Washington to minimize the impact of tariffs.\n\nSeparately, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters at a press conference that Trump's decision is \"not the act of a friend,\" while ruling out responding with counter-levies against the U.S.\n\n- Anniek Bao\n\nFour Senate Republicans joined every Democrat today to pass a resolution that would terminate Trump's Canada tariffs.\n\nThe measure, introduced by Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), passed with a simple majority, 51-48.\n\nThe Republicans who crossed party lines to back it were Sens. Mitch McConnell (Ky.), Lisa Murkowski (Ak.), Susan Collins (Me.) and Rand Paul (Ky.)\n\nThe resolution would terminate the national emergency that Trump used as a legal rationale earlier this year for imposing tariffs on Canada.\n\nThe Republicans' votes were largely symbolic, given that the measure is dead on arrival in the GOP-majority House of Representatives.\n\nBut coming, as it did, just hours after Trump had unveiled a sweeping tariff plan, the vote was a bipartisan rebuke of the president's trade policy by the U.S. Senate.\n\n- Erin Doherty\n\nStock futures fell steeply after Trump's announcement today, reflecting what CNBC's Jim Cramer described as the potentially \"horrendous\" effects of Trump's new tariffs on equities markets.\n\nFutures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1,007 points, or 2.3%. S&P 500 futures dropped 3.4%. Nasdaq-100 futures lost 4.2%.\n\nShares of multinational companies tumbled in extended trading. Nike and Apple each dropped about 7%. Shares of big sellers of imported goods were among the hardest hit. Five Below lost 15%, Dollar Tree tumbled 11% and Gap plunged 8.5%. Tech shares dropped in an overall risk-off mood, with Nvidia off 4.5% and Tesla down 6%.\n\n- John Melloy and Pia Singh\n\nPresident Donald Trump and the White House laid out the U.S. reciprocal tariff rates that more than 180 countries and territories will face under his sweeping new trade policy.\n\nIn charts posted on social media, the White House shows the effective tariff rates they claim other countries impose on American goods, including by \"currency manipulation and trade barriers.\"\n\nAn adjacent column shows the new tariff rates the U.S. will impose on each country or territory, including the European Union. The reciprocal rates are not necessarily the only U.S. tariffs these countries will face.\n\nTrump held up the chart when he unveiled his tariff policy in the White House Rose Garden.\n\nSee the full list here.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nIn addition to the sweeping country-by-country tariffs announced today, Trump also imposed a 10% baseline tariff that effectively ensures a tariff on any country that is not among the more than 180 singled out.\n\n\"All articles imported into the customs territory of the United States shall be, consistent with law, subject to an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 10%,\" unless otherwise noted, the executive order signed this afternoon reads.\n\nTrump also reserves the right to raise this baseline rate \"should U.S. manufacturing capacity and output continue to worsen.\"\n\nRead the whole executive order here .\n\n- Erin Doherty\n\nPharmaceutical products are among the goods that will not be subject to the reciprocal tariffs announced today, according to a White House fact sheet .\n\nBut Trump has not ruled out his plans to impose pharmaceutical-specific tariffs sometime soon.\n\nOther goods not subject to the reciprocal tariffs include copper, semiconductors, lumber, bullion, energy and certain minerals that are not available in the U.S., the fact sheet said. It also includes products already subject to Trump's recently announced tariffs, including steel, aluminum, autos and auto parts.\n\n- Annika Kim Constantino\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds says she is \"working directly with the administration to ease the short-term impact\" of the tariffs on her state, to \"keep our ag economy strong, and open the door to new export opportunities.\"\n\nReynolds is a Republican in a state that is especially sensitive to the sweeping tariffs Trump announced this afternoon.\n\n\"President Trump is using tariffs as leverage - to force our trading partners to the table and put America's farmers first,\" Reynolds said in a statement after Trump's announcement.\n\nReynolds also criticized the Biden administration, which she said \"consistently ignored the needs of Iowa farmers.\"\n\n- Erin Doherty\n\nTrump is imposing a 54% total tariff rate on imports from China, effective April 9, a White House official said.\n\nChinese imports had already been subject to 20% tariffs. Another 34% in reciprocal tariffs is being put on top of that, the official said.\n\n- Dan Mangan and Eamon Javers\n\nTrump finished speaking after roughly 50 minutes and signed an executive order imposing his sweeping reciprocal tariff plan.\n\n\"It's going to be a day that hopefully you're going to look back in years to come and you're going to say, 'You know, he was right. This has turned out to be one of the most important days in the history of our country,'\" Trump said.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nThe Trump administration announced Wednesday that Canada and Mexico will be exempt from the baseline 10% tariff rate, as well as reciprocal levies for specific countries for now.\n\nThe 10% tariff would only kick in when the original 25% duties Trump slapped on Canadian and Mexican imports are terminated or suspended. The 25% tariff was based on allegations that the neighboring countries were failing to stem the flow of drugs and crime into the U.S.\n\n- Yun Li\n\nExchange-traded funds tied to major U.S. stock indexes fell sharply in after-hours trading Wednesday after President Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on goods imported to the U.S.\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) tumbled 2.2% . The Invesco QQQ Trust , which tracks the Nasdaq-100, dropped 3%.\n\nThe White House unveiled a baseline tariff rate of 10% on all countries that goes into effect April 5. Higher duties will be charged against countries that levy higher rates on the U.S.\n\n\"We will charge them approximately half of what they are and have been charging us,\" Trump said in a press conference from the White House Rose Garden. \"So, the tariffs will be not a full reciprocal.\" - Fred Imbert, Pia Singh\n\nTrump showed off a big league chart outlining the reciprocal tariffs he is imposing on various countries.\n\nThe chart, featuring countries such as China, Vietnam, Japan, India and Switzerland, as well as the European Union, compares the tariffs and other trade costs Trump says those nations place on U.S. imports, with the reciprocal tariffs taking effect.\n\n- Dan Mangan\n\nTrump called out Australia, saying, \"they're wonderful people and wonderful everything, but they ban American beef.\" \"Yet, we imported $3 billion of Australian beef from them just last year alone. They won't take any of our beef.\"\n\n\"They don't want it because they don't want it to affect their farmers and you know what, I don't blame them, but we're doing the same thing, right now starting about midnight tonight.\"\n\n- Erin Doherty\n\n\"We will charge them approximately half of what they are and have been charging us,\" Trump said of his reciprocal tariff plan.\n\n\"So, the tariffs will be not a full reciprocal,\" he said.\n\nBut that halved figure includes \"the combined rate of all their tariffs, nonmonetary barriers and other forms of cheating,\" he said.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nTrump is promising what he calls \"the Golden Age of America,\" which he believes will see more jobs and domestic production ushering in a new age of domestic prosperity.\n\n\"We will supercharge our domestic industrial base, we will open foreign markets and break down foreign trade barriers,\" Trump said from the Rose Garden.\n\n\"And ultimately more production at home will mean stronger competition and lower prices for consumers. ... We're gonna come back very strongly.\"\n\n- Pia Singh\n\nTrump says \"jobs and factories will come roaring back\" and that the reciprocal tariffs will usher in a \"golden age\" for the country.\n\n\"We will supercharge our domestic industrial base, we will pry open foreign markets and break down foreign trade barriers and ultimately more production at home will mean stronger competition and lower prices for consumers,\" he said from the Rose Garden.\n\n- Erin Doherty\n\nTrump confirmed his administration will impose 25% tariffs on auto imports starting Thursday at 12:01 a.m.\n\nTrump, in his Rose Garden speech, said, \"None of our companies are allowed to go into other countries.\"\n\n\"That's why, effective at midnight, we will impose a 25% tariff on all foreign-made automobiles,\" he said.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nTrump took the podium in the Rose Garden to tout his new tariffs, calling it America's \"declaration of economic independence.\"\n\n- Dan Mangan\n\nTrump said he is about to sign a \"historic executive order instituting reciprocal tariffs on countries throughout the world.\"\n\n\"Reciprocal. That means they do it to us and we do it to them. Very simple. Can't get any simpler than that,\" Trump said at the start of his remarks.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nMedia executives have been in ongoing conversations with advertisers who are seeking flexible terms , as they face uncertainty about how impending U.S. tariffs will affect their businesses, according to people close to the discussions.\n\nDuring tough economic times, companies often pull back on advertising and marketing spending. The scarcity of specifics on the new tariffs has fueled discussions between media companies and advertisers, the people said.\n\nIn most cases, brands are seeking more lenient agreements in which they could pivot quickly depending on how the tariffs shake out, they said.\n\nTariffs, coupled with inflation and unemployment, could tighten budgets beyond earlier expectations, said Kate Scott-Dawkins, global president of business intelligence of GroupM, WPP's media investment group.\n\nThe potential hit to the ad market shows the ripple effect of tariffs on companies that won't directly contend with heightened costs on products.\n\n- Lillian Rizzo\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent is attending Senate Republicans' weekly lunch today before Trump's expected tariff announcement.\n\nThe Treasury secretary's visit to Capitol Hill comes a day after he visited with House Republicans.\n\nThere, Rep. Kevin Hern, R-Okla., told CNBC that Bessent said the tariff rates being announced today would be the top rates, and will go down from here, not up.\n\n- Erin Doherty\n\nRep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., is warning that Trump's tariffs are \"regressive\" and will hit \"people on things they buy every day.\"\n\n\"I don't think people are seeing this, including a lot of Republicans, as a day of liberation, but ... a day of higher costs and a day of chaos,\" Gottheimer told CNBC's \"The Exchange.\"\n\n\"Regardless where people are on the political spectrum, what they don't like is a lot of uncertainty,\" said Gottheimer, who is currently running for governor of New Jersey.\n\n\"I think people are hearing all this noise, they're seeing every day the news change and they just want some certainty,\" he added.\n\n\"They want less chaos in their lives.\"\n\n- Erin Doherty\n\nMajor averages are trading modestly higher in the volatile session as investors await details about tariffs on key U.S. trading partners.\n\nThe S&P 500 last traded up 0.2% after swinging significantly between gains and losses. At its session high, the benchmark was up 1.1%. At its session low, the S&P 500 declined 1.1%.\n\nThe 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 60 points, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.3% as Tesla shares jumped more than 4%.\n\n\"Any 'relief' bounce is likely to be short-lived as the absolute effect of the trade agenda remains decidedly negative with downside pressure on growth/earnings and upside risks to inflation,\" Adam Crisafulli, founder of Vital Knowledge, said in a note.\n\n- Yun Li\n\nThe Trump administration is adding imports of beer and empty aluminum cans to its 25% tariffs on derivative aluminum products, according to a notice posted Wednesday in the Federal Register .\n\nThe notice from the Commerce Department said the adjusted tariffs would take effect after midnight Friday.\n\nOne of the two product tariff codes referenced in the notice applies to \"beer made from malt.\" The other applies to aluminum casks, drums, cans, boxes and similar containers with a capacity no greater than 20 liters.\n\nThe notice does not include a separate code that would encompass beer in glass containers.\n\nThe Commerce Department did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nUncertainty surrounding Trump's tariff policy has created panic for smaller businesses grappling with the likelihood of added operations costs and potential supply chain bottlenecks.\n\n\"I'm going to run out of appliances,\" said Robin Liss, founder of kitchen gadget company Suvie, ahead of her two-week trip to Taiwan and Vietnam to work out a new business plan. \"I've got to figure this out.\"\n\nTrump slapped additional tariffs on China and is threatening to strain America's relationships with other longtime trading partners.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n- Samantha Subin\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum says she does not plan to implement tit-for-tat tariffs on American goods in response to Trump's import duties.\n\n\"It's not about tit-for-tat, but about what is best for Mexico and how to face this situation,\" she said during a morning press conference.\n\n\"We do not believe in an eye-for-an-eye, a tooth-for-a-tooth because that always leads to a bad situation,\" she said.\n\n- Erin Doherty\n\nThe Senate is poised to vote later today on a Democratic-led resolution to undo the \"national emergency\" that Trump declared in order to create a legal rationale for his tariffs on Canada.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told reporters earlier that Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., indicated that he plans to back the resolution. At least three other Republican senators - Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, Susan Collins, of Maine, and Rand Paul, of Kentucky - have also signaled plans to support the measure.\n\nThe resolution is largely symbolic, because it still needs to move through the Republican-controlled House and would require Trump's signature to become law.\n\nNonetheless, Senate passage with the support of some Republicans - on the same day Trump unveils his tariff plan - would mark a rebuke to Trump's tariff policy.\n\n- Erin Doherty\n\nSen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., a member of the Senate Finance Committee, is slamming Trump's tariff policies, saying that his \"half-baked trade war will only raise prices for consumers.\"\n\n\"Trump's so-called 'liberation day' will throw the global economy into turmoil and leave Americans holding the bag,\" Welch says in a statement hours before the unveiling of so-called reciprocal tariffs at the White House.\n\n\"We should not impose sweeping tariffs on our allies and longtime partners in trade. America's close economic ties with our trading partners are based on trust,\" Welch says.\n\n\"These on-again, off-again tariffs are extremely destructive and totally unnecessary,\" he says. \"President Trump is sticking it to our farmers, our businesses, and everyday working people.\"\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nTrump has made a final decision on how he wants to proceed with his sweeping reciprocal tariff plans, a White House official told CNBC's Megan Cassella.\n\nThe update marks an apparent end to the internal deliberations that were reportedly ongoing in the hours before the Wednesday afternoon announcement event.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger and Megan Cassella\n\nTrump will be joined in the Rose Garden by workers from industries that are likely to be affected by his reciprocal tariffs.\n\nThe guest list includes \"steel workers, autoworkers, oil and gas workers, steam fitters, truck drivers, and hardworking Americans from a variety of trades,\" a senior White House official told NBC News.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger and Peter Alexander\n\nTrump has said tariffs on pharmaceutical products imported into the U.S. were coming soon, but it is not clear if they will be announced at the White House event.\n\nThose potential tariffs would likely drive up U.S. drug prices for patients, because even if companies moved to produce those medications domestically, it would take years and cost more than producing medicines abroad, Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said in a note last week.\n\nPredicting the potential impact of tariffs on pharmaceutical companies is difficult since they have vast and complex manufacturing networks with multiple steps, sometimes in different geographies, TD Cowen analyst Steve Scala said in a note.\n\nBut Scala said Eli Lilly , Bristol Myers Squibb and AbbVie appear better positioned than others to weather tariffs because they have more major manufacturing plants in the U.S. than internationally.\n\nThe majority of their sites responsible for producing the active ingredients in drugs are also in the U.S., he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Novartis and Roche \"look more at risk\" because they have few U.S. plants and a higher share of active ingredient sites that are international, Scala said.\n\n- Annika Kim Constantino\n\nSome tequila makers have been warning about how tariffs could hit their businesses , but Colorado-based Suerte Tequila said it won't raise prices to offset tariffs.\n\n\"Tequila margins are stronger than ever,\" said Laurence Spiewak, Suerte Tequila CEO.\n\nStill, the industry could see a hit with tariffs on Mexico.\n\nIn 2024, the U.S. imported $5.2 billion worth of tequila and $93 million worth of mezcal from Mexico, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S.\n\n- Brandon Gomez and Michele Luhn\n\nTrump is targeting Sen. Mitch McConnell and three other Republican senators in a critical Truth Social post , urging them to oppose a bill that would undo U.S. tariffs on Canada.\n\nMcConnell and Sen. Rand Paul, both of Kentucky; Sen. Susan Collins, of Maine, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, \"will hopefully get on the Republican bandwagon, for a change,\" Trump writes.\n\nHe presses the senators to \"fight the Democrats wild and flagrant push to not penalize Canada for the sale, into our Country, of large amounts of Fentanyl, by Tariffing the value of this horrible and deadly drug in order to make it more costly to distribute and buy.\"\n\nIt is not immediately clear what Trump means by \"tariffing the value\" of fentanyl.\n\nTrump calls the Senate bill introduced by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., a \"ploy\" intended to \"show and expose the weakness of certain Republicans, namely these four.\"\n\nThe president also calls on Kentucky, Alaska and Maine voters to call these senators' offices.\n\n\"They have been extremely difficult to deal with and, unbelievably disloyal to hardworking Majority Leader John Thune, and the Republican Party itself,\" Trump adds.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford said he stands ready to remove retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products if Trump cancels heavy American import duties on Canadian goods.\n\n\"We're willing to take these tariffs off, like in the next minute, if he said he's taking their tariffs off,\" Ford told CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\n\nCanada has imposed 25% tariffs on more than $20 billion worth of U.S. goods in retaliation for the Trump administration's steel and aluminum duties .\n\nIn addition, Ottawa has slapped 25% counter-tariffs on $30 billion worth of U.S. goods, in response to Trump's imposition of broad-based tariffs on imports from Canada.\n\n- Yun Li\n\nTrump is hyping his reciprocal tariffs in a Truth Social post declaring the day of their unveiling \"LIBERATION DAY IN AMERICA!\"\n\nTrump commonly refers to his tariffs in historic terms, raising expectations and concerns about how severe the duties could be.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nSlovakia, the landlocked country east of Austria, could suffer the most from the new auto tariffs that Trump said will start to take effect Thursday.\n\n\"Germany's car industry is in the eye of the storm and by far most exposed in terms of value, with major players like Volkswagen , BMW , Mercedes , and Porsche likely getting hit by tariffs,\" economists Inga Fechner and Rico Luman of Dutch bank ING said in a recent research note.\n\n\"But Slovakia - home to several car plants - is most exposed in terms of total US export volume,\" they said.\n\nThe nation of 5.4 million people produces more cars per capita than any other country in the world. And the \"Detroit of Europe\" relies heavily on U.S. trade, with autos comprising a major chunk of its U.S. exports.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger and Sam Meredith\n\nThe U.S. stock market was poised to open lower Wednesday as Wall Street continues to struggle in the face of the looming tariff policies from the Trump administration.\n\nThe S&P 500 is now down 4.2% over the past month and is 8.4% below its record high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has dropped 7.4% over the past month and is 13.6% below its record high.\n\nUncertainty about tariffs is not the only reason the stock market has struggled, as some tech stocks that are thought to be relatively insulated from trade war concerns have also fallen.\n\nOther stock moves seem to have a more direct line to concerns about tariffs and their economic impact, such as the 12% decline in the past month for Stellantis .\n\nOn the other hand, gold and Treasury bonds have both been rallying in recent days, a sign that investors may be looking to reduce risk. Gold was trading near a record high Wednesday morning.\n\n- Jesse Pound\n\nThe scope of new tariffs has yet to be finalized by the White House, the Bloomberg news service reported.\n\n\"The White House has not reached a firm decision on their tariff plan,\" Bloomberg reported , citing people familiar with the plan.\n\nSeveral options are under consideration at the White House. One is a universal flat tariff rate applied to all trade partners, while another would tailor tariffs to each trade partner.\n\nA third option prepared by the U.S. Trade Representative's office would apply a flat rate to a select group of countries.\n\n- Dan Mangan\n\nDemocratic Sen. Peter Welch of Vermont said the tariff disagreements between Trump and Democrats go beyond typical party differences, calling it a \"very, very serious situation.\"\n\n\"We believe what President Trump is doing is, in many cases, lawless and really beyond any norms,\" he said on \"Squawk Box.\"\n\nWelch said Congress has tariff authority that can be traced back to the Constitution.\n\nTrump's actions are an \"overreach\" in service of a personal agenda, he said.\n\n\"There's a real abdication by Congress of its own authority,\" he said.\n\n- Laya Neelakandan\n\nThe U.S. Trade Representative's office has prepared a third option for tariffs, The Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nThis tariff structure would set a rate below 20% and apply it only to a small group of trade partners.\n\nThere are two other plans under consideration at the White House.\n\nRead more at The Wall Street Journal .\n\n- Erin Doherty\n\n- Christina Wilkie\n\nTrump's new tariffs will take effect \"immediately \" after he announces them in the Rose Garden, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday.\n\nThe timeline offered a morsel of clarity about the reciprocal tariff plan, which remains highly opaque just hours before it is set to be unveiled.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum spoke on the phone in advance of looming U.S. tariffs to reaffirm their \"strong trading and investment relationship,\" Carney's government in Ottawa said.\n\n\"With challenging times ahead,\" the two leaders \"emphasized the importance of safeguarding North American competitiveness while respecting the sovereignty of each nation,\" Ottawa said in a statement after Tuesday's call.\n\nCarney also laid out his \"plan to fight unjustified trade actions against Canada\" by the Trump administration.\n\nIn separate remarks to reporters Tuesday, Carney said Canada is prepared to retaliate against whatever actions the U.S. takes Wednesday.\n\n\"We have held back, but we will not disadvantage Canadian producers and Canadian workers relative to American workers,\" he said.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nTrump is about to drop a sweeping tariff policy on an economy that already seems to be showing cracks .\n\nSeveral top analysts have lowered economic growth projections in recent weeks and warned of persistent inflation, dragging the term stagflation back into the conversation.\n\nStrategists and fund managers have also recently raised the probability of a recession , a shift that stems in large part from concerns about the Trump administration's fiscal policies.\n\nThese fears coincide with a highly volatile stock market and souring sentiment from consumers and businesses alike.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Trump tariff fallout: Navarro downplays sell-off, while Musk slams his qualifications; tech and finance chiefs reportedly head to Mar-a-Lago\n\nThis was CNBC's coverage of how U.S. trade partners, industries and employers respond to President Donald Trump's historic tariffs.\n\nWhat you need to know:\n\nAmericans nearing retirement and recent retirees said they were anxious and frustrated following a second day of market turmoil that hit their 401(k)s, NBC News reported .\n\nSome said they are pausing big-ticket purchases and reconsidering home renovations, while others said they fear their quality of life will be adversely affected by all the turmoil.\n\n\"I'm just kind of stunned, and with so much money in the market, we just sort of have to hope we have enough time to recover,\" said Paula, 68, a former occupational health professional in New Jersey who retired three years ago.\n\nPaula, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she feared retaliation for speaking out against Trump administration policies, said she was worried about what lies ahead.\n\n\"What we've been doing is trying to enjoy the time that we have, but you want to be able to make it last,\" Paula said Friday. \"I have no confidence here.\"\n\n- Daniella Silva of NBC News\n\nFrance could see a 0.5 percentage point reduction in gross domestic product growth as a result of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies, Prime Minister Francois Bayrou said in an interview on Saturday.\n\n\"Trump's policies could cost us more than 0.5% of our GDP,\" Bayrou said, according to excerpts published in an interview with Le Parisien newspaper.\n\n\"The imposition of these outrageous tariffs will lead to a global crisis (...). The risk of job losses is significant, as is that of an economic slowdown,\" he said.\n\nUnder Trump's plans announced on Wednesday, France will be subject to a general tariff of 20% along with other European Union countries.\n\nAfter speaking with Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer, President Emmanuel Macron said earlier on Saturday the two countries reaffirmed their determination to \"closely coordinate\" positions in tariff discussions with Trump.\n\n\"A trade war is in no one's interest. We must stand united and resolute to protect our citizens and our businesses,\" he said in post on X.\n\n- Reuters\n\nPresident Donald Trump may hope his tariffs jump-start a renaissance in manufacturing in the United States, but the reality is not so simple, according to experts.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Chris Snyder said he thinks tariffs are a \"positive catalyst\" for reshoring but that he doesn't expect a massive wave of projects returning to the U.S. in the near term. Right now, he sees small, quick turnaround investments that could boost output by about 2%, he said.\n\nConsumer confidence has taken a hit - and that will be a factor in business' decisions on whether and when they will reshore, said Manish Kabra, Societe Generale's head of U.S. equity strategy.\n\nThere also needs to be a significant investment in training America's workforce, experts say.\n\n- Michelle Fox\n\nSilicon Valley's early return from the Trump administration so far in 2026 has been plunging valuations and delayed IPOs.\n\nThe leaders of Alphabet , Amazon , Meta , Microsoft and Uber all made big donations - either personally or through their companies - to Trump's second inauguration. Over the past two trading sessions, the seven most valuable U.S. tech companies lost a combined $1.8 trillion in market cap.\n\nWith Wall Street selling out of risky assets on concern that widespread tariff hikes will punish the U.S. and global economy, the fallout has drifted down to the IPO market. Online lender Klarna and ticketing marketplace StubHub delayed their IPOs due to market turbulence, just weeks after filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and fintech company Chime is also reportedly delaying its listing.\n\n- Ari Levy\n\nCNBC's Jim Cramer on Friday said next week's earnings reports will provide a first look at how CEOs are dealing with the fallout of Trump's tariff plan.\n\nBig bank earnings will kick off earnings season in the week ahead, and investors will also get to parse more inflation data.\n\nNo matter what the numbers reveal, however, Cramer said the market's direction will depend on Trump's next move. The tariff-driven market rout could end soon if Trump grants relief to trading partners, he said, or it could suddenly get worse as it did on Black Monday in 1987.\n\n\"If President Trump stays intransigent and does nothing to ameliorate the damage that I saw these last few days, I'm not going to be constructive here,\" Cramer said .\n\nEven if earnings do come in ahead of expectations, souring economic expectations due to tariffs have already punished their stocks and could continue to do so next week, Cramer said.\n\n\"Our only real hope is that the president comes up with something that can turn this bear into a bull,\" Cramer said.\n\n- Russell Leung\n\nWhere's Trump? The president is golfing today at his club in Jupiter, Florida, as the market continues to reel from his sweeping tariff announcement.\n\nThe president flew down to his home state of Florida on Thursday, one day after he announced his \" reciprocal tariffs .\" He took part in a \"LIV Dinner\" for the LIV Golf tour on Thursday night.\n\nOn Friday, he went to Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, before attending a fundraising dinner for a super PAC that backs Trump, MAGA Inc.\n\nTrump on Saturday is golfing at his course in Jupiter, where the senior club championships are taking place.\n\nThe White House said that Trump \"won his second round matchup of the Senior Club Championship ... and advances to the Championship Round tomorrow.\"\n\nDemocrats pounced on Trump's trip to Florida amid the fallout from his tariff announcement, taking to social media to criticize the president.\n\n\"Recession fears are rising. The stock market is tanking. But don't worry, Donald Trump is golfing,\" Democratic Rep. Jason Crow (Colorado) wrote on X.\n\n- Erin Doherty\n\nThe National Association of Wine Retailers said tariffs will have a material impact on the wine industry, resulting in significant revenue reductions, layoffs and business closings.\n\n\"We have every reason to believe that the recently enacted tariffs on wines imported from other countries, as well as tariffs on other goods, will result in a significant contraction of the wine market in the United States,\" the group said in a statement .\n\nThe association said the belief that wine drinkers will simply switch from European, South American, and Pacific nations' wines to domestically-made wines is false.\n\n\"It is a fundamental misunderstanding of wine drinkers and the wine marketplace to believe that wine is a fungible product. ... when an American wine drinker asks for Red Burgundy, they do not substitute Oregon Pinot Noir when the Burgundy is out of their price range or unavailable. They simply don't make a purchase,\" it said.\n\n- Yun Li\n\nElon Musk on Saturday said he wants a \"zero-tariff\" system between the U.S. and Europe that would effectively create \"a free trade zone,\" Bloomberg reported .\n\n\"Both Europe and the United States should move, ideally, in my view, to a zero-tariff situation,\" Musk told Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini on Saturday during a virtual event. \"That's what I hope occurs.\"\n\nSalvini thanked Musk for his appearance in an X post .\n\n- Annika Kim Constantino\n\nEconomists say that Trump's tariff formula is based on an underestimation of a key metric, which has resulted in inflated tariff rates for countries nationwide.\n\nAccording to the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the formula calculating Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariff plan is the country's trade deficit with the U.S., divided by its exports, then divided by two.\n\nBut that formula assumes an elasticity of import prices with respect to tariffs of about 0.25, but the economists say that that number should be closer to 1.0 (0.945), according to senior fellows Kevin Corinth and Stan Veuger at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nIf Trump's formula reflected this, no country's tariff would exceed 14% and most would be at the 10% baseline established by the administration, according to AEI.\n\nFor instance, the tariff rate for Lesotho, the country with the highest rate, was 50%. But if adjusted, it would be 13.2%.\n\n- Erin Doherty\n\nA group of high-profile tech and finance leaders is making a trip to Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, to \"talk common sense\" to the president about his sweeping tariffs, several sources told veteran tech journalist Kara Swisher.\n\n\"Their million dollar donations to the inauguration is turning into billions and soon trillions in losses,\" Swisher said in a post on Threads, not indicating which leaders are part of the group.\n\nShe added that de facto DOGE chief and Tesla CEO Elon Musk is \"in their crosshairs too.\"\n\nTrump's tariffs sent global markets into a tailspin on Thursday and Friday, wiping out $30.9 billion in net worth for Musk, $23.49 billion for Amazon's Jeff Bezos and $27.34 billion for Meta's Mark Zuckerberg - the world's three richest people  - according to Bloomberg .\n\nThe tariffs are battering tech stocks due to the industry's heavy dependence on manufacturing, computer chips and IT services from countries like China, India and Taiwan.\n\n- Annika Kim Constantino\n\nElon Musk took aim at Peter Navarro, as the top Trump trade advisor continues to defend the president's sweeping tariffs.\n\n\"The market will find a bottom. It will be soon, and from there, we're going to have a bullish boom, and the Dow is going to hit 50,000 during Trump's term,\" Navarro said on CNN Saturday .\n\n\"A PhD in Econ from Harvard is a bad thing, not a good thing,\" Musk wrote in a post on X, responding to a post on the social media platform by a user touting Navarro's qualifications.\n\nMusk - whose DOGE team is engaged in a controversial effort to cut federal spending, including mass layoffs - also said that Navarro hasn't built \"s--t.\"\n\nThe billionaire SpaceX founder, who has been an influential voice during the early days of the Trump White House, may be leaving the administration in the coming months, NBC News reported this week .\n\n- Erin Doherty\n\nThe British maker of Jaguar and Land Rover cars is pausing shipments to the U.S. as it works to mitigate the impact of a 25% tax on vehicle imports imposed by the Trump Administration.\n\nJaguar Land Rover Automotive, one of Britain's biggest carmakers, said Saturday that the pause would take place this month.\n\n\"The USA is an important market for JLR's luxury brands,\" the company said in a statement. \"As we work to address the new trading terms with out business partners, we are taking some short-term actions including a shipment pause in April, as we develop our mid-to-longer term plans.\"\n\nThe U.K. automotive industry is expected to be hit hard by the new tariffs, which come at a time when British carmakers are struggling with declining demand at home and the need to retool their plants for the transition to electric vehicles.\n\n\"The industry is already facing multiple headwinds and this announcement comes at the worst possible time,\" Mike Hawes, chief executive of the U.K.'s Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said last week. \"SMMT is in constant contact with government and will be looking for trade discussions to accelerate as we need to secure a way forward that supports jobs and economic growth on both sides of the Atlantic.\"\n\nThe number of cars made in the U.K. dropped 13.9% to 779,584 vehicles last year, according to the SMMT. More than 77% of those vehicles were destined for the export market.\n\n- Reuters\n\nTop trade aide Peter Navarro downplayed the sharp market sell-off triggered by Trump's aggressive tariff rollout, vowing stocks will rebound and flourish soon.\n\n\"The market will find a bottom. It will be soon, and from there, we're going to have a bullish boom, and the Dow is going to hit 50,000 during Trump's term,\" he claimed on CNN Saturday. \"The S&P 500 is going to have a very broad based recovery, and wages are going to go up, profits are going to go up, and life is going to be beautiful here in America.\"\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2,231.07 points on Friday, the biggest decline since June 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic. This follows a 1,679-point decline on Thursday and marks the first time ever that it has shed more than 1,500 points on back-to-back days. The S&P 500 shed 10% in two days, now off more than 17% off its recent high.\n\n- Yun Li\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Saturday claimed that China has been \"hit much harder than the USA, not even close,\" in the escalating trade war.\n\n\"They, and many other nations, have treated us unsustainably badly,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social. \"We have been the dumb and helpless 'whipping post,' but not any longer.\"\n\nHe touted his sweeping new tariffs, saying, \"We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before.\"\n\n\"Already, more than FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT, and rising fast! THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN. HANG TOUGH, it won't be easy, but the end result will be historic. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\" Trump wrote.\n\n- Annika Kim Constantino\n\nEli Lilly CEO David Ricks warned that Trump's decision to impose broad tariffs could ultimately hurt drug research and development in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nTrump's reciprocal tariffs exempted pharmaceuticals imported to the U.S., bringing a temporary sigh of relief to drugmakers. But industry leaders are still bracing for Trump's plans to impose pharmaceutical-specific tariffs sometime soon.\n\n\"We can't breach those agreements, so we have to eat the cost of the tariffs and make trade-offs within our own companies,\" Ricks told BBC in an interview on Friday. \"Typically, that will be in reduction of staff or research and development, and I predict R&D will come first. That's a disappointing outcome.\"\n\nEli Lilly has led the industry in building up its U.S. production capabilities, earmarking $50 billion to construct and upgrade new plants since 2020. Those facilities are key to manufacturing the company's blockbuster weight loss and diabetes drugs.\n\nBut Eli Lilly also depends mainly on foreign manufacturing, most notably in Ireland, where it employs more than 3,000 and is constructing a new $800 million facility.\n\nRicks described the tariffs as a watershed moment in the nation's economic history.\n\n\"I think it's a pivot in U.S. policy and it feels like it'll be hard to come back from here,\" he said.\n\n- Annika Kim Constantino\n\nSome automakers are trying to capitalize on the moment amid the tariffs, industry analysts told CNBC . Ford and Stellantis are offering employee-pricing programs, while Hyundai Motor said it would not raise prices for at least two months to ease consumer concerns.\n\nAutomakers view the actions as a way to get vehicles off their lots and maintain or increase sales amid uncertain market conditions due to the tariffs.\n\n\"We understand that these are uncertain times for many Americans. Whether it's navigating the complexities of a changing economy or simply needing a reliable vehicle for your family, we want to help,\" Ford said in a statement Thursday morning announcing the program. \"We have the retail inventory to do this and a lot of choice for customers that need a vehicle.\"\n\n- Michael Wayland\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry on Saturday said \"the market has spoken\" following the U.S. imposition of sweeping new tariffs and called for the White House to defuse the escalating trade war through \"equal-footed consultation.\"\n\nU.S. stock markets fell sharply for a second consecutive day on Friday, with all three major indexes dropping by more than 5% as part of a global rout .\n\nSharing a picture of Friday's U.S. stock market downturn, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said, \"the trade and tariff war started by the U.S. against the world is unprovoked and unjustified.\"\n\n- Sam Meredith\n\nWith one of the nastiest two-day selloffs in history following President Donald Trump's launch of punitive tariffs on most trading partners, the stock market is in one of those precarious spots : Both tightly coiled for a near-term bounce soon, but not quite priced for the full fundamental implications of this policy as now contemplated.\n\nBespoke Investment Group gave voice to this uncomfortable moment, in which markets that are built to produce the \"wisdom of crowds\" through rational, collective price-setting are lashed to the whims a president channeling decades' worth of anti-trade feelings through the executive power to declare \"emergency\" tariffs.\n\n- Michael Santoli\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to visit the White House on Monday to discuss recently announced tariffs with Trump, three Israeli officials and a White House official said on Saturday.\n\nThe impromptu in-person visit could mark the first by a foreign leader to meet with Trump and try to negotiate a deal to remove tariffs.\n\nNetanyahu's office has not confirmed the visit, that would likely also include discussions on Iran and Israel's war against Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza. The visit was first reported by Axios.\n\nThe surprise invite by Trump came in a phone call on Thursday with Netanyahu, who is presently on a visit to Hungary, when the Israeli leader raised the tariff issue, according to the Israeli officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nAs part of a sweeping new tariff policy announced by Trump, unspecified Israeli goods exports to the United States face a 17% tariff. The U.S. is Israel's closest ally and largest single trading partner.\n\nAn Israeli finance ministry official said on Thursday that Trump's latest tariff announcement could impact Israel's exports of machinery and medical equipment.\n\nIsrael had already moved to cancel its remaining tariffs on U.S. imports on Tuesday. The two countries signed a free trade agreement 40 years ago and about 98% of goods from the U.S. are now tax-free.\n\n- Reuters\n\nBefore Wednesday, President Donald Trump's tariffs were expected to be a problem for markets and the economy, but a manageable one. What actually emerged, though, has been economic and geopolitical mayhem.\n\nIt started with Trump's Rose Garden news conference Wednesday after the market close, when the president slapped 10% tariffs on every U.S. trading partner starting Saturday, with individualized rates for 60 other countries that would begin in a week. Virtually overnight, the effective U.S. tariff rate was set to spring from 2.5% to well past 20%.\n\nChina retaliated with 34% tariffs on all goods, European Union leaders also are considering countermeasures.\n\nMarkets recoiled at the developments, sending stocks into a vicious two-day sell-off that put the Nasdaq Composite, home to powerhouse Silicon Valley names that Trump has been courting in the early days of his second term, into a bear market.\n\n- Jeff Cox\n\n- Terri Cullen\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "House Republican Will Introduce Bill Challenging Trump's Tariffs-As Speaker Johnson Reportedly Urges Tariff Support\n\nBy Alison Durkee\n\nBy Alison Durkee , Forbes Staff. Alison is a senior news reporter covering US politics and legal news.\n\nBy Alison Durkee ,\n\nForbes Staff.\n\nRep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., is planning to introduce legislation Monday that would restrict President Donald Trump's tariffs, as GOP opposition grows against the president's signature economic policy-though House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is reportedly so far telling lawmakers to back the president.\n\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., at a news conference on March 25 in Washington, DC.\n\nHouse Republicans should \"hold the line\" on Trump's tariffs and not oppose them, Johnson told his colleagues on a call Sunday, as reported by The Wall Street Journal, saying they should trust that Trump and his instincts will ultimately improve the economy, and just give the tariffs \"time\" to play out.\n\nRep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., asked for House lawmakers to receive a briefing on the tariffs because they haven't been looped in on what the president's plan is for them, the Journal and Punchbowl News report , with Johnson reportedly saying he'd speak with Trump and get someone to brief lawmakers.\n\nTrump imposed sweeping tariffs on nearly all countries last week that have wreaked havoc in the stock market and spurred economists to warn of a possible recession, leading even some Republican lawmakers to speak out against the policy and the tariffs' possible impacts on their constituents.\n\nSeven Republican senators have so far signed on as co-sponsors of a Senate bill that would require the White House to get congressional approval to impose tariffs, with Bacon telling CBS News he'll introduce a companion bill in the House on Monday.\n\nIt's so far unlikely that the legislation will actually pass Congress-let alone get a majority large enough to overrule Trump if he vetoes it-though Bacon said he thinks, \"If we continue to see the stock market go a certain direction, or if we see inflation or unemployment shift in a bad way, I think then this bill becomes a very viable bill.\"\n\nWith seven Republicans already backing the legislation potentially clawing back Trump's tariffs, only a few more GOP senators would be needed to give the bill the 60 votes it needs to pass. Bacon acknowledged on CBS on Sunday that he thinks \"it will be harder to pass this in the House,\" but if the bill were to get a 60-vote majority in the Senate, \"they'll put pressure on the House to look at this.\" \"So it will not pass tomorrow, or maybe in the next couple of weeks, but this will be in the queue that we can use, and it's time that Congress restores its authorities here,\" Bacon told CBS about Trump's tariffs. \"The Constitution is clear, the House and the Senate, Congress, has the power of tariffs and taxes, and we gave some of that power to the executive branch, and I think in hindsight, that was a mistake.\" It's still unclear how many House Republicans could throw their support behind Bacon's bill when he introduces it Monday.\n\nThe seven Republican senators so far co-sponsoring the bill reining in Trump's tariff power are Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, Jerry Moran, R-Kan., Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, Thom Tillis, R-N.C., Todd Young, R-Ind., Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Susan Collins, R-Maine. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., also backed a resolution opposing Trump's tariffs on Canada last week, and has decried tariffs as a \"tax\" and said it's a \"fallacy to think that it'll help the country.\" Some other Republicans have also expressed concerns about Trump's tariffs but haven't backed any legislation opposing them, such as Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who said on his podcast Friday he's \"not a fan\" of tariffs and the White House's plan could \"hurt jobs and hurt America\" and harm Republicans in the 2026 midterms. \"If we go into a recession - particularly a bad recession - 2026 in all likelihood, politically would be a bloodbath,\" Cruz argued, as quoted by Politico.\n\nTrump's sweeping tariffs on nearly all countries fulfilled a longtime campaign promise by the president, who has long championed widespread tariffs despite warnings from experts that doing so would destabilize the economy. While so far limited, the willingness of even some Republicans to diverge from Trump on tariffs has been notable, as GOP lawmakers in both the House and Senate have so far been overwhelmingly supportive of the president's agenda. Republicans in Congress have been typically unwilling to push back on even proposals that have weakened Congress' power, such as canceling congressionally approved funding. The discussion over the new Senate and House legislation that would claw back Congress' power on tariffs comes after Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., introduced a resolution opposing Trump's previous tariffs on Canada, which passed Wednesday with the support of four Republican senators: Collins, McConnell, Murkowski and Paul."

      "text": "Trump's Sister Declared The Immigration Law He Used Unconstitutional\n\nBy Stuart Anderson\n\nBy Stuart Anderson ,\n\nSenior Contributor.\n\nDonald Trump talks to reporters from the Resolute Desk after signing an executive order on January ... More 30, 2025. In a historical twist, Donald Trump's sister was the federal judge who ruled unconstitutional the immigration law the Trump administration is using to deport a pro-Palestinian protester. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nIn a historical twist, Donald Trump's sister was the federal judge who ruled unconstitutional the immigration law the Trump administration is using to deport a pro-Palestinian protester. In 1996, U.S. District Judge Maryanne Trump Barry wrote an opinion that declared unconstitutional the part of U.S. immigration law that Donald Trump has promised to continue employing to deport protesters. The current case has captured headlines and will test the Trump administration's immigration authority.\n\nOn March 8, 2025, Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a lawful permanent resident and pro-Palestinian protester who graduated in December from Columbia University. Controversy over the arrest surrounded the Trump administration using a provision in immigration law that allows for deportation if the Secretary of State believes an alien's presence or activities \"would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\"\n\nIn 1995, Secretary of State Warren Christopher used the same authority when attempting to deport Ruiz Massieu to Mexico. As presented by the court documents, the circumstances in that case were quite different from the arrest of Mahmoud Khalil.\n\nIn September 1994, Ruiz Massieu's brother, a prominent member of PRI, Mexico's ruling party, was assassinated. As Deputy Attorney General, Ruiz Massieu investigated and identified a PRI official, Manuel Munoz Rocha, as the lead conspirator in his brother's killing. Rocha was protected, first by official immunity and later by disappearing before an interview could be conducted. In late November 1994, Massieu resigned in a public speech and later published a book criticizing the PRI.\n\nAfter Mexican officials sought his arrest, he entered the United States legally as a visitor (he owned property in Texas) and flew to Spain with a stopover at Newark Airport. In Newark, he was arrested for declaring only $18,000 of the $44,322 in cash with him. While the declaration infraction was later dropped, the Mexican government charged him with crimes \"against the administration of justice\" and sought his extradition.\n\nThe U.S. government failed four times to convince a judge that Massieu should be extradited to Mexico. The Mexican government showed that Massieu had $9 million in a bank account in Houston but could not prove that it had been illegally obtained.\n\n\"It was then, however, that this case took a turn toward the truly Kafkaesque,\" writes U.S. District Judge Maryanne Trump Barry, Donald Trump's sister. She notes that the Immigration and Naturalization Service took Massieu into custody. \"He was ordered to show cause as to why he should not be deported because, the Secretary of State has made a determination that . . . there is reasonable ground to believe your presence or activities in the United States would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States .\" (Emphasis added.) In 1996, the provision was Section 241(a)(4)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act but it was later redesignated Section 237(a)(4)(C)(i) due to other changes in the INA. The language in both designations is identical.\n\nOn February 28, 1996, U.S. District Judge Maryanne Trump Barry issued an opinion declaring unconstitutional the provision in the Immigration and Nationality now being used in the deportation of Mahmoud Khalil. He is being held in a detention facility in Louisiana.\n\n\"Notwithstanding the political branches' near plenary power over aliens, this power is circumscribed by the constitutional constraints imposed on the exercise of all governmental authority,\" wrote the judge in her opinion in Massieu v. Reno . \"It is a fundamental tenet of the law in this area that both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments protect aliens from the deprivation of life, liberty and property without due process of law.\" Attorneys today have used similar language to challenge her brother's immigration policies.\n\nMaryanne Trump Barry provided three reasons why it was unconstitutional to allow the government to deport an individual based on the Secretary of State declaring the person's presence or activities would have \"potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\"\n\nFirst, the provision was unconstitutional under the \"void-for-vagueness\" doctrine. She cited an earlier Supreme Court decision that noted, \"Living under a rule of law entails various suppositions, one of which is all persons are entitled to be informed as to what the State commands and forbids.\"\n\nThe judge cited the immigration provision and wrote, \"It simply cannot be disputed, and indeed the government does not, that the statute provides absolutely no notice to aliens as to what is required of them under the statute. Simply stated, it 'contains no standard for determining what a suspect has to do in order to satisfy' its requirements.\" (She cited Kolender, 461 U.S. at 358, 103 S. Ct. at 1858.)\n\nSecond, the judge wrote that the statute \"also deprives aliens such as plaintiff of due process of law by denying them a meaningful opportunity to be heard.\" In her opinion, U.S. District Judge Barry declared, \"The issue . . . is whether an alien who is in this country legally can, merely because he is here, have his liberty restrained and be forcibly removed to a specific country in the unfettered discretion of the Secretary of State and without any meaningful opportunity to be heard. The answer is a ringing 'no.'\"\n\nThird, the judge wrote that the statute represented an unconstitutional delegation of authority from Congress to the executive branch, giving the Secretary of State limitless authority in this area. \"Here, the government has offered no means of limiting the Secretary's authority . . . by reference to the text, related statutes, legislative history, or common understandings,\" according to U.S. District Judge Maryanne Trump Barry. \"Neither can this court conceive of a way to judicially circumscribe the discretion afforded to the Secretary so as to impose a 'recognized standard' upon the Secretary's otherwise 'totally unrestricted freedom of choice.'\"\n\n\"This court concludes that by leaving deportability determinations to the wholly unguided and unreviewable discretion of the Secretary of State, 241(a)(4)(C)(i) of the INA [later redesignated 237(a)(4)(C)(i)] represents an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power by which Congress eliminated the judiciary's constitutionally required function of review while abdicating its lawmaking responsibilities in favor of standardless executive discretion,\" wrote the judge.\n\nDonald Trump, Maryanne Trump, and Robert Trump during Opening of Donald Trump's Taj Mahal Casino on ... More April 5, 1990. (Photo by Ron Galella/Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images)\n\nIn September 1999, Ruiz Massieu committed suicide following four years of house arrest. His death occurred two days before an arraignment on money laundering charges. His wife and authorities said he \"died from an overdose of antidepressants, derailing a trial that was likely to touch the highest echelons of power in Mexico and further tangle U.S.-Mexican relations,\" reported Newsweek .\n\nMaryanne Trump Barry retired from the federal bench in 2019. She passed away in November 2023. In July 1996, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit overturned her decision in Massieu v. Reno for technical reasons unrelated to her constitutional arguments. \"We do not reach the merits of the constitutional questions decided by the district court,\" wrote Samuel Alito, now a Supreme Court Justice. \"Instead, we hold that the district lacked jurisdiction to entertain plaintiff's claims. . . . if plaintiff wished to challenge the efforts to deport him, he was required to exhaust available administrative remedies and then petition for review in this court.\"\n\nOn March 17, 2025, attorneys for Mahmoud Khalil, including the Center for Constitutional Rights and the ACLU Foundation, filed a motion for preliminary injunctive relief and named Donald Trump as one of the respondents. Khalil's lawyers did not include the opinion of U.S. District Judge Maryanne Trump Barry in their filing, unsurprising given the decision was overturned on technical grounds related to exhausting administrative remedies.\n\nHowever, the filing echoed a crucial argument in her opinion. \"Mr. Khalil is also likely to succeed on his claim that the challenged Policy does not satisfy due process because it is void for vagueness ,\" his attorneys wrote. \"The Policy, including as applied to Mr. Khalil, does not give the proper notice to anyone residing in the country which of their otherwise-lawful speech, opinions, beliefs, or advocacy will result in the government targeting them for detention and removal, and it provides government officials with unfettered discretion to target disfavored speech.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\nThirty years ago, Donald Trump's sister may have crafted one of the strongest legal arguments against his immigration policy."

The margin of error was plus or minus 2.5 percentage points.\n\nThe poll, which was conducted after Trump imposed some tariffs but before he announced sweeping tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners in Wednesday, found that 54 percent of people oppose Trump's tariffs on imports, while 42 percent support them.\n\nIt also found that 52 percent think the economy is getting worse rather than better, up from 37 percent who said the same in January.\n\nIt comes as several recent polls have shown Trump's approval rating on the decline.\n\nOn Friday, his approval rating turned negative for the first time during his second term with Rasmussen, which is generally considered a Republican-leaning pollster.\n\nTrump's approval rating fell to 43 percent, the lowest since his return to office, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Wednesday.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nDonald Trump's sweeping tariffs have thrown the global stock market into chaos and are likely to hurt the U.S. economy by increasing inflation, economists warned-but they may also finally bring mortgage rates down.\n\nFollowing the president's announcement of new tariffs on what he called \"Liberation Day\" last week, mortgage rates fell to their lowest level in six months, offering some respite to aspiring homebuyers struggling with shrinking affordability on the U.S. market.\n\nMortgage rates shot up in 2022 as a result of the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate-hiking campaign to combat the rise of inflation and have remained high despite the central bank's recent cuts to its interest rates.\n\nHistorically high mortgage rates have exacerbated the country's housing affordability crisis, contributing to eroding potential homebuyers' purchasing power.\n\nTrump has announced a 10 percent baseline tariff on imported goods, with higher rates for specific countries-including 20 percent on imports from the European Union and 35 percent on Chinese goods.\n\nSeveral economists have warned that these tariffs could lead to higher prices for American consumers, slower growth and higher unemployment-as well as higher construction costs that could slow down homebuilding across the country.\n\nA rise in inflation is likely to prevent the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates significantly, a move that many have been counting on to improve affordability in the U.S. housing market.\n\nBut as of April 3, one day after the president's announcement, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 6.64 percent, down 0.01 from a week earlier and 0.18 from a year earlier, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, better known as Freddie Mac.\n\nAs of the same day, the 15-year fixed-rate mortgage was 5.82 percent, down 0.07 from a week earlier and 0.24 from a year earlier.\n\nThe recent decline in mortgage rates is giving Americans more purchasing power.\n\nAs rates fell from 6.82 percent on March 27 to 6.55 on April 4, a buyer on a $3,000 budget has gained about $9,000 in purchasing power. The same buyer can now afford a $458,750 home with a 6.55 percent mortgage rate, according to Redfin-the lowest daily average mortgage rate in six months.\n\nSince mid-January, when mortgage rates hit 7.26 percent, a buyer on a $3,000 budget has gained a total of $25,000 in purchasing power.\n\nDespite this obvious positive development for buyers, housing costs remain near record highs, keeping many on the sidelines of the market even as spring buying season heats up. In the four weeks ending March 30, the typical U.S. homebuyer's monthly payment hit a record high of $2,802, according to Redfin.\n\nRedfin Economics Research Lead Chen Zhao said in a statement: \"Even in times of great economic uncertainty, there are people who need to move. For those weary homebuyers, this drop in mortgage rates could be a silver lining of this week's historic tariffs announcement. However, a word of caution for the general public: This is a wait-and-see moment. Tariffs and the fallout we've already seen in the stock market are impacting the economy and could create more volatility in the housing market.\"\n\nMelissa Cohn, regional vice president of William Raveis Mortgage, previously told Newsweek : \"Mortgage rates are going down at the moment. However, when the higher costs of goods start to push up the rate of inflation, it is quite possible that rates will go back up. I expect to be on a mortgage rate roller coaster for the next few months.\"\n\nAlex Beene, a financial literacy instructor for the University of Tennessee at Martin, previously told Newsweek : \"Further inflation to both housing costs and other commonly purchased items could cause the Fed to reverse course on dropping interest rates and play a key role in increasing-not decreasing-mortgage expenses. As it stands right now, this is a worst-case-scenario for homebuyers.\"\n\nWhile mortgage rates have fallen as a result of Trump's tariffs announcement, Redfin's Zhao warned that this decline is likely to be temporary as \"much uncertainty and volatility lies ahead.\"\n\n\"The future for mortgage rates depends on whether the inflationary or the recessionary effects of tariffs dominate, and how the Fed chooses to respond,\" Zhao wrote in an update released last week. \"Some clues will emerge as we see how various countries choose to respond, and we hear from Fed Chair Powell later this morning.\"\n\nEarlier this year, a majority of experts forecast mortgage rates to remain between 6 percent and 7 percent throughout 2025 and 2026.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nGiulia Carbonaro is a Newsweek reporter based in London, U.K. Her focus is on the U.S. economy, housing market, property insurance market, local and national politics.

Languages: English.\n\nBased on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\n\nNewsweek AI is in beta. Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresident Donald Trump 's approval rating has risen by 5 percentage points among Democrats , according to new polling.\n\nIt comes at a time when the Democrats are more unpopular than ever following their performance in the 2024 election, when Trump improved his performance in almost every state. The Republican Party also flipped the Senate and held on to a narrow House majority.\n\nThe scale of Trump's triumph has sparked widespread soul-searching within the Democratic Party over what went wrong and how to rebuild. But polls suggest the party is struggling to find its feet.\n\nAccording to the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted between March 31-April 2 among 1,486 respondents, Trump's approval rating among Democrats currently stands at 8 percent. That is up from 3 percent in a similar poll conducted in early March.\n\nHis disapproval rating among Democrats has also decreased, from 95 percent in February, to 92 percent now.\n\nWhile Trump's approval rating among Democrats has risen, among members of his own party, it has stayed the same at 86 percent. His disapproval rating also remains the same at 12 percent.\n\nThe poll also shows that Trump is becoming less popular among independent voters, with his approval rating dropping by 7 points in the space of a month, to 37 percent. His disapproval rating has risen by 6 points to 59 percent. The poll had a margin of error of +/- 3 percentage points.\n\nThe latest YouGov/Economist poll, conducted between March 30-April 1 among 1,626 adults, showed the same trend, with Trump's approval rating among Democrats at 9 percent, up from 6 percent in a poll conducted in early March.\n\nThose disapproving were also down 6 points to 87 percent. Trump's approval rating has also taken a hit among independents, according to the poll, dropping to 33 percent, compared to 37 percent in the previous poll. Meanwhile, his disapproval rating was up 3 points to 57 percent.\n\nBut the YouGov/Economist poll differed from the Ipsos/Reuters one in that it showed Trump's approval rating among Republicans has gone up by 3 points to 93 percent, while his disapproval rating has been slashed to 5 percent, down from 7 percent last time. The poll had a margin of error of +/- 3 percentage points.\n\nIt comes as polls have shown that the Democrats are more unpopular than ever after the party's loss to Trump in November. According to an NBC News poll from March 7-11, 55 percent of respondents said they had a negative view of the Democratic Party, while 27 percent said they had a positive perception. That is the lowest level recorded since NBC News began asking the question in 1990.\n\nThere was also evidence of dissatisfaction with the party from its base, with 20 percent of Democratic voters viewing it negatively, twice as high as the figure for Republicans who had a negative view of their party. The poll had a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.\n\nThe survey showed that Democratic voters wanted their party to take a tougher position in Congress . Among Democratic voters, 65 percent said they wanted their congressional representatives to \"stick to their positions even if that means not being able to get things done in Washington,\" while 32 percent said they should \"make compromises with Trump to gain consensus on legislation.\"\n\nNonetheless, Alejandro Verdin, a Democratic strategist, was keen to point out that we shouldn't read too much into the bump in Trump's approval rating among Democrats.\n\nHe told Newsweek that recent Democratic successes in Wisconsin and underperformance by Republicans in Florida show that the Republicans are the ones in trouble. Wisconsin yesterday elected a liberal Democrat-backed Supreme Court justice by a nine point margin, and overperformed in a special congressional election in Florida, but still missed out on winning.\n\nVerdin said that the small rise in Trump's approval is \"meaningless\" and shouldn't be overinterpreted, noting that people's dissatisfaction with Trump and figures like Elon Musk will only grow leading up to the midterms.\n\n\"Democrats are finding our footing and are going to fight back and win,\" he said.\n\nThomas Gift, an associate professor at University College London, expressed the same sentiment, stating that Trump's popularity among Democrats remains low. He suggested that small fluctuations in Trump's approval could be \"just noise\", with any gains likely coming from populist-leaning Democrats who resonate with Trump's rhetoric on working-class issues and globalization.\n\nBut Democratic strategist Christy Setzer noted that her party has been \"weak\" in the face of Trump-something that has frustrated voters.\n\n\"Democrats aren't standing up strongly against the biggest threat to our economy and our democracy in history,\" she told Newsweek .\n\nIn a recent interview on Real Time with Bill Mahe r, California Governor Gavin Newsom described his party's brand as \"toxic.\"\n\n\"Democrats, we tend to be a little more judgmental than we should be,\" Newsom added.\n\n\"We need to own our mistakes. We need to own what's wrong with our party.\"\n\nNewsweek's average of the 10 most recently published polls shows that Trump's approval rating currently stands at 47 percent, while 49 percent disapprove.\n\nIt comes as many polls have shown his approval rating on the decline. A poll conducted by Marquette University Law School between March 17 to March 27 among 1,021 adults showed that Trump's approval rating had dropped to 46 percent, while 54 percent said they disapproved. In January, 48 percent approved and 52 percent disapproved. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.\n\nBoth the Reuters/Ipsos and YouGov/Economist polls showed Trump's overall approval rating has changed marginally in the past month. In the Reuters/Ipsos poll, it declined by 1 point to 43 percent, while his disapproval also rose by 1 point to 53 percent. In the YouGov/Economist poll, Trump approval rating went up by 1 point to 46 percent, while his disapproval dropped a point to 49 percent.\n\nThe drop in Trump's approval rating has been mirrored by growing dissatisfaction with how he is handling the economy, reflected in the polls.\n\nTrump's 47 percent approval rating is lower than former President Joe Biden 's popularity at the same point in his presidency on April 3, 2021, when he stood at 54 percent, with a disapproval rating of 42 percent, according to RealClearPolitics.\n\nPolls released in the days after Trump's inauguration showed his popularity at an all-time high. However, he was still the least popular president in recent times.\n\nAccording to Gallup's first poll of Trump's second term, conducted between January 21 and 27, his initial approval rating was 47 percent. The pollster said this figure made him less popular than any president since 1953 at the start of a term and the only one to begin with a sub-50 percent approval rating. Gallup said Biden started his first term with a 57 percent approval rating.\n\nThe RealClearPolitics tracker shows that on April 3, 2017, Trump's approval rating was 40 percent, while his disapproval rating was 53 percent, giving him a net approval rating of -13 points, making Trump more popular now than at the same point in his first term.\n\nAlejandro Verdin, Democratic strategist, told Newsweek : \"We just watched Democrats successfully mobilize and message to voters in Wisconsin, where people turned out in droves to crush Trump's candidate for Supreme Court. In Florida, Republicans completely underperformed in districts Trump carried last November.\n\n\"This all happened at the same time that people are growing more concerned about the economy and Trump's overall approval is at the lowest it's been since returning to office.\n\n\"What's happening right now is not a problem for Democrats. Republicans are the ones in hot water. The small bump is meaningless and we shouldn't read too much into it. People's dissatisfaction with Trump and his crony Elon Musk are only going to grow in the year and a half until the midterms. Democrats are finding our footing and are going to fight back and win.\"\n\nThomas Gift, an associate professor of political science and the director of the Centre on U.S. Politics at University College London, told Newsweek : \"First thing's first, Trump remains enormously unpopular among Democrats. Small blips in his approvals could be just noise, and it's unclear how meaningful these figures are given that they're so close to falling within the margin of error.\n\n\"In all likelihood, Trump's gains are coming from more populist-oriented Democrats who are coming around to Trump's rhetoric about helping the working class and revitalizing American industries, while taking concrete steps like tariffs that push back against globalization and other neoliberal policies.\"\n\nChristy Setzer, Democratic strategist, told Newsweek : \"To quote Bill Clinton , people will often choose 'strong and wrong' over 'weak and right.' Trump is certainly 'wrong,' but 'weak and right' is about the kindest thing one could say about the Democratic Party right now. With few notable exceptions-Cory Booker's 25-hour filibuster being one of them-Democrats aren't standing up strongly against the biggest threat to our economy and our democracy in history. Senate Democrats are still voting for Trump's nominees!\n\n\"And though one can argue Schumer's position that voting against Trump's budget would have caused even greater damage through a (perma-) government shutdown, there's no excuse for 'playing dead.' That makes Democrats furious-maybe even to the point of saying they'd rather crash the economy with Trump than go with the party that can't stand up to it.\"\n\nTrump's approval rating will likely fluctuate in the coming weeks, depending on the outcome of key events, including critical negotiations on the Russia-Ukraine war, the growing tariff battle with countries such as Canada, and concerns about a recession.\n\nUpdate 4/3/2025, 11:36 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with comment from Thomas Gift and Alejandro Verdin.\n\nUpdate 4/4/2025, 04:58 a.m. ET: This article has been updated with comment from Christy Setzer.\n\nMartha McHardy is a U.S. News reporter based in London, U.K. Her focus is on polling and California politics.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nAs President Donald Trump 's tariffs spark alarm and criticism from across the political spectrum, analysts at conservative think tank the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) believe the formula used to calculate the import levies is \"based on an error.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out to the White House for comment on Saturday.\n\nTrump's tariff move sent Wall Street and the global economy into a tailspin when he announced on Wednesday that the United States would impose a 10 percent \"baseline\" tariff on virtually all imports . He also singled out roughly 60 countries for what he described as \"discounted reciprocal tariffs,\" with some being set at more than 40 percent.\n\nHe explained that the \"reciprocal\" tariffs were based on tariffs those countries imposed on the U.S. The numbers Trump cited, however, were inaccurate and the White House clarified later on that the formula it used was based on just two variables: the U.S.'s trade deficit with a foreign country divided by that country's exports to the U.S.\n\nTrump then halved that number to arrive at his \"discounted reciprocal tariff,\" which he said he was doing to be \"kind.\"\n\nThe Washington Post reported Friday, citing two sources who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, that the final tariff rates Trump displayed on a chart he held up during a widely televised Rose Garden speech were set just three hours before the address .\n\nTrump's decision to use his simplified formula also scuttled weeks of efforts by government officials across federal agencies, who had deliberated over how to set the tariffs while taking into account a wide range of tariff and non-tariff barriers and global trade practices, the newspaper's report said.\n\nOn Friday, AEI released a report on the formula, which criticized the tariffs and said the purported formula was incorrect. The new analysis was titled, \"President Trump's Tariff Formula Makes No Economic Sense. It's Also Based on an Error.\"\n\nThe report's authors, senior fellows Kevin Corinth and Stan Veuger, wrote that a \"trade deficit with a given country is not determined only by tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers, but also by international capital flows, supply chains, comparative advantage, geography, etc.\"\n\nThe two added that even if the formula is taken seriously, \"it makes an error that inflates the tariffs assumed to be levied by foreign countries four-fold,\" causing the tariffs to be highly inflated.\n\n\"The formula published by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has two additional terms in the denominator that just so happen to cancel out: (1) the elasticity of import demand with respect to import prices, ε, and (2) the elasticity of import prices with respect to tariffs, φ,\" the authors wrote.\n\nTheir analysis continues: \"The idea is that as tariffs rise, the change in the trade deficit will depend on the responsiveness of import demand to tariffs, which depends on how import demand responds to import prices and how import prices respond to tariffs. The Trump Administration assumes an elasticity of import demand with respect to import prices of four, and an elasticity of import prices with respect to tariffs of 0.25, the product of which is one and is the reason they cancel out in the Administration's formula.\n\n\"However, the elasticity of import prices with respect to tariffs should be about one (actually 0.945), not 0.25 as the Trump Administration states. Their mistake is that they base the elasticity on the response of retail prices to tariffs, as opposed to import prices as they should have done. The article they cite by Alberto Cavallo and his coauthors makes this distinction clear. The authors state that 'tariffs [are] passed through almost fully to US import prices,' while finding 'more mixed evidence regarding retail price increases.' It is inconsistent to multiply the elasticity of import demand with respect to import prices by the elasticity of retail prices with respect to tariffs.\"\n\nPolling analyst Nate Silver shared the report on Friday on X, formerly Twitter, and wrote: \"OMG they applied their stupid f***ing formula incorrectly?!?\"\n\nIn a separate X post, Silver wrote that the administration \"dramatically increased the chance of a recession, wiped out trillions on wealth, and delivered a COVID-magnitude shock to the global economy...because they applied their stupid f***ing formula incorrectly?\"\n\nPau Pujolas, professor of economics at McMaster University, previously told Newsweek : \"The way in which we calculate the tariffs is using a sophisticated quantitative model that needs to go through a supercomputer to speed up what the tariff rates are. I do not think that that's what they have done.\"\n\nTrump trade adviser Peter Navarro told CNBC this week that the calculations were \"based on very sophisticated analyses in the trade literature for decades.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Truth Social on Saturday: \"THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN. HANG TOUGH, it won't be easy, but the end result will be historic. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"\n\nTrump and his allies have said there may be some temporary economic \"disruption,\" but that tariffs will ultimately benefit the U.S. economy and Americans.\n\nTrading partners have responded in various ways to the newly imposed tariffs, with some announcing reciprocal measures . Others are holding off or attempting to negotiate with the Trump administration to lower the rates.\n\nMeanwhile, the stock market reacted negatively this past week, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average shedding more than 1,500 points on back-to-back days for the first time ever. The average plunged more than 2,200 points on Friday after dropping over 1,600 on Thursday.\n\nThe president has insisted that markets will \"boom\" as a result of his trade war.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nJason Lemon is a Senior Politics Editor at Newsweek based in Brooklyn, New York.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nDonald Trump's approval rating has hit a new low, according to a poll from a Republican-leaning firm.\n\nTrump's approval rating is a key indicator of his political strength as he navigates his second presidential term and prepares for future policy battles.\n\nA shift in his numbers could influence support from Republican lawmakers; affect his ability to push through his agenda; and shape the political landscape, heading into the midterm election cycle.\n\nAccording to Rasmussen's daily poll tracker, as of April 3, Trump's approval rating sits at 49 percent, while 49 percent disapprove of his job performance.\n\nThat is the first time in Trump's second term that Rasmussen's tracker has shown the president without a net positive approval rating. It is also the first time during his second term that his approval rating has dipped below 50 points on Rasmussen's tracker.\n\nMany polls have shown his approval rating on the decline in recent days.\n\nNewsweek's average of the 10 most recently published polls shows that Trump's approval rating stands at 47 percent, while 49 percent disapprove. That is a decline from early March, when Trump's approval rating peaked at 49 percent, while 47 percent disapproved.\n\nMeanwhile, the most-recent TIPP Insights poll, conducted between March 26 and 28 among 1,452 respondents, showed that 44 percent approve of Trump, while 45 percent disapprove, giving him a net approval rating of -1. The poll had a margin of error of ± 3 points.\n\nA previous TIPP Insights poll from January showed that Trump's net approval rating stood at +5 points, with 46 percent approving and 41 percent disapproving.\n\nA poll conducted by Marquette University Law School between March 17 and March 27 among 1,021 adults also showed that Trump's approval rating had dropped to 46 percent, while 54 percent said they disapproved. In January, 48 percent approved and 52 percent disapproved. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.\n\nAnd according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted between March 31 and April 2 among 1,486 respondents, Trump's approval rating fell to 43 percent, the lowest since his return to office. Overall, the president was down 2 percentage points from a poll conducted March 21 to 23, and 4 points below the 47 percent approval he had shortly after taking office on January 20. The poll had a margin of error of +/- 3 percentage points.\n\nThe drop in Trump's approval rating has been mirrored by growing dissatisfaction with how he is handling the economy.\n\nFears of a recession have sprouted in recent weeks in reaction to a number of Trump economic policies, including tariffs on countries including Canada, Mexico and China. Goldman Sachs previously estimated this could push up inflation by 1 percent while squeezing U.S. companies' profits.\n\nTrump also announced a raft of new tariffs on various countries on Wednesday, which sent the markets into turmoil.\n\nThe Marquette poll showed that 58 percent of adults think tariffs hurt the U.S. economy. The same amount think Trump's policies will increase inflation.\n\nOn Monday, Goldman Sachs raised its odds of a recession in 2025 to 35 percent, up from 20 percent previously. That is the company's highest recession probability since the regional banking crisis two years ago.\n\nMeanwhile, JP Morgan now says the chances of a recession this year stand at 40 percent, with both business sentiment and consumer confidence having slumped in recent weeks.\n\nTrump's 47 percent approval rating is lower than former President Joe Biden 's popularity at the same point in his presidency on April 4, 2021, when he stood at 54 percent, with a disapproval rating of 42 percent, according to RealClearPolitics.\n\nPolls released in the days after Trump's inauguration showed his popularity at an all-time high.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresident Trump signaled Monday that he has no intention of backing down from his sweeping tariff plans, despite speculation that rising market volatility might prompt a pause. Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump dismissed the idea outright, even as he claimed multiple countries were eager to negotiate new trade agreements with the U.S.\n\nWhat to Know:\n\nThis live blog is now closed.\n\nTrump on Monday repeated his long-standing criticism of the European Union's trade practices, calling them unfair and one-sided.\n\n\"It's got to be fair and reciprocal. It's not fair,\" Trump said, pointing to limited U.S. car sales in Europe as an example. He claimed the U.S. trade deficit with the EU, roughly $350 billion, would \"disappear fast\" if Europe began purchasing more American energy.\n\n\"They're going to have to buy it from us. We can knock off $350 billion in one week,\" he said.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that Israel will eliminate its trade deficit with the United States and swiftly remove its tariffs. Speaking alongside Trump after their Oval Office meeting, Netanyahu emphasized the importance of balanced trade.\n\n\"Free trade has to be fair trade,\" Netanyahu said, pledging that Israel would act \"quickly\" to drop its tariffs. In response, Trump said, \"That's very nice, thank you.\"\n\nThe remarks come amid heightened global trade tensions following new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.\n\nTrump said today that he is \"not looking at\" a pause in tariffs.\n\nAn emerging grassroots campaign group is stepping up its plan for economic \"blackouts\" and boycotts against American retailers, with a rolling series of direct-action protests planned well into the summer. The group is currently calling on shoppers to boycott Walmart this week .\n\nFuture events will focus on hitting the profits being made by Walmart, General Mills, Amazon , Target , and McDonalds.\n\nWalmart told Newsweek, in part, \"Serving communities is at the heart of Walmart's purpose to help people save money and live better.\" Newsweek has also contacted the other four companies by email seeking comment.\n\nThe movement was initiated as a response to corporate rollbacks of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs-notably at companies like Target-and also in protest against President Trump's plans to cut the government workforce, NPR reported.\n\nThe events are being run by a group called People's Union USA , and founder John Schwarz has previously told Newsweek that the organization's \"mission\" is designed to force \"corporations to start paying their fair share of taxes so the American people can finally be relieved of the burden of federal income tax.\" Schwarz has also cited a number of other factors behind the movement , including a drive for equality, opposition to rising prices, and an attempt to help smaller local businesses.\n\nThe group emphasized broader goals: \"economic resistance, government accountability, and corporate reform.\" Founder John Schwarz said the campaign is not about Elon Musk or Trump, but about \"the system as a whole.\" The group advocates eliminating federal income tax, capping corporate profits, and \"promoting equality for all.\"\n\nRead the full story by Chloe Mayer on Newsweek.\n\nWall Street is edging closer to a bear market as growing concerns over President Trump's sweeping tariffs shake investor confidence. Analysts warn that added taxes on imported goods could severely impact global economic growth.\n\nA bear market is defined by a sustained drop of 20% or more from recent highs. The S&P 500 was down 1.2% on Monday afternoon and is now 18.4% below its February peak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 1.8%, while the Nasdaq, already in bear territory, dropped another 0.9%.\n\nSome analysts say the current downturn resembles the rapid 2020 bear market more than the slower decline of 2022.\n\nU.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer is set to testify before the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday, revealing that nearly 50 countries have reached out to discuss the new tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. In written testimony obtained by Reuters, Greer noted that countries like Argentina, Vietnam, and Israel have expressed intentions to reduce their tariffs and non-tariff barriers.\n\nGreer acknowledged that the U.S. trade deficit, which has persisted for over three decades, won't be solved immediately, but emphasized that these steps are a positive move towards addressing the issue.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has announced tariffs reaching up to 54 percent on Chinese imports, continuing his trade war with China from his first time in office. But this time, the stakes are different, and Beijing's response has caught Washington off guard.\n\nInstead of triggering panic in Beijing, Trump's announcement has been met with strategic calculation. Chinese officials didn't mirror the tariff escalation in kind. They went for precision. China strategically targeted $15 billion in U.S. agricultural exports, delivering a precise blow to Republican strongholds during peak planting season. The timing compounds the economic anxieties of already struggling farmers.\n\nIn this war of attrition, Beijing isn't just retaliating, it's evolving. Since the first iteration of Trump's trade war in 2018, China has restructured its import portfolio, welcoming Brazil and Russia. American agricultural products once made up 40 percent of China's market; that amount has fallen below 20 percent. Brazil and Russia are now supplying China's growing demand with fewer political strings attached.\n\nRead the full opinion piece by Geostrategic Analyst Imran Khalid on Newsweek.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with Pakistan's Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar following Trump's decision to impose a 29% tariff on exports from Pakistan. The conversation, which took place on Monday, focused on bilateral relations, regional security, and economic cooperation.\n\nIn a statement released by Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Rubio emphasized that future relations between the U.S. and Pakistan would be centered around economic and trade cooperation. This dialogue comes amid significant economic tension, with Pakistan's stock market experiencing a sharp decline following the tariff announcement.\n\nThe European Commission unveiled a proposal on Monday for 25% counter-tariffs on a variety of U.S. goods, a direct response to Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum.\n\nAccording to a document seen by Reuters , the tariffs will be implemented in two phases: some goods will be affected starting May 16, while others will face tariffs beginning December 1.\n\nNotably, bourbon, which had initially been considered for inclusion in the March proposal, has been removed from the final list.\n\nBeijing has sharply criticized Trump's tariffs, citing a 1987 speech by the late President Ronald Reagan as a warning about the dangers of escalating trade wars. The Chinese Embassy in the U.S. shared a video clip of Reagan's remarks on social media, highlighting his warning that high tariffs lead to retaliation, increased trade barriers, and economic harm.\n\nIn the video, Reagan, a Republican, stated, \"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars.\" He went on to describe the devastating consequences of such wars: collapsing markets, business shutdowns, and widespread job losses. The embassy added that Reagan's decades-old words \"find new relevance in 2025,\" signaling China's concerns over the continued imposition of tariffs under Trump's administration.\n\nThe Trump administration has initiated a new wave of visa revocations targeting international students studying at American universities. Universities across the nation, including Harvard University, the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and UCLA, reported that several students had their visas revoked. It remains unclear if these actions are linked to anti-Israel sentiments or political activities on campuses.\n\nAt Harvard University, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revoked the visas of three graduate students and two recent graduates. Similar incidents occurred at other universities, where visa revocations were discovered during routine record reviews, with many institutions not being directly informed by DHS.\n\nThe University of Michigan also saw four students affected by the visa cancellations, with one student already leaving the country. Secretary of State Marco Rubio commented on the situation, stating that visas are being revoked daily due to concerns over students' involvement in activist movements. Rubio emphasized the administration's stance on denying visas to students participating in such activities.\n\nThis development follows ongoing concerns about political movements on US campuses, with the Trump administration taking a cautious approach to student visas, particularly for those linked to organized protests or activism.\n\nThe U.S. is preparing to more than double duties on Canadian softwood lumber, raising tariffs to 34.45%, which will further pressure materials costs in the US housing market, Bloomberg reports. Currently, duties stand at 14.4%, but a memo from the Department of Commerce reveals a proposed increase of 20 percentage points, which would significantly affect lumber imports.\n\nThis comes before Trump potentially imposes additional tariffs on the sector. Trump has ordered a national security investigation into US lumber imports, claiming the U.S. does not need Canadian wood, though US homebuilders argue that more tariffs would only raise housing costs for Americans.\n\nThe dispute stems from the long-standing trade conflict between the US and Canada. The U.S claims Canadian sawmills benefit from subsidies due to low \"stumpage\" fee.s set by provincial governments. Canada, however, maintains that its stumpage system is market-driven, with timber sold through competitive auctions.\n\nLumber is a key industry in Canadian provinces like British Columbia and Quebec, where officials and industry leaders are voicing concerns that the new tariffs will harm local workers and increase housing costs for U.S consumers. In Quebec, companies are struggling to navigate both rising produ.ction costs and the looming trade barriers.\n\nDonald Trump's Monday post on Truth Social signaling a 50% tariff hike on Chinese imports could push the total cost of many goods well over double their original price, as layers of tariffs stack up.\n\nTrump initially imposed a 10% tariff, followed by another 10% linked to fentanyl concerns. Last week, he announced a 34% increase. The latest move appears to tack on an additional 50%.\n\nThat's on top of first-term tariffs of up to 25% that President Joe Biden later expanded-raising rates on Chinese electric vehicles to 100% and boosting tariffs on semiconductors and solar products to 50%.\n\nThe Trump administration on Monday urged the Supreme Court to block a federal judge's order requiring the return of a Maryland man who was deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador. In an emergency appeal, the Justice Department argued that U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis exceeded her authority when she directed the government to bring Kilmar Abrego Garcia back to the United States.\n\nAlthough the administration acknowledged that Abrego Garcia should not have been deported-citing an immigration judge's finding that he likely faced persecution by local gangs-it claimed he is no longer in U.S. custody and cannot be retrieved. Judge Xinis had given the government until just before midnight Tuesday to \"facilitate and effectuate\" his return.\n\nRead the full story by Gabe Whisnant on Newsweek.\n\nAs tariff battles and economic uncertainty continue to rattle markets, NerdWallet investing spokesperson Sam Taube is sharing practical advice for investors looking to stay focused and resilient.\n\nTaube told Newsweek that bear markets, though uncomfortable, are normal and often shorter than bull markets. Staying calm and avoiding panic selling can help investors benefit when markets rebound.\n\nHe also stresses the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective. \"Knee-jerk reactions to short-term drops can lock in losses,\" he notes, while a steady focus on long-term goals allows for recovery and growth.\n\nDiversification remains crucial, especially during downturns. Taube points to recession-resistant sectors like healthcare and the use of bond ladders as ways to build stability. International stocks can also help offset domestic risk.\n\nLastly, he encourages dollar-cost averaging-investing steadily over time-to help smooth out volatility and avoid the pitfalls of trying to time the market.\n\nTrump warned Monday that the U.S. will impose new 50% tariffs on China if it does not roll back its latest round of retaliatory measures. The warning, delivered in a Truth Social post, followed Beijing's announcement of a 34% tariff hike on U.S. goods.\n\nTrump accused China of \"long term trading abuses\" and said any country that retaliates against existing U.S. tariffs will face even higher penalties. He said the new tariffs would take effect April 9 if China does not reverse course by April 8.\n\nHe also threatened to end trade talks with Chinese officials and said negotiations with other countries would begin instead. The statement revived fears of a renewed global trade war and sent shockwaves through markets already rattled by rising protectionism.\n\nThe Trump administration has informed the World Food Program (WFP) and other partners that it is terminating some of the last remaining lifesaving humanitarian initiatives in the Middle East. A U.S. official and a U.N. official confirmed to The Associated Press that around 60 contracts were canceled in the past week, affecting major projects in Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, and other regions like Yemen, Somalia, Afghanistan, and Zimbabwe.\n\nThe terminations, directed by Jeremy Lewin from the Department of Government Efficiency, are part of ongoing efforts to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). The cuts impact vital programs that provide food, medical care, water, and shelter to displaced individuals, contradicting previous administration promises to protect these crucial services. This decision is part of a broader push to reduce perceived wastefulness within USAID and other foreign assistance efforts. There has been no immediate response from the State Department regarding these terminations.\n\nRichard Branson shared his thoughts on leadership and the economic consequences of U.S. tariffs in a series of tweets on April 4.\n\nThe Virgin Group founder emphasized the importance of strong leadership, which includes taking risks but also quickly admitting mistakes and correcting them. Branson argued that the sweeping tariffs imposed by the U.S. government are heading the global economy in a dangerous direction, warning that they will negatively impact people worldwide.\n\n(1/4) Strong leadership means taking risks and trying things - but when it doesn't work, realising your mistake and correcting it. Quickly.\n\nCryptocurrencies, which had remained relatively stable during last week's market turmoil, have now followed the broader market in a sell-off. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, dipped below $75,000 on Monday morning before showing a slight recovery. This marks the lowest price for Bitcoin since just after the 2020 U.S. presidential election when its value surged.\n\nBitcoin's supporters often refer to it as \"digital gold,\" positioning it as a potential hedge against market volatility. However, cryptocurrency analyst Garrick Hileman pointed out that Bitcoin's price drop undermines that theory, as it continues to behave more like a volatile tech stock than a stable asset. Other major digital currencies, such as ether, XRP, and solana, experienced even larger declines during the same period.\n\nThis latest downturn has raised concerns about the true resilience of cryptocurrencies during financial instability.\n\nConcerns are rising about a \"Black Monday\" market crash over President Donald Trump 's tariff hikes and the resulting backlash from China.\n\nMajor stock indexes plunged in Asia on Monday after Wall Street experienced the worst two days since the pandemic last week, the S&P 500 down 6 percent by market close on Friday while the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 5.5 percent. The Nasdaq composite dropped 5.82 percent.\n\nCNBC host and market analyst Jim Cramer on Saturday warned of a repeat of the devastating \"Black Monday\" collapse of October 19, 1987 , when the Dow Jones Industrial Average saw its worse single-day fall and plummeted 22.6 percent.\n\nRead the full story by Khaleda Rahman on Newsweek.\n\nU.S. stock markets reversed earlier losses and rose sharply after White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett revealed that President Trump might consider a 90-day suspension of tariffs on all countries except China.\n\nAs of 10:20 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up by 333.50 points (0.87%), reaching 38,614.49. The S&P 500 gained 79.99 points (1.69%), reaching 5,154.07, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed by 362.69 points (2.33%) to 15,950.47. Investors showed optimism, reacting favorably to the possibility of a pause in trade tensions.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba voiced strong concerns over U.S. tariffs during a telephone call with President Donald Trump on Monday. Ishiba expressed fears that the tariffs could discourage investment from Japan, which has been the top foreign investor in the U.S. for the past five years.\n\nIshiba urged Trump to pursue a more mutually beneficial trade relationship and assured that Japan would continue to negotiate for a reconsideration of the measures. The two leaders agreed to form a team of representatives to handle further discussions.\n\nIshiba also called the situation a \"national crisis\" and said Japan would hold a ministerial task force meeting to address the issue. He emphasized the need for a counterproposal to reshape U.S.-Japan relations, although he ruled out retaliatory measures, believing they would only escalate the situation. The Japanese government, he added, would support industries affected by the tariffs, particularly small and medium-sized businesses.\n\nWhite House trade adviser Peter Navarro has dismissed Vietnam's recent offer to reduce its tariffs on American exports to 0%, calling it \"meaningless.\" The offer came after a \"productive\" call between Trump and Vietnam's General Secretary Tô Lâm. However, Navarro stressed that the focus should not be on tariffs alone, but on \"non-tariff cheating\" by foreign nations.\n\nThe U.S. is set to impose high \"reciprocal\" tariffs on several countries, including Vietnam, starting April 9. With a proposed 46% tariff rate, Vietnam, which was the sixth-largest source of U.S. imports last year, faces significant impact. The new tariffs could raise the cost of goods like electronics, apparel, and footwear that the U.S. imports heavily from the country.\n\nWhite House trade counselor Peter Navarro doubled down on the U.S.'s stance on foreign trade, insisting that countries remove the \"non-tariff barriers\" hindering American commerce. Navarro said these barriers, stating they \"suck our blood\" and demand removal.\n\nHe specifically called on the European Union to ease its value-added taxes and restrictions on American meat, which is produced with hormones or other chemicals.\n\nNavarro accused foreign countries of \"stealing from the American people\" and emphasized that simply lowering tariffs wouldn't suffice.\n\nPeter Navarro, White House trade counselor, spoke on CNBC Monday, revealing plans for soon-to-be-implemented tax cuts and additional benefits for American citizens, which include deregulation, lower energy prices, reduced interest rates, and a reshaping of the country's manufacturing sector. He said that these actions would help return manufacturing to the U.S. while boosting real wages and profits, predicting the market would eventually stabilize.\n\nNavarro also addressed recent criticisms from Elon Musk, who had voiced concerns over tariffs and Navarro's role in their implementation. Navarro countered by saying that Musk, who had questioned the tariffs, is \"not a car manufacturer but a car assembler,\" noting that Tesla's Texas plant relies on imported parts such as batteries and electronics.\n\nWall Street's main indexes opened sharply lower on Monday, with the S&P 500 on track to enter bear market territory. As of 9:31 a.m., the Dow had fallen 1,212.98 points, or 3.17%, to 37,101.88.\n\nThe S&P 500 lost 181.37 points, or 3.57%, dropping to 4,892.71, while the Nasdaq saw a steeper decline of 623.23 points, or 4.00%, settling at 14,964.56. The broad sell-off reflects growing concerns over the economy and the potential for further market instability.\n\nThe S&P 500 opened the trading day down more than 3%, signaling a potential entry into bear market territory.\n\nIf the losses continue, the index would be 20% or more below its recent peak, a key indicator of a bear market.\n\nGoldman Sachs has raised concerns about the long-term economic damage caused by recent tariff announcements, suggesting that a recession is increasingly likely, even if Trump alters his trade policies. The firm lowered its growth forecast, citing factors like tightened financial conditions, foreign consumer boycotts, and rising policy uncertainty that could severely limit capital spending.\n\nGoldman Sachs further noted that meeting prior economic expectations would now require a significant reduction in the tariffs set to take effect on April 9, warning that the economic outlook could worsen without this change.\n\nTrump shared another post on Truth Social this morning, urging people to not be \"weak\" or \"stupid,\" calling them \"panicans,\" which he says is a \"new party based on Weak and Stupid people.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson has struck a deal with Florida Representative Anna Paulina Luna over their standoff regarding proxy voting for new parents.\n\nIn a Sunday post on X, formerly Twitter , Luna said the pair reached an agreement to formalize a centuries-old procedure called \"live/dead pairing,\" which allows lawmakers to symbolically vote by proxy, with the vote canceled out by an opposing one.\n\nNewsweek has contacted Johnson's office for comment via email.\n\nProxy voting is largely opposed by MAGA and hard-line Republicans , including Johnson. The compromise with Luna could increase pressure on Johnson from MAGA figures, as he already faces a potential challenge to remain House speaker in the GOP's narrow majority in the lower chamber.\n\nRead the full story by Ewan Palmer on Newsweek.\n\nWall Street is set to begin the week with more substantial losses as worries grow that the U.S. tariffs imposed by Trump may result in a global economic slowdown.\n\nShares in both European and Asian markets experienced sharp declines, while U.S. futures also fell. The S&P 500 futures dropped 2.7% in premarket trading, with the index now down 17.4% from its February high. A drop of 20% or more from a recent peak would signify a bear market.\n\nOil prices saw another significant drop, briefly falling below $60 a barrel for the first time since 2021.\n\nFutures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq also declined, down 2.4% and 3%, respectively, reflecting widespread investor concerns about the impact of ongoing trade tensions.\n\nA federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. has ruled to reinstate members of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) whom Trump had sought to remove, Politico reporter Kyle Cheney shared via X.\n\nThe court's decision was a 7-4 split, citing laws that protect these members from dismissal without cause.\n\nThe ruling could pave the way for the Supreme Court to take up the case, though further details are still to come.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Monday, becoming the first foreign leader to visit since Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on multiple countries.\n\nWhile Netanyahu's visit focuses on the new tariffs, it will also cover major geopolitical issues, including the war in Gaza, tensions with Iran, and Israel's relationship with Turkey. The outcome of the meeting could influence how other world leaders approach the U.S. tariffs.\n\nNetanyahu's office has indicated that discussions will center on the 17% tariff Israel faces, although it remains unclear if any resolution will be reached. In preparation for the visit, Israel announced last week that it would remove all tariffs on U.S. goods, including food and agricultural imports.\n\nExperts expect Trump to use the tariff issue as leverage, potentially pressing Netanyahu for concessions, including a pause in the Gaza conflict.\n\nGermany reported a significant rise in exports to the United States in February, marking an 8.5% increase compared to the previous month, reaching 14.2 billion euros ($15.6 billion). This surge came just ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs, as Germany solidified its position as Europe's top economy and a leading exporter.\n\nThe U.S. became Germany's biggest trading partner last year, surpassing China for the first time in nearly a decade. Overall, German exports worldwide rose 1.8% in February to 131.6 billion euros.\n\nHowever, Dirk Jandura, head of Germany's exporters association BGA, cautioned that the increase was likely due to anticipatory effects, as U.S. firms stockpiled goods and German companies expedited shipments ahead of the tariffs.\n\nJandura also emphasized the need for Germany and the EU to quickly adapt to the changing global trade landscape and explore new opportunities with emerging markets. He suggested that Europe's response to the U.S. tariffs could position it as a reliable global partner.\n\nHong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan said Monday that recent market volatility does not require drastic action, even after the city's stock market fell 13.2% in a single day.\n\nChan said the market remains orderly, with strong trading activity on both sides, but warned that U.S. tariffs and global interest rate shifts will likely fuel more instability.\n\nHe criticized the U.S. tariffs as \"bullying and unreasonable,\" accusing them of harming global supply chains and slowing economic recovery.\n\nChan also reaffirmed Hong Kong's status as a free port with distinct policies from mainland China.\n\nA Latvian official said Monday the European Union may seek negotiations with the U.S. on energy security and military trade in response to a new 20% tariff on EU exports.\n\nArtjom Uršulskis, parliamentary secretary at Latvia's foreign ministry, said finding common ground is more productive than escalating tensions.\n\n\"Trade wars are never favorable for everyone,\" he told reporters ahead of an EU trade ministers meeting.\n\nUršulskis also pushed back on suggestions the EU should target U.S. services, saying the bloc should avoid \"new wars and new battlefields.\"\n\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the U.S. economy is \"facing considerable turbulence,\" citing tariffs, inflation concerns, and high market valuations.\n\nIn his annual letter to shareholders , Dimon cautioned that recent tariffs could fuel inflation and increase the risk of a recession. Despite recent market declines, he said stock prices remain elevated.\n\n\"Markets still seem to be pricing assets with the assumption that we will continue to have a fairly soft landing,\" he wrote. \"I am not so sure.\"\n\nChina has issued a sharp rebuke of new U.S. tariffs, accusing Washington of \"unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying\" in a growing trade confrontation that has drawn in major companies such as Tesla and GE Healthcare .\n\nPutting \"America First\" over international rules harms the stability of global production and the supply chain and seriously impacts the world's economic recovery, China's Foreign Affairs spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters.\n\nChinese officials criticized the administration of President Donald Trump after it imposed a sweeping 34 percent tariff on Chinese goods, escalating from previous rounds of tariffs announced earlier this year.\n\nBeijing has responded with its own 34 percent tariff on American exports and has moved to restrict key imports such as sorghum and poultry while tightening export controls on critical rare earth elements. At the same time, China filed a formal complaint with the World Trade Organization, signaling the dispute could extend into international legal channels.\n\nRead the full article by Newsweek's staff.\n\nTrump defended his trade policies in a Truth Social post, saying that tariffs are bringing in \"Billions of Dollars a week\" and insisting there is \"NO INFLATION\" despite growing economic concerns.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nAmanda M.

You can get in touch with Suzanne by emailing s.blake@newsweek.com. Languages: English\n\nBased on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\n\nNewsweek AI is in beta. Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresident Donald Trump 's sweeping new tariff policies could significantly raise the price of imported baby formula , a product many American parents rely on.\n\nThe new measures repeal key exemptions previously in place and impose across-the-board import duties on goods from countries including those in the European Union , where many popular baby formula brands originate.\n\nA 2022 law passed by Congress temporarily lifted tariffs on baby formula imports to ease a nationwide shortage.\n\nTrump's new tariffs, which he described as applying to \"all countries,\" do not appear to exempt baby formula, and could reinstate the same burdens Congress previously moved to eliminate.\n\nWhile pharmaceuticals received an explicit carve-out, formula was not included in the exemptions published by the White House. Depending on the country of origin, this could translate into substantial increases in the cost of formula for U.S. families.\n\nTrump's newly signed executive orders impose a minimum 10 percent tariff on imports from all countries, with reciprocal rates applied to countries running large trade surpluses with the U.S.\n\nImports from the European Union-where leading baby formula brands like HiPP and Holle are manufactured-will be subject to a 20 percent tariff, according to Fierce Healthcare.\n\nPharmaceuticals received a narrowly defined exemption, limited to specific drugs and compounds. Baby formula was not specifically included in that list.\n\nNewsweek reached out to the White House for comment via email.\n\nTariffs on formula imports from Canada could be particularly costly. A recent study found that a 25 percent tariff on Canadian drug products alone would add $750 million in annual costs. For baby formula, where prices are already volatile and shortages have occurred recently, new tariffs could increase retail prices significantly, trade experts warn.\n\nGovernment subsidies and federal programs also complicate the formula market.\n\nThe Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), which purchases about half of the U.S. supply, heavily limits the formula brands available to families, according to an NPR analysis . That restriction made it difficult to import new supply during the 2022 shortage.\n\n\"Eventually, the shortage was relieved with the help of imported baby formula,\" NPR reported, \"but only after a months-long delay while government restrictions were relaxed.\"\n\nAlex Beene, a financial literacy instructor for the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek : \"Few Americans would disagree with the concept of promoting purchases of products made within their own country. At the same point, putting a more heavy reliance on American-produced items could lead to supply issues down the line. We saw this with baby formula over the past few years, when the closure of just one factory curtailed availability for the entire country and had parents panicking.\"\n\nDavid Warrick, EVP at Overhaul, a supply chain risk management company, told Newsweek : \"Baby formula is a particularly sensitive category. If tariffs are placed on European-made formula, we could see a repeat of the supply stress we experienced in recent years-higher prices, tighter inventory, and limited options for parents. In a category where safety, nutrition, and availability are non-negotiable, even slight disruptions have outsized consequences.\"\n\nAs the tariffs take effect, advocacy groups and healthcare experts are already pressing for exemptions. The White House has not yet clarified whether baby formula might be added to the exemption list.\n\n\"Having imported formula is an option in making sure those shortages don't occur, and adding to the cost of it creates yet another added expense for financially strapped parents,\" Beene said.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nSuzanne Blake is a Newsweek reporter based in New York.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresident Donald Trump 's standing with critical swing voters appears to have taken a hit as his new tariff policies kick in, according to a new analysis from Impact Social that was shared with Newsweek .\n\nNewsweek has reached out to the White House for comment on Saturday.\n\nPost-election exit poll surveys have shown that Trump won swing voters by a significant margin in the 2024 election. This was particularly notable in the critical swing states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, which went for President Joe Biden in 2020 after going for Trump in 2016. These critical states flipped back for the Republican president in last year's election.\n\nEconomic issues and inflation were a top concern for voters in the November presidential election. While Trump and his allies say that the new tariffs will ultimately be a boon for the U.S. economy, most economists have said they will increase inflation and possibly lead to a recession .\n\nOn Wednesday -which Trump called \"Liberation Day\"-the president announced that he would impose higher tariff rates on dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the U.S.\n\nSpeaking at the White House, Trump said he would impose a 10 percent baseline tariff on imports from almost all countries and \"reciprocal\" tariffs on others, unveiling a chart showing higher duties on some of the U.S.'s most significant trading partners.\n\nWhile some nations will only face the 10 percent baseline, many have been set above 30 and even higher than 40 percent. Trump says the tariffs will be paid by the foreign countries, but most economists and analysts say these costs will simply be passed on to consumers, which would dramatically increase the price of many imported goods.\n\nA new report shared with Newsweek by Impact Social, a specialist social media, online monitoring and analysis company, shows that swing voters' sentiments toward Trump have dropped further with his tariff moves.\n\n\"After holding steady for a month at -12, Trump's net sentiment among swing voters has now dropped to -15-a sign that recent developments are beginning to cut through,\" the report said.\n\nIt continued: \"This shift is being lead by the rollout of new tariffs, which have quickly become the dominant issue in swing voter conversations. A combined 38 percent of negative sentiment is now tied to tariffs, split between general concern (25 percent) and a fear personal financial impact (13 percent). Posts are increasingly focused on how tariffs might raise prices, disrupt local economies, and threaten job security-moving the conversation from political positioning to real-world consequences.\"\n\nThe new analysis aligns with public polling, which shows voters sorrowing on Trump's handling of economic issues.\n\nAccording to a late March survey of 1,021 adults by Milwaukee-based Marquette Law School, 45 percent of Republicans assess the state of the economy as excellent or good, while 46 percent view it as \"not so good\" and an additional 9 percent as \"poor.\"\n\nAdditionally, a majority of adults (58 percent) believe Trump's policies will result in higher inflation, with the number of Republicans believing the president will reduce inflation declining from 76 percent in December to 62 percent in March.\n\nTrump's overall job approval has remained largely unchanged between January and March, currently enjoying 46 percent approval and 54 percent disapproval. His Republican support is at 87 percent, down from 89 percent in January. Approval among independents dipped from 37 to 32 percent, and edged up to 10 percent from 9 percent among Democrats .\n\nSenator Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, told Fox Business on Friday : \"I'm getting all kinds of reactions from businesses, farmers in Wisconsin that are highly concerned about what's happening. Those are the facts. All I can really do is report the reality to the administration, let them know how these actions are impacting my constituents, and it'll be pretty much up to President Trump and his administration to determine exactly how long they're going to go down this road.\"\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with the Democratic Party, in a statement emailed to Newsweek on Friday: \"We need a rational, well-thought-out and fair trade policy. Trump's across-the-board tariffs are not the way to do it. We do not need a blanket and arbitrary sales tax on imported goods which will raise prices on products that the American people desperately need. We should be doing everything we can to lower prices, not make them incredibly higher.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Truth Social on Friday: \"Big business is not worried about the Tariffs, because they know they are here to stay, but they are focused on the BIG, BEAUTIFUL DEAL, which will SUPERCHARGE our Economy. Very important. Going on right now!!!\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, on X, formerly Twitter, on Wednesday: \"These tariffs restore fair and reciprocal trade and level the playing field for American workers and innovators. The President understands that FREE trade ONLY works when it's FAIR!\"\n\nTrump and his allies have said repeatedly that there may be some temporary economic \"disruption,\" but that tariffs will ultimately benefit the U.S. economy and Americans.\n\nTrading partners have responded in various ways to the newly imposed tariffs, with some announcing reciprocal measures. Others are holding off or attempting to negotiate with the Trump administration to lower the rates.\n\nMeanwhile, the stock market reacted negatively this past week, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average shedding more than 1,500 points on back-to-back days for the first time ever. The average plunged more than 2,200 points on Friday after dropping over 1,600 on Thursday.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\n\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\n\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\n\nJason Lemon is a Senior Politics Editor at Newsweek based in Brooklyn, New York.

      "text": "Trump Is Giving Everyone What They Want In the Dumbest Way Possible\n\nDonald Trump\n\nChristian Britschgi | 4.4.2025 1:55 PM\n\nA range of factions with mutually exclusive policy goals entered the Trump White House hoping the president would prioritize their particular political project.\n\nDynamists want to cut regulation and unleash economic growth. Many different stripes of protectionists want to end past decades' regime of global free-ish trade. Foreign policy restrainers want to get us out of overseas conflicts. Foreign policy hawks want to start some more.\n\nIt's a credit to President Donald Trump's slapdash style and personal charisma that he managed to convince every camp of this heterogeneous coalition that they'd get what they wanted from his second term.\n\nMore incredibly, he's making everyone's dreams come true. The only catch is that he's doing it in the dumbest way possible.\n\nThis past Wednesday was \"Liberation Day,\" when the president announced a sweeping regime of bilateral \"reciprocal tariffs\" on almost every country in the world.\n\nPeople who wanted tariffs certainly got them, but the details belie any coherent logic behind the scheme.\n\nIt's hard to claim these tariffs are being done to counter Chinese influence (as some in the Trump administration want to use tariff policy to do) if China's 32 percent tariff rate is roughly equivalent to Taiwan's 32 percent and less than Chinese rival Vietnam's 46 percent.\n\nNor can one claim that these tariffs are about fair trade, whereby we only have free trade with countries that have free trade with us, given the formula the administration is using to calculate the \"reciprocal\" tariffs. The White House is simply dividing our trade deficit with each country by their imports to us.\n\nArch-tariff defender Oren Cass has heroically attempted to defend these tariff rates by arguing that trade deficits by themselves are a good proxy for unbalanced trade policies.\n\nYet even Cass has conceded that under a balanced system of trade, the U.S. would run trade surpluses with some countries and deficits with others. It's for this reason that he favors a single global tariff rate.\n\n\"Setting tariffs country-by-country, and re-evaluating each with some regularity, will create a lobbying bonanza and inevitable misfires and distortions,\" wrote Cass back in February.\n\nCass seems willing to accept Wednesday's system of bilateral tariffs as a second-best option. Even here, though, one wonders why the Trump administration decided to tariff uninhabited islands and individual French administrative regions with no independent trade policy of their own.\n\nAt some point, even the protectionists are going to have to admit that none of this makes any sense.\n\nBefore libertarian free traders get too haughty, it's worth remembering that we've already gone through this with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nTrump isn't a small-government guy. But on the campaign trail he did promise state-shrinkers that he'd launch a DOGE effort to slash federal workers, regulation, and spending.\n\nHis first few months in office have been dominated by stories of the Elon Musk-led DOGE firing thousands of federal workers, canceling grants, and even shuttering whole agencies.\n\nIt's hard not to get excited by the energetic effort. I've argued before that even a very crude and legally dubious arsonists' blitz through federal departments has a sunny side.\n\nBut when one looks at the details of DOGE's fruits, you can't argue that it's been well-thought-out .\n\nBillions in claimed savings have been subsequently reduced to millions. Thousands of cut workers have been ordered back to the office, either by courts or by the administration's own backtracking .\n\nDOGE's promise that rooting out fraud, waste, and abuse would balance the budget was always illusory. Seemingly no effort has been made to work with Congress on more lasting and permanent spending recissions and regulatory repeals.\n\nAll things considered, a haphazard DOGE effort is preferable to the Biden administration's \"whole-of-government\" efforts to expand regulations wherever possible.\n\nLibertarians have nevertheless managed to find themselves in the same boat as protectionists-watching an administration very ineptly pursue their generational political project.\n\nThe list of factions in the same position goes on.\n\nThose who wanted to see the Trump administration stand by Israel and crack down on domestic opposition to it have had to watch its bungled, likely unconstitutional effort to eject a non-criminal legal permanent resident for his speech alone.\n\nThe hawks that wanted to see Trump take on Iran and its allies are no doubt disappointed they weren't invited to the Signal group chat about military strikes on the Houthis-even though a liberal journalist was.\n\nForeign policy restrainers that want us to extricate ourselves from the war in Ukraine on the grounds that it's really not our business have been rewarded with a bizarre \"mineral deal\" that keeps us more involved in that conflict.\n\nNativists who wanted mass deportations are, for the moment, having to settle for more targeted evictions of valid asylum seekers with the wrong tattoos.\n\nOnly MAGA true believers can actually claim to be satisfied. They voted to see a double-proof Trump show, and the president has delivered with his characteristic flair.\n\nThe most common way politicians disappoint you is by saying they'll do the thing you want and then doing the opposite. There's been plenty of that during the Trump administration for sure.\n\nIn large part, however, Trump has failed in a more unusual way: doing what his supporters want in the most haphazard and incompetent way possible.\n\nThose disappointed by the results might continue to console themselves by saying it's better than what the alternative would have been. At a minimum, everyone should hopefully be able to admit by now that there's no 4-D chess being played.\n\nRent Free is a weekly newsletter from Christian Britschgi on urbanism and the fight for less regulation, more housing, more property rights, and more freedom in America's cities.\n\nΔ\n\nNEXT: An Executive Power Case That Trump May Win\n\nChristian Britschgi is a reporter at Reason .\n\nShow Comments (100)\n\nC.

      "text": "Donald Trump's Energy Department Saved Your Appliances\n\nDepartment of Energy\n\nMarc Oestreich | 4.4.2025 7:45 AM\n\nLast week, President Donald Trump's administration turned its chainsaws on the Department of Energy (DOE), cutting, canceling, or pausing a handful of onerous regulations set to hobble household and commercial appliances. Anyone who's coughed up a small fortune for a barely functional machine lately knows the stakes.\n\nMy 30-year-old Bosch dishwasher was a marvel-efficient, precise-scouring dishes in 45 minutes like a Prussian drill sergeant on a deadline. Last month, it died. I dropped $800 on a sleek successor, expecting progress. Instead, I got a two-hour grease-smearing farce that leaves forks, like my optimism, caked in the grime of dashed hopes-a victim of the DOE's regulatory straitjacket.\n\nMy 1979 brick ranch creaks on into senescence, its heater, air-conditioning, fans, and water heater-bastions of a bygone era of appliance liberty-teetering. Replacing them likely means paying thousands of dollars for lesser-able machines. That's been the story for decades: as tech leaps forward, appliances regress. Until now.\n\nIn February, Trump's DOE postponed three Biden-era efficiency rules related to central A.C. and heat pumps, walk-in coolers and freezers, and gas tankless water heaters. It also carved a special regulatory category, freeing tankless heaters from Biden's near-ban. Just last week , the DOE cut four more rules outright-impacting ceiling fans, dehumidifiers, external power supplies, and the electric motors that power almost everything. This isn't just red tape slashed-it's a rare win for choice and function over dogma. What exactly did we dodge? A lot.\n\nTake electric motor mandates-these rules hit everything from your blender to your garage compressor. They aimed to tighten already-strict regulations and expand them to even more motors in everyday appliances. Ostensibly, the goal was to reduce electricity use and emissions. Sounds noble-until you realize what it does to the products we actually use.\n\nThese motors skimp on low-end torque , hobbling appliances that need a quick jolt-think A.C. units gasping to start or a blender stalling on ice. They're slower to respond and less precise. And because they require rare earth metals and heavier materials , they make devices bulkier-your cordless drill suddenly feels like a lead pipe.\n\nWorse, these high-efficiency designs come with a high-efficiency price tag. Costs shoot up, and U.S. manufacturers-after burning capital on redesigns and retooling-struggle to compete with countries that don't play by the same regulatory rulebook.\n\nThe proposed charger rules carried similar baggage. Those familiar bricks were slated for \"standby\" efficiency upgrades, which would draw less power when idle-but also slow charging and tack on extra cost. Another small freedom sacrificed to make a number in a lab look better.\n\nEach of these rules hit manufacturers with retooling costs, consumers with higher bills, and our homes with clunkier gear.\n\nMy dishwasher is the poster child. A 5-gallon water limit (10 CFR 430.32) strangles it-my old Bosch used ten gallons. A 307 kWh/year energy cap starves its heater and pump-my German-engineered gem used to shoot scalding water and dry dishes in minutes. New efficiency rules bloated cycles to more than two hours just to scrape at grease-four when I have to double wash.\n\nCeiling fans that cost more and barely move air, dehumidifiers that take too long to stop mold from moving in, tankless water heaters priced like luxury items yet reduced to a trickle, A.C. units bloated with \"efficiency\" tech but still wheezing through heat waves-these were all narrowly avoided. However, dozens more remain-rules that hike prices, gut performance, and drive out American manufacturers in favor of compliant mediocrity. This isn't about saving the planet. It's about feeding a machine that's been running since the late '80s.\n\nIt all started in 1987, when President Ronald Reagan-prodded by California regulators and General Electric lobbyists-signed the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act . It was meant to simplify a chaotic state-by-state patchwork. Instead, it handed Washington control of everything from your showerhead to your stove. By 1992, Congress doubled down with the Energy Policy Act , and industry giants like Whirlpool saw the angle: back the rules, get the tax breaks, and freeze out smaller competition. In the 2000s, Bush-era energy bills brought green nonprofits and manufacturers into open collusion-subsidies for submission-while appliance lifespans quietly cratered, from 30 years to 10.\n\nThe DOE boasted that its 1996 rules saved 26 million metric tons of carbon dioxide-about 2 percent of national emissions. But that figure is a bloated fantasy, based on lab conditions and imaginary consumer behavior. Meanwhile, in the real world, people ran longer cycles, rewashed by hand, and used more water and energy to make up the difference.\n\nThese regulations stack up like bad sequels-each more expensive, less effective, and harder to defend than the last. The low-flow toilet that takes two flushes, the washer that needs a second cycle, the showerhead that sputters like a garden hose with arthritis. Trump's latest cuts nick the beast. But it's still alive.\n\nLast week's rollback swings the pendulum toward sanity-I hope. My $800 dishwasher still mocks me, but my fans, heater, and A.C. might dodge that fate. It's a small dent in decades of regulatory lunacy that's burdened makers, killed innovation, and trashed our kitchens.\n\nOne day, I'll drag that dishwasher out back for an Office Space -style sendoff, keeping a broken, battered DOE dishwasher as my trophy. Damn, it'll feel good to be a gangster.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Are Trump's Tariffs Constitutional?\n\nTariffs\n\nJack Nicastro | 4.4.2025 12:40 PM\n\nThe New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA) challenged the constitutionality of President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports on Wednesday. The NCLA argues that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) has never been used before to impose tariffs because that is not what the act authorizes. In using this law to impose tariffs, the president overstepped his constitutional authority.\n\nThe NCLA filed the complaint on behalf of Simplified , a lifestyle brand based in Pensacola, Florida, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida. The company, which sells planners, notebooks, and stationery has been harmed by the tariffs, which have increased the price of materials it imports from China.\n\nThe complaint alleges that Trump's executive orders raising tariffs on Chinese imports exceed the statutory authority of the IEEPA, and that a ruling upholding this assumed authority would violate the nondelegation doctrine , which prohibits Congress from transferring to other branches of government \"powers which are strictly and exclusively legislative.\" When Congress does delegate its power, it must provide an intelligible principle , i.e., \"a legal framework to constrain the authority of the delegee.\" The suit argues that the IEEPA contains no such principle vis-à-vis tariffs, which are nowhere mentioned in the statute.\n\nThe NCLA also argues that the IEEPA only authorizes the president to apply asset freezes, trade embargoes, and sanctions in response to international emergencies. The IEEPA cannot be interpreted to grant the president the ability to modify the federal tariff schedule , says the suit. Congress alone has the constitutional authority \"to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations,\" and the president may only impose tariffs as specifically granted by statute . When Congress authorizes the executive branch to make \"decisions of vast 'economic and political significance'\" it must do so clearly, per the major questions doctrine . The suit contends that increasing tariff rates on hundreds of billions of dollars of imported goods is of such significance.\n\nThe plaintiff does not dispute that the opioid crisis is an emergency-an argument that Trump has used to levy tariffs- but contends that there is \"no connection between the opioid problem and the tariff [Trump] ordered.\"\n\nTrump's other justification for the Chinese tariffs is found in the America First Trade Policy memo, which bemoans the \"country's large and persistent annual trade deficits\" with China. Trump himself described the China tariffs as \"not a negotiating tool [but] pure[ly] economic.\" John Vecchione, senior litigation counsel for the NCLA, tells Reason, \"The IEEPA says that sanctions can be invoked for the emergency and for no other reason.\" Vecchione explains that the Supreme Court ruled in Department of Commerce v. New York (2019) \"that the courts are allowed to look behind the stated reason for an action [to determine] the actual reason for an action.\" Trump has stated his other reasons.\n\nThe suit describes how Trump legally imposed tariffs in his first administration: on steel and aluminum under the national security provision of the Trade Expansion Act; on solar cells and washing machines under the global safeguard provision of the Trade Act of 1974; and on Chinese imports under the unilateral trade sanctions provision of the Trade Act. Unlike the IEEPA, these two acts \"expressly refer to duties or tariffs\" and require the administration to make certain findings. The process required to impose these tariffs, including publication in the Federal Register followed by the regular notice-and-comment period, took 10, 11, and eight months, respectively. The latest tariff increase on Chinese goods takes effect exactly one month from the issuance of Trump's executive order.\n\nThe NCLA's lawsuit is the first of its kind. Vecchione says that \"the chances of [the tariffs] being pulled are slim,\" but \"if Congress came in and said all of this was unlawful...I believe both NCLA and my client would be very happy with that outcome.\"\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "The Trump Administration Should Focus on Deregulation, Not Tariffs\n\nRegulation\n\nJ.D. Tuccille | 4.7.2025 7:00 AM\n\nPresident Donald Trump's justifications for tariffs keep shifting-one moment they're to cut the flow of illegal drugs and immigrants , the next, they're to bolster American businesses and jobs . But the argument that seems to resonate most with the public is that they will result in a stronger and more competitive U.S. economy. Economists aren't convinced , to put it mildly. The fact is that American government is often the biggest impediment to the workers and employers that politicians claim to be helping.\n\n\"Large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits have led to the hollowing out of our manufacturing base [and] resulted in a lack of incentive to increase advanced domestic manufacturing capacity,\" Trump argued in an April 2 executive order imposing stiff tariffs on most of the planet. \"President Trump is working to level the playing field for American businesses and workers by confronting the unfair tariff disparities and non-tariff barriers imposed by other countries.\"\n\nYou are reading The Rattler from J.D. Tuccille and Reason . Get more of J.D.'s commentary on government overreach and threats to everyday liberty.\n\nΔ\n\nBut what if the most insurmountable barriers for domestic businesses and the jobs they create come not from foreign governments but from homegrown regulators trying to mold the economy into their preferred form? In fact, entrepreneurs and executives at established firms complain bitterly about the costs of pleasing elected officials and government employees who create red tape instead of prosperity.\n\n\"Considering all federal regulations, all sectors of the U.S. economy and all firm sizes, federal regulations cost an estimated $12,800 per employee per year in 2022 (in 2023 dollars). Small firms with fewer than 50 employees incur regulatory costs of $14,700 per employee per year - 20% greater than the cost per employee in large firms ($12,200),\" according to a 2023 study commissioned by the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) as a continuation of earlier work by the authors for the U.S. Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy.\n\nThat's bad enough. But if you're concerned about domestic manufacturing, you should know that the situation is even tougher for companies that make things: \"The regulatory cost disadvantage confronting small firms is amplified greatly in the manufacturing sector, with small manufacturing firms bearing more than double the cost of large manufacturing firms, or $50,100 versus $24,800 per employee.\"\n\nFor all firms, economic regulations were the most burdensome-followed by environmental regulations, then tax compliance, and occupational safety and health and homeland security (OSHHS) rules. For firms with fewer than 50 employees, environmental regulations had the greatest costs.\n\nIn the manufacturing sector, environmental rules imposed the greatest expense for firms of all sizes (over 80 percent of the total for firms with fewer than 50 employees), followed by economic rules, OSHHS, and then tax compliance.\n\n\"Federal and state requirements establish mandates for every element of the manufacturing process: the employees, machinery, methods, inputs and waste,\" according to a separate 2017 NAM report.\n\nAmerican companies are strangling in red tape imposed by American government. Unsurprisingly, small businesses in particular say that heavy regulation is a killer.\n\n\"The latest Small Business Index survey finds that 51% of small businesses say navigating regulatory compliance requirements is negatively impacting their growth,\" the U.S. Chamber of Commerce revealed in December 2024. \"Almost as many (47%) say their business spends too much time fulfilling regulatory compliance requirements.\"\n\nThe percentage of small businesses saying they spend too much time on regulatory compliance rises to 51 percent of manufacturers-and 57 percent for professional services.\n\nUnfortunately, this isn't a new barrier to creating and growing successful companies. In 2018, Gallup found that among small businesses, \"more owners mention issues relating to government policies and regulations (24%) than any other\" challenge.\n\nIn 2011, \"small-business owners in the United States are most likely to say complying with government regulations (22%) is the most important problem facing them today,\" also according to Gallup.\n\nGiven governments' tendency to intrude ever more deeply into human life and to find new justifications for bureaucrats' salaries, it should be no surprise that regulatory costs rise year after year.\n\n\"Our research shows that regulatory compliance costs of US businesses have grown by about 1 percent each year from 2002 to 2014 in real terms,\" Francesco Trebbi, Miao Ben Zhang, and Michael Simkovic wrote in a 2024 Cato Institute research brief.\n\nOne percent per year in growing compliance costs may not sound like a lot, but that compounds over time into an increasingly more oppressive tangle of red tape that firms must deal with. That hampers large firms, frustrates mid-size ones, and keeps many small businesses from ever getting off the ground.\n\nBefore starting a trade war with the rest of the planet, the Trump administration should strongly consider getting the U.S. government out of the way of American businesses so they can build, innovate, employ, and compete with the foreign firms that so worry U.S. politicians.\n\nThere are encouraging signs the Trump administration is friendly to that goal. The first Trump administration left office after \"adding a net total of $40.4 billion in regulatory costs,\" which was less than 10 percent of the net burden imposed by the previous Obama administration, according to the American Action Forum. \"When removing independent agencies, the Trump Administration actually achieved net regulatory savings of nearly $1 billion over its term.\"\n\nThat is, Trump at least slowed the regulatory state and may have slightly reduced its burden.\n\nLast month, with Trump back in office, the Treasury Department dropped enforcement of burdensome \"beneficial ownership\" reporting rules that were causing confusion and concern for small businesses.\n\n\"NFIB has been steadfast since the beginning that this onerous requirement is a massive intrusion into small businesses' privacy and creates an unprecedented new government database on Americans,\" responded National Federation of Independent Business President Brad Close. \"We agree with President Trump that requirements from the Corporate Transparency Act are 'outrageous and invasive.'\"\n\nFor his second term, President Trump has signaled that deregulation is priority. A January 31 executive order requires that \"for each new regulation issued, at least 10 prior regulations be identified for elimination\" as part of an effort \"to significantly reduce the private expenditures required to comply with Federal regulations.\"\n\nDeregulation is where the Trump administration should focus its efforts, not tariffs. Once freed of regulatory deadweight, Americans will be in a much better position to compete with the world.\n\nThe Rattler is a weekly newsletter from J.D. Tuccille.

Tuccille | 4.4.2025 7:00 AM\n\nPresident Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" massive tax hikes-err, tariffs-are here, and the effects are already apparent in stock market selloffs , layoffs , and plant closures . We're also being asked to tolerate a little pain for the duration of the trade war with the entire planet until \"reciprocal\" tariffs close American trade deficits with other countries. But all this talk of allegedly fine-tuned tariffs intended to counter other countries' trading barriers is based on faulty assumptions: that every imbalance in commerce with other nations can be attributed to trade barriers, and that trade deficits are necessarily bad.\n\nYou are reading The Rattler from J.D. Tuccille and Reason . Get more of J.D.'s commentary on government overreach and threats to everyday liberty.\n\nΔ\n\n\"I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that underlying conditions, including a lack of reciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships, disparate tariff rates and non-tariff barriers, and U.S. trading partners' economic policies that suppress domestic wages and consumption, as indicated by large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits, constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States,\" began the president's April 2 executive order invoking questionable unilateral executive authority to hike tariffs.\n\nThe recent report from the Office of the United States Trade Representative assessing international trade barriers looks not only at formal tariffs, but also at such impediments as weak intellectual property protection, \"buy local\" policies, discriminatory licensing requirements, subsidies, \"sanitary\" standards that exclude American goods, and much more. Many of these are easily recognizable as efforts to reduce competition to local companies. But they also seem very difficult to assess in terms of their impact. So, how did the White House come up with such specific numbers to assign to other countries' trade barriers so that it could \"reciprocate\" with fine-tuned tariffs of its own?\n\nWell, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative, \"reciprocal tariffs are calculated as the tariff rate necessary to balance bilateral trade deficits between the U.S. and each of our trading partners. This calculation assumes that persistent trade deficits are due to a combination of tariff and non-tariff factors that prevent trade from balancing. Tariffs work through direct reductions of imports.\"\n\nWait. So, any imbalance in trade is attributed to trade barriers and tariffs are supposed to fix this by choking the flow of goods brought to the U.S.? Apparently so.\n\n\"The numbers [for tariffs by country] have been calculated by the Council of Economic Advisers...based on the concept that the trade deficit that we have with any given country is the sum of all unfair trade practices, the sum of all cheating,\" an unnamed White House official told The New York Post .\n\nThat's quite a simplistic calculation to use as the basis of a global trade war. It's the sort of estimate that has economists scratching their heads and wishing they could punch somebody else's.\n\n\"The tariffs are much worse than we thought,\" Independent Institute economist Phil Magness commented on Facebook. \"The CEA literally improvised them from a made up formula that confuses trade deficits for tariff reciprocity. The entire CEA should be fired and purged for this. It is not even 'economics' - it is flat earther statistical fabrication.\"\n\nWorse, flat-earther humbug is being invoked to fix a problem that is really no problem at all.\n\n\"The gain from foreign trade is what we import,\" the late and great Milton Friedman commented during a lecture at Kansas State University in 1978. \"What we export is a cost of getting those imports. And the proper objective for a nation as Adam Smith put it, is to arrange things so that we get as large a volume of imports as possible, for as small a volume of exports as possible.\"\n\nFriedman added that \"when people talk about a favorable balance of trade...it's taken to mean that we export more than we import. But from the point of our well-being, that's an unfavorable balance.\"\n\nThat is, trade deficits, by which we import more from a country than we export to it, are good .\n\nThe idea that exports are the cost of imports was emphasized by the Cato Institute's Michael Chapman in a piece he wrote last summer . He pointed out that trade isn't some state-level exchange in which one government mugs another. It takes place voluntarily between individuals and businesses.\n\n\"In their criticism of global trade and imports, Vance and the GOP platform don't mention several important things: the American consumer, private property, and the freedom that people should enjoy to voluntarily exchange goods and services,\" he noted. \"Some folks call this liberty and the pursuit of happiness: people freely choosing to buy and sell what they want, not what the government dictates.\"\n\nAnd what do we call voluntary exchanges between willing participants? Well, as economist Roy Cordato wrote for the John Locke Foundation in 2018, \"all trade, by definition, is reciprocal. It is best to think of a trade as simply two parties coming together for mutual gain with each of them giving up something that they possess for something that they want more.\"\n\nSo, in order to eliminate trade deficits with other nations that aren't really a problem to begin with, the Trump administration is hiking tariffs to raise the cost of imported goods so that Americans will buy less of them. That's interference in the free reciprocal exchanges chosen by consumers and businesses. And the price of that interference comes out of Americans' pockets. That's because, as the Tax Foundation's Alex Durante warns , tariffs are taxes that, while partially paid by foreign firms, are mostly a burden for people in the countries that impose them-especially as they rise to the heights we now see.\n\n\"If the US imposes a large enough tariff, the resulting reduction in economic activity would also entail a meaningful increase in unemployment,\" adds Durante.\n\nThis, of course is true of the tariffs and other barriers imposed by other governments as well-the ones to which President Trump claims to be responding and the new ones implemented as retaliation for the recent U.S. measures. But those are mostly a worry for their own people who suffer the consequences.\n\nIn a Newsweek column written back when American politicians fretted over a trade deficit with protectionist Japan, Milton Friedman cautioned : \"We only increase the hurt to us-and also to them-by imposing additional restrictions in our turn.\" He urged the U.S. \"to move unilaterally toward free trade\" to minimize harm caused by tariffs and to maximize gains from trade.\n\nIf we want trade reciprocity, the government should get out of the way and let businesses and consumers engage in voluntary exchanges with each other and overseas partners as they please.\n\nThe Rattler is a weekly newsletter from J.D.

      "text": "NCLA Files Lawsuit Challenging Trump's IEEPA Tariffs Against China\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nNondelegation\n\nIlya Somin | 4.4.2025 4:49 PM\n\nYesterday, the New Civil Liberties Alliance, a prominent conservative public interest group, filed a lawsuit challenging Trump's IEEPA tariffs against China. To avoid confusion, I should not these are not the much more sweeping \"Liberation Day\" tariffs enacted against some 180 nations (also using the IEEPA), which the Liberty Justice Center and I plan to challenge in court . The NCLA lawsuit focuses on the 10% tariff against Chinese imports adopted in February under the theory that it is somehow necessary to combat fentanyl smuggling. Still, their arguments (especially on nondelegation and the major questions doctrine) overlap in some ways with those I have been promoting since February , when Trump first announced IEEPA tariffs against China, Mexico, and Canada in February.\n\nHere is NCLA's description of their case:\n\nRepresenting  Simplified, a Pensacola-based company owned by entrepreneur Emily Ley, NCLA challenges President Donald Trump's unlawful attempt to require Americans to pay a heavy tariff on all products they import from China. President Trump imposed the tariff by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). However, this statute authorizes specific emergency actions like imposing sanctions or freezing assets to protect the United States from foreign threats. It does not authorize the President to impose tariffs. In its nearly 50-year history, no other president-including President Trump in his first term-has ever tried to use the IEEPA to impose tariffs. This lawsuit does not quibble with President Trump's declaration of an opioid-related emergency, but it does take issue with his decision to impose tariffs in response, without legal authority to do so.\n\nThis China tariff is harmful to Simplified, a company that improves women's lives by selling premium planners and other home management products. Simplified's business depends on importing materials from China, and it already has paid substantial tariffs to purchase goods from China that are not available here. The \"emergency\" tariff will force it to make higher tariff payments, driving up its costs and thus prices for its customers, and reducing its profits.\n\nUnder art. 1, § 8 of the Constitution, Congress has sole authority to control tariffs, which it has done by passing detailed tariff statutes. The President cannot bypass those statutes by invoking \"emergency\" authority in another statute that does not mention tariffs. His attempt to use the IEEPA this way not only violates the law as written, but it also invites application of the Supreme Court's Major Questions Doctrine, which tells courts not to discern policies of \"vast economic and political significance\" in a law without explicit congressional authorization. If the IEEPA were held to permit this executive order, then the statute would run afoul of the nondelegation doctrine because it lacks an \"intelligible principle\" to limit or guide the president's discretion in imposing tariffs.\n\nReason's Jack Nicastro has a more detailed summary of NCLA's arguments here . For the complaint filed in the case, see here .\n\nI have some differences with NCLA over other issues. But I think they are absolutely right about this case, and I commend them for bringing it.\n\nI believe the Liberation Day tariffs are even more vulnerable on major questions and nondelegation grounds than the February China tariff, because of their vastly greater scope . They are a much bigger (or more \"major\") question, and also a more egregious example of \"delegation run riot,\" as University of Texas law Prof. Sanford Levinson calls it. We also plan to make some arguments that NCLA did not , such as points related to the wording of the IEEPA (which requires an \"unusual and extraordinary threat,\" as well as the declaration of a national emergency), and arguments that there is no true national emergency here to begin with.\n\nThat said, I wish the NCLA and their client every possible success in pursuing this case.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Trump's New Car Tariffs Are a $100 Billion Tax Increase No One Wants\n\nFree Trade\n\nEric Boehm | 3.27.2025 1:00 PM\n\nIf there's one positive thing to be said about President Donald Trump's latest tariff announcement, perhaps it is this: Few trade policy moves are more abundantly counterproductive and costly than tariffs on cars and car parts.\n\nThat's a lesson the Trump administration is apparently determined to learn the hard way. On Wednesday, Trump announced a new set of 25 percent tariffs that will apply to imported cars and the components that go into cars built in the United States. Trump says those moves will promote domestic auto manufacturing, but that seems unlikely. Instead, the tariffs will make cars and light trucks more expensive, and will likely reduce the number of cars made and sold in America. They are bad news for auto workers, auto dealers, and consumers.\n\nThe only winner is likely to be the federal government's tax coffers. The White House projects that the tariffs will generate $100 billion in new revenue for the government-money that Americans will pay for the privilege of buying a car the government dislikes for arbitrary reasons. Americans imported nearly 8 million cars in 2024 , and the biggest sources of imported cars were Mexico, Japan, and South Korea.\n\nAt Wednesday's press conference announcing the tariffs , Trump immediately disputed his own staff's estimates on the tariffs and predicted a much higher tax increase on Americans: \"I think ultimately, we could probably [get] anywhere from $600 billion to $1 trillion,\" Trump said . \"I think we'll go from $600 [billion] to a trillion in two years.\"\n\nThat's probably just Trumpian bluster-as always, Trump thinks bigger numbers are better, even when those numbers are the result of a tax increase he's imposed on Americans. And, as economist Erika York pointed out , if the goal of the tariffs is to draw more manufacturing into the United States, then the tariff revenue would decline over time rather than increase.\n\nWhatever the final figure turns out to be, these new tariffs will be a significant disruption for the auto industry in the U.S., which employs more than 7 million people . Even before Wednesday's announcement, industry insiders projected lower sales and economic disruptions due to Trump's other tariffs (and tariff threats). Cox Automotive projects that there will be 700,000 fewer cars sold in America this year, a 4.3 percent decline from last year's total, as Americans pull back on spending due to the higher prices created by tariffs.\n\nIn the wake of Wednesday's announcement, Jonathan Smoke, a chief economist at Cox Automotive, told The New York Times that 25 percent tariffs on cars and car parts would add an estimated $3,000 to the cost of cars built in the United States, with higher price hikes likely for foreign-made cars. He estimated that American factories will produce about 30 percent fewer cars as a result of the tariffs and that the industry is prepared for \"disruption to virtually all North American vehicle production.\"\n\nBut why would even American-made cars be impacted by the tariffs? Because there really is no such thing as a fully American-made car. According to an annual survey published by American University, there was not a single car brand that sourced all its parts domestically in 2024. New tariffs on car parts will hurt some brands more than others-Tesla, notably, seems poised to be hurt less than most of its competitors-but the damage will be widespread.\n\nHistory suggests that's exactly what will happen. The last time the U.S. engaged in widespread auto protectionism was in the late 1980s when the Reagan administration imposed import quotas on Japanese cars. The result? Higher prices for cars made in Japan, of course, but also higher prices for cars made in America and Europe. Facing less competition, carmakers simply started charging more. That means the $100 billion tax increase will likely not be the only cost incurred by these tariffs.\n\nOnce again, it's worth asking what Trump hopes to accomplish here . The White House says Trump is bringing back \"MADE IN AMERICA\" with these tariffs, but the American automotive industry is already thriving -not in spite of foreign trade, but because of it .\n\nThree decades after the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was signed, the supply chains for American automakers stretch across the whole continent. \"Ultimately, a vehicle is considered an import when it is shipped to the United States after undergoing final assembly in another country. But many vehicles-including those assembled in America-are composites of parts that come from all over the world,\" notes The New York Times in an explainer about the modern automotive manufacturing supply chains that someone at the White House probably ought to read.\n\nDrawing these political distinctions between domestic and foreign cars is pretty silly in a marketplace that is increasingly integrated. Is a BMW built in South Carolina a foreign car because of the name on the hood? What about a Toyota truck assembled in Tennessee ? What about a Ford that's built in Mexico with parts sourced from every corner of the globe? None of these questions are as black-and-white as the Trump administration wants to make them, and that's just fine-we should trust the market, not politicians, to build the best car.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Trump's White House Says 'Gulf of Mexico' Is Misinformation\n\nMisinformation\n\nRobby Soave | 2.14.2025 4:35 PM\n\nPresident Donald Trump's exceedingly silly efforts to rename the Gulf of Mexico the \"Gulf of America\" became particularly obnoxious this week, as the White House announced that it would strip the Associated Press of access to presidential press briefings and Air Force One flights. The news organization's transgression ? Sticking with Gulf of Mexico in its official style guide.\n\nThere are obvious hypocrisies running in both directions here. Many liberal and mainstream media organizations have embraced the progressive push to rename various public locations, landmarks, sports teams, etc., or to use new and awkward naming conventions in an effort to appease social justice activist groups. The A.P. deciding in July 2020-in the midst of the summer of unrest following the killing of George Floyd-that its style guide would henceforth capitalize black but not white is a good example of this.\n\nBut in this case, the MAGA hypocrisy is even more galling. If Joe Biden's White House had stripped a right-leaning news organization of Oval Office access because it refused to recognize the area in front of Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C., as Black Lives Matter Plaza , conservatives would have gone ballistic. Imagine a Biden surrogate asserting that any journalists who failed to properly respect the space's new name were guilty of spreading misinformation-the opprobrium would be cacophonous and well-deserved.\n\nYet that's exactly what the Trump White House is doing. In a statement on X, Deputy Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich accused the A.P. of betraying its commitment to stem the spread of misinformation.\n\n\"The Associated Press continues to ignore the lawful geographic name change of the Gulf of America,\" he wrote . \"This decision is not just divisive, but it also exposes the Associated Press' commitment to misinformation.\"\n\nThis is a baffling statement that demonstrates exactly why it was such a profound mistake for mainstream and progressive organizations to latch on to misinformation as a quasi-clinical term to describe everything they disagree with. Misinformation concept creep has become a real and regrettable phenomenon; the term should be reserved for information that is patently, objectively false-not a viewpoint-based disagreement over which naming convention should apply to a body of water.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

It's recession day in the United States of America.\"\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum will not implement retaliatory tariffs on the United States.\n\nAhead of President Donald Trump's \"liberation day\" announcement that will unveil sweeping tariffs on U.S. trading partners, the Mexican leader confirmed that she will outline a \"comprehensive plan, not a tit-for-tat on tariffs\" on April 3.\n\nIsrael has announced it is eliminating all remaining tariffs on U.S. imports, hours before the Trump administration is set to implement sweeping reciprocal levies against its global trading partners.\n\nThe decision, revealed on Tuesday by Israeli officials, still requires final approval from Economy Minister Nir Barkat and the Parliament's finance committee, though both are expected to support the measure.\n\n\"Tariffs on all imports from the United States will be cancelled,\" the prime minister's office said in a statement.\n\nWASHINGTON-President Donald Trump is set to announce reciprocal tariffs for all nations starting April 2, the date he has dubbed \"Liberation Day.\"\n\nCompanies, markets, and governments are on edge, expecting the move to send shockwaves across the globe.\n\nLiberation Day will impact all countries, Trump told reporters over the weekend aboard Air Force One. However, some countries will be more vulnerable due to their high trade imbalances with the United States and significant trade barriers against American goods, including China, India, the European Union, Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Vietnam, Japan, and South Korea.\n\nThe White House has yet to disclose details of the sweeping tariffs. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said that the administration will focus on the \"dirty 15,\" or the top 15 percent of partners contributing the most to the United States' negative trade balance.\n\nApril 2 will be America's \"liberation day,\" President Donald Trump says.\n\nThe president is set to unveil his administration's reciprocal tariffs on U.S. trading partners. This initiative is to feature the United States matching tariff rates set by other countries on American goods.\n\n\"If they charge us, we charge them,'' the president said in February. \"If they're at 25, we're at 25. If they're at 10, we're at 10. And if they're much higher than 25, that's what we are too.''"

FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nSchwab Chief Investment Strategist Liz Ann Sonders shares how investors should be approaching the market after a massive hit over President Donald Trump's tariff announcement on 'Barron's Roundtable.'\n\nPresident Donald Trump's unilateral 10% tariff on all imports from many countries went into effect on Saturday, with U.S. customs agents beginning to collect.\n\nThe initial 10% \"baseline\" tariff took effect at U.S. seaports, airports and customs warehouses at 12:01 a.m. ET. Higher taxes on goods from 57 larger trading partners are set to start next week.\n\nTrump's announcement of the tariff on Wednesday shook global stock markets, cutting $5 trillion in stock market value for S&P 500 companies by Friday's close, which marks a record two-day drop. Prices of oil and commodities also took a nosedive.\n\nTARIFF STOCK SHOCK: NASDAQ HITS BEAR MARKET; S&P, DOW SINK\n\nPresident Donald Trump's unilateral 10% tariff on all imports from many countries went into effect on Saturday.

There appears to be no grace period for cargoes on the water at midnight on Saturday, according to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection bulletin to shippers.\n\nA U.S. Customs and Border Protection bulletin did, however, offer a 51-day grace period for cargoes loaded onto vessels or planes and in transit to the U.S. before 12:01 a.m. ET Saturday. These cargoes must arrive by 12:01 a.m. ET on May 27 to avoid the 10% tax.\n\nTrump's higher \"reciprocal\" tariff rates ranging from 11% to 50% are set to take effect on Wednesday. European Union imports will face a 20% tariff, while Chinese goods will be hit with a 34% tariff, bringing Trump's total new taxes on China up to 54%.\n\nTrump's higher \"reciprocal\" tariff rates ranging from 11% to 50% are set to take effect on Wednesday.

The country benefited from the shift of U.S. supply chains away from China after Trump's trade war with Beijing during his first term.\n\nCanada and Mexico were exempt from Trump's latest levies because they are still subject to a 25% tariff for goods that do not comply with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada rules of origin.\n\nGoods subject to separate, 25% national security tariffs, including steel and aluminum, cars, trucks and auto parts, are not covered by the new tariff.\n\nAFTER TRUMP TARIFFS, JPMORGAN RAISES CHANCE OF RECESSION TO 60%\n\nThere appears to be no grace period for cargoes on the water at midnight on Saturday.
