Jean Carroll's $5 million judgement against Donald Trump on Monday - one day after the president-elect former floated the idea of retribution against the ex-advice columnist - ex-federal prosecutor Andrew Weissmann explained why Trump is likely the one in danger.\n\n\"This is an interesting day,\" the former FBI counsel told MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace during the latest episode of Deadline: White House.\n\n\"I think clearly what the former president and president-elect is doing is another shot across to send a message to those people who might sue him for wrongs,\" Weissmann continued. \"E. Jean Carroll obviously was the victim here, as found by not one but two juries that awarded her a sum of over 85 million dollars, and they found that she was sexually is assaulted.\"\n\nThe former top prosecutor went on to explain why Trump's appeal failed.\n\n\"And so, the claims against her by Donald Trump are unsupported by any facts, and in fact, are contrary to the jury verdicts and just legally, by the way, Donald Trump cannot re-litigate that,\" Weissmann emphasizes. \"He had an opportunity not once, but twice, he could have testified and didn't, so this is a lot of fear mongering, but it is effective fear mongering, as we have seen in a variety of different contexts. It's  something to keep an eye on in terms of the courts.\"\n\nWeissmann continued, \"Today's decision is frankly quite a routine decision. There was not much of a legal issue here. The court issued an unusually long opinion, probably to make sure this case was bulletproof in terms of an appeal. It was issued per curiam - one judge wrote it. I think that also was an is the effect of Trump, so that no one judge was bearing the brunt of any repercussions. And it remains to be seen just whether the judicial system is going to hold up. But today is a good sign. It remains to be seen whether it is going to last for four more years of this.\"\n\nWatch the video below or at this link .\n\n- YouTube www.youtube.com"

Trump , a federal appeals court has upheld a jury's civil verdict holding the president-elect liable for, Carroll alleged, defamation and sexually abusing her. The ruling was handed down on Monday morning, December 30.\n\nFormer Elle Magazine columnist Carroll has alleged that during the 1990s, Donald Trump tried to force himself on her in the dressing room of a Manhattan department store. Trump has vehemently denied Carroll's accusation, but in May 2023, a jury in her civil defamation lawsuit found him guilty of defamation and agreed she was sexually abused. And Trump's legal team has been fighting the $5 million in damages that jurors awarded her.\n\nThe ruling has inspired a lot of reactions on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nMSNBC legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Joyce White Vance was quick to weigh in, tweeting, \"After inexplicable delay, the 2nd Circuit has affirmed the jury verdict awarding E. Jean Carroll $5 mil in the 1st of her defamation cases to go to trial against Donald Trump. The jury found Trump slandered her when he said she was lying about being sexually abused by him.\"\n\nVance added that the opinion \"is 79 pages long.\"\n\nFormer Watergate prosecutor Jill Wine-Banks posted, \"Appeals court upholds verdict finding Trump liable for sexually abusing E. Jean Carroll. The Courts remain as guardrails of the rule of law. \"\n\nPolitico's Kyle Cheney noted that the ruling upholds the parts of the civil verdict that Trump has been fighting, including the president-elect being \"liable for sexually abusing\" Carroll and jurors \"ordering him to pay $5 million.\"\n\n\"Trump's request for a new trial is rejected,\" Cheney tweeted.\n\nLawfare's Roger Parloff tweeted that according to the December 30 ruling, Trump \"failed to prove that Judge Kaplan 'erred in any of the challenged rulings.'\"\n\nWMBD Radio observed that \"Carroll's cases are continuing despite Trump's having won a second four-year White House term on Nov. 5.\"\n\nThe Democratic group Blue Virginia posted , \"Good, although the fact that 10s of millions of Americans (including Glenn Youngkin, Jen Kiggans, etc.) simply don't care about this is incredibly depressing.\"\n\nJournalist Adam Klasfield pointed out that Carroll's allegations had been \"affirmed by a federal appeals court.\""

      "text": "'Did he defame her again?' Expert points out how Trump just risked new E. Jean Carroll charges\n\nIn a so-called \"press conference\" in Manhattan on Friday - after which he took no questions - former President Donald Trump repeatedly assailed writer E. Jean Carroll and other women who accused him of sexual misconduct. Now, one legal expert is saying that tirade may end up costing him.\n\nTrump was in court on Friday for a hearing about his appeal of a $5 million civil verdict from 2023, in which the 45th president of the United States was found liable for sexual abuse. That verdict was separate from his early 2024 verdict for defamation, in which a New York jury ordered Trump to pay Carroll $83.3 million in damages.\n\nAfter Trump's speech concluded, former assistant Manhattan district attorney Karen Friedman Agnifilo joined CNN's Wolf Blitzer, who asked her why Trump chose to attend the appeal given that he didn't attend the initial 2023 proceedings. Agnifilo said that was \"one of the big questions,\" but that a bigger one could be if Carroll's attorneys end up taking additional legal action in response to his latest attacks on their client.\n\n\"This was an appellate argument. This is him trying to appeal the finding of liability that this nine-person jury found against him and found that he had sexually abused [Carroll]. He's guilty, essentially of sexually abusing E. Jean Carroll in addition to defaming her,\" Agnifilo explained. \"And so that is what he's complaining about here, is he almost wants a do over. You can't do that on appeal. On appeal, the judges look at the record and that's it. They don't listen to your defense or anything else that you have to say.\"\n\n\"One of the things I was listening for is, did he defame her again? And will E. Jean Carroll bring additional defamation charges against him from this press conference?\" She continued. \"Because every time he denies ever meeting her or knowing her or denies that this happened, that could be another charge of defamation. So it'll be interesting to see if the lawyers bring more defamation charges against him.\"\n\nTrump maintained that he had no idea who Carroll was, and that he \"never met her.\" However, Vanity Fair special correspondent Molly Jong-Fast dug up a photo of Trump speaking to several people - including Carroll - at an event in the 1990s while standing next to his then-wife Marla Maples.\n\n\"She has gone around for years saying this story and it's a total lie,\" the former president said, \"This whole thing started, along with just about every case I've been involved with, with the political campaign of [Vice President Kamala] Harris , who's having a bad time.\"\n\nThe former president's approximately 45-minute speech to the media mostly involved him lobbing baseless allegations at President Joe Biden's Department of Justice for supposedly putting its finger on the scale in the case (which he called a \"rigged deal\"). He added that the media should look into \"China, China, China\" and \"Iran, Iran, Iran\" instead of telling voters about his legal woes.\n\nCarroll's initial allegation was that the ex-president sexually assaulted her in Manhattan's Bergdorf Goodman department store in the 1990s, when Trump was still a New York real estate mogul. Trump posited that Carroll fabricated the story in order to accumulate money and to score political points, which led to her successful defamation lawsuit.\n\nWatch Agnifilo's segment below, or by clicking this link ."

Jean Carroll hearing singled out by legal analyst\n\nAs part of her column explaining why Donald Trump showed up for a hearing at a Manhattan's federal court where his lawyers made an appeal to a three- judge panel to toss writer E. Jean Carroll's first civil trial verdict where he was found liable for sexual abuse and defamation, MSNBC's Lisa Rubin noted it started off in a disconcerting manner .\n\nBefore getting to her larger point that the former president likely showed up as part of a fundraising ploy to get his rabid fans to send him more money to be used to pay his multi-million dollar Carroll penalty by playing the real victim in a press conference afterwards, Rubin pointed out two \"notable\" Trump actions that she found disturbing.\n\nPointing out that the former president showed up for the hearing - which he was not obligated to attend - with a phalanx of lawyers and his Secret Service protective detail and reported, \"before the argument began, Trump did two notable - and chilling - acts.\"\n\nALSO READ: Something broke Trump's brain\n\n\"First, while still standing, he wheeled around and surveyed the gallery of assembled press and members of the public,\" she wrote before continuing, \"First, while still standing, he wheeled around and surveyed the gallery of assembled press and members of the public.

But Carroll, in a nipped-waist skirt suit with her hair tied back with a girlish, satiny bow, stared straight ahead, just as she had for nearly all of her two trials.\"\n\nShe went on to make her point that the grandstanding press conference that followed, \"|Trump and his campaign advisers well understand the perverse relationship between his perceived victimization through the civil and criminal cases against him , on the one hand, and his popularity among his base, on the other. And they recognize that Trump's fundraising peaks when he is - or simply portrays himself to be - in serious legal peril.\"\n\nYou can read more here ."

      "text": "Trump's efforts to delay paying E. Jean Carroll officially over after Judge Kaplan ruling\n\nUS District Judge Lewis F. Kaplan has denied former President Donald Trump a stay in paying his eight-figure civil judgment to writer E. Jean Carroll in a Thursday ruling. This means Trump now has no other option but to immediately post the judgment bond plus interest, or simply pay the judgment outright.\n\nPolitico legal reporter Kyle Cheney tweeted an excerpt of Judge Kaplan's ruling on Thursday, in which he remarked specifically on Trump's strategy to delay and postpone accountability at every opportunity.\n\n\"Mr. Trump's current situation is a result of his own dilatory actions,\" Kaplan wrote . \"He has had since January 26 to organize his finances with the knowledge that he might need to bond this judgment, yet he waited until 25 days after the jury verdict - and only shortly before the expiration of Rule 62's automatic 30-day stay of judgment - to file his prior motion for an unsecured or partially secured stay pending resolution of post-trial motions.\"\n\n\"His present application for a temporary administrative stay is denied,\" he added.\n\nIn early February, a New York jury ordered Trump to pay Carroll $83.3 million after she sued him for defamation. Carroll filed the lawsuit after Trump baselessly accused her of lying about when he sexually assaulted her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in the 1990s, saying she fabricated the claim for financial gain. That judgment came roughly a year after a separate $5 million judgment in Carroll's favor for sexual abuse.\n\nTrump attorney Alina Habba said in a post-trial press conference that her client would appeal the judgment. However, under New York law, any appeal requires that a bond equal to the initial judgment plus 9% interest be set aside in a separate, court-managed account, to ensure the plaintiff would be paid if the defendant loses the appeal. When including the statutory interest, Trump will have to post more than $90 million while the appeals process plays out.\n\nKaplan pointed out that at no point in the post-trial process did Trump indicate \"what expenses he might incur if required to post a bond or other security, on what terms (if any) he could obtain a conventional bond, or post cash or other assets to secure payment of the judgment, or any other circumstances relevant to the situation.\" Because the former president already tried unsuccessfully to get a judge to accept a $100 million bond concerning his $454 million civil fraud judgment, Trump may not have the cash on hand for the Carroll judgment, either.\n\nEven though the judge denied his offer of a lower bond payment, he did add that Trump would be free to seek out bank loans from to help pay the judgment. But that may be easier said than done, given that the former president is now officially an adjudicated fraudster who already has a rocky relationship with financial institutions, given his past history with Deutsche Bank and his pattern of artificially inflating the values of his real estate assets.\n\nOn Thursday, former federal prosecutor Jeffrey Toobin suggested that if Trump is unable to get banks to help him pay his judgments, he may have to lean on his foreign business connections . Trump's son, Eric, previously alluded to the Trump Organization having a history of borrowing money from Russia to finance the development of his company's golf resorts, though he later denied making that statement.\n\nBesides having to pay his judgments, Trump is also struggling to pay his sky-high legal fees. He's already paid roughly $55 million in legal costs in 2023 alone, and still has to defend himself in four criminal trials coming up later this year. The first of those trials will take place in Manhattan later this month. So far, Trump's legal team has yet to notch a win in any New York courtroom since leaving office."

      "text": "Legal expert reveals 'two chilling acts' from Trump during defamation appeal\n\nIn an op-ed published by MSNBC this weekend, legal correspondent Lisa Rubin explains why she believes Donald Trump failed to show up for the Thursday hearing related to his federal election interference case since the Supreme Court's immunity ruling - but did manage to attend oral argument Friday for his team's \"appeal of E. Jean Carroll's first civil trial verdict that found him liable for sexual abuse and defamation.\"\n\nRubin emphasizes: \"Sometimes you can only win by losing. And Trump knows that well.\"\n\nThe MSNBC correspondent points out that during \"the first Carroll trial, which dealt with statements Trump made in fall 2022 , yielded a $5 million award for Carroll,\" which, although a large sum of money, is \"likely pocket change to\" the former president. \"So why would he care?\" the legal expert asked. \"Because although Friday's argument was technically limited to evidentiary issues at the first trial, it could also impact the much larger, $83.3 million verdict in the second trial, which concerned Trump's June 2019 statements .\"\n\nRubin notes :\n\nLast year, the trial judge overseeing both Carroll cases, Lewis Kaplan, determined that the first trial verdict established that Trump's substantively 'identical' 2019 statements were also defamatory and, therefore, Trump's liability had already been adjudicated. All that was left for the second jury, Kaplan ruled, was to decide Carroll's damages. The flip side of Kaplan's decision, however, is that if the appeals court overturns the first verdict, it would necessarily destroy the second. And it could have been that hope - specifically, the hope of erasing nearly $90 million owed to Carroll - that brought Trump to watch the appeal.\n\nThe legal expert submits that the Carroll defamation case \"plays right into the twin pillars of Trump's messaging: martyrdom and misogyny\" - which is why the ex-president \"stewed silently during court so he could unleash his grievances after, all with the goal of filling his campaign coffer and pushing back on Harris' 'prosecutor versus sexual abuser' framing .\"\n\nRubin then points to \"two notable - and chilling - acts\" the 2024 GOP nominee did during the court appearance.\n\n\"First, while still standing, he wheeled around and surveyed the gallery of assembled press and members of the public. Eyes narrowed, he glowered in an echo of trial days past ,\" the legal expert writes. \"Then, taking his seat at the head of a table immediately behind his legal team, he turned to his right, seeming to appraise a tall blonde seated at a table directly across the room.\"\n\nCarroll, however, Rubin notes, \"in a nipped-waist skirt suit with her hair tied back with a girlish, satiny bow, stared straight ahead, just as she had for nearly all of her two trials.\"\n\nRubin's full op-ed is available at this link."

Jean Carroll in her two defamation lawsuits against former President Donald Trump - indicated that a third defamation case is possible if Trump continues to verbally attack the former Elle Magazine columnist.\n\nKaplan told CNBC , \"As we said after the last jury verdict, we continue to monitor every statement that Donald Trump makes about our client, E. Jean Carroll.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Trump is still reeling from the damages that juries have ordered him to pay in Carroll's two defamation lawsuits: $5 million in the first, $83.3 million in the second.\n\nTrump and his lawyers have been trying to delay the second payment. But according to the Daily Beast's Jose Pagliery , an attempted delay proved unsuccessful.\n\n\"When Donald Trump posted the $91.6 million bond on Friday allowing him to appeal the E. Jean Carroll decision without paying her immediately,\" Pagliery explains in an article published on March 12 , \"it set off an interesting scramble to unpack why Federal Insurance Company - a subsidiary of Chubb Insurance Company - would lend to a notoriously unreliable borrower. But there was also some fine print in the bond that would have, curiously, given Trump an additional 30 days to come up with the money - as well as another 30 days for FIC to come up with the money if Trump failed to pay.\"\n\nThe Daily Beast reporter continues , \"That meant Trump had found a way to unilaterally stall paying up, pending the consent of the court.... for three days, it seemed as if Trump had gotten away with a minor tweak in court paperwork that would have created a two-month delay in having to pay a cent to the journalist he defamed - even if he lost the rape defamation case on appeal.\"\n\nBut Pagliery reports that Kaplan's attorney \"spotted the odd jumble of legalese and pressured Trump's legal team to give up the ploy for extra time.\"\n\n\"According to Neil Pedersen, who runs an eponymous appellate bond agency in Manhattan, Trump's extension on paying up was 'not standard,'\" Pagliery notes . \"The episode is merely the latest example of the many twists and turns that continue to unfold as Carroll fights to punish the man who keeps denying that he sexually attacked her in the dressing room of a Manhattan department store - even though one federal jury concluded he did it and a second federal jury fined him to stop his lies about the assault.\"\n\nRead the Daily Beast's full report at this link (subscription required)."

Jean Carroll's first defamation lawsuit was for former President Donald Trump, her second one brought a much larger judgement.\n\nJurors in the first case awarded the former Elle Magazine columnist $5 million , but on Friday afternoon, January 26, the news broke that jurors in the second case had decided to award her $83.3 million in damages. That includes $18.3 in compensatory damages and $65 million in punitive damages.\n\nIn an op-ed published by MSNBC on January 29, journalist Molly Jong-Fast argues that the importance of the $83.3 million award goes way beyond justice for Carroll - it is a victory for feminism in general.\n\nPOLL: Should Trump be allowed to hold office again?\n\n\"I don't remember when I met the glamorous advice columnist E. Jean Carroll,\" Jong-Fast explains , \"but I do know that it was through my mom, feminist writer Erica Jong. They were very similar types, women in media in New York City. My mother wrote books; Carroll wrote an advice column.\"\n\nThe journalist continues , \"Both women are now in their 80s.... Women like my mother and Carroll have seen some of their biggest victories of our society reversed by Trump. Guarantees of rights they thought they'd always have, like Roe v. Wade , are gone.\"\n\nAfter being awarded $5 million in damages in her first defamation case in May 2023, Carroll applauded the decision as a \"victory.... not just for me, but for every woman who has suffered because she was not believed.\" And the $83.3 Carroll has been awarded, Jong-Fast stresses , is another blow against the United States' \"deeply misogynistic edge.\"\n\n\"Women like my mother.... and Carroll have paid dearly in their fight to earn more rights for their daughters like me, and for future generations,\" Jong-Fast writes . \"Because of Trump, they're still fighting. And we need them. If anything, (this) verdict proves there is a very important place for women like them in society - women with the wisdom, tenacity and deep understanding of people who keep turning back time, limiting our rights and trying to ignore them.\"\n\nRead Molly Jong-Fast's full MSNBC op-ed at this link ."

Jean Carroll trial will be for Trump\n\nIn addition to four criminal indictments, Donald Trump is facing a variety of civil lawsuits - one of which is writer E. Jean Carroll's second defamation case against the former president and 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner.\n\nU.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan , who is overseeing the case, issued a 27-page order on Tuesday, October 9. And the Daily Beast's Jose Pagliery analyzes the judge's words and actions in an article published the following day .\n\nKaplan's order, Pagliery emphasizes , makes its abundantly clear that the case will only get worse for Trump when the trial gets underway.\n\nPOLL: Should Trump be allowed to hold office again?\n\n\"With Donald Trump's second rape defamation trial only one week away,\" Pagliery explains , \"a federal judge has rewarded the billionaire's unceasing legal insolence and delusional defense strategy with a brutal order laying out just how punishing the court battle is going to be. Until recently, the former president's lawyers had been preparing for the upcoming defamation trial as if the first one never happened - seeing it as a chance to rewrite history and try to clear Trump's name after a jury, last year, concluded he sexually assaulted the journalist E. Jean Carroll decades ago.\"\n\nIn the order, Kaplan wrote that \"the material facts concerning the alleged sexual assault\" against Carroll \"already have been determined, and this trial will not be a 'do over' of the previous trial.\"\n\nKaplan, the Daily Beast reporter notes , has \"reiterated that the jury will merely be deciding how badly to reprimand Trump for dragging Carroll's name through the mud.\" The judge's order, according to Pagliery , \"clarified that Trump will have the obligation - but not the right - to remain silent about nearly everything the billionaire intended to say in court.\"\n\n\"This new jury will see the most damning evidence of Trump's misogyny, from the 'Access Hollywood' tape in which he gloats about how he can 'grab them by the pussy' to the videotaped deposition where he remarks that stars get away with sexual assault 'unfortunately - or fortunately,\" Pagliery points out . \"The previous iteration of this case dealt with the defamatory denials Trump made after leaving office, a trial that cost him $5 million in damages, which he apparently paid.\"\n\nPagliery continues , \"The second defamation trial, which begins next week, deals with the denials Trump made as U.S. president, with all the additional attention and gravitas his former position of power bestowed upon him at the time he made those comments.... Trump can't even say he didn't believe Carroll was telling the truth about their encounter in the 1990s, the judge wrote. That means Trump's big claims that he plans to finally speak up and testify at this trial - after notably ghosting the first one - might amount to nothing but grandstanding. The calculation has flipped, and Trump potentially stands much more to lose by showing up now that he'll be effectively wearing a courtroom muzzle.\"\n\nJose Pagliery's full analysis for The Daily Beast is available at this link (subscription required)."

(AP Photo/John Minchillo)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - A jury found Donald Trump liable Tuesday for sexually abusing advice columnist E. Jean Carroll in 1996, awarding her $5 million in a judgment that could haunt the former president as he campaigns to regain the White House.\n\nThe verdict was split: Jurors rejected Carroll's claim that she was raped, finding Trump responsible for a lesser degree of sexual abuse. The judgment adds to Trump's legal woes and offers vindication to Carroll, whose allegations had been mocked and dismissed by Trump for years.\n\nShe nodded as the verdict was announced in a New York City federal courtroom only three hours after deliberations had begun , then hugged supporters and smiled through tears. As the courtroom cleared, Carroll could be heard laughing and crying.\n\nJurors also found Trump liable for defaming Carroll over her allegations. Trump did not attend the civil trial and was absent when the verdict was read.\n\nTrump immediately lashed out on his social media site, claiming that he does not know Carroll and referring to the verdict as \"a disgrace\" and \"a continuation of the greatest witch hunt of all time.\" He promised to appeal.\n\nTrump's lawyer, Joseph Tacopina, shook hands with Carroll and hugged her lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, after the verdict was announced. Outside the courthouse, he told reporters the jury's rejection of the rape claim while finding Trump responsible for sexual abuse was \"perplexing\" and \"strange.\"\n\n\"Part of me was obviously very happy that Donald Trump was not branded a rapist,\" he said.\n\nHe defended Trump's absence, citing the trial's \"circus atmosphere.\" He said having Trump there \"would be more of a circus.\"\n\nTacopina added: \"What more can you say other than 'I didn't do it'?\"\n\nIn a written statement, Kaplan said the verdict proved nobody is above the law, \"not even the president of the United States.\"\n\nCarroll, in her own statement, said she sued Trump to \"clear my name and to get my life back. Today, the world finally knows the truth. This victory is not just for me but for every woman who has suffered because she was not believed.\"\n\nIt was unclear what, if any, implications the verdict would have on Trump's third presidential bid. He's in a commanding position among GOP contenders and has faced few political consequences in the wake of previous controversies, ranging from the vulgar \"Access Hollywood\" tape to his New York criminal indictment.\n\nHis GOP rivals were mostly silent after the verdict, a sign of their reluctance to cross Trump supporters who are critical to winning the presidential nomination. Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, one of the few vocal Trump critics in the race, said the verdict was \"another example of the indefensible behavior of Donald Trump.\"\n\nCarroll was one of more than a dozen women who have accused Trump of sexual assault or harassment. She went public in a 2019 memoir with her allegation that the Republican raped her in the dressing room of a posh Manhattan department store.\n\nTrump, 76, denied it , saying he never encountered Carroll at the store and did not know her. He has called her a \"nut job\" who invented \"a fraudulent and false story\" to sell a memoir.\n\nCarroll, 79, sought unspecified damages, plus a retraction of what she said were Trump's defamatory denials of her claims.\n\nThe trial revisited the lightning-rod topic of Trump's conduct toward women.\n\nCarroll gave multiple days of frank, occasionally emotional testimony , buttressed by two friends who testified that she reported the alleged attack to them soon afterward.\n\nJurors also heard from Jessica Leeds, a former stockbroker who testified that Trump abruptly groped her against her will on an airline flight in the 1970s, and from Natasha Stoynoff, a writer who said Trump forcibly kissed her against her will while she was interviewing him for a 2005 article.\n\nThe six-man, three-woman jury also saw the well-known 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" hot-mic recording of Trump talking about kissing and grabbing women without asking.\n\nThe Associated Press typically does not name people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly, as Carroll, Leeds and Stoynoff have done.\n\nThe verdict comes as Trump faces an accelerating swirl of legal risks.\n\nHe's fighting a New York criminal case related to hush money payments made to a porn actor. The state attorney general has sued him, his family and his business over alleged financial wrongdoing.\n\nTrump is also contending with investigations into his possible mishandling of classified documents, his actions after the 2020 election and his activities during the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Trump denies wrongdoing in all of those matters.\n\nCarroll, who penned an Elle magazine advice column for 27 years, has also written for magazines and \"Saturday Night Live.\" She and Trump were in social circles that overlapped at a 1987 party, where a photo documented them and their then-spouses interacting. Trump has said he doesn't remember it.\n\nAccording to Carroll, she ended up in a dressing room with Trump after they ran into each other at Bergdorf Goodman on an unspecified Thursday evening in spring 1996.\n\nThey took an impromptu jaunt to the lingerie department so he could search for a women's gift and soon were teasing each other about trying on a skimpy bodysuit, Carroll testified. To her, it seemed like comedy, something like her 1986 \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch in which a man admires himself in a mirror.\n\nBut then, she said, Trump slammed the door, pinned her against a wall, planted his mouth on hers, yanked her tights down and raped her as she tried to break away. Carroll said she ultimately pushed him off with her knee and immediately left the store.\n\n\"I always think back to why I walked in there to get myself in that situation,\" she testified, her voice breaking, \"but I'm proud to say I did get out.\"\n\nShe never called police or noted it in her diary. Carroll said she kept silent for fear Trump would retaliate, out of shame and because she worried that people would see her as somewhat responsible for being attacked.\n\nThe jury awarded Carroll $2 million for Trump's sexual abuse and $20,000 in punitive damages. For defamation, jurors awarded $1 million for Trump's October statement, another $1.7 million for harm to Carroll's reputation and $280,000 in punitive damages.\n\nTacopina told jurors Carroll invented her claims after hearing about a 2012 \"Law and Order\" episode in which a woman is raped in the dressing room of the lingerie section of a Bergdorf Goodman store.\n\nCarroll \"cannot produce any objective evidence to back up her claim because it didn't happen,\" he told jurors. He accused her of \"advancing a false claim of rape for money, for political reasons and for status.\"\n\nIn questioning Carroll, he sought to cast doubt on her description of fighting off the far heavier Trump without dropping her handbag or ripping her tights, and without anyone around to hear or see them in the lingerie section.\n\nThe lawyer pressed her about - by her own account - not screaming, looking for help while fleeing the store or seeking out medical attention, security video or police.\n\nCarroll reproached him.\n\n\"I'm telling you he raped me, whether I screamed or not,\" she said.\n\nThere's no possibility of Trump being charged with attacking Carroll, as the legal time limit has long since passed.\n\nFor similar reasons, she initially filed her civil case as a defamation lawsuit, saying Trump's derogatory denials had subjected her to hatred, shredded her reputation and harmed her career.\n\nThen, starting last fall, New York state gave people a chance to sue over sexual assault allegations that would otherwise be too old. Carroll was one of the first to file.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

Jean Carroll , noted in a statement that the statute of limitations for defamation in most jurisdictions ranges from one to three years.\n\n\"As we said after the last jury verdict, we continue to monitor every statement that Donald Trump makes about our client, E. Jean Carroll,\" Kaplan said.\n\nHer statement came after the Republican front-runner in this year's presidential race angrily complained during a nearly two-hour speech at a Rome, Georgia, rally on Saturday that he had \"just posted\" a $91.6 million bond to cover the January verdict by a Manhattan jury while he appeals.\n\nHe told the rally that the verdict was \"based on false accusations made about me by a woman that I knew nothing about, didn't know, never heard of.\"\n\nHis statements about Carroll were similar to those he made while he was president after Carroll first publicly revealed her claims in a 2019 memoir that Trump had raped her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room across the street from Trump Tower in the spring of 1996. At the time, Trump said she was lying to sell her book and damage him politically.\n\n\"This woman is not a believable person,\" Trump said Saturday. He also denounced the trial judge as a \"Democrat Trump-deranged judge\" and derided a state judge in a separate case who recently refused to halt collection of a $454 million civil fraud penalty against Trump as \"another whacked-out judge.\" For over 10 minutes, Trump railed against his civil cases and four criminal cases , saying he'd been indicted more often than the \"late, great Al Capone.\"\n\nTrump, 77, followed up his Saturday rally statements with an interview on Monday on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" in which he labeled Carroll as \"Miss Bergdorf Goodman\" and said, \"I have no idea who she is.\"\n\nFILE - Former President Donald Trump speaks after exiting the courtroom for a break at New York Supreme Court, Dec. 7, 2023, in New York.

The trial judge instructed the jury that it was only to determine what damages, if any, Trump owed as a result of his 2019 statements. They were to accept the findings of the previous jury that last May concluded Trump sexually abused Carroll at the department store but did not rape her according to New York state's legal definition of rape.\n\nThat jury, in awarding Carroll $5 million, also found that Trump defamed her with statements made in October 2022. Trump did not attend the May trial.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer Jill Covin in Washington contributed to this story.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

Donald Trump is seated at left, as Judge Lewis Kaplan presides. (Elizabeth Williams via AP)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - With former President Donald Trump no longer in the courtroom Thursday, a columnist who accused him of sexually attacking her concluded her testimony with an emphatic denial that she had benefited from the publicity that followed the allegations.\n\nA Trump attorney tried to show the jury that E. Jean Carroll has achieved the fame, if not the fortune, she desired after the publication of a memoir accusing Trump of raping her in a department store dressing room in the 1990s.\n\nCarroll responded: \"No, my status was lowered. I'm partaking in this trial to bring my own reputation and status back.\"\n\nThe testimony came on the third day of a trial in Manhattan federal court that will determine what damages, if any, Trump owes for remarks he made about Carroll when he was president. A jury has already found Trump liable for sexually abusing Carroll in 1996 and defaming her in a separate round of denials he made following his presidency.\n\nIn her final day on the witness stand, Carroll said her allegations against Trump - first made public in a 2019 article in New York Magazine - had brought her an unexpected degree of infamy, along with death threats.\n\nAn attorney for Trump, Alina Habba, countered that Carroll's social media followers increased \"exponentially\" since the allegations, adding that she had gained professional opportunities and social standing among left-leaning celebrities.\n\n\"I've been invited to two parties,\" Carroll responded dryly, before adding: \"Yes, I'm more well known and I'm hated by a lot more people.\"\n\nTrump, who had attended the first two days of the trial, was in Florida Thursday for the funeral of his mother-in-law.\n\nDuring the previous day's proceeding, he was scolded by Judge Lewis A. Kaplan and threatened with expulsion after a lawyer for Carroll complained he was grumbling about the case loudly enough that jurors could hear him.\n\nThough he was absent from the courtroom Thursday, Trump's presence still loomed over the proceedings, as lawyers for Carroll played a video of his press conference from the previous evening describing the trial as \"rigged\" and Carroll as \"a person I never knew.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Habba also showed jurors a series of mean tweets sent to Carroll in the hours after her allegations became public in 2019 but before Trump released his first public statements - an apparent effort to prove the vitriol directed at Carroll was unrelated to the former president's statements.\n\n\"They follow Donald Trump. They want to emulate him,\" Carroll said. \"They're standing up for the man they admire.\"\n\nThe judge quickly shut down the line of questioning, saying it was \"simply repetitious.\"\n\nCarroll has testified that her life changed dramatically after Trump branded her a liar, claimed he never met her and asserted that she made her claims against him to promote her book and damage him politically. She said she lives in fear, sleeps with a loaded gun beside her and wishes she could boost her security but doesn't have enough money.\n\nLast May, a jury in the same courtroom awarded Carroll $5 million in damages after concluding Trump sexually abused her in a Bergdorf Goodman store across the street from Trump Tower in spring 1996 and then defamed her with statements in October 2022.\n\nIn that verdict, jurors rejected Carroll's claim that she was raped, finding Trump responsible for a lesser degree of sexual abuse. The judge said the jury's decision was based on \"the narrow, technical meaning\" of rape in New York penal law and that, in his analysis, the verdict did not mean that Carroll \"failed to prove that Mr. Trump 'raped' her as many people commonly understand the word 'rape.'\"\n\nTrump did not attend that trial and has said recently on the campaign trail that he was advised by his attorney to stay away.\n\nTrump has been animated during his two days in the courtroom this week, shaking his head at testimony he disagreed with, passing notes to his lawyers and speaking to them while jurors were in the room.\n\nDuring his confrontation with the judge on Wednesday, Trump responded to the threat to eject him from the courtroom with: \"I would love it.\"\n\nThat prompted the judge to say: \"I know you would. You just can't control yourself in these circumstances, apparently.\"\n\nAfter he left the courthouse Wednesday, Trump told reporters that Kaplan, a Bill Clinton appointee, was \"a nasty judge\" and a \"Trump-hating guy\" who was \"obviously not impartial.\"\n\nSometime next week, the jury will be asked to determine damages. Carroll is seeking $10 million in compensatory damages and substantially more in punitive damages.\n\nNorthwestern University sociologist Ashlee Humphreys, who testified at last year's trial, told the jury Thursday that Trump's 2019 statements had caused between $7.2 million and $12.1 million in harm to Carroll's reputation after they were seen or heard about up 104 million times through social, print and broadcast media. Her estimates were based on what she said it would cost to repair Carroll's reputation.\n\nHabba said in an opening statement that Carroll should not receive more money, particularly since the death threats and comments she receives on social media are not unusual for public figures with a strong social media presence.\n\n\"Regardless of a few mean tweets, Ms. Carroll is now more famous than she has ever been in her life, and loved and respected by many, which was her goal,\" Habba told jurors.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Eduardo Munoz Alvarez)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Veering from the campaign trail to a courtroom, Donald Trump quietly observed Friday as his lawyer fought to overturn a verdict finding the former president liable for sexual abuse and defamation.\n\nThe Republican nominee and his accuser, E. Jean Carroll , a writer, sat at tables about 15 feet (4.5 meters) apart, in a Manhattan federal appeals court. Trump didn't acknowledge or look at Carroll as he passed directly in front of her on the way in and out, but he sometimes shook his head, including when Carroll's attorney said he sexually attacked her.\n\nTrump attorney D. John Sauer told three 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals judges that the civil trial in Carroll's lawsuit was muddied by improper evidence.\n\n\"This case is a textbook example of implausible allegations being propped up by highly inflammatory, inadmissible\" evidence, Sauer said, noting that jurors saw the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape in which Trump boasted in 2005 about grabbing women's genitals because when someone is a star, \"you can do anything.\"\n\nCarroll's lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, told judges the evidence in question was proper, and that there was plenty of proof in the nearly two-week-long trial of Carroll's claim that Trump attacked her in a luxury department store dressing room decades ago. She said the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, as the trial judge had noted, could be viewed as a confession.\n\n\"E. Jean Carroll brought this case because Donald Trump sexually assaulted her in 1996, in a dressing room at Bergdorf Goodman, and then defamed her in 2022 by claiming that she was crazy and made the whole thing up,\" Kaplan said.\n\nCarroll, standing with Kaplan outside the courthouse afterward, declined to comment.\n\nTrump left court in a motorcade, then delivered a lengthy diatribe against the case at Trump Tower, where he said again that Carroll - and other women who had accused him of sexual assault - were making everything up.\n\n\"It's so false. It's a made up, fabricated story by somebody, I think, initially, just looking to promote a book,\" Trump said. Carroll first spoke publicly about her encounter with Trump in a newly published memoir in 2019.\n\nIn remarks to reporters Friday, Trump repeated many claims about Carroll that a jury has already deemed defamatory, and added some new ones, like suggesting that a photograph of him and Carroll together in 1987 was produced by artificial intelligence. It was unclear whether his comments could lead to a new defamation lawsuit by Carroll.\n\n\"I've said before and I'll say it again: all options are on the table,\" Kaplan said after Trump's news conference.\n\nThe three-judge panel, if it follows the pattern of other appeals, would be unlikely to rule for weeks, if not months.\n\nA jury found in May 2023 that Trump sexually abused Carroll. He denies it. That jury awarded Carroll $5 million .\n\nTrump did not attend the trial and has expressed regret that he was not there.\n\nThe civil case has political and financial implications for Trump.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, has jabbed at Trump over the jury's verdict, noting repeatedly that he had been found liable for sexual abuse.\n\nAnd last January, a second jury awarded Carroll another $83.3 million in damages for comments Trump had made about her while he was president, finding that they were defamatory. That jury had been instructed by the judge to accept the first jury's finding that Trump had sexually abused Carroll.\n\nTrump, 78, testified less than three minutes at the second trial and was not permitted to refute conclusions reached by the May 2023 jury. Still, he was animated in the courtroom throughout the two-week trial, and jurors could hear him grumbling about the case.\n\nThe appeal of that trial's outcome will be heard by the appeals court at a later date.\n\nCarroll, 80, testified during both trials that her life as an Elle magazine columnist was spoiled by Trump's public comments, which she said ignited such hate against her that she received death threats and feared going outside the upstate New York cabin where she lives.\n\nThe Associated Press does not identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly, as Carroll has done.\n\nDuring Friday's arguments, Trump's attorney said testimony from witnesses who said Carroll told them about the 1996 encounter with Trump immediately afterward was improper because the witnesses had \"egregious bias\" against Trump.\n\nSauer also attacked the trial judge's decision to let two other women testify about similar acts of sex abuse they say Trump committed against them in the 1970s and in 2005. Trump denies those allegations too.\n\nKaplan said that in each instance of sex abuse, including one that occurred on an airplane, Trump followed a similar pattern in which he would engage in \"pleasant chatting\" bordering on flirtation and then \"all of a sudden out of nowhere, he would, for lack of a better term your honor, pounce.\"\n\nShe added: \"Once these three brave women came forward and said what had happened to them, he said the same thing about all three of them.\"\n\nPerhaps foreshadowing the eventual decision, Circuit Judge Denny Chin warned Sauer that the 2nd Circuit generally gives \"great deference\" to lower court judges on evidentiary issues.\n\n\"It's very hard to overturn a jury verdict based on evidentiary rulings,\" Chin said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Jennifer Peltz contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Jean Carroll in a defamation lawsuit while he appeals the jury's verdict , the former president's lawyer told a court on Friday.\n\nAttorney Alina Habba filed papers with the New York judge to show that Trump had secured the bond from the Federal Insurance Co., a unit of the insurance giant Chubb. The bond would cover the $83.3 million judgement in the lawsuit, plus interest.\n\nHabba simultaneously filed a notice showing Trump, the likely 2024 Republican presidential nominee , is appealing the verdict. The posting of the bond was a necessary step to delay payment of the award until the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals can rule on Trump's legal challenge.\n\nThe filings came a day after Judge Lewis A.

He now has until March 25 to either pay up or buy a bond covering the full amount. In the meantime, interest on the judgment continues to mount, adding roughly $112,000 each day.\n\nTrump's lawyers have asked for that judgment to be stayed on appeal, warning he might need to sell some properties to cover the penalty.\n\nA civil jury in New York last May found that Trump had sexually abused Carroll in 1996 in the dressing room of a luxury department store in Manhattan.\n\nTrump, 77, vehemently denies the claims, saying that he didn't know Carroll at the time and that the encounter at a Bergdorf Goodman store never took place.\n\nThat jury awarded Carroll $5 million to compensate her for both the alleged sexual assault and for damage to her reputation when Trump said publicly that she made up the attack to help sell a memoir.\n\nA second trial was held in January to decide how much more Trump might owe Carroll for derogatory comments he made about her in 2019 while he was president. Kaplan instructed the jury that it must accept the earlier jury's findings that the sexual abuse had happened.\n\nTrump did not attend the May trial. He testified briefly and regularly sat with defense lawyers at the January trial, held in Manhattan, though the judge threatened to banish him from the courtroom for muttering disparaging comments about the case that were potentially loud enough for jurors to hear.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - A federal judge in New York rejected Donald Trump's request for a new trial on Thursday after a jury awarded $83.3 million in damages to a longtime magazine columnist who sued the former president for defamation for calling her claim that he had sexually assaulted her in a Manhattan department store a lie.\n\nThe judge rejected the former president's claims that the compensatory and punitive damages awarded to writer E. Jean Carroll in January were excessive.\n\nThe January verdict came after Carroll, 80, an author and former advice columnist for Elle magazine, testified that Trump's public statements about her had led to death threats.\n\nJudge Lewis Kaplan said in his ruling Thursday that the jury was entitled to find that \"the degree of reprehensibility\" of Trump's attacks against Carroll on social media was high.\n\n\"Far from being purely 'defensive,' there was evidence that Mr. Trump used the office of the presidency - the loudest 'bully pulpit' in America and possibly the world - to issue multiple statements castigating Ms. Carroll as a politically and financially motivated liar, insinuating that she was too unattractive for him to have sexually assaulted, and threatening that she would 'pay dearly' for speaking out,\" Kaplan said.\n\nThe decision was the second time that a civil jury returned a verdict related to Carroll's claim that an encounter with Trump in 1996 in a Bergdorf Goodman's dressing room ended violently. She said Trump slammed her against a wall, pulled down her tights and forced himself on her.\n\nA different jury awarded Carroll $5 million in May 2023. It found Trump not liable for rape, but responsible for sexually abusing Carroll and then defaming her by claiming she made it up. He is appealing that award as well.\n\nCarroll's attorney, Roberta Kaplan, said in a statement that she was \"pleased though not surprised\" by the decision from the judge, who is no relation.\n\nA spokesperson for Trump attorney Alina Habba said she was confident that the decision would be overturned on appeal.\n\nThe decision came as Trump, the presumed Republican candidate for president, spent the day in a criminal courtroom where he is on trial for hush money payments allegedly made to an adult film star in a scheme to cover up negative stories Trump feared would hurt his 2016 presidential campaign. He has pleaded not guilty and says the stories were false.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(Elizabeth Williams via AP)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - He testified for under three minutes. But former President Donald Trump still broke a judge's rules on what he could tell a jury about writer E. Jean Carroll's sexual assault and defamation allegations, and he left the courtroom Thursday bristling to the spectators: \"This is not America.\"\n\nTestifying in his own defense in the defamation trial , Trump didn't look at the jury during his short, heavily negotiated stint on the witness stand. Because of the complex legal context of the case, the judge limited his lawyers to asking a handful of short questions, each of which could be answered yes or no - such as whether he'd made his negative statements in response to an accusation and didn't intend anyone to harm Carroll.\n\nBut Trump nudged past those limits.\n\n\"She said something that I considered to be a false accusation,\" he said, later adding: \"I just wanted to defend myself, my family and, frankly, the presidency.\"\n\nAfter Judge Lewis A. Kaplan told jurors to disregard those remarks, Trump rolled his eyes as he stepped down from the witness stand. The former president and current Republican front-runner left the courtroom during a break soon after, shaking his head and declaring to spectators - three times - that \"this is not America.\"\n\nCarroll looked on throughout from the plaintiff's table. The longtime advice columnist alleges that Trump attacked her in 1996, then defamed her by calling her a liar when she went public with her story in a 2019 memoir.\n\nE. Jean Carroll arrives at Manhattan federal court, Thursday, Jan. 25, 2024, in New York. Former President Donald Trump could return to the New York courtroom Thursday to defend himself against a lawsuit seeking more than $10 million for things he said about Carroll after she accused him of sexual assault. (AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey)\n\nWhile Trump has said a lot about her to the court of public opinion, Thursday marked the first time he has directly addressed a jury about her claims.\n\nBut jurors also heard parts of a 2022 deposition - a term for out-of-court questioning under oath - in which Trump vehemently denied Carroll's allegations, calling her \"sick\" and a \"whack job.\" Trump told jurors Thursday that he stood by that deposition, \"100%.\"\n\nTrump didn't attend a related trial last spring, when a different jury found that he did sexually abuse Carroll and that some of his comments were defamatory, awarding her $5 million. This trial concerns only how much more he may have to pay her for certain remarks he made in 2019, while president. She's seeking at least $10 million.\n\nAP correspondent Jackie Quinn reports.\n\nBecause of the prior jury's findings, Kaplan said Trump now couldn't offer any testimony \"disputing or attempting to undermine\" the sexual abuse allegations. The law doesn't allow for \"do-overs by disappointed litigants,\" the judge said.\n\nEven before taking the stand, Trump chafed at those limitations as the judge and lawyers for both sides discussed what he could be asked.\n\n\"I never met the woman. I don't know who the woman is. I wasn't at the trial,\" he cut in from his seat at the defense table without jurors in the room. Kaplan told Trump he wasn't allowed to interrupt the proceedings.\n\nTrump was the last witness, and closing arguments are set for Friday.\n\nCarroll, 80, claims Trump, 77, ruined her reputation after she publicly aired her account of a chance meeting that spiraled into a sexual assault in spring 1996. At the time, he was a prominent real estate developer, and she was an Elle magazine advice columnist who'd had a TV show.\n\nIn this courtroom sketch, Thursday, Jan. 25, 2024, Donald Trump and his attorney watch video of his deposition, presented prior to the defense resting, in Federal Court in New York. (Elizabeth Williams via AP)\n\nShe says they ran into each other at Bergdorf Goodman, a luxury department store close to Trump Tower, bantered and ended up in a dressing room, teasing each other about trying on lingerie. She has testified that she thought it would just be a funny story to tell but then he roughly forced himself on her before she eventually fought him off and fled.\n\nThe earlier jury found that she was sexually abused but rejected her allegation that she was raped.\n\nBesides Trump, his defense called only one other witness, a friend of Carroll's. The friend, retired TV journalist Carol Martin, was among two people the writer told about her encounter with Trump shortly after it happened, according to testimony at the first trial.\n\nTrump lawyer Alina Habba confronted Martin on Tuesday with text messages in which she called Carroll a \"narcissist\" who seemed to be reveling in the attention she got from accusing and suing Trump. Martin said she regretted her word choices and doesn't believe that Carroll loved the attention she has been getting.\n\nCarroll has testified that she has gotten death threats that worried her enough to buy bullets for a gun she inherited from her father, install an electronic fence, warn her neighbors and unleash her pit bull to roam freely on the property of her small cabin in the mountains of upstate New York.\n\nTrump's attorneys have tried to show the jury through their cross-examination of various witnesses that by taking on Trump, Carroll has gained a measure of fame and financial rewards that outweigh the threats and other venom slung at her through social media.\n\nAfter Carroll's lawyers rested Thursday, Habba asked for a directed verdict in Trump's favor, saying Carroll's side hadn't proven its case. Kaplan denied the request.\n\nEven before testifying, Trump had already tested the judge's patience. After he complained to his lawyers last week about a \"witch hunt\" and a \"con job\" within earshot of jurors, Kaplan threatened to eject him from the courtroom if it happened again. \"I would love it,\" Trump said. Later that day, Trump told a news conference Kaplan was a \"nasty judge\" and that Carroll's allegation was \"a made-up, fabricated story.\"\n\nWhile attending the trial last week, Trump made it clear - through muttered comments and gestures like shaking his head - that he was disgusted with the case. When a video clip from a Trump campaign rally last week was shown in court Thursday, he appeared to lip-synch himself saying the trial was rigged.\n\nThe trial had been suspended since early Monday because of a juror's illness . When it resumed Thursday, the judge said two jurors were being \"socially distanced\" from the others.\n\nTrump attended the trial fresh off big victories in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday and the Iowa caucuses last week. Meanwhile, he also faces four criminal cases . He has been juggling court and campaign appearances , using both to argue that he's being persecuted by Democrats terrified of his possible election.\n\nThe Associated Press typically does not name people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly, as Carroll has done.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Jean Carroll will receive a jury award for his verbal attacks against her if it survives appeals.\n\nJudge Lewis A. Kaplan formally approved the bond on Tuesday, a day after lawyers agreed there was no argument over it.\n\nThe bond offered by the Republican 2024 presidential front-runner comes after Trump's lawyers announced they were appealing the verdict to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan.\n\nOver the weekend at a campaign rally, Trump resumed his attacks on the credibility of the longtime advice columnist, saying she had falsely accused him of raping her in spring 1996 in the dressing room of a luxury department store across the street from Trump Tower.\n\nHer lawyer responded to his remarks at the Georgia rally and a Monday television appearance by suggesting that a third defamation lawsuit was possible if Trump's verbal attacks continued.\n\nTrump had all but stopped his public attacks on Carroll in the weeks after the $83.3 million January defamation award by a jury that had been instructed only to assess damages from Trump's 2019 statements while he was president and accept the findings of another Manhattan jury that last May awarded Carroll $5 million.\n\nThat jury had concluded that Trump defamed Carroll in 2022 and sexually abused her in 1996, though it also found that he had not raped her according to how rape was defined in New York state. The judge, though, said afterward that the jury's findings were consistent with how rape is defined in some jurisdictions.\n\nTrump did not show up for the May trial, but he attended nearly every day in January, grumbling about the case aloud even when jurors were seated in the courtroom. His testimony, though, was limited to just a few minutes because he was not permitted to refute conclusions that had been resolved by the jury last year.\n\nCarroll first made her claims public against Trump in a 2019 memoir.\n\nTrump, 77, also faces a $454 million civil fraud penalty after a New York state judge ruled against him recently. He also faces four criminal cases.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/Frank Franklin II)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Donald Trump was threatened with expulsion from his Manhattan civil trial Wednesday after he repeatedly ignored a warning to keep quiet while writer E. Jean Carroll testified that he shattered her reputation after she accused him of sexual abuse.\n\nJudge Lewis A. Kaplan told the former president that his right to be present at the trial will be revoked if he remains disruptive. After an initial warning, Carroll's lawyer said Trump could still be heard making remarks to his lawyers, including \"it is a witch hunt\" and \"it really is a con job.\"\n\n\"Mr. Trump, I hope I don't have to consider excluding you from the trial,\" Kaplan said in an exchange after the jury was excused for lunch, adding: \"I understand you're probably very eager for me to do that.\"\n\n\"I would love it,\" the Republican presidential front-runner shot back, shrugging as he sat between lawyers Alina Habba and Michael Madaio at the defense table.\n\n\"I know you would. You just can't control yourself in these circumstances, apparently,\" Kaplan responded.\n\n\"You can't either,\" Trump muttered.\n\nAfterward, Trump ripped the judge in brief remarks to reporters at an office building he owns near the courthouse. He called the Bill Clinton appointee \"a nasty judge\" and a \"Trump-hating guy,\" echoing his own social media posts that Kaplan was \"seething and hostile,\" and \"abusive, rude, and obviously not impartial.\"\n\nTrump has made similar comments about the judge in another case: a state of New York lawsuit accusing him of inflating his property values to get better rates on insurance and loans.\n\nOn Wednesday, Judge Kaplan denied a request from Trump's lawyers that he step aside from the case involving Carroll, a longtime Elle magazine advice columnist.\n\nKaplan cracked down after Carroll lawyer Shawn Crowley complained for a second time that Trump could be heard \"loudly saying things\" throughout her testimony as he sat at the defense table, frequently tilting back and leaning over to speak with his lawyers.\n\nCrowley suggested that if Carroll's lawyers could hear Trump from where they were sitting, about 12 feet (3.7 meters) from him, jurors might've been able to hear him, too. Some appeared to split their focus between Trump and the witness stand.\n\n\"I'm just going to ask that Mr. Trump take special care to keep his voice down when conferring with counsel to make sure the jury does not hear it,\" Kaplan said before jurors returned to the courtroom after a morning break.\n\nEarlier, without the jury in the courtroom, Trump could be seen slamming his hand on the defense table and uttering the word \"man\" when the judge again refused his lawyer's request that the trial be suspended on Thursday so he could attend his mother-in-law's funeral in Florida.\n\nTrump, fresh from a win Monday in the Iowa caucuses, has made his various legal fights part of his campaign. He sat in on jury selection Tuesday, then jetted to a New Hampshire rally before returning to court Wednesday and repeating the cycle with another Granite State event Wednesday night.\n\nCarroll was the first witness in a Manhattan federal court trial to determine damages, if any, that Trump owes her for remarks he made while he was president in June 2019 as he vehemently denied ever attacking her or knowing her. A jury last year already found that Trump sexually abused her and defamed her in a round of denials in October 2022.\n\nCarroll's testimony was somewhat of a tightrope walk because of limitations the judge has posed on the trial in light of the previous verdict and prior rulings he's made restricting the infusion of political talk. Habba lobbed multiple objections seeking to prevent the jury from hearing details of Carroll's allegations.\n\n\"I'm here because Donald Trump assaulted me and when I wrote about it, he said it never happened. He lied and he shattered my reputation,\" Carroll testified.\n\nE. Jean Carroll arrives at Manhattan federal court, Wednesday, Jan. 17, 2024, in New York.

He lied on Sunday. He lied yesterday. And I am here to get my reputation back and to stop him from telling lies about me,\" Carroll said.\n\nOnce a respected columnist, Carroll lamented: \"Now, I'm known as the liar, the fraud and the whack job.\" She became emotional as she read through some of hundreds of hateful messages she's received from strangers, apologizing at one point to the jury for reading the nasty language aloud.\n\nCarroll said Trump's smears \"ended the world\" she knew, costing her millions of readers and her \"Ask E. Jean\" advice column, which ran in Elle for more than 25 years. The magazine has said her contract ended for unrelated reasons.\n\nCarroll said her worries about her personal safety after a stream of death threats led her to buy bullets for a gun she inherited from her father, install an electronic fence, warn her neighbors of threats and unleash her pit bull to roam freely on the property of the small cabin in the mountains of upstate New York where she lives alone.\n\nShe also brought security along for the trial this week and last May and said she'd thought often about hiring security more often to accompany her.\n\n\"Why don't you?\" her attorney, Roberta Kaplan - no relation to the judge - asked.\n\n\"Can't afford it,\" Carroll answered.\n\nShe took the stand after a hostile encounter between Habba and the judge - culminating in Trump's desk slam - over his refusal to adjourn the trial on Thursday so Trump could attend the funeral for former first lady Melania Trump's mother, Amalija Knavs, who died last week.\n\nHabba called Judge Kaplan's ruling \"insanely prejudicial\" and the judge soon afterward cut her off, saying he would \"hear no further argument on it.\"\n\nHabba told the judge: \"I don't like to be spoken to that way, your honor.\" When she mentioned the funeral again, the judge responded: \"It's denied. Sit down.\"\n\nCarroll's testimony came nine months after she was in the same chair convincing a jury in the hopes that Trump could be held accountable in a way that would stop him from frequent verbal attacks against her.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump waves as he leaves his apartment building in New York, Wednesday, Jan. 17, 2024.

(AP Photo/Seth Wenig)\n\nBecause the first jury found that Trump sexually abused Carroll in the 1990s and then defamed her in 2022, the new trial concerns only how much more - if anything - he'll be ordered to pay her for other remarks he made in 2019 while he was president.\n\nCarroll accused Trump of forcing himself on her in a luxury department store dressing room in 1996. Then, she alleges, he publicly impugned her honesty, her motives and even her sanity after she told the story publicly in a 2019 memoir.\n\nTrump, 77, asserts that nothing ever happened between him and Carroll, 80, and that he never met her. He says a 1987 party photo of them and their then-spouses \"doesn't count\" because it was a momentary greeting.\n\nTrump did not attend the previous trial in the case last May, when a jury found he had sexually abused and defamed Carroll and awarded her $5 million in damages. The jury said, however, that Carroll hadn't proven her claim that Trump raped her.\n\nCarroll is now seeking $10 million in compensatory damages and millions more in punitive damages.\n\nThe Associated Press typically does not name people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly, as Carroll has done.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jennifer Peltz and Cedar Attanasio contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "The Grim Aftermath of the E. Jean Carroll Verdict\n\nThroughout the defamation trial, Donald Trump eroded the distinction between the court and the court of public opinion.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nThe first time Donald Trump faced the writer E. Jean Carroll in court, in the spring of 2023, he declined to appear at the trial. He lost: The jury, finding him liable both for assaulting her in a department-store dressing room in the 1990s and for defaming her in the aftermath, awarded her $5 million in damages. This month, another defamation suit went to trial-a case based on claims Trump had made about Carroll during his presidency in 2019. This time, he attended the proceedings. Or, more accurately, he attempted to star in them, treating the courtroom as a set and casting himself, variously, as the trial's screenwriter, narrator, publicist, and tragic hero. On Thursday, very briefly, Trump took the stand. On Friday, as Carroll's lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, delivered her closing arguments, he made an abrupt, dramatic exit. Sitting with his defense team, he pouted and smirked and stage-whispered his indignation about the proceedings (\"con job,\" \"witch hunt\"), at one point emoting so loudly that the judge, Lewis Kaplan, threatened to remove him from the courtroom.\n\nThe emoter, however, was unfazed. \"I would love it,\" Trump replied.\n\nThe exchange made for a tidy metaphor: for the trial itself and for the broader implications of Trump's stage fight with the American legal system. How do you handle someone who sees himself as an exception to every rule? Carroll's lawyers framed the damages they sought as a justice of last resort; although Trump \"may not care about the law\" and \"certainly\" doesn't care about truth, Roberta Kaplan argued, \"he does care about money.\" And the jury's verdict, delivered Friday afternoon, suggests that the approach worked. The amount they awarded Carroll, $83.3 million, comprises $18.3 million in compensatory damages and $65 million in punitive damages.\n\nSo Trump has been punished. And he has, in one very particular way, changed his behavior as a result: Over the weekend, his social-media feeds were notably lacking in Carroll-aimed insults. As happens so often when the former president is involved, though, the accountability comes with an asterisk-and not only because Trump's team quickly announced plans to appeal Friday's verdict. Jury trials will always be performances of sorts, with each side competing to win over its 12-member audience. In this one, however, the defendant aimed his antics toward the crowd beyond the courtroom-the jury not of his peers but of his followers. He participated in the trial, it seemed, merely to undermine it, saving the bulk of his testimony for Truth Social , where, post by post, he reframed a case about defamation as evidence of his own persecution. By Friday, acknowledging the verdict, he declared that \"there is no longer Justice in America.\" The escalation was as predictable as it was absurd, and therefore tempting to dismiss. But the former president has many more trials to come , and in that sense his rhetoric is also an omen. Trump has spent years undermining Americans' faith in elections; this is what it looks like when he takes aim at the legal system.\n\nCourtrooms, typically, are settings of constraint. Juries, the oaths they take, the evidence they hear, the context in which they hear it-each is carefully calibrated. Judge Kaplan is known for his no-nonsense stewardship of his courtroom, and the proceedings in E. Jean Carroll v. Donald J. Trump were further narrowed through his invocation of \"collateral estoppel,\" an efficiency rule that limited the scope of the trial. Because the question of whether Trump had assaulted and defamed Carroll had been decided in the earlier proceeding, the question for this jury was simply what damages, if any, Trump should pay for the defamation.\n\nRead: The defiant humanity of E. Jean Carroll\n\nThe result, for Trump, was a setting that was uniquely intolerant of his preferred forms of discourse. And you could read his theatrics, in one way, as a rebellion against the constraint. But you could read them, too, as extensions of the dare-the boast-Trump made when Judge Kaplan considered ejecting him from the courtroom. Trump is a celebrity who comes with an invisible audience; he is a defendant who is supported, in turn, by a collection of defenders who will happily do his bidding when summoned. His fans were a touch point in this latest defamation trial, as attorneys exchanged arguments about the source of graphic death threats Carroll received after Trump maligned her in 2019. But they were there throughout the proceeding as well, in the galleries beyond the courtroom, spectral onlookers suggesting that Trump the legal defendant cannot be separated from Trump the political insurgent. \"When you're a star, they let you do it,\" his famous line goes . \"You can do anything.\"\n\nAnd, so, Trump spent much of the defamation trial engaged in petty displays of impunity. In the courtroom, the jury heard arguments-based on vetted evidence and under-penalty-of-perjury testimony-that Trump had publicly maligned Carroll. Outside court, meanwhile, Trump used social media to ... malign Carroll publicly. (On one day alone, he published more than 40 posts deriding her.) He also denigrated many others he associated with Carroll's case, among them Judge Kaplan, Roberta Kaplan, the state of New York, Joe Biden, Democrats, and the American justice system itself-a spate of insults that treated courts as conspiracies, essentially, fueled by dark money and vapid partisanship and an abiding hatred of Donald Trump.\n\nRead: Is $83.3 million enough to make Trump stop lying?\n\nThe insults did not merely erode the distinction between the court and the court of public opinion; they insisted, post by post and screed by screed, that there is only the court of opinion-that all discourse is political discourse, and that courts are political theaters by other means. In this framework, the $83.3 million awarded to E. Jean Carroll has nothing to do with reputation or defamation or rape or justice; it is a political punishment meted out by people who want Donald Trump to pay simply for being Donald Trump.\n\nThe verdict, in practice, may well do what Roberta Kaplan claimed it could: keep Trump in check and make him put his money, in a direct sense, where his mouth is. But cynicism sells. The notion that the system is rigged has its appeal, whether applied to electoral politics or the courts. And as Trump's trials proliferate, he will likely become more extreme in his denunciations of the law. During another courtroom appearance Trump made earlier this month-for charges that he plotted to overturn the 2020 election-his lawyer argued that he should have absolute immunity from prosecution for actions taken while he was president. The three-judge panel seemed skeptical of a standard that would allow Trump to live above the law. But that is his preferred perch. And many Americans have endorsed his elevation. Last week, Donald Trump lost a case in court. But he won the New Hampshire primary."

      "text": "Nine New York Jurors Saw Trump for Who He Really Is\n\nI teared up as I watched news coverage of the Carroll verdict. Trump is not above the law.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nSign up for The Trump Trials by George T. Conway III, a newsletter that chronicles the former president's legal troubles.\n\nEighty-three million, three hundred thousand dollars. When a New York jury awarded that amount to E. Jean Carroll on Friday in her defamation action against former President Donald Trump, I was awestruck.\n\nNow, as a lawyer, I had thought a fair verdict could range anywhere from $75 to $100 million-or even more. Carroll had already obtained a $5 million verdict in a trial just last year, an amount comprising roughly $2 million for his having sexually abused Carroll in 1996, and roughly $3 million for his having defamed her in 2022, after he (unwillingly) left office.\n\nThis trial, the second trial, was held to determine what damages she had suffered when he defamed her in 2019, when Carroll first told the world how Trump had assaulted her. It stood to reason that the damages for that slander would be much greater-after all, that had been the first time he'd lied about her, and, importantly, his status as president had compounded the impact of those lies. On top of all that, he continued to lie about her, over and over again, even during this second trial-displaying a maliciousness that could justify punitive damages several times higher than the amount quantifying her actual harm.\n\nSo on a professional level, I wasn't surprised. But on a personal one, I felt overwhelmed. Nine regular people in New York, picked at random, meted out justice to a man who had been president of the United States, a man who claims to have billions of dollars.\n\nThey showed that the justice system still works in America. Donald J. Trump can't do whatever he wants with impunity. He is not above the law.\n\nI'm not ashamed to say tears welled up in my eyes. I watched the television coverage silently. My phone buzzed and beeped, and instead of answering, I turned it off. I took a walk to compose myself.\n\nAs I strolled, my mind went back to a hot Monday night in New York City in July 2019, when I had attended a small dinner party at the home of my friend Molly Jong-Fast. Many interesting people were in attendance, and among them was one I had never met. She was an older woman, tall, elegant, with closely cropped hair, somewhere in her late 60s, I would have guessed. But despite never having met her, I knew who she was.\n\nShe was E. Jean Carroll. Three weeks before, New York magazine had published an excerpt of a book she had written about the bad men she had met in her life. One was Donald Trump. She said he had raped her in a department-store dressing room in 1996. Trump denied the allegation, accusing her of lying, and, with classic Trumpian mendacity, claimed never to have met her-even though the New York piece included a photograph showing them together at a Saturday Night Live after-party in the '90s. Trump added that he would never have raped her-not because he would never rape anyone but because she \"was not my type.\" A few days later, The New York Times posted a taped interview with two upstanding friends of Carroll's, to whom she had described the sexual assault almost immediately after it had happened.\n\nI had little doubt she was telling the truth. It's never easy-sometimes it's impossible-to determine precisely what happened between two people alone in a room. But as we've learned during the #MeToo era, when you have a man with a long history of facing sexual-abuse allegations and a woman who contemporaneously told her story to others, you can have a pretty high degree of confidence that the victim is telling the truth.\n\nAnd now there she was, standing before me. Carroll knew who I was, because of a recent article I had written about her , arguing for her credibility, in The Washington Post . We exchanged greetings. I praised her for her courage in speaking out. She thanked me for my article. She then told me that some people had suggested she sue Donald Trump. My response was immediate: \"You have a case.\"\n\nI argued that she had a simple, straightforward claim for defamation. She said he had raped her, lied about it, and, in doing so, lied about her-calling her a lunatic and a liar to all the world. That's defamation-period. I thought to myself, Who should represent her? And that answer, too, came to me in a flash. I told her I knew a fabulous lawyer who might consider doing it. I didn't tell her who. The conversation was over in just a couple of minutes.\n\nEarly the next morning I texted, then called, the lawyer I had in mind, Roberta \"Robbie\" Kaplan, an outstanding litigator who had become a good friend. Robbie was already famous for having won Windsor v. United States , the landmark Supreme Court case that in 2013 struck down the Defense of Marriage Act. Would you be willing to talk to Carroll? I asked her. She said yes. And so at 8:47 a.m. on Tuesday morning, July 16, 2019, I dashed off an email to Carroll and Kaplan. It contained just two sentences: \"Jean and Robbie-I'm putting you together on this email so that you can get in touch. Best regards to you both. g.\"\n\nFour and a half years later, when I saw the news of the verdict, I couldn't get these moments out of my mind. I spent 30 years as a litigator, and I had never become as emotionally invested in a litigation as I did with this one, in which my only contribution was a single short email. And that's not just because I represented mostly corporations in my practice. It was because this case, more than any I had ever seen, involved justice.\n\nFriends and journalists were messaging me. What did I think? It seemed to me that to talk about the law of defamation, punitive damages, even immediate political impact, almost diminished the meaning of the verdict. Because this case was one act in a morality play of immense significance, involving not just one man-but an entire nation. A larger drama about right and wrong. About truth and lies. About justice and injustice.\n\nAnd then there is the verdict in the bigger sense of the word-not the dollar amount but the judgment passed on the man, Donald Trump. As Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, the presiding judge in the trials, said in open court, Trump is somebody who \" just can't control\" himself . And as I have previously written , he can't control himself because he's a deeply disturbed human being. He's a man who has shown no sign of a conscience, indicated no empathy, given no expression of remorse.\n\nThose of us who have watched him closely for many years know this. But many Americans don't. They go about their busy lives, and they get little dribs and drabs about politics in a variety of different ways. They see politics as messy-which it certainly is-and find sorting out lies from truth difficult. This has always given Trump an advantage. Some in the media have inadvertently normalized him-not because they think he's normal, but because they instinctively try to describe events and people in familiar terms. And since January 20, 2021, he's had yet another advantage: People haven't seen as much of him as they once did.\n\nBut the jurors-in both this trial and the earlier one-got to see Donald Trump, up close and personally. Through their own eyes, throughout these trials, they got to see how Trump had nothing but contempt for the woman who accused him of rape, and whom he had defamed so many times. They saw, from just a few feet away, how he had nothing but scorn for the court, the judge, the law-and, by extension, the jury and each and every one of us. They saw that Donald Trump is a man who must be held to account if simple decency and justice are to be upheld.\n\nThe verdict tells us a lot about the nation as well. We live in an age when political tribalism, for so many, has overcome their understanding of right and wrong, of fact and fantasy, and of reason and unreason. Too many Americans support Trump, not because he deserves their support, but because they want to support him, because they consider themselves members of one team against another, or because they've done so in the past and don't want to admit error.\n\nAnd so they pretend that he is not who he is. A lot of these people don't know any better, because they've walled themselves off from reality, changing the channel whenever they begin to hear things they don't want to hear.\n\nBut in the upper reaches of our nation's political system, many of his supporters and enablers do know better. They know who Trump is. They talk about who he is behind closed doors. Recall, for example, that, as reported by Peter Baker and Susan Glasser , one of Trump's chiefs of staff purchased and relied upon a remarkable book, a compendium of essays from psychiatrists, psychologists, and other mental-health professionals describing Trump's warped psyche and explaining its danger to the nation. Many others have now come forward to acknowledge his moral and psychological deficiencies; even Jenna Ellis, the disgraced lawyer who once devoted herself to Trump, has now publicly described him as a \"malignant narcissist.\"\n\nBut too many elites still won't tell the truth. When somebody asks them to go on the record about it, they still say things like \"no comment,\" or \"I didn't see the tweet,\" or \"I haven't followed the case\"-or change the subject to something else. And they're all lying and dissembling-to protect the worst liar of all. But it's long past time for these people to admit what can't be denied: that they've been covering up for a pathological liar, a sexual predator, a man who would put himself over everyone and everything else, including the nation and its Constitution and laws. That he is a man who does not deserve to hold any office of public trust, let alone the highest office in the land.\n\nSome things rise above politics. The challenge posed by Donald Trump is about right and wrong. Everyone needs to look at it that way. And that's just what the jury did.\n\nWhen you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission. Thank you for supporting The Atlantic ."

      "text": "The Defiant Humanity of E. Jean Carroll\n\nShe never tried to be a perfect victim. Her jury believed her anyway.\n\nFor a moment, it read like a loss. The first question asked on the verdict form in the matter of E. Jean Carroll v. Donald J. Trump concerned the writer's battery allegation against the former president. Had she proved that Trump had raped her? \"NO,\" came the answer. But the form continued: Had Carroll proved that Trump had sexually abused her? YES. Had she proved that she had been injured as a result of his conduct? YES. The affirmatives accumulated: yes to defamation, to wanton disregard, to false statements, to actual malice.\n\nThe outcome was historic, my colleague David A. Graham wrote yesterday. And it was, despite that initial \"NO,\" a resounding victory for Carroll-and, symbolically, for the many other women who have accused Trump of sexual abuse. (Trump has denied all of their allegations-and has vowed to appeal yesterday's ruling.) Carroll v. Trump was remarkable not only because it managed to hold the former president accountable, but also because of the way it achieved that victory. Carroll and her team rejected a one-size-fits-all approach to victimhood. They refused to apologize for Carroll's idiosyncrasy or to allow her story to be reduced to callous tropes. In the process, they made a claim that is both obvious and revolutionary: There is no right way to be assaulted.\n\nRead: The astonishing E. Jean Carroll verdict\n\nThe initial whiplash of the verdict made for an apt conclusion: Very little about the trial had been typical. It was a civil proceeding whose claims included both battery and defamation. The former claim was possible because of a recent addition to the New York State legal code: the Adult Survivors Act , which provides a year-long window for adult victims of sexual assault to file civil claims despite expired statutes of limitation.\n\nThe most significantly atypical aspect of the proceeding, though, was Carroll herself. Sexual-assault trials involve compound cruelties: Claimants are made to rehash their pain in public, turning their allegations into a performance. Idiosyncrasy, in that context-being forgetful, say, or tearful, or angry, or uncertain-can hurt their case. It can suggest inconsistency. It might give a jury a reason to doubt the events being alleged, and to dismiss the story being told as the work of an unreliable narrator.\n\nThe assumptions fail to account for the fact that people's reactions to trauma are as variable and unpredictable as people themselves tend to be. And Carroll refused to cede to that ignorant script. On the stand, she was candid about what she could not recall when it came to some details of the attack. She was thoughtful about the shame she'd felt in its aftermath. She acknowledged that one of the reasons she'd accompanied Trump into the dressing room was her belief that the whole thing-she'd get him to try on lingerie, she thought-would make a great story. She talked about getting pushed against the wall, and laughing in response. She talked about rape as an ongoing violation: a momentary act of violence that settled into her romantic life, her professional life, her reputation. She treated her own uniqueness as a crucial element of her credibility.\n\nRead: 'I moved on her very heavily': The E. Jean Carroll interviews\n\nTrump, given ample opportunity to appear at the trial, declined to do so. Instead, his presence was limited to remarks he'd made during a deposition . In those comments, and in the social-media messages he posted while the trial was taking place, Trump tried to do what he always does when people challenge him: treat those who oppose him as hoaxes incarnate-as ideas, essentially, malleable and monstrous. The reflex can be an effective political strategy, but it is a poor legal one. Carroll countered every effort to dehumanize her with eloquent, insistent humanity.\n\nThroughout the trial, Trump's primary lawyer, Joe Tacopina, turned disdain into performance art. He invoked misleading tropes-the perfect victim, the woman who should know better-and built his case around Carroll's lack of conformity to them. Why didn't she call the police after the attack? Why didn't she come forward publicly? Why didn't she scream? Questioning Carroll, Tacopina sneered at her. He disrespected her. He made her cry. He tried to use her individuality against her.\n\nRead: The most telling moments from the E. Jean Carroll-Donald Trump depositions\n\nIt didn't work. Carroll, just as she claims to have done in that dressing room, fought back. At every step, she emphasized-politely, patiently, unwaveringly-the foolishness of Tacopina's line of questioning. She didn't call the police because she didn't call the police. She didn't scream because \"I'm not a screamer,\" she said. The behavior at issue, she and her team kept reminding the jury, was not hers. It was Trump's. \"He raped me,\" Carroll said, \"whether I screamed or not.\"\n\nCarroll has called herself a member of the \"silent generation\"-a woman who grew up being told that other people's abusive behavior is her shame to endure. Her case, all these years in the making, rejected both the silence and the shame. She and the other people who spoke during the trial-her lawyers, her friends, her fellow Trump accusers-told a story that was messy and complicated and intimate and very, very human. And the members of the jury believed it. They believed Carroll, as its narrator. Their belief was unanimous. The woman who refused to act as a perfect victim did not win a perfect verdict. The NO on the rape charge remains. But the verdict, as a whole, is the opposite of silent: big, loud, definitive. Carroll, in her suit, did not specify dollar amounts for the various damages she claimed. It was the members of the jury who were given the task of putting a price on her pain. They chose $5 million. The amount brought a stark resolution to a case that had put so much of its faith in nuance: He assaulted her, the jury decided. And he should pay the price."

      "text": "The Astonishing E. Jean Carroll Verdict\n\nDonald Trump has been found liable by a jury for an act of sexual violence perpetrated nearly 30 years ago.\n\nUpdated on May 9 at 4:46 p.m. ET\n\nThe perpetual circus and endless scandals that attend Donald Trump, whether in his personal life, business, or politics can obscure the utter strangeness of the circumstances of any one case. So pause to consider what happened today in a Manhattan courtroom: A jury, after fewer than three hours of deliberation, concluded that the former president had sexually abused and defamed the writer E. Jean Carroll , though jurors also concluded that her accusation of rape wasn't proven. The jury awarded Carroll about $5 million in damages.\n\nThat result is astonishing. This is a former president of America, being found liable by a jury-of his peers-for defamation resulting from an act of sexual violence perpetrated nearly 30 years ago. The verdict is a sign of two competing truths about American society today: The country has become more willing to hold powerful men to account for their behavior and yet, at the same time, is still willing to give them power, again and again.\n\n\"Make no mistake, this entire bogus case is a political endeavor targeting President Trump because he is now an overwhelming front-runner to be once again elected President of the United States,\" his campaign said in a statement. \"President Trump will never stop fighting for the American people, no matter what the radical Democrats dream up next. This case will be appealed, and we will ultimately win.\"\n\nMegan Garber: The most telling moments from the E. Jean Carroll-Donald Trump depositions\n\nThe shock of the verdict is not because the allegation was particularly difficult to believe. On one side was Carroll, whose account of the incident was clear, consistent, and nauseating in its specificity. Carroll sued Trump for defamation after he brushed off the allegation by saying, \" She's not my type .\"\n\nOn the other side was Trump. The former president faced a challenge in defending himself in the case. Much of Carroll's account matched a modus operandi that at least 26 women who accused Trump of sexual assault have described. Carroll interviewed five of them for a series in The Atlantic in 2020. (Trump denies the allegations.) Trump himself described his approach in the infamous leaked recording from Access Hollywood in which he boasted about sexually assaulting women. \"You know, I'm automatically attracted to beautiful-I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything,\" he said. \"Grab 'em by the pussy. You can do anything.\"\n\n'I Moved On Her Very Heavily': The E. Jean Carroll interviews\n\nTrump also didn't bother to show up for the trial, claiming that he wanted to spare New Yorkers the traffic jams his presence would cause. Last week, while in Ireland, he said he would fly home to appear in court but, surprising no one, he didn't. Trump's absence might have reflected a recognition from the outset that he was likely to lose, and a desire to distance himself from the case. And although it's impossible to determine how much his decision was a factor in the trial's outcome, by failing to show up, he sent a message to the jury that he wasn't invested in defending himself. His lawyers reinforced the message by declining to call any witnesses and instead trying to pick apart Carroll's case during cross-examination. (What kind of witness would Trump have called anyway? Finding an alibi witness for a moment 27 years ago would be tough, and who would be a convincing character witness?)\n\nCarroll's lawyers made Trump a presence in the courtroom anyway, playing excerpts from a deposition for the case to devastating effect. In one instance, going straight at Trump's \"not my type\" defense, Carroll's lawyer showed him a photograph of Carroll. Asked to identify her, he mistook Carroll for his ex-wife Marla Maples, whom Trump had to admit was his type.\n\nMore appalling was his discussion of the Access Hollywood tape. Trump, both in the past and in the deposition, wrote that off as \"locker room\" talk. But he couldn't bring himself to repudiate or even distance himself from the comments, even now, nearly two decades later.\n\nDavid A. Graham: A guide to the potential indictments of Donald Trump\n\n\"Well, historically, that's true with stars,\" he said.\n\n\"True with stars that they can grab women by the pussy?\" Carroll's attorney Roberta Kaplan asked.\n\n\"Well, that's what-if you look over the last million years, I guess that's been largely true,\" Trump said. \"Not always, but largely true. Unfortunately or fortunately.\"\n\nUnfortunately or fortunately.\n\nMegan Garber: The real meaning of Trump's 'She's not my type' defense\n\n\"And you consider yourself to be a star?\" Kaplan prodded.\n\n\"I think you can say that, yeah,\" Trump replied smugly.\n\nIn citing the last million years as precedent, he seemed to believe he was still living in them. Trump is not the first man to be both president and a sexual assaulter, but he is the first to have a jury find so. The verdict against him shows that in at least one case, with one high-profile and unrepentant defendant, the old world in which powerful men could do anything they wanted to women has passed away. Things have changed a little in the past 1 million years-or at least in the past 30."

Jean Carroll.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nA jury in New York today put a price on Donald Trump's inability to keep his mouth shut, awarding the writer E. Jean Carroll $83.3 million in damages in a defamation lawsuit.\n\nIt's the second time a jury has ordered Trump to pay Carroll. She alleged in 2019 that Trump raped her in a department-store dressing room in the 1990s. When Trump denied it, Carroll sued him for defamation and battery. Last May, a jury found Trump liable for assaulting her and awarded her $5 million. But Trump responded by continuing to verbally attack Carroll, so she sued again.\n\nAlthough Trump's fortune is enormous, usually estimated in the billions, he is likely to feel the cost of today's verdict. First, he is a notorious skinflint-he once cashed a 16-cent check sent to him as a prank by Spy magazine-so any cost, especially one denominated in eight figures, will pain him. Second, much of his net worth is tied up in illiquid assets such as real estate or intangible ones such as brand value. The former president sometimes acts like he has limited cash flow, so coming up with $83 million ( if that amount is sustained ) might not be simple. Trump has already said he'll appeal.The first $5 million judgment is being held in escrow while Trump appeals that, too.\n\nDavid A. Graham: The cases against Donald Trump-a guide\n\nThe second defamation case was entirely an own goal by Trump. Having lost the first case, all he really had to do was stop publicly assailing Carroll. He didn't have to admit that he was wrong. He didn't have to admit that he had sexually assaulted Carroll. He didn't even have to admit that he had defamed her. He just had to stay quiet.\n\nBut this being Trump, he couldn't do it. Even as the trial proceeded, and all signs suggested that Trump was in for a rough verdict, he kept at it. He attacked Carroll with dozens of missives on his social-media site . While campaigning in Iowa this month, he said she'd made up her story . He behaved no differently in court. Yesterday, he testified for less than five minutes but still managed to call the accusation false, earning a rebuke from Judge Lewis Kaplan, who said Trump could not re-litigate the first defamation trial.\n\nDavid A. Graham: The astonishing E. Jean Carroll verdict\n\nThe latest verdict will indicate whether there's any amount of financial cost that can keep Trump quiet. If he keeps going, all signs would point to another case from Carroll, presumably with similar (or larger) results. In a way, the question raised here is the same as the one raised by the several other cases against Trump. Is there any sanction so dire that it can keep Trump from lying?\n\nA civil case in New York could cost him his ability to do business in the state and some of his marquee buildings. The criminal cases against him in Washington, D.C.; Fulton County, Georgia; and Florida could even cost him his freedom.\n\nSo far, Trump can't stop saying things that get him into trouble and then deepen it. He is unable to stay out of the public eye, because he is running for president. And once he's there, he appears psychologically unable to stop making the same bogus claims. Never before has it cost him so dearly."

      "text": "An Ominous Warning to the E. Jean Carroll Jury\n\nA Manhattan judge's advice to jurors accurately reflects what the former president has done to democratic norms.\n\nAfter many trials, the judge will dismiss the jurors by thanking them for their time and public service. These words of gratitude are usually a formality, a polite nod to a key feature of our democratic process: defendants' right, under the Seventh Amendment , to judgment by their peers in \"Suits at common law.\" Federal Judge Lewis A. Kaplan also offered a piece of practical advice to the Manhattan civil jury that had just found former President Donald Trump liable for sexually abusing E. Jean Carroll in a luxury department store's dressing room in 1996: Kaplan told the jurors that they might not want to publicly identify themselves-\"not now and not for a long time.\" Those words were jarring and yet seemed wise in light of Trump's habit of directing violence, threats, and general mayhem against the peaceful functioning of our democratic norms.\n\nThe judge's advice sounded less like a legal requirement than like the words of a parent to an older teenager, imparted without any ability to enforce. Kaplan apparently did not give a specific reason for his statement. But he didn't need to. Everyone knows how things can unfold for people who challenge Trump, and jurors who find against him in court are highly vulnerable to whatever he might do.\n\nTrump's political legacy is often measured by his policy impact: restrictions on immigration , lower taxes for the rich , conservative Supreme Court justices who deliver on a stridently right-wing agenda . Those changes are significant, but are also largely answerable through the same political process, voting, that made Trump only a one-term president. Trump's real, enduring legacy is his successful introduction of violence, the threat of violence, and targeted harassment into the dynamics of our political system, as if they were all just a natural extension of democratic disagreement.\n\nDavid A. Graham: The astonishing E. Jean Carroll verdict\n\nThe January 6 insurrection is the most obvious example. Regardless of whether he directed the exact violence on Capitol Hill that day-which delayed, and came dangerously close to denying, the certification of Joe Biden's election as president-Trump welcomed it. For weeks before, he encouraged a legal strategy of fake electors and promoted false allegations of voter fraud. His plans to remain in office could best be executed if Congress were hindered in performing its constitutional duty. Violence was part of the scheme, because it could buy Trump time to interrupt the proceedings, sow confusion, and perhaps intimidate his noncompliant vice president, Mike Pence , into fleeing the Capitol.\n\nBut the specter of violence was hardly new. From a presidential-campaign announcement that portrayed the U.S. as a victim of Mexican aggression, to a dark inauguration speech that described \"American carnage,\" to his use of social media to direct outrage toward elected officials and reporters who dared to get in his way, Trump understood how to whip some of his followers into a frenzy. Trump may seem irrational at times, but he is also a sophisticated student of incitement. His verbal technique promotes violence while allowing him plausible deniability. \"Be there, will be wild!\" he said on Twitter in the run-up to the January 6 riot. His language is intended to make its targets- including not only elected officials and judges but often just civil servants or average citizens -feel uncomfortable, defensive, vulnerable.\n\nConcerns for jurors' safety are commonplace in criminal trials involving mob figures. Kaplan was presiding over a civil trial. Yet even before the verdict, Trump was using his media platform, Truth Social, to attack the proceedings as a witch hunt. \"The greatest witch hunt of all time,\" he declared after the verdict . Hunt is an evocative term; it suggests that you are either predator or prey. Without overtly saying so, the judge was telling the jurors in the civil case: Don't be prey. To allow yourself to be identified might gain you 15 minutes of fame, but the downside could be a whole lot worse. (Ironically, Kaplan was speaking in easily deciphered code, much as Trump does.)\n\nE. Jean Carroll: \"I moved on her very heavily\"\n\nKaplan surely knows that the Manhattan judge who will oversee a criminal trial against Trump has faced threats . Trump has already promised to appeal Carroll's victory, so perhaps Kaplan was speaking obliquely to avoid some future challenge to his objectivity. But Kaplan wasn't being paranoid; he was acting pragmatically and cautiously, and he asked the same of the jurors.\n\n\"If you're one who elects to speak to others and to identify yourselves to others, I direct you not to identify anyone else who sat on this jury,\" Kaplan said from the bench. \"Each of you owes that to the other, whatever you decided for yourself.\" The jurors have one more public duty: They have a continuing responsibility to protect others and, by extension, the sanctity of a jury trial protected by our Constitution. Because that, like many other processes that enshrine our democracy, is under threat."

      "text": "The Most Telling Moments From the E. Jean Carroll-Donald Trump Depositions\n\nThe writer and the former president have discussed the allegations at stake in revealingly different ways.\n\nDonald Trump, who is accused of rape, will likely not appear in court to defend himself against the charge. The former president declined the chance to appear at the trial that begins today, he explained through his lawyer, because of the \"logistical burdens\" his presence would place on the courthouse and on New York City, where the civil proceeding is taking place. It seems he does not want to be an inconvenience.\n\nBut Trump will be an unavoidable presence as the trial unfolds. The writer E. Jean Carroll is suing him for damages related to the allegation she made in 2019, which he has vehemently denied: that Trump, encountering her in a New York City department store in the 1990s, led her into a dressing room and raped her. At issue in the trial are defamation and battery-the latter claim made possible by a New York State law that provides a one-year window for adult victims of sexual assault to file civil claims after the criminal statute of limitations has expired. Carroll is also suing Trump in a separate defamation case, based on the disparaging comments he made in response to her accusation; the path of that case may depend in part on the outcome of the current trial. Jury selection will begin today, with arguments expected throughout the week.\n\nRead: The cruel paradox at the heart of E. Jean Carroll's allegation against Trump\n\nTrump has tried to dismiss Carroll's claims in both the narrow sense-his lawyers tried and failed to get both cases dismissed-and the broad. You could read the empty excuse Trump offered for his non-appearance at the trial in a similar vein: as an extension of efforts he has made to minimize Carroll's accusation, undermine her credibility, and paint her story as a hoax. Trump has made those attempts not merely in public statements but also in sworn testimony. In January, Lewis Kaplan, the federal judge hearing both of Carroll's cases, ordered a partial unsealing of depositions that both Carroll and Trump had given in October 2022 for the defamation suit. The portions of the transcripts made available detail the contested events of that day as well as their public aftermath. In them, Trump repeats his familiar insults. But he also acknowledges, seemingly in spite of himself, the gravity of Carroll's claim. \"She's accusing me of rape-of raping her, the worst thing you can do, the worst charge,\" Trump says. In testimony that found the former president ranting, rambling, and generally resisting the word rape itself, this was a rare moment of clarity.\n\nCarroll had also been hesitant to use the word rape , she has made clear : The word had felt too loaded, too stark, to describe what she says happened in that dressing room. She does not use the term in the book excerpt , published in 2019 in New York magazine, in which she first made her claim public. Per her account, the interaction began when she encountered Trump at Bergdorf Goodman. He told her that he wanted to buy clothes for someone else as a gift, she alleges, and asked her to try on his selection. As she writes in her excerpt:\n\nThe moment the dressing-room door is closed, he lunges at me, pushes me against the wall, hitting my head quite badly, and puts his mouth against my lips. ... He seizes both my arms and pushes me up against the wall a second time, and, as I become aware of how large he is, he holds me against the wall with his shoulder and jams his hand under my coat dress and pulls down my tights.\n\nShe struggled against him, she alleges, as he raped her.\n\nI am wearing a pair of sturdy black patent-leather four-inch Barneys high heels, which puts my height around six-one, and I try to stomp his foot. I try to push him off with my one free hand-for some reason, I keep holding my purse with the other-and I finally get a knee up high enough to push him out and off and I turn, open the door, and run out of the dressing room.\n\nNot until Carroll told a friend about the alleged assault, she says in the deposition, did she find the language for it. \"Lisa shocked me in the call,\" Carroll says. \"She told me I had been raped.\"\n\n\"Had it occurred to you?\" Trump's lawyer Alina Habba asks.\n\n\"No,\" Carroll replies.\n\nRead: The real meaning of Trump's 'she's not my type' defense\n\nElsewhere in her deposition, Carroll explains her initial hesitance to go public with her claims. \"Did you ever consider coming forward with your account prior to #MeToo?\" Habba asks.\n\n\"Never,\" Carroll replies.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Just-I'm going to say something that even surprises me-because women who have been raped are looked at in this society as less, are looked at as spoiled goods, are looked at as rather dumb to let themselves get attacked. I mean, even you have to say, 'Did you scream?' I mean, every woman who admits to being attacked has to answer that question-'Why didn't you scream, why did you come forward when you did, why didn't you come forward before?' And so, no, I didn't-I would have been fired.\"\n\nCarroll, throughout the deposition, acknowledges the cultural reality of rape: the suspicion placed on those who say it has happened to them, the impulse to blame them, the stigma that follows. Trump, by contrast, repeatedly describes her allegation as a mere political tactic-one more effort, waged by unnamed enemies, to take him down. He repeatedly attacks Carroll: In his testimony, he treats her mental fitness (\"sick,\" \"really sick,\" \"sick, mentally\") as a refrain. He dismisses Carroll's lawyer, Robbie Kaplan, as a political operative, and threatens to sue her. He threatens to sue Carroll as well (\"I'll be suing her very strongly\"). He writes off Judge Kaplan (no relation to Carroll's lawyer) as \"not a fan of mine.\" He returns to his favored role-the cable-TV critic-to analyze an appearance Carroll made on CNN, and thoroughly misrepresents the claims she made during the segment. At one point, he gets in a dig at Joe Biden. At another, via his dismissal of this publication's report about Trump's disparagement of Americans who died in war-\"hoax,\" \"total hoax,\" \"failed magazine\"-he gets in a dig at The Atlantic .\n\nRead: Trump: Americans who died in war are 'losers' and 'suckers'\n\nIt's all extremely familiar: Distract, deflect, \" flood the zone with shit .\" The strategy has proved effective for him in the past, both when it comes to Carroll's claims and when it comes to those of the other women- more than 20 -who have accused him of sexual misconduct. (Trump has denied all of their claims.) It is the same tactic that Trump reportedly demanded of Brett Kavanaugh when the then-Supreme Court nominee was credibly accused of assault: Perform rage. Sell it. Make the indignation so incandescent that the heat of it consumes everything else.\n\nBut the pared-down scope of the trial will likely limit Trump's ability to put his typical antics to use. The case will rest on a binary question: Did he rape Carroll, or didn't he? The question is big and consequential. That helps explain why Trump has seemed to resist talking about it in straightforward terms. Robbie Kaplan, in the deposition, asks him about public statements he made about Carroll from 2019 to 2022. Carroll's claim, Trump wrote in one of them, is that he \"swooned her\" in the dressing room.\n\n\"What does 'swooned her' mean?\" Kaplan asks.\n\n\"That would be a word,\" Trump replies, \"maybe accurate or not, having to do with talking to her and talking [ sic ] her-to do an act that she said happened, which didn't happen. And it's a nicer word than the word that starts with an F , and this would be a word that I used because I thought it would be inappropriate to use the other word.\"\n\nKaplan looked up swoon in the dictionary, she notes. Did Trump intend it to mean \"to faint with extreme emotion\"?\n\n\"Well, sort of that's what ... she said I did to her,\" Trump replies. \"She fainted with great emotion.\"\n\nThat is manifestly not what Carroll says happened. But Trump's evasion also acknowledges, in its way, the immensity of the assertions she has made. Swoon is simply not a word most people use-unless, that is, they are trying to avoid using another one.\n\nCarroll's defamation case against Trump preceded the current one: In denying her allegations so disparagingly and so personally, Carroll argued, the former president has harmed her reputation. That claim will hover over the trial as it moves forward this week. The proceeding itself, for that reason and others, will likely be particularly complicated, as lawyers struggle to find unbiased jury members and debate which evidence is admissible and which is beyond the trial's scope. Still, the stakes of it all are painfully clear. The trial will make Carroll one of the few Trump accusers to have her day in court. And it will decide whether the man who has earned so many epithets over the years is deserving of one more: rapist."

      "text": "Two Women, Two Breasts, Two Decisions\n\n'I Moved on Her Very Heavily': Part 2\n\nIn her 2019 memoir, What Do We Need Men For? , E. Jean Carroll accused Donald Trump of rape, in a Bergdorf's dressing room in the mid-1990s. After the president denied ever meeting her and dismissed her story as a Democratic plot, she sued him for defamation. Carroll was not, of course, the first woman to say that Trump had sexually harassed or assaulted her, but unlike so many other powerful men, the president has remained unscathed by the #MeToo reckoning. Which might seem surprising, until you remember Trump's modus operandi: He escapes the consequences of one outrage by turning our focus to another, in perpetuity. So in the run-up to the November 3 election, Carroll is interviewing other women who alleged that Trump suddenly and without consent \"moved on\" them, to cite his locution in the Access Hollywood tape. \"I'm automatically attracted to beautiful-I just start kissing them, it's like a magnet ... And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab 'em by the pussy.\" Carroll's lawsuit remains in progress; a White House spokesman denied all of the women's allegations, calling them \"decades-old false statements\" that had been \"thoroughly litigated in the last election and rejected by the American people.\" Read Part 1 and Part 3 here.\n\nFifty or so miles out of New York City, in a hamlet so rich, it makes Mar-a-Lago's Palm Beach look like a John Mellencamp video, there lives a beautiful woman by the name of Karena Virginia. Today is a brilliant Monday. The sun pours down like Fort Knox gold. Karena has conducted an angel sanctuary over the weekend-connecting her friends (she calls clients \"friends\") with the supernatural beings she believes are as real as each of us-and later today she is teaching friends to breathe in tune with the ocean waves for \"Yoga on the Beach.\"\n\nWhen I pull up in my car, Karena is standing in the road. To welcome me, she raises the brim of her enormous beach hat and holds a pose on one foot, lifting her arms to the gods like a forest sprite. If William Blake-the poet and artist who conversed with angels in the nude-could see Karena in her turquoise sarong and turquoise bikini bottom with the circle clasp on the hip, her long, golden-brown hair streaming down her back, he would paint her with wings.\n\nDonald Trump once spots Karena at the U.S. Open tennis tournament as she waits for a car, but he doesn't paint her. It is 1998, and she recalls that he says to his male pals, \"Hey, look at this one. We haven't seen her before.\"\n\n\"I am wearing a short, black, sleeveless A-line dress,\" continues Karena, who can also tell me the exact skirt, sweater, and shoes she is wearing when she meets her husband a year later. \"I call my friend immediately after I get in the car and tell her what happened and ask if she thinks it is because my dress is too short. I remember thinking my protective Italian father would have been appalled at my outfit, because Trump, as he is walking toward me with his entourage, says: 'Look at those legs.' It's my fault that I allow him to grab my arm without my pulling away. And then he goes further\"-she demonstrates, quickly sliding her knuckles back and forth on the right side of her bust-\"and he grabs my breast.\"\n\nNow let us leave Karena and visit a handsome apartment on the Upper West Side. It is 21 years later, June 2019. A lawyer sits in an armchair suckling a newborn. The child is about the size of a basset hound-he weighed nearly 10 pounds at birth-and the lawyer, a peach-complexioned looker (yes, reader, another pretty woman, but we are dealing with a man who, you'll recall, denies that he attacks women by claiming they're not \"his type\"), glances up from the giant baby. \"This is off the record,\" she announces to her companions, several women who are being interviewed about sexual assault.\n\nThe lawyer is not taking part in the discussion, but her story is so on point that she couldn't help but chime in. The journalist is The New York Times ' Megan Twohey, who in 2016 reported some of the earliest sexual-misconduct allegations against Trump and who, along with Jodi Kantor and Ronan Farrow, won the Pulitzer Prize for breaking the Harvey Weinstein story.\n\n\"Of course,\" Twohey says, off the record.\n\nAnd the lawyer says: \"Trump grabbed my boob.\"\n\nSo this is a few words about Trump and a few more words about breasts. One of the breasts belongs to a woman who, three weeks before the 2016 election, comes forward and warns the world not to vote for a man who gropes women. The other belongs to a woman who has stayed quiet. Which woman is happier with her decision? Is it the yoga teacher/angel connector, or the attorney? We must go back and forth in time to find out.\n\nI meet Karena in 1994, when we both work for Roger Ailes at his NBC cable network, America's Talking. (It later becomes MSNBC, and Roger goes on to create Fox News.) I am the host of the live, one-hour Ask E. Jean show. Karena, a theater major straight out of Ithaca College, is starring in one of Roger's experiments called Cable Crossings , a 30-second soap opera airing \"in the cracks\" between the talk shows.\n\nI tell you with a straight face that Karena is not a normal human. For instance, Karena finds most things on Earth pleasant. She has seen angels since she was a little girl. One of her yoga workshops, for women who are trying to get pregnant, is called \"Mommies and Miracles.\" She believes \"energy is everything.\" She texts with Oprah (with whom she collaborated on a seven-part 2015 documentary about spirituality across the globe called Belief ). I suspect that Karena's spleen has wings raised for flight, and, yes, she has been told by dullards that she needs to \"get a grip.\"\n\nSo in the countdown to the 2016 election, when America is caught in the Groundhog Day time loop of women coming forward to tell of Trump-the truffle pig-rooting around their bodies, Karena is in the family room on the chaise lounge (\"One day I want to toss that thing! It brings back PTSD\"), watching the 6:30 news and admiring the courage on display. At the same time she is thinking, I could never tell my story. I could never do it , and feeling deeply ashamed.\n\nThen one day a woman-Karena can't remember who-comes on TV and calls Trump's accusers liars . Karena's very corpuscles tighten. She starts shaking. She cannot understand why women don't believe other women. Karena says to herself: \"I teach women to be empowered through yoga. I tell women they are goddesses of the divine, and here I can't even talk about the truth?\"\n\nThe next night she confesses her shame to a perfect stranger at a party in the Rainbow Room for the New York screening of La La Land . The stranger tells her, \"You must stand with these women!\" After teaching her morning yoga class the next day, Karena calls an attorney recommended by a friend. The attorney is Gloria Allred. \"I had no clue who she was,\" Karena says. Twenty hours later, she is sitting behind a phalanx of mics in a hotel conference room and reading her eight-minute, 39-second statement to the world press.\n\nYou remember it. She is as firm as Kamala Harris and chokes up like Bette Davis in Now, Voyager . Joan of Arc at the stake could not have been more dramatic.\n\nIt is a disaster. \"The fallout from the press conference,\" Karena says, \"is a million times-a million times-worse than being groped by the president.\"\n\nThe scene now shifts to Santa Monica in 2006. The lawyer with the peach complexion is booming her new BMW-a law-school graduation present from her mother-up the circular drive of a Santa Monica Beach hotel, when who should emerge through the front door?\n\nOh my God, Donald Trump , thinks the lawyer, who agrees to tell her story as long as she isn't named. Fine, whatever-like, he's old. It is about five months after Trump pushed Natasha Stoynoff up against a Mar-a-Lago wall and shoved his tongue down her throat, according to Stoynoff. The sun is about to set. Trump lasers his eyes through the lawyer's windshield.\n\nShe pulls up to the valet-parking stand. She alights from the car, smooths her black sheath (her new lawyer dress!), and, as her three friends tumble out of the vehicle in a merry burst, ready to celebrate their last day at law school-excited to be alive, thrilled to be dressed up and arriving in such a hot ride-and as the valet is saying, \"I'm sorry, the hotel bar is closed for a private event,\" Trump appears next to her.\n\n\"He comes in from the side,\" says the lawyer, who is Zooming with me. The giant baby is now a year old and is nearly the size of a race-horse jockey-\"and he comes around and puts his meaty arm around me and his hand goes ...\"\n\nThe lawyer places her own hand on the top part of her breast. \"And so I am immediately uncomfortable,\" she says, \"and he is like, 'Hey, you want to get into the bar? I can get you in. Just you. Not your friends.' And at this point, he is just rubbing my breast.\"\n\nI am sorry, reader, I must ask: \"The entire breast?\"\n\n\"The top of the breast, the nipple. He just, like ...\" She kneads her breast like it's a ball of pie dough.\n\n\"And I had this whole-body visceral reaction,\" she says. \"I was like, I have to get out of here right now . I didn't say a word. I turned around. I still had my keys. I got in the car and I was like, 'Get in, everyone. We're going.' They hadn't seen it happen. They were facing toward the hotel. We did not talk about it. We fell out of touch pretty quickly after passing the bar. I was in shock.\" (The White House called the allegations \"an anonymously sourced smear.\")\n\nWhen I try to determine the timelines of Melania Trump giving birth in Manhattan and her husband feeling up a young law-school grad at a Santa Monica hotel, the lawyer emits a bitter, sarcastic chuckle. \"I don't think Melania being perfect or giving birth would stop Trump,\" she says. \"I don't think anything would stop him. He probably did the same thing to 10 different women that night . That's the thing. I was not special . \"\n\nThough Karena is as ethereal as Thoreau's wood nymph, the paradox is that the life she has created for herself with her lawyer husband and two children is chock-full of good cheer and success because she is also tough-minded and confident as a businessperson. In 2001, when her \"kids are babies,\" she starts teaching prenatal yoga, then yoga with moms and babies, then yoga for women who want babies. How good is she? Gloria Allred gets a message after the press conference from one of Karena's former clients-excuse me, friends- to pass the following news on to Karena: \"I was in your 'Mommies and Miracles' workshop, and I am now a mother!\"\n\nBefore we start talking about the hideous aftermath of her press conference, as a sort of warm-up, I ask Karena: \"What do you wish you would've done when Trump knuckled your breast?\"\n\nI ask because I know that I'm not the only Trump accuser to imagine punching him repeatedly between mandible and eye socket.\n\nKarena pauses a moment to ponder. We are sitting outside her friend's house in two of the most comfortable deck chairs ever built by human hands, on an emerald lawn, by a blue pool, near a willow so weeping that it is practically moaning, and we are overlooking-get this-a canal down which float rich people on pontoons, kayaks, and canoes.\n\nKarena turns to me with her answer.\n\nI lean in, hoping she is about to describe a groin kick that sends Trump rolling over and over across the DecoTurf of Arthur Ashe Stadium until he is picked up by the ball girls, stuffed in a bag, and carried away.\n\nShe says: \"I would look Trump in the eyes and ask, 'What kind of man are you?'\"\n\nYogis! Bah.\n\n\"Did you think about coming forward before the 2016 election?\" I ask the lawyer.\n\n\"I thought about it a bunch,\" she says. \"But in the scheme of things, it wasn't a rape. It was a forcible touch. I wondered: Is it worth associating my name with that ?\"\n\n\"Forever,\" I say.\n\n\"Forever. And as a woman, if you ever come forward with any allegation, it's like you're tainted . They pick apart your work. They pick apart your appearance.\" (Indeed. Tributes to my devastating beauty have been offered daily since I accused Trump of raping me. This tweet, from @blumrln75-a.k.a. \"God Fearing American, Florida saltwater cowboy\"-is one of my favorites: \"He [Trump] wouldn't do you with Joe Biden's wiener!\")\n\n\"So are you glad you didn't come forward in 2016?\" I ask the lawyer.\n\n\"I was worried about my career. It's already been hard enough to get where I am as a woman . \"\n\n\"Do you want to come forward-now-on the record?\"\n\nThe lawyer graduated with distinction from a prestigious midwestern university before she went to law school in Los Angeles; she is now married to a writer. In 2019, she joined a new law firm, when the couple moved from New York to California.\n\n\"That's the thing,\" says the lawyer, trying to frown, but a grin zings across her face. \"I'm up for partner!\"\n\nFor Karena, the consequences of speaking up are swift and severe. \"Did you think you were going to get killed?\" I ask her.\n\n\"Oh, yeah,\" she says.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because people were telling me that they were going to kill me. I was getting death threats.\"\n\nAfter the press conference, four close friends take up arms and quickly begin deleting the hundreds of hate messages on Karena's YouTube channel, her Instagram and Facebook accounts, and her yoga video on Amazon. \"I couldn't look at any messages from anybody,\" she says. \"Even the good ones. I just needed to hide. I started to feel like my skin was burning. No way of explaining it, unless you're in it. It was as if there were millions of little needles in my skin.\"\n\n\"You walk down your driveway,\" I say, \"and open your mailbox-?\" This is the driveway that leads to the house that is nestled in one of the boskiest Republican enclaves on the Eastern Seaboard.\n\n\"I got clippings cut out of the newspaper with daggers drawn through my eyes. They come in with, like, 'You're going to die.' And swears and awful things. My husband and I took them to the police. Brutal.\"\n\nAnd the reaction from her neighbors?\n\n\"The people in the town,\" says Karena, with about as much aspersion as she is capable of, \"are very elegant .\" In other words, the shoulder Karena receives from the town is so cold, she needs an ice pick to leave the house. \"Lots of silence.\"\n\nDo you want to hear my theory about why the response to her press conference is so savage? ( A) She looks like she's just left a lawn party at Jay Gatsby's. (B) People think the tears she sheds-and dew rolling down an anemone could not fall more gracefully-are because she's making a big deal about Trump seizing her breast. In fact, she is overwhelmed by \"the cameras and the clicking,\" as she puts it, and she feels unaccountably moved by the thought of all the other women who have suffered in silence. And what with the pressure inherent in publicly accusing a man who is running for president of the United States of something sexual- of course she cries. Who wouldn't?\n\nKarena says she loses clients, has to cancel a big book-signing at Barnes & Noble, and is dropped or not invited back to do \"wellness\" appearances on TV shows such as The Doctors, though the show's producers deny that. (\"It would have been a huge launching pad for my brand. I still sometimes think about it. Then I remember I have integrity.\") She gets an email from a famous retreat center canceling her planned appearance, lest Trump supporters feel uncomfortable. She reads the email and calls her husband. \"I'm crying. I am gasping for air, and I say, 'This ( gasp ) just ( gasp ) happened ( gasp ). I ruined my career! \"\n\nDoes she regret coming forward then?\n\n\"My whole entire life, I've been considered super sensitive. But the past three and a half years have been a time of real, true empowerment for me. When I die, I'm going to know that I stood up for women. And you know what? It's been awful seeing how impulsive Trump has been as president. So in the end, my close friends have said to me, 'Karena, can you imagine if you had never said anything and had to watch this?'\"\n\nSo there you have it. Both Karena and the lawyer are happy with their decisions.\n\nAnd by the by, the lawyer does, in fact, tell one person about what Trump did to her before the 2016 election. She tells her mom. I know her mother. She is a doctor, a scientist, an abortion-rights woman, a southern belle, and she loves her daughter. Guess whom her mom votes for in 2016, knowing he has assaulted her daughter? That's right. She votes for Trump: \"He's so good at business.\"\n\nHer mother is a busy woman, however. She may not have heard about all of the women Trump allegedly manhandled. \"So I am speaking to support the women,\" Karena tells me. \"For those people who were not able to hear it then, I hope you hear it now. Because the only reason I am putting myself in this situation again is because this cannot happen again.\""

      "text": "What E. Jean Carroll Means for #MeToo\n\nThe advice columnist's account of being sexually assaulted by Donald Trump has more power than it might seem.\n\nLast week, The Cut published E. Jean Carroll's astonishing account of the \"hideous\" men she's encountered over the years, an excerpt from her upcoming book that ends with her detailing a brutal assault by Donald Trump. Carroll is about my mother's age, and I thought about her stories, and about my own, and about the ways men used to behave with impunity, and the ways they still do. Carroll's narrative-funny, frank, self-protective-seemed to me to be one of those world-changing moments: A woman was accusing the president of the United States of rape (Carroll has chosen not to use that word , but it fits the act she describes), adding her voice to more than a dozen others . It was appalling. It had to matter.\n\nThen, the next day, the story seemed almost to have evaporated into the ether. It wasn't mentioned on the front page of The New York Times , The Wall Street Journal , or the Los Angeles Times. The New York Times included a write-up in its books section, which felt so belittling to Carroll and to its female readers that even the paper's editor has since admitted it should have merited more prominent exposure . Trump responded, \"with great respect,\" by saying first and foremost that Carroll was not his type -yet another affirmation that the president conceives of women only as objects of desire or repulsion. Everything Carroll was set up to endure-the awful public scrutiny, the doxing, the abuse-felt like it was going to be for nothing. (For example: \"Is that really a woman?\" someone asked me about Carroll, on Twitter. \"Poke my eyes out. My dog would run from that.\")\n\nAnd yet, Carroll's great power is that she is not going away. While it's frustrating to see Trump so repeatedly and consistently skirt the accountability processes for sexual-assault accusations, Carroll's story still has power. Speaking on Thursday at the Aspen Ideas Festival, co-hosted by The Atlantic , the National Women's Law Center President and CEO Fatima Goss Graves said that one of the legacies of Donald Trump will be the way his presidency brought conversations about assault and harassment into the light. Without the Access Hollywood tape , Graves said, #MeToo might not have gone viral in the same way. Every time Trump resorts to old tropes about sexual violence, it sparks a massive outpouring of people sharing their own stories. What people such as Trump would really like, Graves said, \"is for all of these stories to go away, and for it to be so hard for individuals going forward [to accuse people] that they don't tell.\" Yet every woman who comes forward publicly ends up having the opposite effect.\n\nTwo years in, even as allegations about harassment, abuse, and assault keep surfacing, the #MeToo movement has had a tangible impact, Graves said. One major example is the alliance it's forged between women with power and privilege and women in sectors that don't afford them the same protections, such as domestic workers and farmworkers. Another is to what extent #MeToo still occupies the national imagination. Two weeks after #MeToo went viral in 2017, Graves was getting phone calls from reporters asking whether the movement had peaked, or whether it had gone too far. \"I thought, We haven't even gotten started yet ,\" she said. \"People are still grappling with stories and experiences that feel so deeply personal.\"\n\nThose stories have kept coming, and they show no signs of abating. When Brett Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court and Christine Blasey Ford came forward with her allegations of being assaulted by Kavanaugh during high school, it sparked what Graves described as \"this extraordinarily rich public conversation ... about the nature of sexual harassment and violence.\" In real time, survivors were responding to Ford's testimony with their own stories and sharing why they never went public about their own experiences, with the hashtag #WhyIDidntReport . It is true, Graves said, that \"we have not done right by survivors over the decades,\" and that many women still fail to get the justice they deserve. And it can be infuriating when political leadership seems to be unable to adequately process allegations of assault against men occupying positions of profound power. But there's an opportunity, she noted, every time a story like Carroll's emerges, for a public cultural reckoning with toxic masculinity, with misogyny, with harassment, and with sexual violence. And so accounts such as the one in The Cut continue to have power, even if the fullness of their impact can't be seen in the moment."

Jean Carroll\n\nNews Reporter\n\nFormer Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly , whose sexual harassment claims were a catalyst in former Fox News CEO and Chairman Roger Ailes's resignation, said she doesn't believe \"one word\" of another woman's sexual assault claims against President Donald Trump .\n\nThe right-wing media pundit blasted author E. Jean Carroll-who was awarded over $85 million in punitive damages in her sexual abuse and defamation cases against Trump -in a wide-ranging interview with The New York Times published Saturday.\n\nCarroll alleged that Trump sexually abused her in a dressing room of a Bergdorf Goodman department store in the 1990s. However, Kelly said she has sided with Trump, who called the allegations \"a hoax and a lie .\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"I don't believe one word of that. Not one word,\" Kelly said.\n\n\"The things I heard included things like he got handsy on an airplane. Now, I don't know whether that happened or it didn't, but do I find that a deal-breaker for a possible politician? Not really,\" Kelly continued.\n\nKelly also said that she didn't want her own sexual harassment claims against Ailes to give credence to those of former co-worker Gretchen Carlson-who sued the network and reportedly received a $20 million settlement. Kelly, who did not pursue legal action, said she didn't want to hurt Ailes as the network's \"cult leader.\"\n\n\"I really cared about Roger, and we had gotten past his harassment of me, which, for the record, never led anywhere. I did not submit to any of his advances. I had forgiven him, and he had done so much for me, and I did not want to hurt him,\" she told the Times . \"And I didn't like Gretchen Carlson, who was kind of looking for help in a way. The whole question was, can he be this thing who she has alleged he is? And I was really not inclined to help her and stick a knife in him.\"\n\nDespite her very public endorsements of Trump and his administration, Kelly insisted that she is \"still a journalist\" and can play hardball when needed. She mentioned her viral exchange with Trump at a 2015 Fox News debate during his first run for president, in which Kelly took heat for asking the president about calling women \"fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals.\"\n\n\"Look, you have to separate when you're in this business, you the person and you the professional. Megyn Kelly the woman and Megyn Kelly the brand, and they were attacking Megyn Kelly the brand, which is fair game,\" she said.\n\n\"I had thrown a very tough ball right at Trump's face in that debate,\" said Kelly, adding that the attacks and threats following the debate led her to hire security to take her children to Disneyland.\n\nBut now Kelly is firmly in Trump's corner, appearing at his victory rally just before the inauguration, and has rebuked suggestions that she has somehow caved into pressure to support him from his base.\n\n\"I don't think it was me caving. It was me rising. It was me answering something I truly felt called to do,\" said Kelly. \"I'm thrilled Trump won. I shudder to think of what the country would be right now if Kamala Harris had won, and in the end, I had no qualms about going out there for him whatsoever.\"\n\nNews Reporter\n\nemell.adolphus@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "E. Jean Carroll's Lawyers Foil Trump's Quiet Attempt to Stall $91 Million Payment\n\nPolitical Investigations Reporter\n\nWhen Donald Trump posted the $91.6 million bond on Friday allowing him to appeal the E. Jean Carroll decision without paying her immediately, it set off an interesting scramble to unpack why Federal Insurance Company-a subsidiary of Chubb Insurance Company-would lend to a notoriously unreliable borrower.\n\nBut there was also some fine print in the bond that would have, curiously, given Trump an additional 30 days to come up with the money-as well as another 30 days for FIC to come up with the money if Trump failed to pay. That meant Trump had found a way to unilaterally stall paying up, pending the consent of the court.\n\nIt looked like just the latest way Trump had, like Darth Vader before him , altered the deal. And for three days, it seemed as if Trump had gotten away with a minor tweak in court paperwork that would have created a two-month delay in having to pay a cent to the journalist he defamed -even if he lost the rape defamation case on appeal.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut over the weekend, Carroll's attorney spotted the odd jumble of legalese and pressured Trump's legal team to give up the ploy for extra time. On Monday, she alerted U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan of the new deal. And in a sign of just how interested he is, the judge immediately responded in a handwritten note scribbled over her letter to the court.\n\n\"The parties shall submit revised documentation promptly,\" the judge wrote back.\n\nAccording to Neil Pedersen, who runs an eponymous appellate bond agency in Manhattan, Trump's extension on paying up was \"not standard.\"\n\nThe episode is merely the latest example of the many twists and turns that continue to unfold as Carroll fights to punish the man who keeps denying that he sexually attacked her in the dressing room of a Manhattan department store-even though one federal jury concluded he did it and a second federal jury fined him to stop his lies about the assault.\n\nIt also adds a degree of intrigue to the relationship that Trump has developed with an insurance company that's led by a financier he once appointed to a government board.\n\nFederal Insurance Company swooped in last week to provide a last-minute lifeline to the real estate tycoon, whose cascading legal troubles have suddenly threatened his wealth and well-being. Faced with the prospect of handing over $83 million after losing a defamation trial to a woman he despises and continues to slander , Trump managed to secure what amounts to an expensive loan to hold off on her payday while he appeals the trial verdict.\n\nTrump is navigating a relatively obscure corner of the legal world, one that rarely makes headlines or gets media scrutiny. In the simplest terms, Carroll is owed a ton of money, and this outside company guaranteed that Trump is good for it while he fights the judgment-and it'll pay if he's not.\n\nSurety firms that are in the business of fronting money for legally imperiled people and companies typically give themselves a certain amount of time to make good on their promise-in some cases as short as 10 days, Pedersen said.\n\n\"Companies try to insert certain things to give them a little breather if they have to pay the judgment,\" Pedersen said.\n\nBut Trump and FIC got together and ironed out a deal that showered them with a lot of leeway: If Trump loses the case, he would have 30 days to pay Carroll. And if he doesn't, the company has up to an extra 30 days to do it for him. Stretched to the maximum, Carroll could win her historic case and still be forced to wait another 60 days for her money-a whopping sum that would have earned $3 million if it were invested in the S&P 500 stock market index during a similar time period at the start of the year.\n\nN. Alex Hanley, an expert in how companies appeal enormous judgments, thinks the potential two-month gap doesn't sound all that odd, given the immense amount of money in question and the huge players involved.\n\n\"These corporations are big battleships that take a long time to turn around,\" he told The Daily Beast.\n\nBut others felt that the agreement put Carroll at a severe disadvantage.\n\n\"From what I can see, there's no basis for it. If you have to pay, there's no reason to give Trump another 30 days. There's no reason to give a company with billions upon billions of assets a 30-day grace period,\" Pedersen told The Daily Beast.\n\nStill, all of the insurance and surety experts interviewed for this story read the situation as a cautious company trying to buy time-particularly given the track record of the man at the center of the storm.\n\n\"Especially with somebody like Trump,\" said Tom Gober, a forensic accountant and certified fraud examiner with extensive experience in the insurance industry.\n\nThe executives at FIC knew they were taking on a huge risk by fronting the money for Trump. His foray into the gambling world ended in disaster with four entities-the Trump Taj Mahal , Trump Plaza, Trump Castle, and Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts-going into corporate bankruptcy. He just lost a bank fraud trial that barred him from doing business in the global financial capital of New York. And he's poised to return to the White House, where he's threatened to become a dictator \"on day one\" and be beyond the reach of the law.\n\nAs such, the insurance company likely saw the need to give itself extra time now to chase after him for any cash it might have to turn over to Carroll if he eventually loses the case.\n\n\"They'd have 60 total days to try to squeeze blood from a turnip,\" Gober said. \"Knowing all of the public record being what it is on Trump's false statements and times he hasn't paid his bills, all of that, it wouldn't surprise me. I'm sure the surety company would like as much time as they can justify. Plus it gives them time. They earn interest on that money before they have to pay it out. They'd much rather not have to make the payment.\"\n\nThis odd arrangement has some financial and legal sleuths taking a closer look at the angel who came to Trump's rescue.\n\nFIC's parent company, Chubb, is led by Evan G. Greenberg. While president, Trump appointed Greenberg to the U.S. Trade Representative's advisory committee for trade policy and negotiations in 2018. He's also the son of Hank Greenberg, the former CEO of insurance supergiant AIG, whose profile became synonymous with the 2008 Great Recession and was once deemed by then-respectable journalist Matt Taibbi as one \"who perhaps more than anyone else was responsible for the galactic balance-sheet goat-f*ck that caused AIG's implosion in the first place.\"\n\nWhile speaking in 2019 before a crowd at The Economic Club of Washington, D.C., the younger Greenberg asserted that he only knew Trump \"from a distance\" and \"you know, in business.\" That gap is closing now that Greenberg's company is on the hook for $91 million from a man who's often made a mockery of his lenders.\n\nThe initial 60-day window would have given the company more time to harangue Trump with the $83 million bill, something Hanley called \"the ideal scenario for a surety.\"\n\n\"If there's the ability of the judgment debtor to pay the claim, it makes closing the bond far simpler. Otherwise, the company will make the payment to the judgment creditor, they'll have to issue a satisfaction of judgment, then they'll go get the money back from Trump,\" Hanley said.\n\nBut Carroll's lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, blew that up on Monday when she knocked it down to 15 days for the first phase and 15 days for the second phase, keeping the surety company on the hook at the front end and Trump responsible for the inevitable bill. Judge Kaplan, who is not related to her, will have to weigh in as well.\n\nThe only thing that matters now is whether Carroll can convince a panel of judges at the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals that her damages-only New York City trial in January holds up to scrutiny. And if it does, then Trump will have to pay up-and fast.\n\n\"I suppose it's more onerous to him,\" Hanley said.\n\nMaking matters more absurd is that Trump will have to repeat this high-wire act later this month, as he tries to fight off the $464 million judgment issued by a New York state judge who concluded Trump and his top lieutenants had engaged in outright bank fraud by lying about the tycoon's net worth and the most mundane statistics in his real estate portfolio.\n\nPolitical Investigations Reporter\n\njose.pagliery@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Trump Gets Hit With $83 Million Punishment in New E. Jean Carroll Case\n\nPolitical Investigations Reporter\n\nDonald Trump was ordered to pay E. Jean Carroll $83 million on Friday, after a jury last May said Trump sexually assaulted Carroll decades ago and a new jury on Friday decided only a massive sum close to nine-figures would stop Trump from continuing to defame the journalist about the assault.\n\nIt already appears the verdict wasn't enough, as Trump almost immediately went online and used Carroll's name to say she was making a \"False Accusation.\"\n\nThe former president has remained defiant for years, making continued false denials ever since Carroll first came forward with her traumatic experience. The former president has relentlessly attacked Carroll, even after a separate jury concluded last year that the sexual assault occurred and Carroll should receive $5 million.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn this trial, Carroll's lawyers asked the jury to award her $12 million to repair her reputation, an additional sum for her \"emotional harm,\" and an untold figure to dissuade Trump from abusing his immense political power and wealth to continue his defamation.\n\nThe jury on Friday responded by pegging the theoretical \"reputational repair\" program at $11 million, awarding her $7.3 million for enduring the ongoing personal suffering, and a whopping $65 million in punitive damages. The total judgment comes out to $83.3 million.\n\nU.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan had instructed the nine jurors-whose profiles cut across New York City's diverse population -to consider a punitive damages figure that would be \"intended to punish a defendant and deter his future defamatory statements.\"\n\nThe jury responded with $65 million, which is a massive blow to the real estate tycoon infamous for inflating his net worth.\n\nThe verdict comes just before another expected wallop against the supposed billionaire's real estate empire, that one coming from a New York state judge who already concluded that Trump routinely overstated his assets and committed bank fraud for nearly a decade. In that case, the New York Attorney General has asked Justice Arthur F. Engoron to yank $370 million from him for activities at the Trump Organization.\n\nThe combined one-two punch threatens to turn the billionaire's finances upside down just as he seeks the 2024 Republican nomination for president on his quest to return to the White House.\n\nAlthough the trial itself was saddled with contentious fighting and bitter outbursts from Trump, its conclusion was muted. Trump, who ghosted the entirety of his first rape defamation trial last year, ducked out early and avoided being in the courtroom when the verdict was read.\n\nJurors deliberated for two hours and 45 minutes, slightly shorter than they did during the last Carroll case. Just before the moment of truth, Trump lawyer Alina Habba hugged one of Carroll's lawyers, Shawn Crowley. Court staff announced that a verdict was ready at 4:25 p.m. and entered the courtroom minutes later.\n\nThe woman leading the nine-person jury handed the judge's law clerk a dark yellow manila envelope, which was then read out loud. Each juror later avowed they stood by the verdict, ensuring that the decision was unanimous.\n\nJudge Kaplan then told the jury-which he had kept anonymous for their own safety, given the raucous political atmosphere of the country at the moment and the threat of reprisal from Trump's loyal fanbase-that they were now free to identify themselves. However, he advised them not to.\n\n\"My advice to you is to never disclose that you were on this jury,\" he said.\n\nTrump's strategy in court amounted to an unapologetic refusal to accept reality, with his lawyers unabashedly shifting the blame for his unceasing verbal attacks on Carroll-trying to convince jurors that she bore some responsibility for his public denials and the backlash from his fans that followed.\n\nIn her closing argument, Habba casually referred to \"his truth\" in an attempt to justify Trump's relentless dishonesty about the attack. But when it was the opposing side's turn, Crowley wasn't having it.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, his truth was a lie, and he had no right to say it,\" she said.\n\nThat dialectic strikes at the heart of what has come to define the Trump Age of American politics: Trump's fabricated tales versus the truth. And while that dichotomy has become an overwhelming dividing line in the halls of Congress, TV news shows, and households, it was no barrier in this courtroom overlooking lower Manhattan.\n\nEvery time Trump and his lawyers tried to ignore the previous jury's finding that he had sexually assaulted a woman-something the judge has asserted in court filings was, in common parlance, a \"rape\"-the judge would shut them down.\n\nIn a hearing yesterday with the jury out of the courtroom, the lawyers debated the language on the verdict form. Trump defense lawyer Michael Madaio tried to spare his client the embarrassment and peril of allowing jurors to hear exactly what happened on that evening inside Manhattan's Bergdorf Goodman department store.\n\n\"Again, your Honor, I think it is unnecessary to include the graphic language concerning the underlying act itself. I think a general description-sexual abuse, sexual assault-will suffice,\" he said.\n\n\"Overruled,\" the judge shot back.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump gestures at a rally in advance of the New Hampshire primary.\n\nThat same fight played out in court in a myriad of ways over the past two weeks. No matter how many times the judge asserted that Trump himself was responsible-at one point saying, \"he did it\"-the former president simply wouldn't own up to his actions or the failure of his attorneys to succeed in defending him in court. Trump's simmering rage was evident in his angry murmuring from the defense table, his penchant for walking out, and his nonstop public declarations outside the courtroom.\n\nIt reached a boiling point on Friday afternoon, when the judge instructed the jury and finally went into detail about what exactly Trump did years ago that put him in this situation. Trump slumped in his seat with an incredulous look on his face when the federal judge told jurors Trump had \"forcibly inserted his fingers into her vagina.\"\n\nHabba tried to put a backstop to that during her final argument in front of jurors, when she told them, \"You heard him say he didn't intend to hurt her.\" It was a non-apology, one that she followed up by trying to decouple Trump from his rabid followers, trashing his MAGA trolls by calling them \"sick individuals whose messages should be universally condemned.\"\n\nBut if Trump agrees that some of his followers are \"sick individuals,\" he's never denounced them. Instead, almost immediately after the ruling came down, Trump took to Truth Social to blast the verdict.\n\n\"Absolutely ridiculous!\" he wrote just a few minutes after the jury ruled against him. \"I fully disagree with both verdicts, and will be appealing this whole Biden Directed Witch Hunt focused on me and the Republican Party. Our Legal System is out of control, and being used as a Political Weapon. They have taken away all First Amendment Rights. THIS IS NOT AMERICA!\"\n\nConspicuously absent from that statement, however, was E. Jean Carroll, an early indication that Trump may finally be dissuaded from attacking the former journalist.\n\nBut, true to form, just minutes after the Truth Social post, Trump took to Telegram -another social media site-to continue the very behavior the jurors had just tried to dramatically disincentivize.\n\n\"We asked for one Trial, on the E. Jean Carroll False Accusation Case, but the Judge wouldn't give it to us, he made us have two Trials on the same Hoax, and then, on the second Trial, they were allowed to use whatever information they wanted from the first, but we weren't allowed to use anything!\" Trump wrote. \"As an example, the Depositions they're using on the second Trial were taken in the first. He wouldn't allow us to use the totally exonerating Anderson Cooper/CNN Interview on either trial, but none of it in the second. Our Legal System is in shambles! This is another Biden Demanded Witch Hunt against his Political Opponent, funded and managed by Radical Left Democrats. The Courts are totally stacked against me, have never been used against a Political Opponent, like this, but in the end, we will win it all, and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"\n\nIf the $83.3 million had seemed like a gargantuan amount of money, it apparently wasn't enough.\n\nPolitical Investigations Reporter\n\njose.pagliery@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "How Much Will It Take to Stop Trump From Smearing E. Jean Carroll?\n\nPolitical Investigations Reporter\n\nThe nine New Yorkers on the federal jury hearing E. Jean Carroll 's latest defamation case against Donald Trump have a big question ahead of them in the coming days: How much will they have to punish a billionaire like Trump to stop him from continuing to insult the journalist who accused him of rape ?\n\nThe former president commands a massive real estate portfolio, still proudly declares himself a billionaire, and is sustained by a political war chest that he uses for legal fees. That's what jurors will contend with when figuring out how to correct his increasingly hostile behavior-if they even can.\n\nCarroll, the longtime magazine advice columnist, already won her first trial last year , when a separate jury concluded Trump attacked her at a department store in the mid-1990s and forced his fingers inside of her against her will-a verdict that cost him $5 million.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump is now on trial strictly to determine the extent of the damages that came from the disparaging remarks and false denials he made while at the White House in 2019-along with what it will take to discourage him from continuing his defamatory attacks.\n\nOn the first day of trial, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan told the jury it would be entirely up to them to come up with a dollar figure that would \"deter him from defaming her in the future.\"\n\nBut the odometer is ticking upward, and Trump keeps flooring the pedal.\n\nThe former president has put on a stunning show of insolence from the moment that first verdict came down. The very day after the May 2023 trial ended, Trump appeared at an ill-conceived CNN town hall where he called Carroll a \"wack job\" while sarcastically joking that \"she was immediately attracted to me, and we had this great chemistry.\"\n\n\"I don't know her. I never met her. I have no idea who she is,\" Trump said while a crowd of MAGA fans cheered him on at Saint Anselm College's auditorium.\n\nHe's only ratcheted up the insults on the 2024 Republican primary campaign trail.\n\n\"It's a made-up, fabricated story,\" he said in New York City on Wednesday, shortly before boarding a plane to campaign in New Hampshire ahead of the primary election there.\n\nHe disparaged her again a rally on Sunday, where his campaign barred NBC correspondent Vaughn Hillyard for merely asking a congresswoman about the rape case.\n\nOn his Truth Social network, Trump has posted dozens of times in recent days-sometimes while he sat in the federal courtroom-calling her a liar. Just yesterday, he wrote about the black coat dress Carroll kept for years as evidence of the attack-one that lab tests showed still retained some traces of DNA. (Trump refused to submit a sample of his own DNA before a trial deadline.)\n\n\"The Monica Lewinsky type gambit failed badly,\" he wrote .\n\n\"THIS IS A FALSE ACCUSATION FORCED INTO THE PUBLIC EYE BY DEMOCRAT OPERATIVES LIKE HER LAWYER, HER FUNDERS, AND OTHERS,\" he posted days earlier.\n\nThe unfettered chaos has warped the ongoing trial. While a legal battle of this magnitude would normally be a stoic exercise dealing with dated and carefully examined evidence, Trump's continuing contemptuousness for the justice system has forced lawyers to keep submitting new evidence as the case goes on.\n\nThis came up on the second day of trial, when Carroll's attorney questioned her about the incessant harassment.\n\n\"Ms. Carroll, has he continued to lie about you?\" Roberta Kaplan asked.\n\n\"Yes, he has continued to lie. He lied last month. He lied on Sunday. He lied yesterday. And I am here to get my reputation back and to stop him from telling lies about me,\" Carroll testified.\n\nAt that moment, it became clear that Trump's own lawyers think they can stem the damage.\n\n\"Those statements are not at issue here,\" defense attorney Alina Habba began to reason. The judge quickly stopped her-and made it clear that the door was, in fact, wide open.\n\n\"Overruled. Certainly relevant to punitive damages, at least,\" he shot back.\n\nIn the legal realm, punitive damages are quite different from compensatory damages, which are the actual damages someone suffered. By contrast, punitive damages are meant to be a punishment that serves as a severe lesson to the transgressor.\n\nNaturally, when it comes to massive corporations and the uber rich, the punitive damages can be sky high.\n\nWhen a Los Angeles jury concluded that British-Greek billionaire Alki David (of hologram tech fame) sexually battered an ex-employee, they hit him with $8 million in compensatory damages-which were immediately eclipsed by the $50 million in punitive damages.\n\nThe rich usually understand the near limitless risk that comes with this kind of retaliatory discipline, which is the danger of handing jurors a blank check. When a federal judge allowed a former University of Minnesota student to seek punitive damages from the Chinese billionaire she said raped her after a night of drinks, the entrepreneur Richard Liu settled the case out of court the very next month.\n\nSome seem to think Trump still cares about plugging the leak on this sinking boat.\n\n\"I don't believe Trump will testify at the E. Jean Carroll trial for 3 reasons: he would subject himself to perjury and contempt charges and cause the punitive damages to skyrocket,\" former federal prosecutor Kristy Greenberg commented on Twitter.\n\nHowever, Trump shows no signs of backing down. In court, some observers casually noted that Trump seems to think he'll never pay fines-either by means of legal maneuvering with appeals to a friendly Supreme Court, or by authoritarian refusal to abide by the law if he wins back the White House.\n\nIn fact, Trump's two defense lawyers didn't even counter the $12 million price tag that a marketing expert told jurors in court it would take for Carroll to repair her reputation-a \"compensatory damages\" figure that could easily be multiplied several dozen times to come up with a stiff enough punishment fit for a billionaire.\n\nIt's clear that, if Trump is going to actually stop smearing Carroll, the sum will have to be much higher than it was last time.\n\nAt the first iteration of this trial, the jury awarded Carroll $5 million, but the punitive damages portion was only a tiny fraction of that, set at $280,000. It clearly wasn't enough to make him shut up.\n\nA year ago, U.S. District Judge Donald M. Middlebrooks swung the gavel like a hammer when he ordered Trump and Habba to jointly pay a $937,989 sanction for wasting everyone's time with a revenge lawsuit against political rival Hillary Clinton. And yet, both ignored his blistering order and have brazenly returned to the judge, demanding that he reconsider the case in South Florida.\n\nDuring the recent New York bank fraud trial, $15,000 in court fines proved insufficient to stop Trump from insulting the state judge's law clerk. Only the ominous threat of throwing him in jail seemed to work. (That was on top of the $110,000 he paid in fines for failing to hand over evidence.)\n\nBut the next few weeks could mark a turning point. New York Supreme Court Justice Arthur F. Engoron is about to issue a judgment that, in part, seeks to punish Trump for routinely lying to banks-and that figure could go north of the $370 million requested by the state's Attorney General. The judge is now grappling with how to deter a billionaire from flouting the law with impunity.\n\nWith only a few days left in this second rape defamation trial, the jury will be asking itself the same question.\n\nPolitical Investigations Reporter\n\njose.pagliery@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump's legal team rested its case Thursday in the rape, battery and defamation trial brought by writer E. Jean Carroll, without Trump's lawyer calling a single witness. E. Jean Carroll has accused Trump of raping her in the dressing room of Bergdorf Goodman in the '90s. She was able to file the civil case against Trump decades later because New York opened a one-year window on the statute of limitations for adult survivors of sexual assault.\n\nIn addition to Carroll, her legal team called two other witnesses to testify about Trump's pattern of assaulting women. Jessica Leeds testified Trump repeatedly groped her during a flight in the 1970s. This was Leeds speaking years ago.\n\nJESSICA LEEDS : It was a real shock when all of a sudden his hands were all over me. But it's when he started putting his hand up my skirt, and that was it. That was it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Journalist Natasha Stoynoff also took the stand and recounted how Trump allegedly pushed her against a wall, forcibly kissed her during a 2005 interview at Mar-a-Lago. The jury was also shown the infamous Access Hollywood video in which Trump brags about grabbing women's genitals without asking permission.\n\nDONALD TRUMP : I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know, I'm automatically attracted to beautiful - I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. I just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.\n\nBILLY BUSH : Whatever you want.\n\nDONALD TRUMP : Grab 'em by the pussy. You can do anything.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : In a videotaped deposition shown to the jurors, Trump was asked about his comments in the Access Hollywood tape. He said, quote, \"Historically, that's true with stars, if you look over the last million years,\" Trump said. Trump also claimed E. Jean Carroll's story was made up and that she wasn't his type. He also said in the tape to the lawyer questioning him in the deposition, \"You wouldn't be a choice of mine, either, to be honest.\" Trump waived his right to testify in the case, but on Thursday he told reporters he may return from playing golf in Ireland to testify and \"confront\" Carroll.\n\nDONALD TRUMP : And I have to go back for a woman that made a false accusation about me, and I have a judge who's extremely hostile. And I'm going to go back, and I'm going to confront this woman.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : When the judge heard this, he said that Trump has until Sunday at 5:00 to notify the judge if he will reopen the case and testify. Closing arguments are set for next week with jury deliberation starting Tuesday.\n\nFor more, we're joined by Deborah Tuerkheimer, professor of law at Northwestern University, author of Credible: Why We Doubt Accusers and Protect Abusers . Her New York Times guest essay is headlined \"The Importance of E. Jean Carroll's Lawsuit Against Donald Trump.\"\n\nWelcome to Democracy Now! Professor Tuerkheimer, if you can start off by responding to what's happened so far in this case? You have - this is a civil case. E. Jean Carroll could bring women, who she didn't know, who had accused Donald Trump of sexually assaulting them - two of them testified - and two of her dear friends, who she said she told immediately after she said President Trump raped her back in the '90s in a dressing room.\n\nDEBORAH TUERKHEIMER : Right. I think it's important to say first that the testimony of an accuser is rarely enough to persuade the jury. That's true inside the courtroom. That's true outside the courtroom. The idea of credibility discounting is a really important one. Credibility discounting is rampant today, and it's been rampant throughout our history. So, for E. Jean Carroll to prevail, she's going to need quite a bit of corroborating evidence. She's going to need witnesses who support her story.\n\nAnd that's what we've seen in this trial. As you mentioned, she's brought in two women who heard her describe this account very close in time to the incident alleged. And then she's brought in what we call pattern and practice witnesses, two women who've described sexually aggressive conduct on the part of Donald Trump, that allows the jury to see this as part of a kind of pattern that he engages in. You couple that with the Access Hollywood tape, and E. Jean Carroll's lawyers have presented a powerful case, a case that very much offers the jury support for E. Jean Carroll's story.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Now, explain what it means that this is a civil trial. If he is found guilty, what does this mean? And also that at the same time that his lawyers said they rest their case, Donald Trump is playing golf in Ireland, saying he's going to testify.\n\nDEBORAH TUERKHEIMER : Right. So, if E. Jean Carroll prevails, Donald Trump is not found guilty, per se ; he's found liable. He's found liable for damages. Because, as you mentioned, this is a civil case, not a criminal case, the burden of proof is lower than what we understand to be proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Here, she has got to show by a preponderance of the evidence, meaning it's more likely than not that he raped her, as she said he did. And if she does that, if she convinces the jury, then the jury, again, will award her, presumably, some damages. And the same is true of her defamation claim. What's at issue here is damages.\n\nDonald Trump does not need to testify. It's somewhat unusual, particularly in a civil case, for a defendant not to present evidence, and particularly to tell his version of events. That's his right. He's obviously made noise about coming back to court at the 11th hour. I think most commentators and observers are skeptical that he's actually going to do that. But, of course, Donald Trump is unpredictable, and we'll wait and see what happens this weekend.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Even if he doesn't testify, did it surprise you that not one witness was brought forward by the defense?\n\nDEBORAH TUERKHEIMER : Yes. The defense had a witness list. It ended up not calling anyone on that list. But again, typically in a civil case, there are two sides, and both sides are going to present some witnesses. Particularly because the cross-examination of E. Jean Carroll and the cross-examinations of the other witnesses that she called didn't seem to go especially well, one might have expected the defense to present its own evidence in this case. As you've said, the defense did not.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And, Professor Tuerkheimer, why could E. Jean Carroll bring this case decades later? Explain the law that was just passed in New York.\n\nDEBORAH TUERKHEIMER : New York passed a groundbreaking law. It's called the Adult Survivors Act. The only other state to have passed a law like it, dealing with adult survivors of sexual violence, is California. And it went into effect in November of 2022, providing a one-year, essentially, lookback window, so that there is no statute of limitations that bars claims. Plaintiffs can go back in time as far as they want to go back, as long as they were 18 or older at the time the incident alleged, and they can bring those claims in civil court. They can sue for damages.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : If you can talk about now what this means and why you think this trial is so important? As you talk about in your book, Credible , who is able to bring their cases forward?\n\nDEBORAH TUERKHEIMER : Well, this is important because, in part, Donald Trump really has come to represent, for so many women and other people, male sexual entitlement. The book is really about a long-standing tradition in our culture of protecting powerful men from consequences for sexual assault and sexual harassment.\n\nAnd so, here, we're seeing E. Jean Carroll come forward, against all odds, many years later, believing and hoping that the culture has shifted some, at least enough for her to be believed. That's not something that she felt she would have been back in the '90s. But now, post-#MeToo, and as the #MeToo movement moves along, we'll see whether she's able to get that kind of belief and that kind of justice, a measure of justice, it should be said. Again, a civil case, this is not about criminal punishment. This is not being brought by the state.\n\nBut for E. Jean Carroll to come forward and insist that it happened, that she's not to blame, and that it matters, is quite heroic. It's quite brave. And we'll be watching, I think all of us, with great interest to see what this jury of nine individuals decides in the case.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And finally, Deborah Tuerkheimer, how do you think this case fits into all the other investigations of Donald Trump? It wasn't often included when we talk about the New York attorney general investigating him, the DA investigating him, the Georgia DA investigating him, the federal government investigating him.\n\nDEBORAH TUERKHEIMER : Yeah, it's such an interesting question. Those other investigations focus on Donald Trump's conduct as president, as a businessperson and as someone who's left the office of the presidency. These are all somewhat extraordinary and unusual kinds of conduct, or misconduct, that he is alleged to have engaged in.\n\nWhat's so interesting to me about this case is that the kind of allegation that E. Jean Carroll is articulating is so sadly commonplace. It's so widely experienced by so many individuals in our society. Of course, it's extraordinary that the allegation comes against someone who's been president and who is the top contender for the Republican nomination, but there's so much that's familiar about the allegation and the kind of credibility discounting that's gone on in the case, that kept her quiet for so many decades, that I think it's relatable to many individuals. And so, in that way, it's different from the other kinds of cases, I think.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And the jury being anonymous?\n\nDEBORAH TUERKHEIMER : Yes. I think, for fairly obvious reasons, the judge wanted the jury to remain anonymous. The jury itself wanted to be anonymous. These are the kinds of allegations that - well, we certainly don't want to see any tampering. We don't want to see any threats against this jury. And this is a high-profile case, the highest-profile case of this sort that we've seen in our history, and it's really important that the jury is able to do its job.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Deborah Tuerkheimer, professor of law at Northwestern University, author of the book Credible: Why We Doubt Accusers and Protect Abusers .

The jury did not find that Trump had raped her, as she has claimed. Trump says he will appeal. The closely watched trial stemmed from an incident in the 1990s, when Carroll says Trump sexually assaulted her in a department store dressing room in New York. \"Today, the world finally knows the truth,\" Carroll said in a statement, reacting to the verdict. \"This victory is not just for me but for every woman who has suffered because she was not believed.\" We speak with columnist Moira Donegan, who covers gender and politics for The Guardian and who calls it \"a really significant moment for American women, and specifically for the #MeToo movement.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has been ordered to pay $5 million to writer E. Jean Carroll after a jury found him liable for sexually abusing and defaming her. The jury in the civil trial reached its verdict after just three hours of deliberations. The jury, however, did not find that Trump raped Carroll.\n\nIn a statement, E. Jean Carroll said, \"I filed this lawsuit against Donald Trump to clear my name and to get my life back. Today, the world finally knows the truth. This victory is not just for me but for every woman who has suffered because she was not believed,\" she said.\n\nDuring the trial, E. Jean Carroll recounted how Trump sexually assaulted her in the '90s inside the dressing room of the Bergdorf Goodman department store located a block from Trump Tower. During the trial, Trump's defense team did not call any witnesses, and Trump rejected his chance to testify during the trial.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump, who's running for president again, posted a number of messages and videos on his social media platform blasting the verdict.\n\nDONALD TRUMP : We'll be appealing this decision. It's a disgrace. I don't even know who this woman is. I have no idea who she is, where she came from. This is another scam. It's a political witch hunt.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : In a video deposition recently made public, Donald Trump claimed E. Jean Carroll was, quote, \"not my type.\" But during questioning in the taped deposition, Trump mistook E. Jean Carroll for his ex-wife Marla Maples.\n\nROBERTA KAPLAN : You're saying Marla is in this photo?\n\nDONALD TRUMP : That's Marla, yeah. That's my wife.\n\nROBERTA KAPLAN : Which woman are you pointing to?\n\nALINA HABBA : No, it's that.\n\nDONALD TRUMP : Here.\n\nALINA HABBA : Carroll.\n\nDONALD TRUMP : Oh, it's that? Oh, OK.\n\nROBERTA KAPLAN : The person you just pointed to is E. Jean Carroll.\n\nDONALD TRUMP : Oh, I see. Who is that? Who is this?\n\nALINA HABBA : Furthers the point, in a way.\n\nROBERTA KAPLAN : And the person - the woman on the right is your then-wife Ivana?\n\nDONALD TRUMP : I don't know. This was the picture.\n\nALINA HABBA : Ivana.\n\nDONALD TRUMP : I assume that's John Johnson. Is that -\n\nALINA HABBA : That's Carroll.\n\nDONALD TRUMP : - Carroll? Because it's very blurry.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : In a moment, we'll be joined by Jessica Leeds, who testified during the trial about how Trump sexually assaulted her during a flight in the 1970s. But we begin with Moira Donegan in San Francisco, an opinion columnist covering gender and politics for The Guardian , also a writer-in-residence at the Clayman Institute for Gender Research at Stanford University.\n\nMoira, thanks so much for joining us. Can you first respond to the verdict, to a unanimous jury finding Donald Trump liable for sexually assaulting and defaming E. Jean Carroll?\n\nMOIRA DONEGAN : Well, thank you for having me, Amy.\n\nAnd I think something to remember about this verdict is that it was unusually fast. That suggests that this wasn't very close. You know, usually in even a civil trial like this, a jury will be out in deliberations for much longer. They came back yesterday in just under three hours, which suggests that, you know, there wasn't a lot of doubt in the jurors' minds about who was telling the truth here.\n\nI think this is a really significant moment for American women, and specifically for the #MeToo movement. You know, Donald Trump was sort of the figure whose boorishness, his shamelessness, his long-standing impunity for sexual assault really did inspire this rage at the, you know, ongoing and very pervasive sexual abuse of women, mostly by men. And his lack of accountability for many years had been a motivator and an insult. You know, it was insulting, I think, to the citizenship of American women to have somebody who had been so contemptuous of their dignity in a position of great power. So, that a court of law has now held him accountable, held him liable, is, I think, a really significant moment.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about the law that enabled E. Jean Carroll, decades later, to bring this lawsuit against Donald Trump here in New York City?\n\nMOIRA DONEGAN : Yeah. So, you know, the law under which this lawsuit was filed is something called the New York Adult Survivors Act, which was a long time coming. It is a law that extended the statute of limitations or created a one-year - they call it a lookback window, that began on Thanksgiving, during which, you know, survivors of sexual abuse who have sort of gone past the statute of limitations, whose assaults occurred too long ago to file civil suits, have this opportunity over the course of a year to look back, to bring back their claims and to file civil - not criminal, but civil - suits that would have otherwise been prohibited by the statute of limitations. E. Jean Carroll lobbied for this law, and her attorneys filed the lawsuit just within hours of it having gone into effect.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And so, people can actually still file suits, right? That window is still open 'til - what is it? November?\n\nMOIRA DONEGAN : Yes, there are six more months. If there's any survivors in New York who have, you know, assaults, who have claims that have happened beyond the statute of limitations, they still have that opportunity to file civil claims and to try and get some justice.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : During the trial, the jury was shown the infamous Access Hollywood video in which Trump brags about grabbing women's genitals without asking permission.\n\nDONALD TRUMP : I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know, I'm automatically attracted to beautiful - I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. I just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.\n\nBILLY BUSH : Whatever you want.\n\nDONALD TRUMP : Grab 'em by the pussy. You can do anything.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : \"You can do anything,\" Trump said in that videotape. Well, during the videotape deposition, seen by the jury, Trump defended his comments in the Access Hollywood tape.\n\nROBERTA KAPLAN : Again, this has become very famous. In this video, \"I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the [bleep]. You can do anything.\" That's what you said, correct?\n\nDONALD TRUMP : Well, historically, that's true with stars.\n\nROBERTA KAPLAN : It's true with stars that they can grab women by the [bleep]?\n\nDONALD TRUMP : Well, that's what - it's - if you look over the last million years, I guess that's been largely true - not always, but largely true, unfortunately or fortunately.\n\nROBERTA KAPLAN : And you consider yourself to be a star?\n\nDONALD TRUMP : I think you can say that, yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was Donald Trump in the videotape deposition that was shown in court, and yet he refused to be there live to testify, which is extremely significant, Moira. If you can talk about this? I mean, he was golfing in Ireland at his golf course and said that he would be challenging E. Jean Carroll, whoever she is, and the judge in court. And when the judge took him up on the offer and said that - this was, what, last Thursday - that he'd have until Sunday, even though his lawyer had rested the case, to say whether he would come into court, he didn't. The significance of this, Moira? So, the only thing the jury saw were these damning clips from his deposition.\n\nMOIRA DONEGAN : It's a really damning, it's a really remarkable exchange. You know, that phrase \"fortunately or unfortunately,\" really, I think, bolstered Carroll's claim that the Access Hollywood tape amounts to not, as Donald Trump had characterized it, mere, you know, quote-unquote, \"locker room talk,\" but really a confession, right? He's reaffirming not only his misogynist attitudes but really a true lack of remorse and lack of a moral objection to sexual assault.\n\nYou know, Donald Trump performed so badly in that deposition, and he incriminated himself further in this kind of remarkable way, as you noted, and I think that, you know, it might not have been entirely unwise for him, from a legal standpoint, to avoid coming to the trial. I think, you know, he would not probably have performed very well on cross. He doesn't have a lot of self-control. He's very indignant. He's very impulsive. And, you know, I don't think he would have helped his own case.\n\nThat said, I think it did also make an impression on the jury, you know, how much disregard for the proceedings, disinterest in mounting a real defense, sort of seemingly casual irreverence for the seriousness of what was being alleged in the civil court. You know, I don't think that helped him, either. I think, you know, all that the jurors really heard was a ton of corroboration from E. Jean Carroll, a ton of confessions and reaffirmations of his character and habits from the long record of Donald Trump, and particularly that Access Hollywood tape, which was played many times in court, but they didn't really hear much of a defense from Trump's side. And that, I think, you know, really made a big impression.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Jean Carroll at a department store in the 1990s. After just three hours of deliberations, the jury ordered Trump to pay Carroll $5 million. Following the ruling, Trump appeared in a televised town hall on CNN , where he mocked E. Jean Carroll while the Republican audience laughed at his remarks. We discuss the verdict, Trump's response and the legal system's treatment of sexual assault cases with Jane Manning, a former sex crimes prosecutor who is now the director of the Women's Equal Justice Project.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We begin today's show looking more at how a New York jury has found former President Donald Trump liable for sexually abusing and defaming the writer E. Jean Carroll at the Bergdorf Goodman department store in the 1990s. After just three hours of deliberations, the jury ordered Trump to pay Carroll $5 million. On Wednesday, E. Jean Carroll talked about the ruling during an interview on The Today Show on NBC .\n\nE. JEAN CARROLL : I am overwhelmed, overwhelmed with joy and happiness and delight for the women in this country. ... Here is the astonishing thing about this win yesterday. Of all the cases that this man faces, all the legal quagmires, it was one - well, let's think of all the prosecutors, all the special counsel, all the investigators. And what happened yesterday is one five-foot-two little, blonde, wily female attorney and one 79-year-old -\n\nROBERTA KAPLAN : Five-foot-nine year old.\n\nE. JEAN CARROLL : Yes.\n\nROBERTA KAPLAN : Five-foot nine.\n\nE. JEAN CARROLL : Five-foot-nine - 79-year-old advice columnist beat Donald Trump in court.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : During the trial, Donald Trump's defense team did not call any witnesses. Trump rejected his chance to testify. But on Wednesday night, in a televised town hall on CNN , Trump mocked E. Jean Carroll, while the Republican audience laughed and applauded his remarks.\n\nDONALD TRUMP : Are you ready?\n\nKAITLAN COLLINS : Mr. President, can I - can I - can I ask you, because -\n\nDONALD TRUMP : And I swear on my children, which I never do, I have no idea who this woman - this is a fake story, made-up story. We had a horrible Clinton-appointed judge. He was horrible. He allowed her to put everything in. He allowed us to put nothing in.\n\nKAITLAN COLLINS : Mr. President -\n\nDONALD TRUMP : This is a fake story.\n\nKAITLAN COLLINS : - you're recounting your version of events here right now. ...\n\nDONALD TRUMP : And I swear - and I've never done that. And I swear to you, I have no idea who the hell - she's a whack job.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : After CNN's town hall ended, Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez appeared on MSNBC and blasted Trump's remarks and CNN's handling of the town hall.\n\nREP . ALEXANDRIA OCASIO - CORTEZ : I know you said earlier that you will not comment on the platforming of such atrocious disinformation, but I would. I think it was a profoundly irresponsible decision. I don't think that it would - I would be doing my job if I did not say that. And what we saw tonight was a series of extremely irresponsible decisions that put a sexual abuse victim at risk, that put that person at risk in front of a national audience, and I could not have disagreed with it more. It was shameful.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're joined now by Jane Manning, a former sex crimes prosecutor, now the director of the Women's Equal Justice Project, which serves survivors of sexual assault.\n\nJane, it's great to have you with us. If you can both respond to what Donald Trump keeps on repeating about E. Jean Carroll, even after being found guilty by - unanimously by a jury of six men and three women, found liable for sexually abusing and defaming E. Jean Carroll, and respond to the verdict itself and the significance of it?\n\nJANE MANNING : Let's start with the verdict itself, because I think the headline of this story is that the verdict was a resounding victory for E. Jean Carroll. Some people have had questions about why the jury didn't find him liable for rape. I think that goes to some ambiguities in E. Jean's own testimony about whether she was sure whether she was fully penetrated or not. Sometimes a jury will hear that and say, \"OK, well, if she's not sure, we're not sure.\"\n\nBut the sexual abuse that she described was unequivocal, and the jury delivered a verdict that was unequivocal in less than three hours, which shows that there was broad consensus among the jurors that they thoroughly believed E. Jean Carroll. And so, to come back within three hours delivering a verdict of liability for sex abuse and a $5 million damages award shows that this jury believed E. Jean, that they believed what happened to her was a serious offense and a serious violation of her rights, and they decided to award damages accordingly. So, her message of celebration yesterday morning is absolutely right. This was a victory for her, and it was a victory for all of the survivors who were rooting for her as she approached her trial.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You know, I asked you what Trump - about Trump's comments, you know, defaming her once again.\n\nJANE MANNING : Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about the judge's warning about him doing this? And also, we said \"despite the verdict,\" but maybe it was because of the verdict that he did that.\n\nJANE MANNING : Well, let's point out that Donald Trump is very free with his comments and his insults outside of a courtroom, but he didn't have the guts to walk into the courtroom, take an oath, testify under penalty of perjury, subject himself to cross-examination. Those are all the things that E. Jean Carroll was willing to do. And those are the things that, under our rule of law, transform a person's account from mere talk to testimony. Donald Trump wasn't willing to go into court and back up his words with actual sworn testimony. E. Jean Carroll was.\n\nI think it was really a wrong move for CNN to give Donald Trump, a man who tried to overthrow American democracy, a big piece of primetime airtime to spout whatever he wanted to spout. At the end of the day, though, the jury verdict is in, and Donald Trump can say what he wants, but he was afraid to face down this woman in court. And I think we shouldn't let the public forget that.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : And, Jane, could you explain the origins of the New York Adult Survivors Act, under which this case was heard, where the jury was adjudicating on the basis of that act? If you could explain its origins and also why, even though what Trump is accused of and what he's been found liable for are criminal offenses, this was actually a civil case?\n\nJANE MANNING : It was a civil case. And, in fact, the conduct that Donald Trump was found liable for could have been prosecuted in a criminal court, but for the fact that the statute of limitations had expired. Now, New York has since abolished its statute of limitations on rape, but that only applies to rape cases from 2001 forward. It doesn't go back earlier than that. And that's why E. Jean Carroll's case was never a candidate for criminal prosecution. So she sued Donald Trump civilly under a cause of action called sexual battery. And that is what the jury found him liable for, for conduct that meets the legal description of the crime of sexual abuse. But it was a civil verdict for sexual battery that he was found responsible for.\n\nYou asked about the Adult Survivors Act. So, the Adult Survivors Act is a law that was passed last year, and it opens a one-year window of opportunity, from November of 2022 to November of this year, 2023, for survivors of sexual assault to bring a civil lawsuit against the perpetrator of the sexual assault, even if the normal civil statute of limitations had expired. So, normally, the statute of limitation for a civil lawsuit for sexual battery in New York state is only a year. And as we know, that's just not a realistic view of what happens for some survivors in terms of coming to terms with sexual abuse and coming forward to report it. And so, there was a group of sexual assault survivors who took up this issue in Albany, and they were a group of very specific women - Drew Dixon, Marissa Hoechstetter, Evelyn Yang, Alison Turkos. And they lobbied the Albany Legislature to create this one-year window of opportunity under which survivors can bring a civil lawsuit even if they would otherwise have been time-barred.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : And could you explain the federal statute that was part of the Violence Against Women Act that allowed evidence of similar crimes to be admissible in sex crime cases, and how that worked, if at all, in the case of E. Jean Carroll?\n\nJANE MANNING : Absolutely, because what we saw in E. Jean Carroll's trial was that two other women - Jessica Leeds and Natasha Stoynoff - were permitted to testify about their experiences of being sexually assaulted by Donald Trump in much the same way that E. Jean Carroll described. This testimony was admissible because of a federal rule, 415, that was enacted as part of the Violence Against Women Act in the early 1990s. And it provides that in federal court, civil or criminal trials, evidence of similar crimes is admissible in a sex crime trial. That law was passed because Congress, as part of the Violence Against Women Act, recognized that survivors of sexual assault face added hurdles, beyond those faced by other survivors, to seeking justice in court and that there is a strong societal interest in being able to hold sexual predators accountable.\n\nIt's important to note, however, that the vast majority of sex crime cases, civil or criminal, are tried in state courts, where this law is not in effect. And so, we often have the perverse situation where a survivor takes the witness stand, and if she has, let's say, a shoplifting conviction, she can be cross-examined about that, but if a defendant has seven prior sex crime convictions, that is concealed from the jury. And that happens on the theory that jurors will be prejudiced; they'll be run away with by their emotions, and they won't be able to look at the actual case that's on trial.\n\nWhat we know now from experience is that is not true. And Donald Trump's case is one example of that. The jury wasn't afraid to look at the verdict sheet, think back to E. Jean Carroll's testimony and say, \"Well, we're not convinced of this allegation, because she expressed some ambiguity about it, but she was clear about this count, this count and this count, and we thoroughly believe her. So we are going to find Donald Trump liable for those things.\" And so, what they showed, and what other juries have shown, is that they're not afraid to parse through the charges, parse through the evidence, and base their verdict on what they believe about the crime at hand.\n\nSo, it is time for states to go back and reexamine that rule of law that says jurors cannot know if there is a pattern to a defendant's behavior. Jurors have shown that they can handle it. The #MeToo movement has shown us why that kind of evidence is so relevant. It's time for activists in all the states that don't permit this kind of testimony to go to our legislatures and say, \"Let's take another look at this. Let's change the laws to give survivors a better shot at justice,\" like the shot that E. Jean Carroll had.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : So, Jane Manning, we want to go to E. Jean Carroll in her own words, speaking Wednesday following the verdict.\n\nE. JEAN CARROLL : It is a moment, which, before yesterday, there was a concept of the perfect victim. The perfect victim always screams, always reports to the police, always makes note when it happened. And then her life is supposed - the perfect victim's life is supposed to fold up, and she's never sort of supposed to be happy again. And yesterday we demolished that old concept. It is gone. It is gone. And I am - I'm overwhelmed with happiness for the women of the country. It's really not about me so much. It's about every woman.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : So, Jane Manning, you work with survivors of sexual violence, and you said, after the verdict came, that your cellphone was buzzing with messages of relief and joy from survivors. So, if you could talk about what you think the broader impact of this verdict will be on other survivors?\n\nJANE MANNING : I think every time there's a high-profile rape case, it gives us an opportunity to have important conversations about what real rape looks like, because there are a lot of myths about who the perfect victim is and what a real rape is and what it is not. And E. Jean Carroll did a brilliant job of summarizing that in her comments - oh, the idea that a real victim always screams, always goes straight to the police, never acts happy again for the rest of her life. E. Jean Carroll didn't fit that script, and yet she was so forthcoming about who she is and why she did the things that she did, I think some of the things that made her a, quote-unquote, \"imperfect victim\" are actually some of the things that made her a very credible witness. It gives us all a chance as a culture to learn more about what we should and should not expect the facts of a rape case to look like.\n\nAt the same time, it also gives us a chance to acknowledge that for most survivors, the system is still not working the way it worked for E. Jean Carroll. Civil lawsuits are prohibitively expensive for most survivors. Rape shield laws are very unevenly enforced in civil litigation around the country. And in criminal justice, we still have police departments that can find overwhelming resources to arrest peaceful protesters or women selling food on the subway - they can find the resources for that, but they are still not coming up with the resources to do proper investigations of sex crimes or to train detectives to do trauma-informed interviews. Right here in New York City, the NYPD allocates less than 1% of its personnel to all cases of sex crimes and all child abuse cases in all of New York City. That's exactly upside down from where we should be. And so we still have a lot more work to do so that other survivors can achieve justice.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, I wanted to ask you two questions, Jane Manning. One is, you know, Trump keeps attacking this as a Democratic hit job on him. But, of course, we don't even know who the jurors are. And I want to ask you about the fact that they were anonymous. In fact, it's something that Tacopina, his lawyer, said he's going to appeal on, their anonymity, anonymous also to the lawyers. And, two, he talks about Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn, being one of the funders of this lawsuit that E. Jean Carroll brought. I mean, there is no question Roberta Kaplan is an astonishing lawyer, but who can afford this kind of defense? And that goes to people all over the country who might want to bring charges. And even in this case, when E. Jean Carroll wins, if you can say that - let's not forget she was attacked decades ago - but even when she does, I mean, it's not only the mocking of Trump that Trump does at this town hall; what's more frightening is the cheers from the crowd in the audience. That's a lot to unpack.\n\nJANE MANNING : Amy, it's horrifying. And what it says to me is, once again, we have to recognize the close connection between the health of women's rights and the health of our democracy. The two go hand in hand. When democracy is undermined, women's rights are undermined. Just listen to the way Donald Trump talks about his worldview, of a world where if you're a powerful man, you can do what you want to women, and you can get away with it. Remember the way he rubbed that in Robbie Kaplan's face during the deposition. \"It's been that way for a million years,\" he said. And then he paused, and then he said, \"Unfortunately or fortunately.\" He wants a world where there's no democratic accountability, and specifically there's no legal accountability for men who perpetrate sexual assault.\n\nAmy, you're absolutely right that our civil justice system is out of reach for most survivors. I would love to see more of our wonderful law firms devoting pro bono resources to representing survivors. I personally have seen some law firms do that kind of work, and they've made life-changing differences for survivors. But there will never be enough pro bono representation to address all of the rape cases that exist. Moreover, there are defendants that are just not appropriate for civil relief. We need a functioning criminal justice system that is prioritizing rape cases over arresting nonviolent people for crimes of poverty and addiction. So, we really need to redouble our efforts to make both civil and criminal justice systems more reflective of the true values of our community and the true priorities of women and all survivors in our community.\n\nLook, I was chilled by what I heard in the CNN town hall last night. It was not a representative sample of the American public. It was a hand-picked audience of Republican Trump supporters. At the same time, I think it is essential that we realize that we have a long way to go before we have a legal system that truly reflects the values of Americans, because I do believe that there is broad consensus among Americans that perpetrators of sexual assault should be held accountable, are not yet consistently being held accountable, and there's a lot we can do to change that.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And the anonymous jury? We just have 30 seconds.\n\nJANE MANNING : The anonymous jury is not going to be a grounds for a successful appeal. There is no right that a defendant has to a nonanonymous jury. And the judge made a great record as to why Donald Trump's own history of attacking and endangering people with his inflammatory rhetoric was the reason why he chose to protect the jurors' identities in this case.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Jane Manning, we want to thank you for being with us, former sex crimes prosecutor, director of the Women's Equal Justice Project, which serves survivors of sexual assault. You can also go to democracynow.org to see our interview yesterday with Jessica Leeds, one of the two witnesses who testified on behalf of E. Jean Carroll, who describes being sexually assaulted by Donald Trump.\n\nNext up, we get an update on scandal-plagued Republican Congressmember George Santos, arrested Wednesday on 13 felony charges, still refusing to resign. Back in 30 seconds.\n\n[break]\n\nAMY GOODMAN : \"If It Don't Bleed\" by James McMurtry.

Jean Carroll in the 1990s.\n\nInstead, for nearly 45 minutes, Trump stood in front of a microphone ranting about Carroll and another woman who accused him of sexual assault, and then left without taking any questions.\n\n\"I never touched her,\" Trump said of Carroll, during the New York City event. \"I would have had no interest in meeting her. ... She made up a story, fabricated 100%, that I attacked her.\"\n\nWithout any evidence, he accused Carroll of stealing her story from an episode of a popular legal drama TV series.\n\n\"Her favorite show is 'Law & Order,' \" Trump claimed. \"There's an almost exact story as her story in 'Law & Order' about being attacked in the dressing room of a department store.\"\n\n\"That's her favorite show, 'Law & Order,'\" he repeated. \"She said that.\"\n\nThe Republican presidential nominee had just been in a federal courtroom with his lawyers, who argued that Carroll's civil lawsuit against him in May 2023 should be overturned because it relied on improper evidence. The jury in that case concluded that Trump had attacked Carroll in a luxury department store dressing room in 1996 and awarded her $5 million.\n\nIn Jan. 2024, a second jury awarded Carroll another $83.3 million for defamation, after Trump made derogatory comments about her when he was president. The judge in that case instructed the jury that it had to first accept the previous jury's finding that Trump had sexually assaulted Carroll.\n\nDuring Friday's remarks, in his efforts to discredit Carroll, Trump rambled his way into attacking another woman who had accused him of sexually assaulting her on an airplane decades ago.\n\n\"She said ... we became very intimate,\" he said, recounting her allegations, as the lawyers standing behind him began looking uncomfortable . \"She said I was making out with her. And then after 15 minutes ... that I grabbed her at a certain part, and that was when she had enough.\"\n\nTrump scoffed that this could have happened on a commercial flight.\n\n\"I start kissing her and making out with her. What are the chances of that happening?\" he said, adding, \"I know you're going to say it's a terrible thing to say, but it couldn't have happened, and ... she would not have been the chosen one.\"\n\nBefore leaving the event and ignoring questions shouted at him by reporters, Trump blamed his legal team for failing him in his 2023 trial.\n\n\"I'm disappointed in my legal talent, to be honest with you,\" he said, as some of his lawyers stood next to him. \"I wanted to show up to the first trial. My lawyer, who is not up here, not with us any longer, said, 'Sir, you should not show up.'\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Trump Lawyers Fight To Overturn Jury's Finding That He Sexually Abused E. Jean Carroll\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - While Donald Trump campaigns for the presidency, his lawyers are fighting to overturn a verdict finding him liable for sexual abuse and slander.\n\nThree judges of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals are scheduled to hear arguments Friday in Trump's appeal of a jury's finding that he sexually assaulted the writer E. Jean Carroll . She says the Republican attacked her in a department store dressing room in 1996. That jury awarded Carroll $5 million .\n\nFor several days, preparations have been underway in a stately federal courthouse in lower Manhattan for Trump to attend the arguments in person.\n\nTrump's lawyers say the jury's verdict should be tossed because evidence was allowed at trial that should have been excluded and other evidence was excluded that should have been permitted.\n\nTrump, who has denied attacking Carroll, did not attend the 2023 trial and has expressed regret he was not there.\n\nThe court is unlikely to issue a ruling before November's presidential election.\n\nThe civil case has both political and financial implications for Trump.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris , a Democrat, has jabbed at Trump over the jury's verdict, noting repeatedly that he had been found liable for sexual abuse.\n\nAnd last January, a second jury awarded Carroll another $83.3 million in damages for comments Trump had made about her while he was president, finding that they were defamatory. That jury had been instructed by the judge that it had to accept the first jury's finding that Trump had sexually assaulted Carroll. The second trial was largely held to determine how badly Carroll had been harmed by Trump's comments and how severely he should be punished.\n\nTrump, 77, testified less than three minutes at the trial and was not permitted to refute conclusions reached by the May 2023 jury. Still, he was animated in the courtroom throughout the two-week trial, and jurors could hear him grumbling about the case.\n\nThe appeal of that trial's outcome, which Trump labeled \"absolutely ridiculous!\" immediately afterward, will be heard by the appeals court at a later date.\n\nCarroll, 80, testified during both trials that her life as an Elle magazine columnist was spoiled by Trump's public comments, which she said ignited such hate against her that she received death threats and feared going outside the upstate New York cabin where she lives.\n\nLawyers for Trump said in court papers that he deserves a new trial in part because the trial judge, Lewis A. Kaplan, permitted two other women to testify about similar acts of sex abuse they say Trump committed against them in the 1970s and in 2005.\n\nThey also argued that Kaplan wrongly disallowed evidence that Carroll lied during her deposition, and other evidence they say would reveal bias and motives to lie for Carroll and other witnesses against Trump. The verdict, they wrote, was \"unjust and erroneous,\" resulting from \"flawed and prejudicial evidentiary rulings.\"\n\nTrump has insisted that Carroll made up the story about being attacked to sell a new book. He has denied knowing her.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

This Court should affirm,\" Carroll's lawyers said.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Jean Carroll\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nDonald Trump 's latest effort to reverse his court-ordered $83.3 million payout to the writer E. Jean Carroll was rejected Thursday, leaving him on the hook for the damages she won in her defamation trial against him.\n\nThe ruling comes in response to Trump's requests for a new trial and a reduced judgment against him in Carroll's defamation case, which she brought after Trump lied about sexually assaulting her.\n\n\"Mr. Trump's argument is entirely without merit both as a matter of law and as a matter of fact for all of the reasons articulated in Ms. Carroll's memorandum of law in opposition to his motion,\" U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan wrote in his ruling against Trump, who has made several attempts to reduce or appeal the January judgment against him.\n\nKaplan shot down the claims from the former president that the payout was excessive, pointing to the reach of his defamatory statements about Carroll.\n\n\"Mr. Trump's malicious and unceasing attacks on Ms. Carroll were disseminated to more than 100 million people,\" he wrote (emphasis original). \"They included public threats and personal attacks, and they endangered Ms. Carroll's health and safety. The jury was entitled to conclude that Mr. Trump derailed the career, reputation, and emotional well-being of one of America's most successful and prominent advice columnists and authors.\"\n\nKaplan also dismissed Trump's claims that the jury had been \"erroneously instructed\" and that evidence was left out of the trial.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Jean Carroll are \"watching\" and \"listening\" to Donald Trump 's comments about their client following his latest false claim that he didn't know who she was, Carroll's attorney Shawn Crowley told MSNBC 's Jen Psaki on Monday.\n\nPsaki suggested to Crowley that Trump, over the weekend, \"came awfully close to defaming\" Carroll once again when he told supporters: \"Who the hell is she? Who is the woman?\"\n\nPsaki pointed out, \"Trump knows exactly who your client is.\"\n\nA jury last year ordered Trump to pay Carroll $5 million in damages after it found him liable for sexual abuse and defamation after Carroll accused him of raping her in the mid-'90s. Another jury in January ordered Trump to pay Carroll $83.3 million after he defamed her again.\n\nPsaki noted, \"He was found liable for sexually abusing her and then defaming her by lying about it. Do you watch these, and could this warrant a third suit as you watch that?\"\n\n\"We certainly watch them. It's hard not to,\" Crowley replied. \"Every time Donald Trump speaks, you know, I think as we said at trial many times, he has the biggest megaphone in the world, and so everyone hears them, including us and including our client, E. Jean Carroll. And as you said, what he said was absolutely a lie.\"\n\nCrowley continued, \"Two unanimous federal juries have found that not only did Trump know who E. Jean was, he sexually assaulted her and lied about it, repeatedly. Everything he said about her over the last five years has been a lie and has been defamatory.\"\n\nCrowley added, \"So we're watching, we're listening. We had really hoped that, as I think the jury found that $83 million would maybe be enough to convince him to keep E. Jean Carroll's name out of his mouth. Apparently, he showed us this weekend that he really cannot control himself and that maybe it wasn't.

      "text": "Jury Awards E. Jean Carroll Over $80 Million In Case Against Trump\n\nReporter, HuffPost\n\nJurors reached a verdict Friday after around three hours of deliberation in writer E. Jean Carroll's trial against former President Donald Trump , from whom she sought millions of dollars in damages for defamation.\n\nThe jury awarded Carroll a whopping $83.3 million, The Associated Press reported . That breaks down to $7.3 million in emotional damages, $11 million in reputation-related damages and $65 million in punitive damages.\n\nTrump was not in the courtroom when the verdict was read.\n\nOver the course of the trial, however, Trump's presence led to some dramatic scenes - including earlier on Friday when the former president stormed out during Carroll's attorney's closing arguments.\n\nU.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan interrupted the proceedings to note for the court record that Trump had abruptly walked out. He had also arrived late.\n\nKaplan and Trump's attorneys, particularly Alina Habba, clashed throughout the trial, up until the jurors left to begin their deliberations. The judge was moved to threaten Habba with \"time in lockup\" during a tense procedural exchange before the jury came in, and reportedly reiterated that threat during closing arguments as jurors looked on.\n\nCarroll, a longtime advice columnist, maintains that Trump raped her in a dressing room at Manhattan's Bergdorf Goodman department store in 1996. She wrote about her experience in a book that was excerpted in New York Magazine in 2019, prompting Trump to launch his campaign of denial.\n\nHis personal attacks - Trump has called Carroll a \"whack job\" and a \"fraud\" - inspired her to sue for defamation.\n\nWriting on his social media platform, Truth Social , Trump called the verdict \"absolutely ridiculous\" and pledged to appeal.\n\n\"Our Legal System is out of control, and being used as a Political Weapon. They have taken away all First Amendment Rights. THIS IS NOT AMERICA!\" wrote the former president.\n\nCarroll did not speak to the media scrum outside the courthouse, although she was all smiles as she walked arm-in-arm with her legal team to a waiting vehicle.\n\nKaplan reportedly urged the seven men and two women to \"never disclose\" they served on the jury. The panel was delivered to the courthouse via an underground garage each day to preserve their anonymity and safety.\n\nA previous trial concluded that Trump was liable for defaming and sexually abusing Carroll, although jurors did not find that he raped her under the letter of the law. The May 2023 proceedings centered on Carroll's accusation and critical statements made by Trump in 2022; he was told to pay her $5 million in damages .\n\nTrump did not attend the previous trial on advice from his lawyers, he said.\n\nKaplan instructed jurors in the current trial to accept the earlier verdict, repeating that instruction multiple times on Friday when Habba echoed Trump's denial, per CNN . The judge reportedly told the jurors their only job was to decide how much Trump owed Carroll, and to ignore the assertion from Trump's team that Carroll somehow benefited from the attention.\n\nRoberta Kaplan, an attorney for Carroll who is not related to the judge, told jurors they had \"the opportunity, maybe even the responsibility to put an end to this,\" according to The New York Times .\n\nShe argued that Trump would likely not stop unless he was made to part with a large sum of money - and she reportedly emphasized how wealthy Trump said he was.\n\nIn her closing arguments, Habba cast heavy doubt on the link between Trump's statements and the damage Carroll claims to have suffered, which included physical threats to her safety and a steep drop-off in letters asking for advice.\n\n\"President Trump has no more control over the thoughts and feelings of social media users than he does the weather,\" Habba said, per The New York Times .\n\nOver the course of the trial, jurors watched Habba clash repeatedly with Judge Kaplan, often in ways that left Habba appearing inexperienced.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Bill Barr Says Insulting a Rape Accuser Was Part of Trump's Official Duties\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe Justice Department is trying to squash E. Jean Carroll's defamation case, which stemmed from her sexual assault allegation.\n\nE. Jean Carroll at her home in Warwick, N.Y., on June 21, 2019.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Department of Justice moved to replace President Donald Trump's private legal team to defend the accused rapist in a defamation suit brought by author E. Jean Carroll. Last year, Carroll credibly accused Trump of raping her in a Manhattan department store in the mid-1990s.\n\nIn a predictably putrid response, Trump denied the assault, claimed (falsely) to have never met Carroll and - as grounds for why he could not have raped her - said that she wasn't his \"type.\" These comments spurred the defamation suit, in which the Justice Department has now attempted to intervene.\n\nAccording to the Justice Department, government lawyers must take over Trump's defense because he made the allegedly defamatory comments while \"acting within the scope of his office as President of the United States.\" That is, they state it was within the scope of official duties to lie about and insult a credible rape accuser. Public money will now underwrite Trump's defense, and the intervention could move the case out of New York state court and into federal court.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe U.S. government, rather than accused rapist Trump, would effectively become the defendant in the case. Indeed, on Wednesday morning, the government opened a federal docket titled \"E. Jean Carroll v. United States of America\"; the state lawsuit had been \"E. Jean Carroll v. Donald J. Trump.\" A federal court will decide whether to grant the government lawyers' motion.\n\nThe New York Times described the Justice Department's intervention as \"highly unusual\"; CNN called it an \"extraordinary move.\" But it was not out of character for Attorney General William Barr's Justice Department.\n\nIt feels redundant, at this point, to stress the unprecedented ways Barr has transformed the Justice Department into Trump's private law firm . This latest, unambiguous obstruction of justice is yet another chilling affirmation of federal law enforcement's unwavering loyalty to the president and willingness to decimate all who would challenge his path to reelection.\n\nNeither is Barr's intervention without historic precedent: Within past frameworks of fascist-state regimes , such moves are not, in fact, extraordinary or unusual.\n\nCarroll responded on Twitter to the Justice Department's motion. She noted that it came at the moment in her civil case when the president was \"required to produce documents and DNA in discovery.\" The author's lawyers requested that Trump provide a DNA sample to compare to that of a semen stain on the dress she says she wore on the day of the assault.\n\n\"Trump's effort to wield the power of the U.S. government to evade responsibility for his private misconduct is without precedent,\" Carroll's lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, said in a statement, \"and shows even more starkly how far he is willing to go to prevent the truth from coming out.\"\n\nThe Justice Department's move, if successful, could put an end to Carroll's case entirely. As University of Texas law professor Steve Vladeck noted on Twitter, the \"argument that Trump was acting 'within the scope of his employment' when he defamed E. Jean Carroll is not an effort to take over defense of the suit; it's an effort to have the suit dismissed-because the government itself can't be sued for defamation.\"\n\nThe motion to move the lawsuit from state to federal court comes one month after Trump unsuccessfully attempted to have the case delayed in New York State Supreme Court. The judge rejected his bid and stressed that the president does not enjoy immunity from state criminal investigations. At the very least, the Justice Department's legal maneuver will now see the case delayed, avoiding potentially damaging revelations about the abusive, misogynistic president prior to the November election. Although, to be sure, claims and evidence of past sexual assaults by both Trump and his opponent Joe Biden have done little to hinder their campaigns in the past.\n\nThe attorney general has again and again proven himself willing to deploy the U.S. law enforcement apparatus in service of every aspect of the Trumpian agenda. From the undermining of the federal probe into Russian election interference; to the paranoiac demonizing and criminalization of anti-racist, anti-fascist movements; to anti-immigration extremism; to the refusal to condemn and focus on deadly white supremacist organizations; to casting baseless doubt on voting by mail - the list goes on.\n\nNow the Justice Department is in effect asserting that, if this president rapes and lies about you, it is also the state that has raped and lied about you. And there is an intolerable truth in that.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have?

      "text": "Donald Trump, Joe Biden, and the Politics of Sexual Misconduct\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nJournalist Melissa Gira Grant and former Nevada assemblywoman Lucy Flores are this week's guests.\n\nThe Democratic and Republican parties are set to run candidates for president in 2020 who have been accused by women of sexually assaulting them. This week on Intercepted: Two dozen women have accused Donald Trump of sexual misconduct, harassment, and assault, including rape. Trump has responded by denigrating, mocking, and attacking his accusers. Eight women have made allegations of misconduct against Joe Biden, and one of them has accused him of sexual assault. Biden, who is running on a campaign to restore dignity and honesty to the White House, emphatically denies that he assaulted his former staffer Tara Reade and has sought to explain away his conduct toward his other accusers by portraying his unwanted touching as his way of being affectionate. The New Republic's Melissa Gira Grant discusses Reade's allegations, Biden's response, and the broader discourse in the media and the Democratic Party surrounding the actions of the presumptive nominee toward women.\n\nFormer Nevada lawmaker Lucy Flores says Biden touched her inappropriately, kissed her head, and sniffed her hair when he was campaigning for her. She says she didn't report it to the Obama White House at the time for fear of retaliation or rejection, but when Biden began to run for president, she felt an obligation to speak out. Flores was soon followed by seven other women sharing similar stories. She discusses her experience with Biden, what it means that the Democratic Party is standing by him, and the impact of a choice between Trump and Biden.\n\nElise Swain: This is a content warning to our listeners. This episode of Intercepted contains descriptions of sexual misconduct, sexual harassment, and graphic descriptions of rape and sexual assault throughout the entirety of the program.\n\nMartha MacCallum: Welcome back to our Fox News virtual town hall, \"America Together: Returning to Work.\"\n\nBret Baier: As president, what do you say to the people who are scared to go back to work?\n\nDonald J. Trump: Uh - I don't care. Too bad. It's always bad. And I don't want to - I don't care about it. We're going to lose anywhere from 75, 80 to 100,000, or 90 or 95. If you call losing 80 or 90,000 people successful, good. It's OK with us. The employees have to work. Now, if they don't want to work, make them work. They're not feeling great.\n\nBB: Our next question for the president comes from Clearwater, Fla. Here it is.\n\nAlex Jones: I will eat my neighbors. I'm not letting my kids die. I'm just gonna be honest, because I'm somebody that thought I could fix this, and I'm starting to think about having to eat my neighbors. I'll do it!\n\nDJT: OK. I love the question, actually, because what I did is - I was saying, it's going to pass, not going to be a big deal. People aren't dying from it. The doctors would say, \"Well, you shouldn't say that.\" I'll say what I think. And then one day they said, \"Sir, what's your problem? What is your problem?\"\n\nBB: Mr. President, last thing. What do you tell your kids and grandkids about Covid-19, about this time?\n\nDJT: You know, we're all playing a very complicated game of chess or poker - name whatever you want to name. Space Force. Space Force. But it's not checkers, that I can tell you. It's called America first.\n\nBB: President Trump. Thank you very much for your time.\n\nDJT: Thank you.\n\nJeremy Scahill: This is Intercepted. I'm Jeremy Scahill, coming to you from my basement in New York City. And this is episode 129 of Intercepted.\n\nDJT: You're a famous guy, then you become president. And people just - people that you've never seen, that you've never heard of, make charges. So, you know, I guess in a way you could say I'm sticking up for him... But I would just say to Joe Biden, just go out and fight it.\n\nJS: The Democratic and Republican parties are set to run candidates for president in 2020 who have both been accused by women of sexually assaulting them. In the case of Donald Trump, it's several women. In the case of Joe Biden, it's one woman. Trump also has some two dozen accusers who allege that he has done everything from harass and fondle them to raping them. Joe Biden has eight women who have alleged that he acted inappropriately toward them, including unwanted touching, kissing, and sniffing of their hair, and one accusation of rape.\n\nDonald Trump has responded to the allegations against him by fighting some of the women in court and by publicly attacking them, smearing them, and denigrating them.\n\nDJT: You take a look. Look at her, look at her words. You tell me what you think. I don't think so.\n\nBelieve me, she would not be my first choice, that I can tell you.\n\nThe events never happened. Never. All of these liars will be sued after the election is over.\n\nJS: Joe Biden, on the other hand, has offered carefully worded statements claiming that his intentions were good and that sometimes he has inadvertently invaded women's personal space, but that it's just the affectionate kind of guy he is, from the generation he's from, and he's just a hugging kind of guy.\n\nHis apologies have been phrased so that what he's actually saying is that he's sorry if someone misinterpreted his innocent affection. In the case of his former staffer Tara Reade, who alleges a very serious sexual assault by Biden inside the U.S. Senate, his campaign eventually issued an emphatic written denial of Reade's allegations. And the Biden team encouraged its supporters privately to tell the media that the allegations have been investigated by reputable news organizations and are false.\n\nBut as more and more news outlets began to report on the allegations and more corroborating witnesses emerged, Biden was forced to break his personal silence. And he did it on the extremely friendly turf of MSNBC's Morning Joe, in an interview with host Mika Brzezinski.\n\nMika Brzezinski: Would you please go on the record with the American people? Did you sexually assault Tara Reade?\n\nJoe Biden: No, it is not true. I'm saying unequivocally - It never, never happened. And itt didn't. It never happened.\n\nJS: After Biden's appearance on MSNBC, there was a concerted campaign of harassment that intensified against Tara Reade, with hashtags trending that called Reade a liar and proclaimed #IBelieveBiden. Reade has been mercilessly attacked, had her past rifled through, was accused of being a Russian agent. And she has, she says, been subjected to death threats. Joe Biden has not publicly told his supporters to cease these intensifying attacks against her. This campaign of attempted character assassination against Reade have been bolstered by more official establishment voices, with her allegations being discredited or rejected by major Democratic Party figures, New York Times columnists, and at the highest levels of power within the Democratic National Committee.\n\nNancy Pelosi: I'm a big, strong supporter of the #MeToo movement. I think it's been a great - made a great contribution to our country. And I do support Joe Biden. I'm satisfied with how he has responded.\n\nJS: I do not know what happened between Joe Biden and Tara Reade. It may well be the case that only the two of them truly know. But the allegations are very serious, and they warrant a real independent investigation that does not place at its center the desire to defeat Donald Trump in November's election. Rather, her allegations against an extremely powerful politician running to be president of the United States should be taken seriously independent of the political consequences and aggressively pursued. It cuts directly to the question of Joe Biden's fitness to serve and to the issue of accountability in general.\n\nIf what Reade says happened, happened, Joe Biden should not be a candidate for any office in this country, and he should face the consequences of his actions. At the same time, Biden's emphatic denial should be noted, as should his right to due process. Biden should be offered the presumption of innocence in the context of an actual serious investigation aimed at getting to the truth. That is not what we are currently witnessing. Right now, this is all trial by media and social media. Mostly, it's a trial of Tara Reade, and the prosecution includes scores of Biden supporters motivated by their political preferences rather than facts or concern for the experience of women who allege assault. It is also relevant that as his supporters accuse Reade of lying, that Biden himself has a long history of telling documentable lies, including about his own personal history, and his public behavior toward women, and the stories of women he has made uncomfortable, or he has inappropriately touched. Those are also relevant.\n\nTara Reade's allegation that Joe Biden forced her against a wall and penetrated her body with his fingers stems from her time working for Biden in 1993. Now, much focus is being placed on a complaint that Reade says she filed at the time. Reade herself has said consistently that that complaint did not lay out the sexual assault allegations against Joe Biden.\n\nNow, after the Associated Press ran a headline recently that gave the impression that this was somehow a new revelation, Biden's supporters latched on to it as some sort of a smoking gun, proving that the assault didn't happen. It's a ridiculous hill to stake a defense of Biden on, on multiple levels. Among these is the context of what was happening on Capitol Hill at the time, and who Joe Biden was in the Senate.\n\nBiden had just chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on Clarence Thomas, in which one of Thomas's accusers, Anita Hill, was character assassinated by that committee. At first, Biden and the committee were not going to hear Hill's testimony. But many women lawmakers demanded that Anita Hill be heard.\n\nNita Lowey: One of the reasons we're here is that it's very difficult for some of our colleagues to deal with issues of sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is painful. It exists. It's real. It's not imaginary. There's not only a gender gap in our country, there's a gender chasm.\n\nMary Rose Oakar: Sexual harassment is every bit as evil as any other type of unethical conduct.\n\nJS: I recently rewatched the documentary \"Anita,\" about those hearings, and there are some incredible moments that are relevant to how some Democrats are currently attacking Tara Reade. Here's Senator Barbara Mikulski speaking at the time about the smear campaign against Anita Hill and demanding that the Senate reconvene to hear her testimony before proceeding with Thomas's confirmation.\n\nBarbara Mikulski: To any victim of sexual harassment, or sexual abuse, or sexual violence, either in the street or in even in our own home, the message is: nobody's going to take you seriously, not even the United States Senate.\n\nJS: Joe Biden presided over hearings that amounted to Anita Hill being put on trial herself, repeatedly humiliated, having her reputation dragged through the mud on national television. Biden personally joined with his colleagues in forcing Hill to publicly repeat some of the most painful episodes from her experience with Thomas over and over again.\n\nJB: And what was that incident again?\n\nAnita Hill: The incident with regard to the Coke can that's spelled out in my statement?\n\nJB: Would you describe it once again for me, please?\n\nAH: The, um -\n\nJS: Here's Republican Alan Simpson questioning Hill.\n\nAlan Simpson: If what you say this man said to you occurred, why in God's name when he left his position of power, or status, or authority over you - and you left it in 1983 - why in God's name would you ever speak to a man like that the rest of your life?\n\nAH: That's a very good question. And I'm sure that I cannot answer that to your satisfaction.\n\nJS: Then there was this exchange with one of the GOP's major attack dogs on that committee, Senator Arlen Specter.\n\nArlen Specter: So that you are not now drawing a conclusion that Judge Thomas sexually harassed you?\n\nAH: Yes, I am drawing that conclusion, that is why -\n\nAS: Well then, I don't understand. Then I don't understand.\n\nAH: Well, let me try to explain again.\n\nJS: Joe Biden and the committee ultimately blocked corroborating witnesses who would have backed up Anita Hill's testimony by sharing their own experiences with Clarence Thomas.\n\nJane Mayer: Joe Biden - he really is, in the end, responsible for not having called the witnesses who could have corroborated Anita Hill. I think that there were a lot of facts here that a number of people would rather not think about.\n\nJB: This entire proceeding is ended. [Gavel sound.]\n\nJS: Thomas would go on to be confirmed to a lifetime appointment, and he sits on the U.S. Supreme Court to this day. So it was that Joe Biden who facilitated Clarence Thomas's nomination going forward that Tara Reade went to work for, and that was the culture on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe message in the 1990s was that women who speak out against people like Bill Clinton or Clarence Thomas will be destroyed if they dare to tell their stories. You cannot examine Tara Reade's allegations in any serious way without understanding this. And you cannot use what she did or did not say in her alleged complaint filed at the time as some evidence of Joe Biden's innocence.\n\nIt took incredible strength for any woman to make any allegations against a powerful man, particularly the very Senator Joe Biden, who had just presided over a nationally televised character assassination of a woman who told her story of sexual harassment by a powerful man. And that man got promoted to one of the most powerful positions in the U.S. government, for life. Now, soon after Reade worked for Biden, Bill Clinton faced very serious allegations of sexual assault against him by women, beginning with Paula Jones in 1994, and then later Juanita Broaddrick. The Clinton team smeared Paula Jones mercilessly throughout the 1990s, and Clinton won reelection in 1996. And Bill Clinton's supporters used the same type of demeaning language that Donald Trump uses to describe his accusers, language that is rooted in mocking the appearance and social status of the accusers. Jones was ridiculed as trailer trash on comedy shows.\n\nJay Leno: Paula Jones, are you there?\n\nUnknown actor: I'm coming, I'm coming. Like I told the president, keep your pants on.\n\nJS: And Clinton confidant and adviser James Carville said this in attacking Paul Jones.\n\nJames Carville: What I said was, was it was about money. And what I said - and I said that from day one. I said it the day the lawsuit was filed. And guess what? I'm right. That's all it's about.\n\nJS: So this is the context that is necessary to understand when assessing how Tara Reade approached her response, and what she was going to say, and when she was going to say it in response to Biden's alleged assault. It was the era of Bill Clinton and Clarence Thomas being promoted while their accusers were being destroyed publicly. Now, for her part, Anita Hill recently released a statement on this matter. It read in part, quote, \"Joe Biden has denied Tara Reade's sexual assault allegations, but that should not be the end of the inquiry.\"\n\nHill said the allegations against both Biden and Trump should be investigated, and the findings made public. Anita Hill went on, \"How we proceed comes down to whether we take allegations of sexual violation seriously enough to insist that public institutions have fair procedures in place that protect individuals' rights to come forward and the rights of those who are accused to defend themselves.\"\n\n[Music interlude.]\n\nComing up later in this program, we are going to be talking to another woman who has alleged that Joe Biden acted inappropriately toward her. Her name is Lucy Flores, and she's a longtime member of the Democratic Party, a former Nevada state legislator, and former candidate for lieutenant governor. But we begin today by looking at the range of allegations against both Donald Trump and Joe Biden.\n\nAs it stands currently, come November, we may have two major party presidential candidates facing serious sexual assault and rape allegations. At least 25 women are on record accusing Donald Trump of behavior ranging from sexual harassment to rape. These allegations include Karena Virginia, who says Trump groped her at the US Open in New York in 1998.\n\nKarena Virginia: He then walked up to me and reached his right arm and grabbed my right arm. Then his hand touched the right inside of my breast. I was in shock. I flinched. \"Don't you know who I am? Don't you know who I am?\" That's what he said to me.\n\nJS: Temple Taggart says Trump kissed her without consent on two occasions.\n\nTemple Taggart: He indicated that he wanted to introduce me to various modeling agencies. I had traveled to New York with two chaperones to meet with him at his office located in Trump Tower. To my surprise, Mr. Trump embraced me and kissed me on the lips for a second time. It was that second kiss that made me wonder what his intentions really were.\n\nJS: Tasha Dixon says Trump would walk into beauty pageant dressing rooms unannounced.\n\nTasha Dixon: To have the owner come waltzing in when we're naked or half-naked - in a very physically vulnerable position - and then to have the pressure of the, you know, the people that work for him telling us to go fawn all over him, go walk up to him-\n\nJS: Natasha Stoynoff says that Trump sexually assaulted her in 2005 at his Mar-a-Lago home while his wife Melania was in another room. In a 2016 column, Stoynoff wrote , \"We walked into that room alone, and Trump shut the door behind us. I turned around, and within seconds he was pushing me against the wall and forcing his tongue down my throat.\"\n\nJess Cagle: Why didn't you come forward at the time?\n\nNatasha Stoynoff: It could hurt my career. I could lose my job. I could be, you know, sued. All the things that are happening now is what I worried about then.\n\nJS: Jessica Leeds says that Donald Trump assaulted her while sitting next to him on a flight in the late 1970s.\n\nJessica Leeds: The stories of those other - what, 14, 15 women? They're all the same. And none of them have colluded with each other. So, this is an M.O. of this man.\n\nJS: There are many more allegations, including allegations of rape from journalist E. Jean Carroll and from Trump's ex-wife Ivana Trump. She later slightly altered her story to say she felt violated at times. Donald Trump has denied all these accusations against him, and he's taken the additional cruel step of denigrating his accusers and calling some of them liars.\n\nDJT: Every woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign.\n\nJS: There have been many allegations against Donald Trump, and we all have been subjected to the way that he is attacking his accusers. More recently, though, Joe Biden has become the focus of media attention on this issue. At least eight women have accused Biden of unwanted touching. These allegations include Amy Lappos, says she had an encounter with Biden at a political fundraiser when he was vice president.\n\nAmy Lappos: - put his hands behind my head and pulled me close, and I thought, he's going to kiss me. And he was still pulling me in, and I was like, oh, OK, I think he is actually going to kiss me. And he started rubbing noses with me. And he was still holding on to my face and rubbing noses, and then stopped.\n\nJS: D.J. Hill also described uncomfortable touching from Joe Biden.\n\nD.J. Hill: I felt, and my husband noticed, that Mr. Biden's hand that had been on my shoulder slowly disappeared and did a low or a slow descent down my back until he reached my waist.\n\nJS: Caitlyn Caruso met then-Vice President Biden at an event she was speaking at about her sexual assault.\n\nCaitlyn Caruso: I was invited to speak about my story of sexual assault, and afterward I was able to meet him and share my story. And during the encounter, he was a little uncomfortably physically affectionate. Left his hand on my thigh, maybe in an attempt to console me. But regardless, it crossed my boundaries and made me feel uncomfortable.\n\nJS: Now, other women have come forward also describing unwanted touching that has made them feel uncomfortable and unequal. And one accusation has gone even further, that of Tara Reade, the former Senate staffer who worked for Biden in the early 1990s. Reade says that she decided to reveal more details of her allegations against Biden when it became increasingly clear that he was not going to drop out of the presidential race.\n\nReade says she reached out to other media outlets, reporters, and politicians before January, but no one responded except, she says, Senator Elizabeth Warren's office, which she says recommended that she contact her local representative. Joining me now to discuss the details of Reade's case and what it means to have two leading presidential candidates facing numerous disturbing sexual harassment, misconduct, and assault allegations against them is Melissa Gira Grant, staff writer at the New Republic. Melissa has reported on gender, sexuality, politics, and justice for more than a decade. She's the author of \"Playing the Whore: The Work of Sex Work.\" Melissa Gira Grant, welcome to Intercepted.\n\nMGG: Thanks for having me, Jeremy.\n\nJS: Let's start with the current occupant of the White House, Donald Trump. We have at least two dozen women who have made allegations varying in seriousness against him, ranging from sexual harassment to outright rape. And we're going to be talking in detail also about the allegations against Joe Biden in a little bit, but first, lay out what we understand about Trump and his relationship with women, particularly women who have accused him of sexual harassment, assault, rape.\n\nMGG: I think the troubling theme with Trump is, unlike someone like Joe Biden and most people, to be honest, who are high profile and accused of some form of sexual assault or harassment, he seems to not be troubled all that much by the allegations, to put it mildly. Right? Particularly something like the Access Hollywood tape -\n\nDJT: I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know, I'm automatically attracted to beautiful - I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet.\n\n[Billy Bush laughs.]\n\nDJT: Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.\n\nBilly Bush: Whatever you want.\n\nDJT: Grab 'em by the pussy. You can do anything.\n\nMGG: There's a way that it sort of fits, I think, into his larger sort of delusions of grandeur. I'm not saying he wears it as a badge of honor, but he doesn't sort of follow the playbook - like the Harvey Weinstein playbook or others. There's some denial. But I think on the other hand, there's a level at which he thinks that this just adds to his sort of macho, dealmaking, \"I can do whatever I want\" relationship to politics, right?\n\nJS: Coming out of the era of Bill Clinton, people still talk about the \"Lewinsky scandal,\" but of course, Bill Clinton was accused of very serious crimes by Juanita Broaddrick.\n\nJuanita Broaddrick: It was not consensual.\n\nLisa Myers: You're saying that Bill Clinton sexually assaulted you, that he raped you?\n\nJuanita Broaddrick: Yes.\n\nJS: And by Paula Jones.\n\nPaula Jones: I'll just put it this way, that he presented himself to me in a very unprofessional manner. And I would call it sexual harassment.\n\nJS: Yet it's still, \"Oh, it was the Lewinsky scandal, and what it was about was a consensual relationship. Yes, he was the president. But let's be honest, it was consensual,\" when the reality is the most serious allegations against Bill Clinton were those of assault. And then we have Donald Trump run for office with his scores of women who have made serious allegations against him.\n\nRachel Crooks: About 12 years ago, as a young receptionist in Trump Tower, I was forcibly kissed by Mr. Trump during our first introduction.\n\nJessica Leeds: He started to put his hand up my skirt. And that was the last time I wore a skirt traveling.\n\nKristin Anderson: And next thing I know there's a hand up my skirt.\n\nJill Harth: He just slipped his hand there, touching my private parts.\n\nSummer Zervos: He then grabbed my shoulder, and began to kiss me again very aggressively, and placed his hand on my breast. I pulled back and walked to another part of the room. He then walked up, grabbed my hand, and walked me into the bedroom.\n\nJS: He becomes president. Then we have Brett Kavanaugh nominated for a lifetime appointment at the Supreme Court. Dr. Christine Blasey Ford very bravely comes forward and tells her story.\n\nChristine Blasey Ford: I believed he was going to rape me. I tried to yell for help. When I did, Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me from yelling.\n\nJS: And she is utterly destroyed in the press by right-wing Republicans, primarily, and Democrats saying, \"Believe women #MeToo,\" and Kavanaugh then goes ahead and gets confirmed. And now we have this reality that Trump, who regularly denigrates and insults the women who have made allegations against him, praises Brett Kavanaugh as this great man who was maligned.\n\nDJT: He was totally guilty according to these very dishonest people, these - they're Democrats in all cases. There has never been anybody treated in the history of Congress as badly as Brett Kavanaugh. And he's an innocent man.\n\nJS: What does it say that we are living in a society where a Donald Trump can be president, given all these allegations, and Brett Kavanaugh can be a Supreme Court justice? Because this happened throughout U.S. history. What seems to be slightly different is that you have a more visible recognition that women are being assaulted by powerful men, and that there should be consequences, but it seems to be applied unevenly, to say the least.\n\nMGG: I would add, Trump also isn't just smearing his accusers, right? He's actually fighting them in court. So with the case of E. Jean Carroll, the former writer for Elle magazine, has a long career in media, who in a book, disclosed an experience she had with Donald Trump in a Bergdorf Goodman -\n\nJean Carroll: He pulled down my tights. And it was a fight. It was a - I want women to know that I did not stand there. I did not freeze. I was not paralyzed, which is a reaction that I could have had, because it's so shocking. No, I fought. And it was over very quickly. It was against my will 100 percent.\n\nMGG: She's actually trying to take him to court for this. She's trying to have DNA collected from him, so she can test it against the dress that she was wearing at the time, which she still has. This is somebody who seems untouchable. At least this court case is going forward, like, we will see what happens. I think it's hard enough to come forward with an allegation of sexual assault, and then to have it be against a president who uses his platform in this way, in this petty way, this way that also redirects even more harassment at you, is quite terrifying.\n\nAnd I think you kind of have to be maybe in this position of sort of influence, that this particular place in her career, have particularly high powered lawyers, like, supported by Time's Up. That's what E. Jean Carroll has to go against Trump with, and he's still fighting her ferociously. And a lot of the other women who've come forward with allegations against Trump don't have that. Maybe for many years, he thought that he could just prevail. I mean, there isn't that much in our politics that says, \"If you have a sexual assault or sexual harassment allegation against you, that's the end of your career.\"\n\nThis has happened sometimes. But I think Trump, particularly in the context of the Republican Party, isn't necessarily someone who's going to face the consequences for that. Kavanaugh turned us up to 11 with that kind of political environment. I don't think that it was necessarily a sharp turn towards a different kind of willingness to accept that you could have somebody who's sitting on the highest court who themselves is credibly accused of criminal acts - was accused under oath of this by his accuser. I think that that's just an intensification of this environment that, you know, some people call it rape culture. I prefer just to call it patriarchy.\n\nThere's absolutely nothing in our politics that says that men can't get away with this over and over again. And just as Trump is sort of an amplification of some of the worst things in our political history, I think with rape, it's very similar.\n\nJS: Let's talk specifically about what E. Jean Carroll has asserted. This was an incident that she writes about in her book, \"What Do We Need Men For?\" She was in this dressing room. These are her words: \"The moment the dressing room door is closed, he lunges at me, pushes me against the wall, hitting my head quite badly, and puts his mouth against my lips.\" She continues on, \"The next moment,  still wearing correct business attire - shirt, tie, suit jacket, overcoat - he opens the overcoat, unzips his pants, and, forcing his fingers around my private area, thrusts his penis halfway or completely - I'm not certain - inside me. It turns into a colossal struggle.\"\n\nJean Carroll has been destroyed also in the press. Donald Trump has led the kind of mocking and denigrating of her and the gaslighting of her.\n\nEJC: He shut the door and pushed me up against the wall, and bang, banged my head on the wall and kissed me. I just - it was so shocking.\n\nNancy Cordes: But in a new interview with The Hill newspaper, President Trump insists Carroll is totally lying. \"I don't know anything about her,\" adding, \"she's not my type.\"\n\nMGG: The thing that gets me about E. Jean Carroll's case as well is that, you know, she told people at the time, right? She says that she told actually two journalists, friends of hers. One was very clear with her and said, \"He raped you. Go to the police, we'll go together,\" which she doesn't do. Her second friend tells her, \"Tell no one. He has 200 lawyers, he'll bury you.\" That's how she remembers it. And they both confirmed those accounts to New York Magazine when they reprinted this part of her book.\n\nIt's not unusual that someone doesn't want to report to the police. You know, there are so many reasons not to do that. One, very few sexual assaults actually end up with anybody being held accountable in a court of law. An even smaller number may actually be incarcerated, if that's what you even want. For many women who are in a position of power like E. Jean Carroll, to report to the police means potentially becoming a target yourself, whether they're going to, you know, disbelieve you because of your past criminal record, whether they're going to profile you based on your race or your gender identity. If you fought back, they may charge you yourself.\n\nIt's absolutely 100 percent the norm to not immediately go to the police. And I think it's just as normal to not report at all. So we're really reliant on these contemporaneous accounts, as they're getting called, right - you know, telling your friends at the time what happened and having a friend who's willing to confirm it to a reporter later. E. Jean Carroll's case also shows us that you can be somebody who is a successful woman, you can be somebody who also is already public, and you can still deal with all of these smears and attacks. It's not enough to insulate you.\n\nJS: Now, on March 24, the Intercept's Ryan Grim published a story about how the organization Time's Up declined to support Tara Reade in her allegation against Joe Biden, saying that it could threaten their nonprofit status, since Biden is a presidential candidate. After Ryan Grim publishes this story about Time's Up, Katie Halper - host of a podcast called The Katie Halper Show and longtime progressive journalist - she publishes an interview with Tara Reade . And this is the first time that we've heard Tara Reade in her own words really describing the most serious allegations she's making against Joe Biden.\n\nTara Reade: It happened all at once. The gym bag, I don't know where it went. I handed it to him, it was gone. And then his hands were on me and underneath my clothes. And, um, yeah. And then he went - he went down my skirt, but then up inside it, and he penetrated me with his fingers. And um, I - he was kissing me at the same time and he was saying something to me. He said several things that - I can't remember everything he said, I remember a couple of things. I remember him saying first, like, as he was doing it, \"Do you want to go somewhere else?\" And then him saying to me when I pulled away, he got finished doing what he was doing, and I kind of just pulled back, and he said, he said, \"Come on, man. I heard you liked me.\"\n\nJS: I want to ask you about the way that this story evolved and the parts of it that Tara Reade chose to tell at different times. And in your experience as a woman but also as a journalist, is there anything about this that jumps out at you and says, \"this woman isn't credible, because she originally said this, but now she's saying that?\"\n\nMGG: I mean, I can speak both as a woman and as someone who's a survivor of sexual violence, and someone who's done a lot of reporting on sexual violence and spoken to a lot of survivors. There's nothing about the way that Tara Reade's story has come out - you know, in partial versions, at first, and now we know more, there might even be more that we don't know that she told friends over the years, maybe even not the whole story - I mean, none of this seems particularly like a red flag. If anything, it seems really normal for people who have had that experience to see somebody being treated that way for not presenting themselves as the kind of victim who it's most convenient for them to believe. It's very damaging.\n\nIt's troubling, the degree to which then this becomes interpreted in sort of the narrative about Tara Reade as, \"Well, #MeToo is failing. #MeToo is supposed to be about 'Believe women.' The Democrats are supposed to be about 'Believe women.'\" And believing women has always been conditional. Even for people who say, \"Believe women.\" I think it's incredibly difficult to acknowledge that only some women are afforded the benefit of belief. You know, Rose McGowan had this quote about Tara Reade in a profile of Tara Reade at BuzzFeed a couple of days ago, where she says, you know, she's being portrayed as a kook. She's not the perfect kind of J. Crew woman that people wanted her to be.  And that image just keeps coming back to me. You know, she's not putting on the particular kind of class signals that someone like Christine Blasey Ford has the benefit of.\n\nWatching sort of the story of Tara Reade's allegations become larger than these very serious allegations didn't surprise me, but it's no less upsetting to see that Tara Reade herself has sort of been erased from the story, even as she's been sort of sensationalized, right? That's still not her. You aren't your worst Medium posts. You aren't your worst political take. Inconveniently, a survivor of sexual assault is not defined by their sexual assault alone. They're a whole person. And to have this kind of standard where, if your politics are temporarily inconvenient, that you're not going to be afforded belief - that sends a very dangerous message to any survivor of violence or anyone thinking of coming forward.\n\nJS: As we understand more about what Tara Reade is alleging, it's also relevant to look at the broader context of other allegations made against Joe Biden, which do not include, at this point, other allegations of rape. They do, however, include many allegations of unwanted physical touching, smelling hair, unwanted kisses. In fact, years ago, the Daily Show actually did a segment about the kind of notorious nature of the way Joe Biden seems to just be grabbing on women all the time.\n\nUnidentified news anchor: Biden left his hands on Stephanie Carter's shoulders for an estimated 28 seconds.\n\n[Laughter]\n\nJon Stewart: You seem tense. Is it the stress of me groping you for 28 straight seconds?\n\nJS: Break down how you see what we all know from what is out in public on video, but also, what some of these other women have said about Joe Biden's actions toward them and how it relates to the broader discourse right now about Joe Biden and Tara Reade.\n\nMGG: Before Tara Reade came forward, just looking at that history of Joe Biden's entitlement to women's bodies - I mean, that to me is the common factor there, whether it's somebody who's up in your personal space uninvited, or it's someone deliberately not picking up on your cues that, no, you don't want a hug right now, someone who's turning around on you that you're the problem here for saying that you're uncomfortable with this - like his defenders even sort of taking that posture of, you know, \"You misinterpreted what this was.\"\n\nAnd the bottom line with that kind of behavior is entitlement, both entitlement to someone's physical body, but then also entitlement to characterize what happened through whatever lens you have that allows you to continue that behavior. So that's the Joe Biden, I think, that we're coming into this moment with. And he's also politically someone who is more than happy to use women as a defense and has over the course of his political career, specifically with the Violence Against Women Act, which he falls on over, and over, and over again to defend himself -\n\nJB: Violence against women is a huge problem and especially right now. And Hillary and I have worked very hard on trying to end violence against women - wrote that legislation. And it's been one of the leading causes of my life.\n\nMGG: - as if somebody who supports women's rights and opposes gender-based violence couldn't also themselves act in this entitled way towards women or even commit sexual violence, which isn't true at all. But the fact that he's falling back on that kind of defense speaks to its own kind of entitlement, right? \"How dare you. I support women.\" To me, this doesn't actually lend anything to his credibility. If anything, it makes me only question it deeper.\n\nJS: For the entire duration of his time as the Democratic frontrunner and ultimately as the presumptive nominee, Biden never addressed these allegations directly. But they did send out his campaign talking points to Biden supporters and surrogates, directing them to say, on the one hand, \"I know Joe Biden, and that's completely inconsistent with what I know about Joe Biden,\" and on the other hand, to point to a New York Times piece that was done about Tara Reade's allegations against Joe Biden and to say that The New York Times looked into it and there was nothing there.\n\nStacey Abrams: I believe that women deserve to be heard, and I believe that they need to be listened to, but I also believe that those allegations have to be investigated by credible sources. The New York Times did a deep investigation, and they found that the accusation was not credible. I believe Joe Biden.\n\nJS: Before we talk about what Biden said on MSNBC when he finally was forced to address this, talk about the earlier actions of the Biden campaign to try to encourage people to discredit Reade by pointing to the New York Times or their own personal relationships with Joe Biden.\n\nMGG: I think we should say right up front that The New York Times disputes this characterization of their reporting, right? They don't say that there was nothing here. And if anything, only more reporting has come out. Even before Joe Biden appeared on MSNBC, we had the stories of two other women that Tara Reade told at the time, or a little after the time, and consistent stories of what happened to her. So even if it were just The New York Times, the Biden campaign clung to this idea that he had been exonerated both in the press and by his relationships, that, you know, he was his own best evidence, I guess, for being a stand-up guy.\n\nI don't understand, and I'm only made more depressed about the state of this, when I imagine what it would take for an adviser or someone working on the campaign to think that this is going to be their winning strategy. We're going to lean into his feminist bona fides. We're going to lean into \"but women support him.\" There was a lot of justifiable anger at the idea also that women, particularly women who might be vying for a position in a future Biden cabinet, or even as his VP, were then being asked about these allegations.\n\nAmy Klobuchar: I think this case has been investigated. I know the vice president as a major leader on domestic abuse. I worked with him on that.\n\nGretchen Whitmer: I know Joe Biden, and I've watched his defense and there's not a pattern that goes into this. And I think that for these reasons, I'm very comfortable that Joe Biden is who he says he is.\n\nMGG: I understand why they're being asked. You know, Biden himself was not responding to them. His campaign was responding with this \"look to women\" response. And it worked. I don't think that it was necessarily a case of sexism to have women be the ones who were being asked about this. I think sexual assault is sort of a gendered thing. And women are sort of looked to as, like, the experts or the people who are going to be best positioned to tell these stories - which is bizarre, because that's not how sexual assault works, but just in the way that the whole kind of issue is seen as feminized. I don't think that that was as exceptional as it was made. But it definitely showed that what the Biden campaign wanted to do, and sort of portraying him as a defender of women, portraying him as someone who women had positive relationships with - they got that wish even before he came forward himself.\n\nJS: Now on Friday, Joe Biden went on MSNBC's Morning Joe and host Mika Brzezinski asked Biden directly if he had sexually assaulted Reade. And here's what Joe Biden said.\n\nJB: No, it is not true. I'm saying unequivocally - It never, never happened. And it didn't. It never happened.\n\nMB: Do you remember her? Do you remember any types of complaints that she might have made?\n\nJB: I don't remember any type of complaint she may have made. It was 27 years ago. And I don't remember, nor does anyone else that I'm aware of. And the fact is that I don't remember. I don't remember any complaint ever having been made.\n\nJS: What is your reaction and response to that interview?\n\nMGG: It wasn't really adding anything new. I don't know if I expected Biden to put on a more convincing face all of a sudden, but I wasn't convinced by what I saw. It just raised more questions for me.\n\nJS: What I do think it did was it gave then his base and some of the most rabid people - who have been smearing Reade and using hashtags about her being a liar - now they can say, \"See, he has set the right tone by saying we must allow women's stories to be told and journalists to investigate it. But at the end of the day, it's a false allegation against me.\" And that's been the chief piece of \"evidence\" that has been latched onto. And what happened after that appearance on Biden is just an unreal ratcheting up of the attacks against Reade by Biden's supporters. For all the talk about toxicity in this campaign, my god - Reade had to cancel an interview because of death threats that she and other family members are enduring right now. And Biden has said nothing to his supporters to stop doing this at all.\n\nMGG: Particularly when that was another talking point during the campaign - right? - that you're responsible for the worst behaviors of your most ardent supporters. You know, it's troubling to me that only after Biden appeared, we start to hear from sort of the large mainstream women's organizations. You know, Women's March issues a statement. The president of PPFA - Planned Parenthood Federation of America - issues a statement. That this is sort of like waiting for the man to weigh in seems like sort of an unusual tack to take. And there was some reporting before Biden went on MSNBC that these groups and others were pressing him to come forward, they were going to issue some kind of open letter, and that the campaign actually was able to suppress that or temporarily redirect them.\n\nIt would have said a lot more, I think, if those organizations had come out beforehand, even if it was a statement that was not that different from what Biden said, right? \"We need to investigate these thoroughly. We support a woman's right to tell her story.\" The behavior of women's groups here, I think, should not be let off the hook either. It's very troubling to me that already, you're unwilling to hold this person accountable. I can understand entirely why women's organizations want anything but the current occupant of the White House to remain there, but you can \"both, and\" this, right? You can say, \"We deserve better than that. This is a dangerous president. And the way that Joe Biden is addressing these allegations is wrong.\"\n\nIt already for me sort of sets up a power dynamic that is just as troubling. Even if he manages to win, you know, who are sort of the credible voices for women's rights to hold him accountable, if all these large organizations have already said, \"Well, we're gonna stand by you. In fact, we're going to hold our fire when you ask us to?\"\n\nJS: You know, the DNC is rejecting calls for an independent investigation. On Sunday, Martha Raddatz of ABC's This Week asked the chair of the DNC, Tom Perez, why the DNC is not convening an independent panel to investigate Reade's allegations. And this is what Perez said.\n\nTom Perez: I'm very familiar with vice presidential vetting process. They look at everything about you. They looked at the entire history of Joe Biden - his entire career - and I'll tell you, if Barack Obama had any indication that there was an issue, Barack Obama would not have had him as his vice president. Barack Obama trusted Joe Biden. I trust Joe Biden.\n\nJS: What do you make of this particular line that has become, you know, ubiquitous - that Obama vetted Joe Biden, and none of this came up, therefore it must be totally false and timed to damage Joe Biden?\n\nMGG: Joe Biden can only be \"thoroughly vetted\" in this case if you also believe that any woman who he sexually harassed or sexually assaulted has also come forward with a complaint or some kind of evidence record that's available to you, right? And we know in the case of Tara Reade that there even was a little bit of a paper trail, as far as she's told us so far. It's a very convenient sort of way to also duck behind President Obama - right? And to say that this is somebody who got Obama's trust, so why isn't it good enough for you?\n\nWe already know that that's not the case, right,  that we've learned things about Biden since he would have been vetted by the Obama administration that are very troubling. And it's a mistake to sort of look for some sort of institutional stamp of approval on Joe Biden to say that he couldn't have done these things. Many, many people who've passed these vetting processes could have committed these behaviors. I just don't trust that everything that somebody may have in their past when it comes to sexual violence or sexual misconduct is so perfectly documented that it's available. It's just not true.\n\nJS: And also the list of people that would have to be lying about what Reade told them and when she told them is growing almost by the day. I mean, just the other day the Associated Press identified two additional sources that are going to remain nameless, who say that Reade told them elements of this assault story. You have her neighbor, she was on Democracy Now!.\n\nLynda LaCasse: He put her up against a wall, and he put his hand up her skirt, and he put his fingers inside her. And she was very distraught, and she was very upset, and she was crying.\n\nJS: That woman actually is a self-identified supporter of Joe Biden, who says she's going to vote for Biden. You had the Larry King Live tape that recently emerged from 1993, featuring a woman calling in from the very city that Tara Reade and her mother were living in.\n\nLarry King Live caller: My daughter has just left there after working for a prominent senator and could not get through with her problems at all. And the only thing she could have done was go to the press, and she chose not to do it out of respect for him.\n\nLarry King: So she had a story to tell, but out of respect for the person she worked for, she didn't tell it.\n\nLarry King Live caller: That's true.\n\nJS: Tara Reade says that that is definitely her mother talking about her situation with Joe Biden at the time. And then you have the fact that Joe Biden is a documented notorious liar himself. He has a long, documented history of lying. He had to withdraw from a presidential race earlier in his career for plagiarism and lying.\n\nConnie Chung: Democratic presidential candidate Joseph Biden today faces a controversy. Three weeks ago at a debate at the Iowa State Fair, he used phrases identical to those delivered by British Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock.\n\nJS: In this campaign, he has lied repeatedly about his involvement in the civil rights movement. We have a proven history of pathological lying on the part of a man who is denying that he assaulted this woman.\n\nMGG: Biden's track record of lying, also, you can hold that completely separate from Tara Reade, right? You can still not know what to make of Tara Reade's allegations, you can still be unsure and also not be, you know, living in some alternative universe where Biden has always told the truth. It is entirely understandable, not just among the press but among voters, to not know what to make of Tara Reade's allegations. However, she has at least six people that we know of, some of them named on the record, I think the majority named and on the record, who confirm all or parts of her account.\n\nThere is this sort of sense of, the more contemporaneous accounts that you can point to, the more people that you told about things at the time, that this is sort of one of the standards for developing credibility. And I'm not suggesting that there's, like, a perfect number of corroborating statements that you have to have before you can come forward as a survivor or victim and be believed. But I think Tara has met whatever that standard would be at this point and deserves to be taken seriously up against Biden's own track record of not always telling the truth.\n\nJS: You know, many people seem to be of the belief that this is the most consequential election of our lifetime. And I agree, Trump is a remarkably dangerous person to have in control of the various powers that come with the American presidency, and he's a complete dangerous authoritarian. How do you talk to people whose belief is, \"I don't know if Joe Biden assaulted her or not, I kind of don't even want to know. Because what if Trump remains president for four years?\" And like, \"What is the alternative right now?\" You know, I think a lot of people who are not malicious actors within the Democratic Party establishment are so overwhelmed, don't know what to believe, and just see this as, \"Oh my god, it's gonna keep Trump in power.\"\n\nMGG: All I can say is, just be honest with yourself if that's what your position is - that you would rather not be bothered with the complexity of dealing with an allegation of sexual violence against a powerful person who, like many powerful people, has denied it and has the people around him to protect him from that allegation. If you don't want to deal with that, you are not alone. And if you are turning away from a victim or survivor, when you yourself might profess to support women and believe women, be honest about what you're doing.\n\nI think that's really what's corrosive about this moment, is this idea that you can try to shred Tara Reade's credibility, and stick up for Joe Biden, and still say that you have any kind of commitment to ending sexual violence, that you have any kind of commitment to women's rights. I don't think you get to have it both ways. I'm not saying you have to believe Tara Reade to have that kind of commitment, and to be living your values, if your values are to support women and believe women, but I don't think that you get to pretend that that's not what you're doing.\n\nJS: What does it say to you that our choices in this election, in terms of the way that the two-party system functions, are between a man with two dozen allegations of varying degrees of seriousness, including rape - Donald Trump, who openly is attacking the women who have made allegations against him - and then Joe Biden, who also has allegations that range from unwanted touching, kissing, hair sniffing, rubbing, to in the case of Reade, rape - that this is the Democratic Party's offering in the era of Trump, and that on the ballot it's ultimately going to be a choice between Trump and Biden?\n\nMGG: What else can it say, but sexual violence, gender-based violence, sexual harassment is depressingly common in our culture? What else can you take away from that? You know, putting the presidency aside for a second and the ramifications of who the Democrats have put up, the fact that you could have two major candidates that we know this about speaks to, I think, how absolutely common this is for people. I don't know that that's new. It might be new that we know, right?\n\nAnd it's certainly disconcerting that these allegations are out there in public, very credible allegations are out there in public, some of this behavior is out there in public, right? Trump is on tape talking about these kinds of things. And yet, it doesn't seem to ding their reputation. And yet, it doesn't seem to dim their prospects for becoming the president of the United States. And it's a mindfuck. I want to appreciate how that feels and how uncomfortable that is. I think it's just, like, ripping something back about our culture and our politics and revealing it to us. I don't think it's necessarily new.\n\nJS: Melissa, I want to thank you very much for all of your excellent work, and I hope people pick up your book, and thank you so much for being with us on Intercepted.\n\nMGG: Thanks, Jeremy.\n\nJS: Melissa Gira Grant is a staff writer at The New Republic . She's reported on gender, sexuality, politics, and justice for more than a decade. She's also the author of \"Playing the Whore: The Work of Sex Work.\" You can find her on Twitter at @melissagira .\n\n[Music interlude.]\n\nJS: Before Joe Biden ever even entered the 2020 presidential race, he was embroiled in a national conversation around his, \"affectionate and physical style of politics.\" As we already discussed, eight women have come forward with stories about Biden's inappropriate touching of their bodies. The first, in late March of last year, was former Nevada Assemblywoman Lucy Flores. She published her story in The Cut , and it went viral, compelling more women to come forward.\n\nShe wrote about her deeply uncomfortable encounter with Biden as she campaigned for lieutenant governor of Nevada in 2014. Biden was at the time the sitting vice president of the United States. In an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, Flores said that for her, Biden's conduct that day was disqualifying.\n\nJake Tapper: Vice President Biden is widely expected to announce a run for president in the coming weeks. You say that that is why you decided to speak out now. Do you think that this is disqualifying for him?\n\nLucy Flores: For me, it's disqualifying. I think it's up to everybody else to make that decision.\n\nJS: Biden went on the defensive as more women started sharing similar stories that week. Non-apology qualifications and statements were issued from the Biden camp. Overall, Joe Biden seemed to either be completely ignoring the pain that the women were saying he had caused them, or wanting to shift the focus to how this is just how he is, and he's sorry that they were offended. In a video message posted to his Twitter account, Biden said this.\n\nJB: I worked my whole life to empower women. I've worked my whole life to prevent abuse. I've written a - and, and, so, the idea that I can't adjust to the fact that personal space is important, more important than it's ever been, is just not thinkable. I will, I will.\n\nJS: A month after Flores's story became public and seven more women had come forward, she fired back at Joe Biden in a New York Times op-ed that focused on the power of apology and why she believed Biden needed to atone for his actions. The essay was titled, \"Joe Biden and the Apologies That Weren't.\" In that piece, Flores wrote, quote, \"Most people acknowledge that men don't usually kiss, smell, rub noses with, place their hands on the thighs of, or touch foreheads with random women they don't know. Yet some men do, especially powerful men, who are protected by privilege and a crew of self-interested enablers who don't want to lose their access to power by calling out the obvious.\"\n\nFlores was one of three Latinas in 2010 to ever be elected to the state legislature in Nevada. After leaving elected office, she has gone on to launch a digital media brand called Luz Collective. She continues to be an advocate for women's rights, immigration reform, and criminal justice reform. And Lucy Flores joins me now.\n\nLucy, thank you very much for being with us on Intercepted.\n\nLF: Thank you for having me.\n\nJS: How was it that you came to meet Joe Biden?\n\nLF: I had actually met Joe Biden several times before the inappropriate interaction that we ended up having during my lieutenant governor race. We met various times on the campaign trail. I had already been elected, I was elected in 2010. Nationally, I was a very active surrogate for Obama. And so I was in many rooms together with him and had actually met him one-on-one. And I had never experienced anything abnormal. He was always very friendly. I actually think that that's a big reason why I was so shocked when he did interact with me in such an inappropriate way so many years later.\n\nJS: Talk about what happened that day when Biden came to your campaign event.\n\nLF: Well, it was a really busy campaign day just like any other. I was running statewide at that point, so it was just exhausting. You're running up and down a very large state. I remember very clearly that that morning, I was in northern Nevada and had to fly down to Las Vegas, I decided not to wash my hair because we were running behind, not ultimately thinking that later on, the vice president of the United States was going to be sticking his face in it.\n\nAnd we were just going about, as usual, just the chaos of a campaign. And we all met up in a holding room - again, something completely normal, very friendly, took pictures. And it wasn't until we were lined up, getting ready to go onstage behind the curtains, there were several hundred people waiting for us to give our speeches, when Joe Biden unexpectedly, from behind, puts his hands on my shoulders.\n\nAt that point, I'm thinking, \"OK, weird, but all right.\" You know, your mind just kind of starts racing at that point. And then I feel him come up close behind me, and that's when he leans in and he lingers around my head. I hear him kind of inhale. And then he proceeds to plant this low kiss on the top of my head. And of course, as I mentioned, I was mortified, because one: I just didn't understand what was happening. Two: I'm thinking, oh my god, my hair probably smells disgusting. And three: like, what is this man doing? I just could not comprehend what was happening, particularly because it was the vice president of the United States and you just don't know what to say. And so you don't say anything.\n\nI didn't move, I literally just kind of waited for - it felt like eternity - for my name to be called and just kind of wanted to - that was my only out at that point. And then you do what I often say women do. We just go about our business, and we do what we've got to do. I did mention it to my staff immediately after, because again, I was just so shocked. But at the same time, after you tell people, a few people, trusted people, there is no solution after that, you know? Who do you tell? Who do you complain to? Who do you say, \"By the way, someone really needs to tell the vice president to keep his hands to himself, and to stop making women feel uncomfortable?\" And so, you just - you go on.\n\nJS: Did you talk to the White House at all about this or the Obama administration?\n\nLF: Oh god, no. No, absolutely not. Are you kidding me? Like, one: you're an elected official. You are trained, you know, you are very much encouraged to be a good party soldier. You do not complain. You keep your mouth shut, and you do the business of the party. You would be labeled a troublemaker, people would probably not believe you. There's so many reasons why even if you felt like you wanted to say something to somebody - which at that point, who do you tell - the negatives associated with that are just too many.\n\nJS: Did you tell that story publicly at any point before 2019?\n\nLF: I had told just a handful of people. My staff - there was a couple of staff that knew and some very trusted friends who were also campaign supporters, I think like two. Over the years, I had probably told maybe just one or two more people, but for the most part, you really do keep these things to yourself. It wasn't until, of course, Joe Biden was considering running for president that there began to be much more attention paid to his entire record. And over the years, I had also noticed that there was all these pictures, and stories, and you know, Jon Stewart did a segment on creepy Uncle Joe.\n\nAnd to know what those women were experiencing and to see it treated like a joke - like it was just Uncle Joe being Joe, or you know, \"that's just him\" - was just completely and totally inappropriate to me. And I felt that it needed to be called out with the seriousness that it deserved.\n\nJS: Walk us through your emotional and thought process leading up to going public with your experience with Joe Biden.\n\nLF: Well, at that point, I had started to tell just a couple of individuals. I would see people, friends, colleagues that I knew that were starting to post about potentially supporting him. And because they were close friends, I would reach out personally and I would say, \"Hey, I just want you to know that this actually happened to me with him.\"\n\nAnd do we not care about the years of demonstrated evidence of him behaving inappropriately? Is that not a party value anymore? And I just felt like I wanted to get it off my chest, like I just wanted people to know. And at the same time, I knew that I couldn't keep telling that story to individuals over, and over, and over again, and that ultimately I had to make the decision - do I speak publicly, or forever hold your peace?\n\nAnd I felt like that was the decision, that if I did not speak at that moment, that there was not going to be another time for it. So I decided to just clear my conscience, and get it off my chest, and speak publicly about it, and hopefully, have folks treat that behavior seriously. And people did for a little bit, until, of course, his defenders came out and started to mischaracterize what I had said, question my motives. And then Joe Biden himself took it with a modicum of seriousness and decided he was going to start making fun about it the entire campaign trail.\n\nJS: What do you mean making fun about it?\n\nLF: It was only about, I think, a week or two afterwards that he started making jokes. He was cracking jokes during his appearances about how he had asked for permission, and he would joke, and you know, when he would shake someone's hand or give someone a side hug, that he had gotten consent, and just overall treating it like it was a joke.\n\nJB: I just want you to know, I had permission to hug Lonnie. I - we - we had permission.\n\n[Audience laughter.]\n\nBy the way, he gave me permission to touch him.\n\n[Audience laughter.]\n\nJS: Less than a week after your story about Joe Biden went public, Biden's people uploaded a video on Twitter addressing his behavior, and at that point, more women had come forward with similar stories of their interactions with Joe Biden. And his account tweeted a caption to the video that read, quote, \"Social norms are changing. I understand that, and I've heard what these women are saying. Politics to me has always been about making connections, but I will be more mindful about respecting personal space in the future. That's my responsibility and I will meet it.\"\n\nJB: But I'll always believe governing, quite frankly, life, for that matter, is about connecting, about connecting with people. That won't change. But I will be more mindful and respectful about people's personal space. And that's a good thing. That's a good thing.\n\nJS: What was your immediate reaction to that video message from Biden when it was published?\n\nLF: My immediate reaction was that, one: he did not apologize or admit to and recognize that he caused harm. To be very clear, this wasn't a friendly hug, as many, many people tried to - and I think some successfully have - changed the narrative into  that Biden is just a hugger, or this was just some friendly hug, or some socially acceptable touching, which we all do when we're in pictures, etc. That was not this. And to blame culture or to blame social norms I think was also a copout. This behavior has always been inappropriate. The only thing that has changed now is that women are feeling empowered to actually say something about it.\n\nJS: Did Joe Biden ever reach out to you directly and apologize to you?\n\nLF: No, nor do I expect him to, and I don't think anybody else should, either. It took him 20 or 30 years to reach out to Anita Hill, and even then, he didn't apologize, according to Anita Hill. Joe Biden does not do things unless he is absolutely pressured into doing the right thing. And he has shown that and demonstrated that time and time again.\n\nJS: You know, I also want to note that two days after Biden's people released that video responding to your story and a mounting number of stories of other women who described similar interactions with him, Biden was asked further about his behavior toward women that made them uncomfortable. And he told reporters, quote -\n\nJB: I'm sorry I didn't understand more. I'm not sorry for any of my intentions. I'm not sorry for anything that I have ever done. I've never been disrespectful intentionally to a man or a woman. You know, it's - that's not the reputation I had since I was in high school, for god's sake.\n\nJS: Your response to Biden saying at the time, \"I'm not sorry for anything that I have ever done.\"\n\nLF: It's just such a show of arrogance, and again, it's his M.O. This is what he's known for. He is not known for voluntarily or willingly acknowledging that he has made mistakes in the past, whether it's around his position on the Hyde Amendment, whether it was around how he mishandled the Clarence Thomas hearings, school busing and segregationist policies - I mean, the list is pretty long. And I think what's really important here is that ultimately, it is Joe Biden who is running for president and not anyone else. And if he loses in November because he has chosen not to address the breadth of issues pending before him, including these, this is on Joe Biden. This is on no one else for speaking their truths and for demanding more of our leaders.\n\nJS: What is it like for you as you watch the commentary from many, many Democrats, including powerful Democrats who are supporting Joe Biden? On the one hand, they are calling Tara Reade a liar and saying that they believe Joe Biden -\n\nNP: The fact that Joe Biden is Joe Biden - there's been statements from his campaign, or not his campaign, but his former employees who ran his offices and the rest, that there was never any record of this - there was never any record, and that nobody ever came forward or nobody came forward to say something about it apart from the principal involved. I am so proud. The happiest day for me this week was to support Joe Biden for president of the United States.\n\nJS: And on the other hand, they are addressing the allegations that you've made and the story that you have told about your interaction with Joe Biden and completely dismissing those, as you said earlier, sort of, \"That's Uncle Joe. He's acknowledged this. Most of the women have accepted his explanation for his touching, and sniffing, and all of these things.\"\n\nLF: It's simply not true, and most of them are unfortunately just playing party politics. And I get it. You know, this is a very difficult situation that all people are in, particularly survivors, and I don't consider myself a survivor. But there are many women right now who feel like they have a choice of impossibilities, and asking them to vote between these two men - someone who is clearly, very clearly terrible for women and who is probably a rapist and a sexual harasser in Donald Trump, and all of the various ways in which he has very seriously caused harm to women and so many others, and a man who potentially is a rapist, has caused some degree of harm to women, and is the only other choice.\n\nBut ultimately, those politicians are very much doing what politicians tend to do, which is try to explain away the obvious and in the process end up causing more harm than actually hurting. I think that's exactly what happened with the \"Believe women\" slogan, which should have never been a slogan. It should have been an actual conversation of what that means. And instead, too many people used it as a politically expedient way to push forward some sort of a political agenda.\n\nJS: I think that's something that gets lost in the discussion about Tara Reade's story is the context of what was happening at the time. Earlier you mentioned Anita Hill, and of course, Joe Biden was the chair of the Senate committee that was dealing with the Clarence Thomas nomination and was technically responsible for vetting him. And that was the political culture on Capitol Hill when Tara Reade started working for Joe Biden.\n\nLF: We're not going to find a smoking gun. That has really never been the case in any of these situations where women have come forward. It has literally taken decades. And so, you know, you do have to take these factors into consideration, and hopefully people do, and they do so in a fair and nonjudgmental way when they are taking into account Tara Reade's story and what that culture was like. That is absolutely a part of it.\n\nBut because we are still dealing with, so many years later, the way that women's stories are perceived, the way that they're treated, the way that they're used politically, whether it's embracing them when it serves your purpose or completely trying to sweep them under the rug when it doesn't, and dismissing them when it doesn't serve your political purpose, women are still political footballs. And our stories are not being treated with the seriousness that they deserve and the lack of judgment that should be present when we're considering these stories.\n\nThere's still too much conscious and unconscious bias. There's still too much perception of what a \"good victim\" looks like. There's just too much of it, and that is what I'm hoping that we can get to with this continued conversation about not just Joe Biden's behavior, but the culture in general.\n\nJS: When Biden did appear on Morning Joe on MSNBC when Mika Brzezinski interviewed him, the main thrust of that interview, beyond Biden's emphatic denials, was the notion that Tara Reade had filed some sort of a complaint against Biden. And Reade herself has consistently said that complaint did not lay out the extent of her allegations against Joe Biden. And she's indicated a sense of, if you speak out, you're going to get labeled in a certain way. But also, Tara Reade's story makes sense. And yet, it's being latched on to as a, \"Aha. She didn't say that Joe Biden raped her in a hallway. She didn't say he digitally penetrated her, therefore it must not have happened.\" And I'm wondering what it's been like for you to watch the attacks against Reade, and the way that they're parsing every single perceived inconsistency, or \"She didn't say this at the time, so therefore it didn't happen.\"\n\nLF: Every single thing that the commentators in general and Joe Biden defenders are doing and saying has been done against every single woman who has come out with her own personal story, including me. So I very much empathize with what she's going through, but this is just another reason - it's always just so fascinating to me, you know, the hypocrisies that are revealed daily, the ridiculous, asinine question, \"Why didn't you say something at the time?\"\n\nClearly the answer is, \"Because this is exactly what I didn't want to happen to me. Everything that is happening to me right now, I wanted to not have happened to me.\" And we have to just keep remembering that every single time a woman comes out with her story and is treated in this way dissuades another survivor, another person who has been disrespected, and slighted, and wronged, and all the ways in which women just have to endure every day from using their voice from speaking out.\n\nI was a very young girl when Anita Hill was going through her treatment. I had no concept of what any of that even meant until I was much, much older, of course, and had to learn what it was about. But growing up witnessing that - why would any woman ever want to voluntarily subject themselves to that kind of treatment?\n\nJS: Now, there was a recent poll done. Twenty-six percent of Democrats, including 40 percent of those under the age of 45, say that the party should select a different nominee. And this poll was taken after people were shown part of Joe Biden's interview on MSNBC. So just to repeat, 26 percent of Democrats say the party should select a different nominee, 40 percent of Democrats under the age of 45.\n\nWhere do you fall on that question of if Joe Biden should be replaced by another Democrat on the ticket?\n\nLF: I want to get Trump out of the White House as much as anybody else, more than most people. I worry in how difficult that's going to be with having the choice between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. I don't know what a process would look like to choose another nominee. I don't even know if there is a process. The DNC clearly is working against this. The New York Times editorial board called for some sort of an independent investigation, and the DNC's response was to call that notion \"absurd.\"\n\nThey're grasping onto anything that they can to avoid any kind of a formal - deeper-dive - investigation. And so it's very clear that the Democratic Party is going to do everything possible to avoid any semblance of the Democratic delegates wanting to potentially choose anyone else.\n\nJS: Well, and then obviously we have Donald Trump in the White House, who based on his allegations - I mean, he appears from the stories of all of these women to be a serial sexual predator who openly brags about his ability to sexually assault women. And the notion that the response to this man, on a policy level but also on a personal level, is Joe Biden, just feels like a major slap in the face to women, that this is the offering from the Democratic Party establishment in the age of Trump.\n\nLF: I absolutely agree with that. It does feel so deeply insulting. And that's why I worry so much about what type of decision women are faced with. I do worry that many women are not going to feel compelled to vote at all. And four more years of Trump is just not anything that I even want to think about, yet here we are.\n\nJS: Well, Lucy Flores, I want to thank you very much for the work - we didn't even talk about the broader work that you do on immigration, on social justice, on civil liberties, civil rights. We'll save that for another time. But I thank you so much for your bravery, your temerity and your willingness to speak out especially in the environment that we are operating in right now. And thanks so much for being with us on Intercepted.\n\nLF: Well, I certainly appreciate you providing the platform. It's an important conversation.

      "text": "The Real Danger of ABC News Settling Its Lawsuit With Donald Trump\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe big news outlets used to say settlements would encourage more lawsuits. Trump is already targeting smaller newspapers.\n\nOver the weekend, ABC News shocked the media establishment by agreeing to pay Donald Trump $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit that the president-elect filed against the network and its anchor George Stephanopoulos. On Monday, Trump announced that he plans to target another news outlet, this time, a much smaller, local newspaper: the Des Moines Register in Iowa.\n\nTrump said he plans to sue the daily newspaper, with a staff of around 50 journalists, and political pollster Ann Selzer. He attacked the Register and Selzer for publishing a poll several days before the election that showed Vice President Kamala Harris defeating Trump in Iowa by 3 percentage points. Trump would go on to win Iowa by 13 points and has since said the paper published a \"fake\" poll.\n\n\"I'm not doing this because I want to,\" Trump said during a Monday press conference, announcing the potential lawsuit. \"I'm doing this because I feel I have an obligation to.\"\n\nLegal attacks, such as defamation suits, are nothing new for news organizations. Lawsuits by the rich and powerful, however, are not as common as one might think - and that's because they often don't work.\n\nThanks to precedents that largely favor journalists in cases against the powerful, many outlets defend their coverage, fighting the case in court, even at the cost of the organization's finances. With ABC News bowing out of its own legal fight against Trump, however, media and legal experts worry Trump and other powerful individuals are now emboldened to retaliate against smaller, more vulnerable news outlets for critical coverage.\n\n\"When they settle, not only are they putting a target on their back, they're putting a target on the backs of smaller outlets that don't have those kinds of legal resources,\" said Seth Stern , an attorney and director of advocacy at Freedom of the Press Foundation. \"ABC will write a $15 million check tomorrow and can write another one in six months and they'll be alright. Others don't have that luxury. So it's unfortunate that the message was sent that the media can be bullied.\"\n\nUnlike ABC, smaller publications and individual journalists are not always equipped with an in-house legal team. Even if allegations are eventually dismissed or if publications prevail in court, legal fees can prove costly. An operation like Disney-owned ABC News has more financial flexibility to fight such cases. Despite dips in advertising revenue going to TV news networks in recent years, ABC News still raked in nearly $150 million in ad revenue in 2022, according to the Pew Research Center. And legal experts also felt ABC News had a winnable case.\n\nTrump's main contention in the lawsuit, filed in March, was over Stephanopoulos mentioning on air that Trump had been found \"liable for\" raping writer E. Jean Carroll. A lawsuit instead found Trump civilly liable for sexual assault. Thanks to the First Amendment and other protections for  news organizations, ABC had a strong defense.\n\nStern himself defended a newspaper in Chicago against a similar accusation. In 2014, a Northwestern University professor accused of sexually assaulting a student took exception to a newspaper headline that described the allegations as \"rape\" and sued the paper. A judge threw out the lawsuit, ruling that the words \"rape\" and \"sexual assault\" are interchangeable, according to the Chicago Daily Law Bulletin .\n\nBecause the ABC case had many protections on its side, the decision to settle left room for speculation that the broadcaster and Disney were not owning up to a journalistic mistake, but may have instead wanted to get on \"Trump's good side ahead of Trump's presidency,\" said Adam Winkler, a professor in constitutional law at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law.\n\n\"This shows that some media outlets are willing to settle defamation cases if they think it's better for their bottom line,\" Winkler said.\n\nCompanies would usually fight such cases to protect their credibility and ability to report in the future, Winkler said. The ABC settlement incentivized others to make similar legal attacks.\n\nHe said, \"Traditionally these companies don't want to settle these kinds of cases precisely for fear of encouraging other people to sue them.\"\n\nOriginal reporting.

In October, Trump filed a false advertising lawsuit against CBS News alleging that the network doctored a \"60 Minutes\" segment to make Harris appear more favorable in her comments. The suit, filed in Texas, seeks $10 billion in damages.\n\nIn another lawsuit filed in 2022, Trump accused the Pulitzer Board of defamation for defending its decisions to award the New York Times and Washington Post for their reporting on the 2016 Trump campaign's ties to Russia. The case is ongoing.\n\nDuring his previous term, Trump has also shown a willingness to attack journalists in other ways, including using the Department of Justice to surveil reporters.\n\nFor media advocates like Stern, the concern of similar defamation lawsuits being filed are much larger than Trump. Even before the ABC settlement, he noted an increase in defamation suits that are intended to silence critics. He pointed to an increasingly hostile environment toward media outlets in which more swaths of the public wouldn't push back on a wealthy individual suing an outlet. And then there's the overall suffering economics of the news industry.\n\nHe's hopeful a new bipartisan bill recently introduced in Congress can protect against some of the fallout, specifically for news publications and journalists.\n\n\"These papers and news outlets are easy marks these days because everyone knows they're struggling,\" Stern said. \"The news industry, local news in particular, is in a pretty grim state financially. Millionaires years ago might have said, 'Well, I've got millions, but so does the newspaper, I don't really want to go to work with that.'\"\n\n\"Now,\" Stern said, \"it's a bit different - they're making a different calculation. They're saying, 'I've got far more money to throw around then this struggling news outlet does, so let me take a swing at them and see what happens.'\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "How Many Indictments Does It Take to Bring Down a Cult Leader?\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nDonald Trump's latest charges are just the beginning of his legal woes, but Republicans are standing by their man.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump greets supporters at a Team Trump volunteer leadership training event held at the Grimes Community Complex on June 1, 2023, in Grimes, Iowa. Photo:Scott Olson/Getty Images The Republican Party has devolved into a cult of personality, where every new piece of evidence of their leader's criminality becomes another reason for his followers to defend him. Donald Trump has now been indicted twice in just over two months, in separate cases involving accusations of unrelated crimes. Both times, Republicans have rallied around him. The group of whiners and weaklings who are running against Trump for next year's Republican presidential nomination are so intimidated by his hold on the party's base that they are afraid to publicly tell the truth, which is that Trump is a thug who should be in prison instead of the White House.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump greets supporters at a Team Trump volunteer leadership training event held at the Grimes Community Complex on June 1, 2023, in Grimes, Iowa.\n\nHow many indictments will it take to wake Republicans from their fever dream?\n\nTrump was indicted in April on New York state charges in connection with campaign finance violations involving hush money payments to a former porn star; his most recent charges, in an indictment released Friday, involve his efforts to keep and hide classified documents after his presidency.\n\nAnd yet, this is just the beginning of Trump's legal woes. The most serious criminal investigations of Trump that are now underway have not yet led to charges - but that could soon change. Trump faces the very real possibility that he will be indicted at least two more times this year, in cases related to his efforts to illegally overturn the 2020 presidential election. In Georgia, he could be charged later this summer for his efforts to change the outcome of the presidential election in the state, which Joe Biden won. A separate federal investigation is underway into Trump's role in the January 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol and his broader efforts to overturn the presidential election.\n\nCriminal charges aren't Trump's only legal problems. The state of New York has filed a civil lawsuit against him - along with three of his children and his company, the Trump Organization - alleging that, for decades, they engaged in a wide range of fraudulent business practices.\n\nIn addition, Trump has just lost another civil lawsuit in New York brought by E. Jean Carroll, a writer who alleged that Trump raped her in a department store in 1996, and then defamed her when he denied the accusation. In May, a jury awarded Carroll $5 million in damages; she has since asked a judge to amend her lawsuit so she can seek further damages after Trump made statements during a CNN broadcast in May that she says defamed her once again.\n\nWhile he was in office, of course, Trump was also the first president ever to be impeached twice by the House of Representatives, in two separate cases. In December 2019, the House voted in favor of two articles of impeachment, charging Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress in connection with his efforts to blackmail Ukrainian officials by withholding U.S. military aid to get them to falsely accuse Biden of corruption. At the time, Trump saw Biden as his most formidable Democratic opponent in the upcoming 2020 election, and he believed that an announcement of a criminal investigation of Biden in Ukraine would damage his rival's candidacy.\n\nTrump was impeached a second time in January 2021, just as he was leaving office, in a case in which the House charged Trump with \"incitement of insurrection\" for urging his supporters to march on the U.S. Capitol, which led to the January 6 riot.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nNone of those legal matters involve the true OG of Trump cases: what has gone down in history as the Mueller investigation. From 2017 until 2019, former FBI Director Robert Mueller led a special counsel inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election in order to help Trump win, probing whether Trump or any of his campaign aides or allies collaborated with the Russians. The inquiry found multiple connections between Trump allies and Russian officials and intelligence agents, while also uncovering strong evidence of obstruction of justice by Trump , who was seeking to impede Mueller's inquiry.\n\nMueller did not issue criminal charges against Trump, but he made it clear that Trump could have been charged with obstruction if he had not been the sitting president at the time. In his final report, Mueller pointed to a Justice Department guideline against federal indictments of sitting presidents, strongly suggesting that was the only reason he didn't charge Trump with obstruction. He later told Congress that a president could be charged with obstruction of justice after he left office, but the Biden administration has not revived those charges.\n\nNone of the legal cases address Trump's unrelenting racist demagoguery, his mentally unbalanced embrace of conspiracy theories, or his casual use of lies and disinformation to defend himself and attack his enemies. In 2021, the Washington Post's fact-checking team concluded that Trump had made 30,573 false or misleading claims over the four years of his presidency.\n\nWill four criminal indictments, a wide-ranging civil fraud case, a civil sexual abuse and defamation verdict, two impeachments, a stalled obstruction of justice case, and 30,573 lies be enough to wake up Republicans?\n\nDuring the early days of his 2016 presidential campaign, after he began to attract huge crowds of zealous supporters, Trump famously said that \"I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose voters.\"\n\nHe is currently testing that theory. So far, the Republican Party is proving him right.\n\nWAIT!

Trump wants to keep us that way: a Tommy-like catatonic nation on the perpetual edge of a psychological breakdown.\n\nTrump's most dangerous traits are his utter shamelessness and his pathological ability to employ the Big Lie - the autocrat's weapon. He constantly repeats lies and conspiracy theories, leading the docile press and attention-addled public to talk about them, and thus distracting Americans from his scandalous and possibly criminal actions . He has based his entire presidency on conspiracy theories, flummoxing the mainstream press that has dutifully tried to cover him like a normal president. The most hopeless journalists in Washington are the \"fact-checkers\" who count Trump's lies, when it is obvious that nearly everything that comes out of his mouth is a lie. Margaret Sullivan, a media critic for the Washington Post, wrote this month that \"the defining media story of this era is mainstream journalism's refusal to deny Trump a giant megaphone whenever he holds out his hand.\"\n\nThe most hopeless journalists in Washington are the \"fact-checkers\" who count Trump's lies, when nearly everything that comes out of his mouth is a lie.\n\nIn the era of social media when no one remembers what happened five minutes ago, let alone five months ago, it is sometimes difficult to realize just how brutal the Trump years have been. It may be jarring to remember, for instance, that Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives just 10 months ago.\n\nBut we don't need to find a Dorian Gray-like portrait hidden away in a White House closet to be reminded of Trump's viciousness and ugliness. Step away from Twitter and Instagram for a moment, and look back at a few key episodes from just the last year of his presidency, and it becomes obvious how he has poisoned virtually everything he has touched, in both domestic policy and national security.\n\nNothing Trump has done has been worse than his total abdication of leadership and responsibility during the Covid-19 pandemic . His refusal to take the threat seriously, particularly his aggressive opposition to masks , has led to a new pandemic-era stereotype: the white Trump supporter at Costco who refuses to wear a mask and punches the clerk who asks him to leave.\n\nTrump has turned a simple piece of cloth designed to insulate from a global pandemic into the latest symbol in a roiling culture war. He has damaged the credibility of the once-world-leading Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, placing it in the hands of a director who has faced mounting calls to stand up to political interference.\n\nRobert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, speaks while holding up documents during a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 16, 2020.\n\nInstead, CDC Director Robert Redfield has continued to cave to the White House; he angered CDC personnel and outside experts by giving what amounted to a hall pass for Vice President Mike Pence, clearing him to go to this month's vice presidential debate with Kamala Harris, despite the fact that the White House had become a Covid-19 hot spot. On Monday, the Government Accountability Office, a congressional watchdog, said it will investigate complaints that the Trump administration has been politicizing both the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nTrump's lackey, Mike Pompeo, backs the president's claim that Covid-19 is a Chinese plot ; Trump gets Roland Freisler - sorry, I meant to say William Barr - to threaten lawsuits against state governors for their efforts to curb the virus. Trump takes an Eva Perón turn on the White House balcony, dramatically ripping off his mask to emphasize, once again, that he only thinks about his own twisted, grotesque image.\n\nTo hide the truth about his pandemic failures, Trump has also gone after the watchdogs assigned to keep his administration accountable for its handling of the pandemic. In April, Glenn Fine, the acting inspector general of the Pentagon, was stripped of his leading role on the panel established to monitor the $2 trillion in coronavirus relief passed by Congress. Christi Grimm, the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services, was fired in May after issuing a report that highlighted widespread shortages of testing and protective gear in hospitals dealing with the pandemic.\n\nBecause Trump has refused to deal responsibly with Covid-19, Americans are treated like pestilential beasts by the rest of the world, barred from traveling to Canada or most of Europe. A U.S. passport, once the envy of the world, is now the mark of a plague-carrier.\n\nRacism was one of Trump's calling cards during the 2016 campaign, and his racist appeals have only deepened since he was elected. He has gleefully responded to this year's historic social justice movement with hateful rhetoric, calling out to his racist supporters in front of the entire nation during the first presidential debate when he proclaimed : \"Proud Boys, stand back and stand by.\"\n\nAbove all, Trump has responded to the Black Lives Matter protests with a war against social justice, against Blue America, against Democratic cities and states - a strategy designed to please aging white voters in rural Florida and Pennsylvania watching it all on Fox News. He sent militarized agents from the Department of Homeland Security, his new secret police, to anonymously snatch and grab protesters he called \"thugs\" off the streets of Portland - a move designed not to quell protests but to generate further unrest, so he could exploit it again during the campaign. He had Homeland Security agents spy on protesters in 15 cities with drones, copters and airplanes; had Barr tell prosecutors to use sedition charges against protesters; had Barr threaten to prosecute Seattle's mayor for not cracking down on protesters as viciously as the president wanted; designated New York, Seattle, and Portland \" anarchy jurisdictions \" because of social justice protests and threatened to withhold federal funds from those cities.\n\nImmigrants rights advocates hold a demonstration outside the LA Federal Detention Center on Aug. 26, 2020.\n\nTrump has complained that removing statues of traitorous Confederates from cities and towns across the South is an attack on \"heritage\" and vowed to block any effort to change the Confederate names of U.S. military bases. He is now engaged in a last-minute, preelection effort to undermine voting rights and Black political power by having Republican Party lawyers file lawsuits seeking to block expanded voting procedures in the midst of the pandemic, and he has put a political crony in charge of the U.S. Postal Service to try to slow down mail delivery in a perverted attempt to make voting by mail more cumbersome.\n\nCruelty has been the point of Trump's ruthless immigration crackdown, separating undocumented asylum-seeking parents from their young children and stuffing the children into cages in migrant detention centers. The Trump administration has continued its brutal immigration policies during this year's pandemic; government contractors have demanded that migrants and their children eat cups of ice to try to fool the temperature checks they must pass before they can board deportation flights. Trump now threatens \"sanctuary cities\" by warning he won't give them coronavirus-related aid if they continue to limit cooperation between local police and federal immigration agents.\n\nThe chronic headache of Donald Trump's presidency has been the conclusive evidence that Russia intervened in the 2016 presidential campaign to help him win, and that Trump and his campaign did all they could to collaborate with Moscow. He sought out more foreign meddling for the 2020 campaign, when he tried to pressure Ukrainian officials to fabricate false evidence against Joe Biden; his corrupt actions on Ukraine finally led to his impeachment in the House.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nTo distract from these hard truths, Trump and his minions have advanced many lies. They have labeled the entire Trump-Russia investigation a hoax; claimed that the president has been the victim of a \"witch hunt\" led by special counsel Robert Mueller; claimed that a mythical \"deep state\" is out to get him; pushed sick conspiracy theories, including that a murdered Democratic staffer, rather than Russian intelligence, was responsible for the hack of Democratic emails and documents; and peddled the audacious lie that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that intervened in the 2016 election, and that the intervention was meant to help Hillary Clinton, not Trump.\n\nTheir latest falsehood once again involves Biden, Ukraine, and a laptop mysteriously discovered in a computer repair shop and passed to the New York Post, thanks to Trump crony Rudy Giuliani. The New York Post story was so rancid that at least one reporter refused to put his byline on it. The U.S. intelligence community had previously warned t he White House that Giuliani has been the target of a Russian intelligence operation to disseminate disinformation about Biden, and the FBI has been investigating whether the strange story about the Biden laptop is part of a Russian disinformation campaign . This week, a group of former intelligence officials issued a letter saying that the Giuliani laptop story has the classic trademarks of Russian disinformation. (I separated the truth from Trump's lies about Biden and the Ukraine in a piece last year.)\n\nA video clip of U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland plays during a House Judiciary Committee impeachment inquiry hearing at the Longworth House Office Building on Dec. 4, 2019, in Washington, D.C.\n\nWhile Trump foments conspiracy theories, he fires anyone who tries to tell the truth. In February, immediately after he was acquitted in his impeachment trial by the Republican Senate, the president fired Gordon Sondland, ambassador to the European Union, and Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a staffer on the National Security Council. Both had testified against Trump in the impeachment proceedings in the House. Vindman, who later retired from the Army, was the victim of \"a campaign of bullying, intimidation, and retaliation,\" by the president, Vindman's lawyer stated.\n\nIn April, Trump also fired Michael Atkinson, the inspector general for the intelligence community who told Congress that an anonymous CIA whistleblower had filed a complaint about Trump and Ukraine. Atkinson's warning helped trigger the impeachment proceedings. Like a Soviet dissident on his way to the gulag, Atkinson issued a last-minute plea to whistleblowers in the intelligence community not to give up hope in the face of Trump's Stalinist purges: \"Please do not allow recent events to silence your voices.\"\n\nSteve Linick, the State Department's inspector general, was fired in May while investigating allegations that Secretary of State Pompeo and his wife had asked State Department personnel to run personal errands; he was also probing how Trump unlawfully declared an \"emergency\" to bypass congressional approval for arms sales to Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe only government investigations Trump wants are those of his enemies, so he was happy that the Justice Department inspector general launched an inquiry into the FBI's investigation of his links to Russia - but furious when the inspector general concluded last December that, despite some errors in the investigation, the FBI had sufficient reason to open the original probe and that FBI officials acted without political bias. To placate the president, Barr had to spin the report's findings to try to make it look more damning than it was.\n\nBarr also arranged for John Durham, a malleable federal prosecutor, to conduct a special investigation of the intelligence community's handling of the Trump Russia case. Durham will reportedly not release his findings before the election, almost certainly because he didn't find much that would excite Trump's base. (Another Barr special investigation designed to go after Trump's enemies - into whether Obama administration officials wrongfully \"unmasked\" the identities of Americans in intelligence reports - has just been abandoned .)\n\nAfter it became clear that Durham would not issue a report before the election, Trump predictably ranted that Barr has failed to arrest Barack Obama and Joe Biden. But the president has apparently forgotten how much Barr has already done to go after his enemies while protecting him and his friends. One of Barr's most blatant actions to protect Trump came in September, in the case of E. Jean Carroll, who has sued Trump for defamation for publicly denying that he sexually assaulted her in a New York department story in the 1990s. Barr moved to block her defamation case, mounting the absurd argument that Trump was acting in his official role as president and head of the government when he said he didn't assault Carroll, adding that \" she's not my type .\" That move would allow the Justice Department to substitute the government as the defendant in the case instead of Trump, thereby blocking Carroll's lawsuit.\n\nIn fact, Barr has turned a blind eye to so much corruption and criminality by Trump and his circle that the New York state attorney general's office has effectively taken the place of the absent Justice Department.\n\nLetitia James, New York's attorney general, speaks during a news conference in New York on Aug. 6, 2020.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James - now the closest thing the country has to a real United States attorney general - filed a lawsuit in August accusing top officials of the National Rifle Association of raiding the group's funds in a decadeslong pattern of fraud, draining $64 million from the nonprofit in just three years. She is also investigating the Trump Organization, reportedly for improperly inflating the value of its holdings.\n\nStill, the actions of Trump's acolytes are sometimes so blatant that it is hard even for federal prosecutors to ignore them completely. In August, Steve Bannon, Trump's former chief strategist and one of his most visible henchmen during his 2016 campaign and the early days of his presidency, was arrested on a Chinese billionaire's yacht and charged with ripping off millions of dollars from donors in an online fundraising scheme supposedly designed to build a wall on the Mexican border.\n\nWhile it would be cleansing to get rid of Donald Trump and his cronies, it will not be enough. Regardless of whether Trump wins reelection, the rot at the heart of the Republican Party - particularly its deep-seated racism - is not going away anytime soon. With or without Trump, America is in for a generation-long death match between the supporters of white identity in what is left of the Republican Party and supporters of a more diverse society, primarily Democrats.\n\nUsing the Supreme Court, the Senate, and the Electoral College, Trump and the Republican Party are trying to build defenses against changing demographics. Those mechanisms allow the party that controls the right states to retain power, even if that party does not represent a national majority. The Republican Party's objective is the political hegemony that comes from the strategic control of key states; it helps explain Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee's recent tweet, in which he noted that \" we're not a democracy .\"\n\nThese are the same tools that the southern slavocracy used in the 1850s to try to stop the rising political power of the Northern and Midwestern majority that was starting to turn against slavery. It was the Supreme Court ruling in the Dred Scott case in 1857 that led to enormous frustration in the North.\n\nBut it also led to the rise of Abraham Lincoln.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren't on the beat?\n\nThe kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable.

      "text": "Nancy Pelosi Has Chosen Her War, and It's With Her Own Party's Future\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nIt is time for liberals and leftists who lambast Mitch McConnell to admit to themselves that the hippie-punching Pelosi has become a Trump enabler too.\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi answers questions during her weekly press conference at the U.S. Capitol on June 27, 2019, in Washington, D.C.\n\nThey call themselves the \" Squad .\" From climate change to student debt to migrants in detention , progressive House Democrats Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, and Ayanna Pressley have been energetic and outspoken since getting elected last November - and, as a result, have become inured to constant attacks from congressional Republicans and, of course, Fox News .\n\nBut how about from their own boss?\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times' Maureen Dowd, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dismissed the Squad as \"four people\" who have their \"public whatever and their Twitter world\" but don't \"have any following.\"\n\nOuch. This isn't the first time Pelosi has trolled the left-wing quartet. In April, when she was asked by Lesley Stahl on \"60 Minutes\" to comment on the newly emboldened progressive wing of her party, Pelosi responded : \"That's like five people.\"\n\nRead our Complete Coverage All the President's Crimes\n\nRead our Complete Coverage\n\nIn the wake of November's midterms, Pelosi mocked calls from AOC and her allies for a Green New Deal: \"The green dream or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is, but they're for it right?\"\n\nTo be clear: None of these freshmen Democrats have personally attacked Pelosi, and all four of them backed her bid for the speakership. As CNN's Nathan McDermott tweeted , \"It is pretty notable that the most vocally anti-Pelosi Democrats (ala the moderates in swing districts who opposed her leadership) don't get as much criticism from her as the left-wing of the party.\"\n\nHow about Donald Trump? Pelosi is willing to criticize Trump - \"I've never encountered, thought about, seen within the realm of my experiences as a child or an adult, anybody like this\" - but only criticize. Nothing more. Not impeachment, that's for sure. The top Democrat in the House told Dowd that the president has engaged in criminal behavior but - wait for it - \"you can't impeach everybody.\"\n\nThe New York Times interview is yet another reminder for liberals and leftists that if they want to oppose Trump, they have to oppose Pelosi too.\n\nThink I'm exaggerating? Consider three recent - and shameful - episodes.\n\nFirst, the rape allegations against the president. On June 21, New York magazine published a cover story from the famed advice columnist and writer E. Jean Carroll, in which she documented in excruciating detail how Trump, back in the mid-1990s, forced \"his penis halfway\" inside of her in the midst of a \"colossal struggle\" in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room.\n\nPelosi's response to a reporter who asked her for comment a whole six days later? \"I don't know the person making the accusation ... I haven't paid that much attention to it.\"\n\nHere's Nancy Pelosi verbally shrugging in response to a question about what she thinks Congress should do about a credible rape accusation against the president. Not great. pic.twitter.com/NPoEUB3jgg\n\n- Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) June 27, 2019\n\nNow, she tells Dowd: \"I respect the case she has but I don't see any role for Congress.\"\n\nThe sitting Republican president has been credibly accused of having committed a sexual assault and yet Congress, says the Democratic speaker of the House, has no \"role\" in holding him to account for it. Oh, and the speaker herself hasn't been paying \"attention to it.\"\n\nThis, my dear liberals, is your (feminist) champion.\n\nSecond, the crisis at the border. One of the reasons Pelosi cited for not being familiar with the E. Jean Carroll story was that she was \"busy worrying about children not being in their mothers' arms.\" Yet on that same day, as the New York Times reported, Pelosi \"capitulated to Republicans and Democratic moderates and dropped her insistence on stronger protections for migrant children in overcrowded border shelters\" by signing onto a bill from the Republican-led Senate, giving the Trump administration $4.6 billion to tackle the situation on the southern border.\n\nLast time I checked, though, this administration's horrific decision to separate migrant children from their parents had nothing to do with a lack of funds. \"The cruelty is the point,\" as the Atlantic's Adam Serwer so memorably put it. Plus, 18 so-called \"centrist\" Democrats pushed Pelosi into dropping her objections to the Senate bill and yet in her New York Times interview, the speaker decided to level her attack on - you guessed it - the Squad. They made themselves irrelevant and shouldn't have voted against \"our bill,\" she told Dowd, adding: \"They're four people and that's how many votes they got.\"\n\nYet they were far from alone in opposing Pelosi's decision. \"The final vote, 305 to 102,\" reported the Times on June 27, \"included far more Republicans in favor, 176, than Democrats, 129.\"\n\nMeanwhile, over at the border, children continue to be starved , women continue to drink out of toilet bowls , and men continue to be held in standing-room-only conditions. The Trump administration is now contemplating mass video proceedings for immigrants seeking asylum.\n\nThank you, Madam Speaker.\n\nI don't believe it was a good idea for Dems to blindly trust the Trump admin when so many kids have died in their custody. It's a huge mistake.\n\nThis admin also refuses to hand over docs to Congress on the whereabouts of families. People's lives are getting bargained, & for what? https://t.co/h7gP8Wous1\n\n- Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) July 7, 2019\n\nThird, Trump's tax returns. Last Tuesday, almost exactly six months after Democrats won control of the House, they finally took the president of the United States to court to try to force disclosure of his financial records. Trump administration officials and Trump's army of personal lawyers have offered a range of excuses for refusing to release these records - and for defying congressional subpoenas in the process. But as Slate's Mark Joseph Stern has noted , one in particular stands out from the rest.\n\nOn June 10, in an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Trump's lawyers contested the claim that the House's impeachment power could justify subpoenaing the president's financial records while gleefully pointing out to the judge that impeachment is not even on the table. They wrote in their brief :\n\nSpeaker Pelosi has steadfastly denied that the House's investigations are in any way related to impeachment. In March, she unequivocally told the Washington Post, 'I'm not for impeachment.' In late May, the Speaker reiterated that 'any suggestion that Democrats are planning to pursue impeachment 'simply isn't the truth.'\" After she received the district court's ruling in this case, the Speaker boasted that the Committee had prevailed despite \"the fact the House Democratic caucus is not on a path to impeachment.\" Just four days ago, the Speaker again told senior Democratic leaders that \"she isn't open to the idea\" of impeachment, and Chairman Cummings \"sided with Pelosi.\"\n\nIs it not a source of shame for rank-and-file Democrats, whether on the left or in the \"center,\" that Trump lawyers are citing Pelosi's refusal to impeach him as their defense in court? As their justification for ignoring congressional subpoenas?\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nMeanwhile, Pelosi herself continues to duck and dodge the arguments in favor of impeachment - even when she happens to be the one making them. \"The thing is that, he every day practically self-impeaches by obstructing justice and ignoring the subpoenas,\" she told the Times.\n\nSorry, what is she on about? I may not be a U.S. citizen yet, or speaker of the House of Representatives for that matter, but I have read the U.S. Constitution from beginning to end, and I have yet to come across the clause that refers to \"self-impeachment.\"\n\nSo forget the \"you-go-girl memes for literally clapping back at Trump\" that Dowd fawns over in her interview with the speaker. It is time for liberals and leftists who lambast Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to admit to themselves that the hippie-punching Pelosi has become a Trump enabler too.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "Donald Trump Is Out of Power - and Out of Luck\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe ex-president is finally fair game for an entire legion of lawyers.\n\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump departs after speaking at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla., on Nov. 15, 2022. Photo: Alon Skuy/AFP via Getty Images If politics were football, Donald Trump would be a JAG.\n\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump departs after speaking at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla., on Nov. 15, 2022.\n\nNFL fans know what that means: Trump is \"Just a Guy.\"\n\nIn professional football slang, being a JAG means that a player is average, nothing special. A JAG lacks game-changing talent and unique status. A JAG is not a star. If a JAG makes too many demands, he'll be kicked off the team and thrown out on the street.\n\nTrump is finally finding out that being a former president is not the same thing as being president. Both in the courts and in politics, it turns out that being a former president is a lot like being a JAG.\n\nFor four years, Trump used his special status as president to shield himself from criminal investigations and other legal actions. Trump's position was clearly a factor in the decision by Robert Mueller, the special counsel in the Trump-Russia case, not to bring charges against him. The nation's main recourse for holding Trump accountable while he was president was impeachment, and he became the first president in history to be impeached twice by the House of Representatives. But the Republican-controlled Senate failed to convict him each time, and so Trump came to believe that he was bulletproof.\n\nBut now that he is out of office, Trump is finally fair game for an entire legion of lawyers. The legal system grinds slowly, but nearly two years after Trump left the White House, a dizzying number of cases against him are finally ramping up, seemingly all at once. Prosecutors are having a field day with Trump. He is facing a legal perfect storm.\n\nTrump's status as \"just a guy\" was confirmed Tuesday by a jury in New York, when his real estate company was convicted of tax fraud and other crimes. The jury found the Trump Organization guilty of all 17 counts of financial crimes the company was facing. Donald Trump was not personally charged in the case, but prosecutors did say during the trial that he was complicit by \"explicitly sanctioning tax fraud.\"\n\nThe criminal prosecution against Trump's company came as he, his children, and their family business are also facing a civil case brought in September by the New York attorney general, charging them with fraud for radically overstating the value of company assets. If they are found guilty, Trump and his children could be barred from running businesses again in New York.\n\nThe New York criminal case against Trump's company now appears to be leading to a renewed effort by local prosecutors to investigate Trump personally. After Tuesday's verdict in the criminal case, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said that the case against Trump's company was just \" one chapter in the book ,\" and that his office's investigation of Trump is still underway.\n\nIn fact, the verdict came as Bragg was also reportedly gearing up to revive a long-stalled criminal investigation into Trump's secret hush-money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels. The money was designed to buy Daniels's silence during the 2016 presidential campaign about her erstwhile affair with Trump.\n\nSeparately, E. Jean Carroll, a writer who claims Trump raped her in the mid-1990s , also sued the ex-president in late November for battery and defamation in New York. She had originally sued Trump for defamation while he was president, after he claimed he hadn't assaulted her because she was \"not my type.\" That earlier lawsuit is still tied up in court over Trump's claims that he can't be sued for the comments because he was acting in his official capacity as president when he made them.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you.

A district judge ruled against Trump in February, saying that the three lawsuits, brought by police officers who were at the Capitol on January 6 and Democratic members of Congress, could proceed despite Trump's claims of presidential immunity for his speech.\n\nLast week, the Supreme Court showed that it also now considers Trump a JAG. The court sided with the Democratic-controlled House Ways and Means Committee, ruling that the panel had the right to obtain Trump's tax returns. The legal battle between Trump and the committee over his tax returns had gone on for years, beginning when he was president. But once he left office, he could no longer count on the support of the Justice and Treasury departments to shield his returns. Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., the New Jersey Democrat who chairs the Ways and Means subcommittee on oversight, noted that the Supreme Court ruling came after the panel had waited almost as long as it took to fight the Civil War.\n\nOn yet another front, an appeals court ruled in favor of the Justice Department and against Trump last week in the ongoing case involving his apparent theft of government documents . The appeals court overturned the decision by a lower court judge to create a so-called special master to review documents that the government took from Trump's Mar-a-Lago home during an FBI raid in August. The ruling clears the way for the newly appointed special counsel, Jack Smith , to finish the criminal investigation in the documents case. The legal maneuverings around the special master had slowed the case to a crawl over the last few months, but in its ruling, the appeals court made it clear that the lower-court judge had been wrong to give any special treatment to Trump in the way in which materials seized under a search warrant are handled.\n\nSmith, the new special counsel, has also been put in charge of the criminal investigation of Trump's role in trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election, and he has been busy on that front since taking over on November 18. Two of Trump's White House lawyers were forced to testify last week before a federal grand jury about their former boss's efforts to overturn the election; this week, meanwhile, Smith has sent grand jury subpoenas to officials in Michigan, Arizona, and Wisconsin, seeking any communications with Trump or his aides in connection with his efforts to overturn the 2020 vote. Smith seems to be intensifying the criminal probe of efforts by Trump and his allies to upend the results in key swing states so that he could win in the Electoral College.\n\nWhile Smith ramps up his investigation, the House January 6 Committee, which will effectively go out of business when Republicans take over the House in January, plans to make criminal referrals to the Justice Department based on its investigation, the committee's chair said Tuesday.\n\nSeparately, a Florida appeals court on Tuesday ordered Michael Flynn, Trump's national security adviser who later became a key figure in efforts to overturn the 2020 election , to testify as early as Thursday before a grand jury in Atlanta investigating Trump's efforts to overturn the election in Georgia. Flynn is expected to be one of the last witnesses before the Atlanta grand jury, which is a \"special purpose\" body and will not issue indictments; instead, it will recommend whether anyone should be prosecuted. The Georgia case, in which Trump may face charges of leading a conspiracy to send fake electors from Georgia to the Electoral College, may eventually pose a grave legal threat to the ex-president personally.\n\nAnother new verdict in a January 6-related case also is bad news for Trump. Stewart Rhodes, the leader of the far-right militia known as the Oath Keepers , was convicted last week of seditious conspiracy in connection with the Capitol insurrection. The verdict, showing that a jury believes there was a conspiracy behind the riot, raises the legal stakes for Trump and his lieutenants.\n\nTo once again try to shield himself from the legal tidal wave, Trump announced right after the midterm election in November that he was running for president again in 2024. But just as he no longer enjoys special legal status, his political power also seems to have ebbed. Almost all the major candidates Trump endorsed lost in the recent election, dragging Republicans down to one of the worst midterm performances in modern history for a party out of power. In a final insult on Tuesday, Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock defeated the Trump-anointed Republican, former football player Herschel Walker in the Georgia runoff election. Failure in the midterms has finally led more Republicans to call for an end to the party's addiction to Trump. (His rant last weekend demanding that the Constitution be suspended so he could be reinstalled as president apparently didn't help.)\n\nAs the year ends with Trump's JAG status confirmed, he can only console himself with right-wing dregs, like Elon Musk's laughable efforts to publish Hunter Biden's dick pics.\n\nWAIT!

On Wednesday evening, Donald Trump became the third president of the United States to be impeached. The House of Representatives voted 230-197 to charge Trump with abuse of power and 229-198 to charge him with obstruction of Congress.\n\nIt was a major moment in this car crash of a presidency - and a major achievement for House Democrats. Still, I couldn't help but be disappointed that there were only two articles of impeachment passed against the president. Two? That's it? Why were other Trumpian offenses not included? For context, it's worth recalling that there were a whopping 11 articles of impeachment passed against Andrew Johnson in 1868. With Richard Nixon in 1974, the House Judiciary Committee considered five articles of impeachment, before passing three of them. With Bill Clinton in 1998, the House of Representatives voted on four articles and approved two of them.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nAre we expected to believe that House Democrats really think Trump has only committed two impeachable offenses? Even the president himself seems to have been caught off guard by the Democrats' very narrow approach to impeachment. \"Frankly, I think he's a little surprised it's the Ukraine thing that's done it,\" a White House official told CNN .\n\nThe harsh reality, of course, is that Trump commits impeachable offenses on nearly a weekly basis. So here is an A to Z of such offenses - by issue and/or by crime - that were inexplicably overlooked or ignored by the House of Representatives.\n\nTrump has personally and repeatedly instructed the Postmaster General to double shipping rates for Amazon, in an attempt to inflict billions of dollars of new costs on founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post. \"Some administration officials,\" reported the Post in May 2018, \"say several of Trump's attacks aimed at Amazon have come in response to articles in The Post that he didn't like.\"\n\nThis is a president who has referred to African countries as \" shitholes ;\" to Mexicans as \" rapists ;\" to neo-Nazis as \" very fine people .\" To be clear: bigotry, racism, and white nationalism are impeachable offenses . Ask Andrew Johnson .\n\nIn the summer of 2017, Trump personally intervened to try and block a merger between AT&T and Time Warner - in order to try and punish CNN , which is owned by Time Warner, for its unfavorable coverage of him. Per the New Yorker , Trump told aides, \"I've been telling [then-National Economic Council Director Gary] Cohn to get this lawsuit filed and nothing's happened! I've mentioned it fifty times. And nothing's happened. I want to make sure it's filed. I want that deal blocked!\"\n\nOver the past 12 months, six migrant children aged between 2 and 16 - five from Guatemala and one from El Salvador - have died in federal custody. Over the previous 10 years, not a single migrant child died in custody. Is this not impeachable? It gets worse: As BuzzFeed News reported recently, \"Immigrants held in Immigration and Customs Enforcement jails around the U.S. received medical care so bad it resulted in two preventable surgeries ... and contributed to four deaths.\"\n\nFrom pitching his struggling Doral resort as a venue for the next G-7 summit , to making more than 400 lucrative visits to his own properties and businesses, to having Saudi royals bail out his underperforming hotels, Trump has been violating both the domestic and foreign emolument clauses of the Constitution from day one of his moneymaking presidency. His response to such criticisms? \" You people with this phony emoluments clause .\"\n\nThe president of the United States is a fraudster. Don't take my word for it. In November 2016, less than two weeks after he was elected, Trump settled three different fraud lawsuits related to his Trump University for $25 million. Earlier this month, as the New York Attorney General Letitia James formally announced , the president was \"forced to pay $2 million for misusing charitable funds for his own political gain,\" and his Trump Foundation was \"shut down for its misconduct.\" Trump isn't fit to run a university or a charity, so how is he fit to run the country?\n\nAs the New York Times reported in October 2018, the General Services Administration, which manages real estate for the federal government, had planned to turn the FBI's headquarters in Washington, D.C. \"over to a commercial developer\" - until, that is, the president intervened to veto the sale. As a group of Democratic lawmakers pointed out , Trump was \"'dead opposed' to the government selling the property, which would have allowed commercial developers to compete directly with the Trump Hotel\" only a block away. Is this not worthy of further investigation and, possibly, impeachment?\n\nWe know that Trump's former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, who is serving a three-year prison sentence for campaign finance violations, tax fraud, and bank fraud, made illegal hush money payments to two women - Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal - who claimed to have had affairs with Trump. We also know, thanks to federal prosecutors , that Cohen \"acted in coordination and at the direction of\" the president himself. How is this brazen violation of campaign finance laws not an impeachable offense?\n\nThe president is a threat to law and order. As New York magazine's Jonathan Chait has observed: \"On at least eight occasions, he has encouraged his supporters - including members of the armed forces - to attack his political opponents.\" In addition, a bevy of domestic terrorists arrested since 2016 have cited either Trump's name, his inflammatory rhetoric, or both.\n\nRead our Complete Coverage\n\nTrump demanded that his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, be granted a security clearance, despite objections from intelligence officials who warned that Kushner could be compromised by his business ties to foreign governments. The president may have the right to give anyone a security clearance and yet, as House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerrold Nadler explained in March, \"You can do things that are within your power that are abuses of power and that are crimes.\"\n\nThe Trump administration, as a matter of policy , separated more than 5,400 children - including babies and toddlers - from their migrant parents at the Mexico border. Hundreds of those kids were locked up in cages. This was a clear violation of international law, and experts with the United Nations' Human Rights Council also said the policy may have amounted to \"torture.\"\n\nTrump has told more than 15,000 falsehoods since coming to office. To quote presidential historian Douglas Brinkley: \"There is no president that lied as if they were a form of breathing, except Donald Trump.\" But lying isn't an impeachable offense, right? Wrong. The very first article of impeachment against Nixon accused him of \"making or causing to be made false or misleading public statements for the purpose of deceiving the people of the United States.\"\n\nTrump, as even Fox News host Chris Wallace observed last week, \"is engaged in the most direct, sustained assault on freedom of the press in our history.\" The president has asked the FBI to jail reporters who publish leaks, threatened to revoke the broadcast licenses of media organizations that criticize him, and relentlessly attacked and demonized journalists as \" scum ,\" \" slime ,\" \" sick people ,\" \" fake news ,\" and \" the enemy of the people .\" Members of the press have received death threats from people echoing the president's vile language.\n\nLocal officials in Puerto Rico have blamed presidential negligence and incompetence for the deaths of nearly 3,000 people in Puerto Rico, in the wake of Hurricane Maria in 2017. Trump's response? He falsely claimed that 3,000 Americans didn't die. He also tried to \"illegally withhold \" much-needed and congressionally appropriated disaster relief money. According to the Washington Post , Trump told White House officials that \"he did not want a single dollar going to Puerto Rico. ... Instead, he wanted more of the money to go to Texas and Florida.\"\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election identified 10 instances of possible obstruction of justice by the president. More than 1,000 former federal prosecutors agreed that Trump's conduct, had he been a private citizen, would have resulted \"in multiple felony charges for obstruction of justice.\"\n\nWe know Trump lies all the time - but how about the lies he tells under oath? The president told the Mueller inquiry: \"I do not recall discussing WikiLeaks with [former adviser Roger Stone], nor do I recall being aware of Mr. Stone having discussed WikiLeaks with individuals associated with my campaign.\" In November, however, his former deputy campaign manager, Rick Gates, said in court that Trump had been aware in advance of WikiLeaks' disclosures in 2016, based on his conversations with Stone. The response of conservative lawyer George Conway, husband of Kellyanne? \" Perjury .\"\n\nYou've heard of QAnon , right? The batshit crazy group of online conspiracy theorists obsessed with a deep-state plot against Trump? The president has retweeted QAnon supporters on multiple occasions; invited them to speak at his rallies; and hosted them at the White House. Why does this matter? The FBI has warned that QAnon will \"very likely\" drive extremists \"to carry out criminal or violent acts.\" So how is it OK for the president to endorse or promote such a dangerous group?\n\nTrump has not only been accused of sexual assault and harassment by dozens of women, but in June, the writer E. Jean Carroll also accused him of raping her in the dressing room of a luxury department store. \"I haven't paid much attention,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters, when asked to comment on Carroll's shocking claim. But why not? Shouldn't rape be an impeachable offense? \"I wish there had been a third Article of Impeachment against Donald Trump,\" Carroll tweeted last week. \"The Abuse Of Women.\"\n\nLess than three months after entering office, in April 2017, Trump launched airstrikes against Syria, without a vote in Congress. Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu, a former attorney in the Judge Advocate General Corps of the U.S. Air Force, called the strikes \" FRICKIN ILLEGAL .\" And remember: As former deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes has acknowledged , the lack of congressional authorization, and threat of impeachment from House Republicans, \"was a factor\" in the controversial decision by the Obama administration not to bomb Syria in 2013.\n\nIn October 2018, a blockbuster 13,000-word investigation by the New York Times found that Trump \"received at least $413 million in today's dollars from his father's real estate empire, much of it through tax dodges in the 1990s.\" What kind of dodges? \"He and his siblings set up a sham corporation to disguise millions of dollars in gifts from their parents. ... Records indicate that Mr. Trump helped his father take improper tax deductions worth millions more.\"\n\nRemember how Trump declared a fake \" national emergency \" in February to circumvent Congress and fund his border wall? Well, Trump himself bluntly admitted that there was no emergency or even urgency: \"I didn't need to do this. But I'd rather do it much faster.\" His critics , therefore, argue that the president acted \" ultra vires ,\" a Latin phrase meaning \"beyond the powers.\"\n\nThe Mueller report may have ruled out a criminal conspiracy between Trump and Vladimir Putin, but we know that Trump welcomed Russian help during the 2016 campaign and later suggested that he wasn't bothered by Moscow's interference in the election. We also know that Trump handed over classified intel to the Russians in the Oval Office. As Harvard law professor and former Bush administration official Jack Goldsmith co-wrote , \"Questions of criminality aside ... if the President gave this information away through carelessness or neglect, he has arguably breached his oath of office,\" and there is \"thus no reason why Congress couldn't consider a grotesque violation of the President's oath as a standalone basis for impeachment.\"\n\nIn January, Cohen announced that he was postponing his public congressional testimony because of \"ongoing threats against his family\" from the president and his attorney Rudy Giuliani. In November, Trump attacked former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch as she was testifying in front of the House Intelligence Committee, prompting committee Chair Adam Schiff to accuse the president of \"witness intimidation in real time.\" This is the behavior not of a president but of a mob boss.\n\nDeconstructed Podcast Mehdi Hasan unpacks the most consequential news of the week. Listen and subscribe.\n\nDeconstructed Podcast\n\nWhy is there no mention of the Chinese President Xi Jinping in either of the two articles of impeachment? Why only the Ukrainian president? If the Democrats' argument is that involving foreign governments in U.S. elections is an impeachable offense, as well as a threat to national security, then why stop at Ukraine? What about China? Listen to the president himself, speaking to reporters outside the White House in October: \"China should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine.\"\n\nIn Syria, Trump dropped bombs without congressional approval. In Yemen, the scene of the world's worst humanitarian crisis , Trump has helped Saudi Arabia to continue to drop bombs despite explicit opposition from both chambers of Congress. As an analyst in The Guardian argued , Trump's decision to veto a bipartisan bill calling for an end to U.S. military involvement in the Saudi air war amounted to \"flagrant defiance of the 1973 War Powers Act that checks a president's ability to engage in armed conflict without express consent of Congress.\"\n\nThe president of the United States didn't just abuse his power in attempting to pressure the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden; he tried to bribe him. Pelosi accused Trump of bribery and so, too, did the House Democrats' 169-page impeachment report . Yet, as Vox noted , \"When Democrats actually unveiled their articles of impeachment last week, bribery was MIA.\" Why?\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have?

      "text": "Dmitri Mehlhorn: The Man Financing a Political Counterrevolution\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nRyan Grim discusses political strategy with super PAC operative Dmitri Mehlhorn.\n\nThis week on Deconstructed, Ryan Grim is joined by Dmitri Mehlhorn, a tech executive who has emerged as one of the most powerful financiers in the Democratic Party and a strategist who often takes direct aim, with millions of dollars, at the party's left flank. He was in the news this week for helping finance E. Jean Carroll's defamation suit against Donald Trump. Mehlhorn and Grim discuss their competing views on political strategy, the best way to challenge Republicans, and the way forward for the party.\n\n[Deconstructed theme music.]\n\nRyan Grim: I'm Ryan Grim. Welcome back to Deconstructed.\n\nFirst, a big thank you to everybody who gave last week during our little pledge drive; very much appreciated. Today we're going to be talking about the future of the Democratic Party and competing ideas about how it ought to pitch itself to the country, what it should stand for, and how it can best stand up to Trump and the MAGA movement around him.\n\nNow, for that conversation, we're going to be joined by Dmitri Mehlhorn, who is a tech executive and an advisor to LinkedIn billionaire Reid Hoffman, but is also his own man in democratic politics, and is one of those people in Washington that is influential enough that, when he gets talked about, it's just by one name: Dmitri.\n\nDmitri Mehlhorn: [Laughs.]\n\nRG: Dmitri thinks this, or Dmitri is funding that, and, very often what Dmitri is funding, is aimed at undermining the party's left flank, in order to - in his belief - make the party a more viable challenger to Republicans. And so, I wanted to have Dmitri himself on, so we could hear straight from him what he thinks the party's approach should be in 2024.\n\nDmitri, welcome to Deconstructed.\n\nDM: Ryan, it's a pleasure. And just to make sure that nobody misses this: My sainted mother, who is in her eighties, loves Ryan Grim. And if given the opportunity to choose who's right, she will always choose Ryan Grim over her own son.\n\nRG: Well, anybody with a mother that is that wonderful can't be all bad, so I'm very glad to have you on. And I'll be sure to send this out in my newsletter to her, so she'll be getting a copy of it, no doubt.\n\nDM: Excellent.\n\nRG: And so, before we get into it, can you tell us a little bit about your background, and how you wound up at the center of democratic politics?\n\nDM: [Laughs.] I'm not sure I'm at the center of it. My background: my parents met at U.C. Berkeley. My mom was a great-granddaughter of Jewish immigrants who had come to New York to flee the pogroms of late-1800s Russia and Ukraine. And she shows up in Los Angeles at UCLA., gets her graduate degree at UC Berkeley, and meets my father, who is a non-Jewish German war refugee who was bombed out of his home before he turned two, who eventually made his way out to California. And even though his aunts and uncles were members of the Nazi party, and thus had some culpability in slaughtering the other half of my family, when they met in Berkeley, they fell in love, and they had a child: me.\n\nAnd because of that history and because of the way it was shared with me, I've been very alert my whole life to the potential threat of somebody like Trump. I believe his example is a very common phenomenon in human history. And so, when he came along in 2015, I became quite alarmed. At the time, I was an early-stage angel investor, investing in a variety of small technology and data startups. And I began working, to the extent that I could, to get others to share my fear about Mr. Trump. And when he actually won the election, I realized that I could not do anything else other than try to get him to not win another election. And when I say could not do anything else, I meant, literally, I've tried to concentrate on something else, I couldn't concentrate, because I had so much fear about what a second Trump term would do.\n\nSo, I became active in that, and through social networks was reengaged with my former college classmate, who I'd known lightly over the years - Reid Hoffman - who shared my views of Mr. Trump, but had a great deal - a great deal - more money to fight. And so, he and I partnered up, and we have been active in anti-fascist politics ever since.\n\nRG: I characterized your politics very briefly at the top of the show, but how would you, in your own words, describe the strategy that you are trying to get the Democratic Party to emulate?\n\nDM: Ah, so, as a strategic - The only thing that I am focused on is making sure that Mr. Trump does not get another term of office. I believe that would be a catastrophic event. And if there's anything else that gets in the way of that, I'm opposed to that other thing. So that's the broad background.\n\nIn terms of how I believe that Mr. Trump should be defeated, I believe that the extremism that he represents needs to be the center of the conversation. And the Democratic Party needs to organize and focus on the ways in which his vision differ[s] from what 90 percent of Americans want.\n\nRG: And to you, is this a momentary strategy to deal with an immediate threat? Or would you see this as kind of the basis for a political party to organize itself around?\n\nDM: The former. There are a lot of people who believe - and you see it a lot - that Trump is a symptom, and that if we over focus on him, we will ignore the underlying disease. We are strongly in disagreement with that perspective. He is the disease.\n\nRG: And so, how do you think about the role of center-left parties in other developed countries? If you look at Europe and elsewhere, you've seen the kind of Clintonian type of center-left coalition basically collapse. You know, the bottom has fallen out of the center-left, and a lot of the center-right in a lot of places around the world. What makes you confident that the center-left here in the United States would be strong enough to stand up to a fascist movement?\n\nDM: So, on its own, it's not; the organizing principle should not be center-left, although that happens to be a fairly good characterization of my personal politics. But, by the way, it's probably worthwhile - since politics is all personal - it's probably worthwhile taking a step back. It is not merely that I am anti-fascist. I am currently professionally anti-fascist, but that is not the only thing I care about politically. I also am an extreme libertarian.\n\nSo, for example, on the issue of abortion, I believe that the government's ability to tell you what to do, ends at your body. And so, if some government official has some point of view about what some cells are doing inside your body, there's nothing they can do about it until those cells leave your body, at which point, maybe they have some rights. So, for example, substantively on that issue, I'm pretty strongly libertarian.\n\nThe thing that got me most upset about Mr. Trump was his assault on truth, but it was also his racism, and his assault on immigrants. Personally, in my point of view, I would probably be as quote-unquote \"left\" as many of your listeners on issues such as immigration, and criminal justice reform, and abortion rights. My view is also that none of that really matters if there's a chance that someone like Trump can get a second term in office. Because, the difference is between, say, my more-strong view on that versus someone who's maybe more moderate on that pales in comparison to the position that Mr. Trump would take.\n\nSo, when we're talking about the center-left, the center-left is one of many, many groups that need to be united to prevent fascists from taking power.\n\nRG: OK. So then, are you concerned that the kind of war the center-left has been waging - somewhat successfully, I would say, against the left flank of the party - is then going to undermine the ability of the coalition to come together at election time? Or are you concerned about what that does to turnout or enthusiasm? And if not, why not?\n\nDM: Great questions. So, there's so much about - When you use the analogy of a war, so much ends up getting - and I'm not saying it's the wrong analogy - but there's so much that ends up getting lumped into that. So, for example, you start asking, \"Well, who started the war? Who's fighting? On what grounds are they fighting?\" And so, the thing that I believe is that everybody, from AOC to Liz Cheney, needs to be a part of the coalition to prevent Mr. Trump from taking office again. And so, if AOC is spending all of her time energy attacking Mr. Trump, then she's on my team.\n\nThe reason we invested in groups like the Mainstream Democrats, who elevated Shontel Brown over Nina Turner, is we believe that Nina Turner was actually training her fire on somebody other than Mr. Trump; specifically, Mr. Biden, who was actually the center of our team. So, our decision to start investing in groups like Mainstream Democrats is a relatively recent phenomenon, and it came up after the exposure of working with these groups.\n\nSo, beginning in 2017 and 2018, when we were experimenting with different approaches to defeating the Trumpist movement, we actually put considerable investments behind fairly aggressive leftist groups. We supported open Socialists, for example, in the 2017 Virginia House of Delegates races, and some of them won. And in the 2018 midterm, we supported Richard Ojeda and Krystal Ball and the People's House Project. We supported the Progressive Campaign Change Committee. We were major early backers of Indivisible. We put a lot of money into these groups that anchored what is now seen as the left because we didn't know, and frankly didn't care, so long as they were on the same side.\n\nWhat we observed through the evidence of watching different races and monitoring them is that the more extreme leftist position did worse in the elections. You know, going hard-left cost us about one or two percentage points, which is decisive in a lot of these races, number one. And number two, people on the left were extremely enthusiastic about taking the fight in terms of salience and issues, in a way that we found to be helpful to Mr. Trump and hurtful to Trump's enemies. So, that's why we have moved the way that we have.\n\nRG: What do you mean by \"taking the fight?\" Like, what were they doing? You mean, taking the fight to the Democratic Party establishment?\n\nDM: So, first of all, a huge movement occurred in 2020 around George Floyd, right? Oh, actually, I'll give you three examples and you can pick them apart. Defund the police, as a movement out of the George Floyd protests was one example. The term Latinx was a second example. And Medicare For All was a third example.\n\nIn our view, the evidence was very clear that these three things were politically toxic in a general election, and, the less said, the better. And there were significant parts of the Democratic Party that were urging those issues to be central, important, salient issues in the election, and the entirety of the Republican Party was enthusiastic about that as well. So, you have the left wing of the Democratic Party and the entirety of the Republican Party elevating these issues, because these are issues that will help Republicans defeat Democrats.\n\nAnd so, we realized that, since no one in the Democratic coalition was willing to stand up to our own side and say, \"Guys, this is not working,\" we had to play that role.\n\nRG: I think you would probably find broad agreement on the Latinx point, from kind of left to center at this point.\n\nDM: OK.\n\nRG: And I think - other than a handful of folks who brought the phrase \"defund the police\" into electoral politics - you'd probably find agreement across the democratic political spectrum on that, too. What would you say to the criticism that it was actually the party's center that said \"defund the police\" a hundred times more than the party's left flank? And I think that was particularly true in the 2022 New York elections, where you'd constantly have people like Sean Patrick Maloney or others attacking fellow Democrats for using the phrase \"defund the police\" back in 2020, long after that phrase itself had lost salience among activists.\n\nDM: Yeah. So, I'm glad you're asking the question that way. It's the right way to ask the question, and it creates a complicated answer. The basic answer is that elections are decided by swing voters and what they hear. And what swing voters hear: paid media, what politicians pay to say, and what activists say, and what politicians themselves say has some impact on that, but it's very light. Maybe one unit out of 20, somewhere between one unit out of 20 and one unit out of a hundred. So, something like 1 to 5 percent of what a swing voter hears comes actually from the activists.\n\nThe rest of it comes from this viral ecosystem, this earned media ecosystem, this free media ecosystem. Like, how does our national consciousness move? And it's shaped by a lot of actors, good and bad, and you cannot fully predict it. However, you can draw patterns about things that are likely to be issues. And it is a fair assumption that the republican salient issues in '20 and '22 and '24, the top five issues that they will be trying to make top of mind for swing voters, one of them will be crime. One of the top five, maybe even one of the top three.\n\nAnd on crime, what are they going to say? And what they're going to say is that there is a currently sitting member of the Democratic Party in the United States Congress, who openly and expressly advocates for the end of funding to police forces. And there are quite a number of other Democrats who are in power now - in administration positions and in Congress - who don't agree with that extreme position of, there should be no funding of the police, but when asked if they believe in defund the police, will give a complicated answer other than, \"No, we should fund the police.\"\n\nNow, my friend, Anat Shenker-Osorio, who's another person that we have funded in the past, will tell you that if we say the words \"fund the police,\" that's bad, because it's increasing the salience of an issue. And if you run a poll, real-time, and you ask people, \"Hey, nothing else is going on in the world, it's more than a year away from the next election. I'd like you to take a poll,\" and you drop in the phrase \"fund the police\" out of nowhere that will probably raise the salience of crime in that survey. And you'll read the poll and you'll say, \"Ah, saying the words 'fund the police' or attacking the defund the police movement from the center-left - attacking the left - those things actually reduce the poll results that you get in this survey, a year and a half away from election day.\"\n\nWhat we believe is that the three months leading up to Election Day, and Election Day, is a particularly salient moment where people think about things differently. And so, what you really need to know is, in the three months before an election, and especially on election day, would they ordinarily be thinking about crime, and will they be alert to the possibility that members of the Democratic Party wish to remove funding from the police? If you believe those things are inevitable, then once a significant critical mass of the Democratic Party starts saying \"defund the police,\" you actually have to inoculate yourself, and you have to make sure that you're on record saying, \"fund the police.\"\n\nAnd yes, there will be some short-term irritation around that - just like a vaccine will give you some symptoms - but, once you have those symptoms, when people are cued to understand that you wish to fund the police in normal context - and especially if they remember it, because it's an unusual story, because it's a man bites dog,  a Democrat going away from their own party - once you do that inoculation, you are less vulnerable than you would be if you just let that thing spread like wildfire.\n\nAnd you may be right that, today, most Democratic Party activists agree that defund the police is not worth promoting. Both during 2020, and even throughout 2021, into December of 2021, when you made the argument that Democrats should not do that, you would still get a lot of pushback, with a lot of good arguments, but it was not a consensus then.\n\nDoes that sort of answer it, Ryan?\n\nRG: Yeah. You think you hadn't beaten it back enough yet, so it was still worth fighting, is what you're trying to say.\n\nDM: What I would say is, we still haven't. Yeah, what I would say is that, in an ideal world, Joe Biden would've said the words \"fund the police\" more slowly, more loudly, more often. And had he done so, we would've done even better in '22 and '20. But the democratic left was - Immediately after he said those words in his State of the Union, for example, Anat Shenkar-Osorio - who's widely respected, for good reason, as a messaging expert - sharply criticized him for having done so. And again, her basic argument was, if you pull people outside of an election context, that kind of language doesn't help the way they talk about Democrats in the polls. And that's just, in our view, a deeply flawed way of understanding how politics works.\n\nRG: Well, it feels a little unfalsifiable, in the sense that the place where the strategy was tried the hardest was New York, where you had New York, Cuomo, ex-Cuomo Democrats really going after the left and DSA, and constantly saying that we're not going to be as bad as these other bad Democrats are on crime. You know, we're not going to defund the police, we're going to fund the police.\n\nAnd New York was the most underperforming state, it feels like, anywhere. And so, it feels unfalsifiable, in the sense that your argument seems to be, if we'd have just done it harder, you know, like, more \"defund cowbell\" would have gotten us there. And who knows? Like, I can't say yes or no to that, but I can say that it was tried there, didn't seem to work in New York.\n\nDM: Yeah. You're making a couple of points that are really important. The first point, which is really, really frustrating for Democrats, and it's because Democrats, broadly speaking, are the party of facts and science, and so we want to measure everything. And so, one of the reasons why Democrats lose elections is because we try to only operate in areas that can be falsified. We only look for our keys where the light is. And each election is a sui generis thing, and there's some things you can just know - like this many mail pieces is better than that many mail pieces - but big lane-changing stuff, each election is its own cycle, and you don't know.\n\nAnd in particular, defund the police as a national call, and how that worked nationally, it's hard to know how that played down in New York, etc. What I would say is that candidates that took an aggressive fund the police position in 2020 tended to win their races, like Vicente Gonzalez, Abby Spanberger, etc. Pretty much every one of those frontline members of Congress said, \"I was getting hit at every town hall with defund the police, I was getting slammed with defund the police all over the place. I was only able to eke out a victory by aggressively articulating a fund the police position.\" And that's what they say. And it could be wrong. It doesn't show up in, you know, Anat's polls, but that's what they say.\n\nIt's also like, if you're looking at New York as an example - you know, that's a multi-party primary with ranked choice voting - the fund the police answer won. I mean, Eric Adams is mayor.\n\nRG: Well, that may be the case that he won there. There were some bizarre scandals that knocked out his opponent.\n\n[Crosstalk.]\n\nDM: A hundred percent. Yeah, New York state in general...\n\nRG: And Brandon Johnson just won in Chicago. And Helen Gym might win in Philadelphia.\n\nDM: Yeah. But Chicago is not a ranked choice voting state, is it?\n\nRG: No, it is a runoff. Yeah.\n\nDM: And it was a Democratic primary, right? Or no?\n\nRG: Well, It's top two.\n\nDM: Oh, it's just top two.\n\nRG: Right.\n\nDM: OK. So that's fair enough. So that is an example where the fund the police versus the defund the police was tested. And yeah, the fund the police, in the Paul Vallas case, the fund the police position lost to Brandon Johnson. So you're right about that.\n\nRG: Let's go back to the abortion politics that you mentioned.\n\nDM: Yes.\n\nRG: You and I were emailing about this, and I was surprised to hear your position on how to run on Dobbs and Roe. And so, rather than me articulating it for you, how do you think Democrats ought to approach politics of abortion in 2024?\n\nDM: The same way that I think they should approach every salient issue, which is to point out that the Republican Party is absolutely controlled by a fringe that represents a position that is anathema to 90 percent of the country. The Republican Party cannot distance themselves from that position, they're deeply interlinked with that position. And therefore, those people should not be given the power to put that position into law.\n\nSpecifically in the case of reproductive health, politically, I would say, in general, you can just map out the country who agrees with what. There's about a third that's broadly pro-life, there's about a third that's broadly pro-choice, there's about a third that's kind of in the uncomfortable European middle, of like, some but not others, and that's kind of where we are as a country.\n\nAnd while Roe was law, the Republicans could basically run to gather the pro-life votes, and they could also appeal to that uncomfortable center. And they could even appeal to the pro-choice folks, because the pro-choice folks would know that Roe was a backstop. And so, if the pro-choice folks happened to agree with Republicans on some other issue, like economics, they could swallow the abortion thing because it wasn't real. That's what happened until Dobbs.\n\nOnce Dobbs happens, you have the ability to make the debate. Like, what is the part of the debate that the Republican Party cannot disavow? And in the Wisconsin race, what the Wisconsin Democrats did, and what Governor Evers did, and Ben Wikler did, is they focused, they locked in on - I think his name was Michels? Was that the Republican nominee?\n\nRG: Mm-hmm. Michels. Yeah.\n\nDM: Yeah. They locked into the Republican nominee, they got a mic in his face right after he won the nomination, and they made sure that they understood his point of view about the Wisconsin snapback law, which did not have exceptions for that sort of thing. And so, once Michels was immediately on record suggesting that minors should be forced to carry their rapist pregnancy to term, all of the ads were about that.\n\nDid you see the ad that won those awards in Wisconsin?\n\nRG: This is the Ben Wikler ad?\n\nDM: Well, I don't know if it's \"the Ben Wikler ad,\" because he obviously touches all of this Wisconsin stuff, but he was very active in making sure this ad happened, as did others, and we were active in making sure it got financial support. But the idea was, it was just a series of young girls, age 12, having fun, and then the voiceover changes and the atmospherics change when the discussion is, some of them will be raped, some of them will be impregnant, and Michels wants to force them to actually bear their rapists' children.\n\nAdvertisement voice over: A 12-year old girl can't legally drive a car. At 12, she can't even vote. But if this little girl were tragically raped or a victim of incest and became pregnant, radical Tim Michels would force her to deliver the baby.\n\nHe said, it's, \"Not unreasonable for the state government to mandate rape victims to give birth.\" Would it be unreasonable if he were forcing this on you? Let him know on election day.\n\nDM: That is the winning play. Because the thing about the Republicans now, we have some trouble standing up to our left. You know, I fund Shontel Brown, and a bunch of the left is like, \"Oh, how horrible.\" But we are able to have debates between the center and the left. On the right, that's not available. There is no one on the right that can disavow the pro-life extremists, which is why you get someone like Tudor Dixon in Michigan.\n\nI met. Governor Whitmer for the first time in 2019, and we all thought she had a good chance of losing. She cruised, and part of it was that she was running against someone who said that forcing a 14-year-old to bear her rapist child was a gift from God, and she couldn't disavow that. Abortion is a super salient issue. On average, one of these swing voters who might change their mind is going to be thinking about abortion as one of their top issues, and one of the two candidates is openly saying that they're going to force this young girl to bear her rapist child.\n\nThat's ballgame, and that's what we should be replicating. As long as the Republicans are harboring that kind of insanity, we should make sure they pay for it.\n\nRG: And to me, if you have an opponent who is saying something that is that insane, it only makes perfect sense to highlight the fact that they are saying that completely insane and extreme thing. I guess the question then is, what does that mean for what the Democrats are going to say that they're going to do when they get into office?\n\nBecause what's really struck me about the post-Dobbs moment is that you saw, almost for the first time, people surging into politics who had been disaffected in the past.That's kind of like the Bernie fever dream of politics that he, you know, he ran his campaigns on the idea that, by exciting disaffected voters with an agenda that is populist and popular, and is going to take on the elites, that you're going to bring people into politics that weren't involved in politics before.\n\nNow, that didn't really pan out for him, so that kind of theory collapsed. He actually did better in caucuses and other states where turnout was lower. AOC, you know, upset Joe Crowley in a race where, like, 25,000 people, or something, came out and voted, so it ended up being something of the opposite. But then, when you had the case of Dobbs, and people felt that participating in politics could materially improve their lives, could defend a right that was taken away - Which, in some ways, is what Sanders was trying to get them to do. It's to say, look, if you participate in politics, you will be able to materially improve your lives.\n\nI think he was not able to convince anybody. He was not able to convince enough people that their participation would actually improve their lives. But people seem to get it on their own after Dobbs. You know, with Democrats kind of flat on their back, you had the White House, even with six weeks heads up that the Supreme Court was going to overturn Roe, was still caught flatfooted when they finally did it. Yet voters in Kansas kind of surged to the polls. You saw voter registration among young people, among women, even among men, increasing at substantial rates. You saw huge turnout in Kansas, and a blowout victory for abortion rights advocates, in a race that people thought they might win, or might lose, thought it was going to be very close. Instead, it's a landslide.\n\nAnd then, in every other state where there was a chance that people's participation in politics would actually do something good when it came to abortion rights, you saw turnout surge, and you saw that position sweep, even if it was in Montana. You know, forget Kentucky, as you mentioned, Michigan.\n\nIn states where people didn't feel like abortion rights were under threat - say, like, New York - you didn't see the same surge in voter registration and voter turnout. So, should Democrats still say, we are going to codify Roe v. Wade, but they just should be quiet about it and focus on the extremism of Republicans? Because, if that's your position, maybe I'm comfortable with that. But, do you think that Democrats running on codifying Roe is a bad idea?\n\nDM: So, I think running on codifying Roe is a bad idea, and I think that the words you just said, when taken together, explain why.\n\nBasically, you said Bernie believed that you could turn a bunch of people out by getting them to believe that being involved in politics could make their life better, and that didn't really pan out for him. And you talked about other examples, and there are many, many others. And by the way, I was open to that idea, as I said. It turns out it's not true. You cannot get people to vote by getting them to believe that voting and participating will materially improve their lives. It does not work, ever. Ever.\n\nThere are occasions when the right kind of candidate can catalyze a social movement that then leads to turnout - like a Barack Obama case or maybe a Bill Clinton case - but, fundamentally, these guys are centrists. What you can get people to get really excited about is: if you participate in politics, you might be able to prevent something really bad from happening to you.\n\nSo, imagine you're the average voter, and you're saying, OK, there are three things you can choose to believe about politics, and adjust your behavior accordingly. One, politics can do nothing for you. Two, politics can make your life better. Three, politics can make your life worse. People will believe the third. They normally default to the first, but they will believe the third. Within a rounding error, for electorally viable purposes, nobody believed the second, other than Bernie and his staffers and, you know, some other folks. It doesn't work that way. I wish it did. It doesn't.\n\nThe conversation about, for example, immediately after Dobbs, if I had been the Senate majority leader, I would have put a series of votes on the floor forcing the Republicans to confront their own extremes. The very first one would've been, \"no minor should be forced by the state to carry her rapist pregnancy to term.\" The second would be, \"no adult should be penalized for helping a minor exercise their reproductive rights.\" The third could be, \"no woman of any age should be forced to carry her rapist's. And just keep on going.\"\n\nAnd this puts the Republicans in a terrible position, because you would not- Even the one about banning, just saying, nationally, \"no one in this country who's been raped, who's a minor, should be forced to carry her rapist pregnancy to term,\" even that one would not get a hundred votes. There would be a good solid 10, 15 votes on the far, far right of the caucus who would vote for that. Maybe more. And then they would have to explain that, and that would be the news.\n\nAnd the reason this is important, Ryan, is because politics does affect salience, and does affect news coverage. The specific issue of minors being impregnated, that happens in this country, in every state, all the time. Right now, every single state in this country has a woman, a girl, under 17, a minor, who is carrying a pregnancy that was put there by a rapist. Every state in this country. And the news doesn't cover it, normally, because it's background noise. It happens all the time, has happened for centuries, forever. The news will start covering it only if it becomes a salient issue, which it became after Dobbs. And once that becomes an issue, you have all of these Republican figures in media and politics explaining, \"Oh, that didn't really happen, that couldn't happen.\" And then, actually, yeah, it does happen. So, do you defend it or not?\n\nAnd when the Democrats were considering whether to do this kind of work on the Senate floor to expose the extremism in the Republican Party, they chose not to, because Democrats were concerned that Republicans would simply use this to de-extremize themselves. They would stand up and, you know, Adam Laxalt might say, \"Oh, I would vote for that Schumer bill,\" and therefore, Cortez Masto would not be able to use Dobbs against him. That was the theory.\n\nAnd what I think that misunderstands is, it just doesn't understand the way that politics has turned in the last few years. It is impossible, in my view, for Adam Laxalt, or any Republican, to disavow their extremists, because the extremists have become the critical part of their coalition. They control the state and local party, they cannot be disavowed. And so, if you go extreme, it's not that, suddenly, they're going to use your symbolic vote as a way to position themselves as moderates. They're going to be screwed, unless we decline to take the option, which we did.\n\nSo, instead, the bill that we put up for discussion was a bill that literally united every single Republican Senator in opposition - which was to codify Roe, with some other stuff - and they also got Joe Manchin. So, rather than a bill that would've been a 90 to 10 debacle that would have forced them to explain their extremists, it's like, oh yeah, both sides, the Democrats have a bunch of extreme positions on abortion as well. It's the worst possible choice.\n\nSo, to win elections, you don't codify Roe, you codify not-extreme. You force the vote the way that the Kansas ballot initiative was, force the vote on the extreme Republican position, and Democrats will win - like in Kansas - by substantial margins, and you'll have things like the Democratic Governor of Kansas winning reelection, because she made it about the Republican extremists.\n\nRG: But you had Warnock and Fetterman, both proud champions of abortion rights, of saying that they would codify Roe - or even beyond codify Roe, actually - if they got into the Senate. So, why do you think that that didn't hurt them? Or maybe my question is: Are you against them actually codifying Roe, if they take power and can eliminate the filibuster? Like, do you think that would be a political mistake, and that they're better off being able to kind of beat up Republicans with the issue?\n\nDM: Well, I want to really separate out two issues. One is, what should Democrats or anyone do in governance to make the country better and serve their constituents? Versus what is the way to win an election? Those are different things in my view.\n\nIf Democrats have a governing majority that allows them to do whatever they want on abortion, I still think you can get to codifying Roe, just get there in a series of steps. I guess I would put it this way, Ryan: when you're thinking about the aggregate epistemology of the country, and where we are going as a country- There's a new book out called \"Gradual\" that's very good. There's a book that came out not that long ago by David Graeber, who's now passed, \"The Dawn of Everything.\" And what you see is that human societies move very much in opposition to each other, people separate themselves from each other. And in a time of great uncertainty like this where the boundaries are all over the map, the way that you legislate effectively is you start by saying, \"OK, can we at least all agree on 'X' as a starting point?\" You start that way.\n\nAnd in the case of abortion, like, \"OK, can we at least agree that minors should not be forced to carry their rapist pregnancy to term? Good? We're all good with that. OK. How about this?\" And you just keep going. And where you end up might look a little bit like Roe, might be better than Roe. Might be a little worse, might be better in some ways, worse in others, but that's what you're trying to go to.\n\nRG: But, because Warnock and Fetterman won on as strong champions of abortion rights, the Senate now is controlled by a majority that is pro-codifying Roe. I guess I'm trying to figure out -\n\nDM: Step one is: Make it clear that, under federal law, any minor who has been impregnated - and therefore, truistically [sic], definitionally, is a rape survivor - any minor who is pregnant as a result of that rape should be given all the healthcare she needs to end that pregnancy if she needs and wants to, needs or wants to. And no adult should be prevented from helping her, or punished in any way for helping her do that.\n\nYou could start there, that doesn't preclude you from doing anything else. But why wouldn't you start there? Why wouldn't you just get the 90 votes, bank that, and then, how about, what's the next thing? This kind of steady approach of marginalizing the extremes will likely get you to the same place, legislatively. But in terms of the governing majority, remember, under the current rules, you need 60 votes. This is not going to go in through reconciliation.\n\nAnd you're not going to get 60 votes to just codify Roe. You know, it's just too complicated of a decision, it was too cumbersome and too mixed in its popularity. You're not going to get there. So, why not get what you can, protect the people you can, protect all those girls, every single state, rather than going for it all, and risking it all?\n\nAnd by the way, again, going for the first step of marginalizing and excluding the extremes, in my view, does not preclude then doing more. In fact, it makes it more likely.\n\nRG: So, to you, does the victory by Fetterman, and the victory by Warnock, and Ossoff, previously, who ran on pretty progressive platforms - Now, they didn't use the phrases \"Medicare For All,\" they didn't use the phrase, \"Green New Deal.\" Fetterman had previously supported Medicare For All, never denounced Medicare For All, but, if you looked at his new campaign site for 2022, Medicare for All wasn't on there. But the language was very similar.\n\nBut, up and down, these were not your 2012 or 2006 democratic Senate candidates - Blue Dogs, new Democrats - who were picking some Republican issues and picking some democratic issues, and portraying themselves as centrists. They were pretty unapologetic progressive candidates, and they won. Does that change how you think about what's possible in a winning coalition? Because there could be some type of compromise there, between the left and the center-left, that if Warnock and Fetterman are going to be the party-type candidates in purple States, the left wouldn't have a whole lot to complain about.\n\nDM: All right, well, there's a bunch bundled in there that's worth talking about, and I'll try to limit myself to the things that might be of greatest interest to you and your audience. First of all, issues themselves play a very, very small role in determining elections. If you are focused on winning an election, and you just want to win an election, for the purposes of math, you basically ignore the people who are going to vote anyway, on the Republican side and the Democratic side, and you focus yourself on the people who might vote either way.\n\nThese are the legendary swing voters. A more accurate way of describing them that's more precise is that they're partisan bystanders. So, negative partisanship is not so dominant in their thinking that it prevents them from switching between one major partner and the other. That's about 10 percent of the electorate. And then there's people who are marginal in their decision whether to vote or not. Whether it's the sort of rural non-college whites who were brought out by Karl Rove's 2004 anti-gay initiatives or college students who were brought out by enthusiasm for Barack Obama or whatever.\n\nYou know, those are the only issues. Those are the only groups that you care about winning elections. And frankly, if you care about Trump, you only care about those groups in swing states. Those groups don't care about political issues or policy issues. The random marginal voter who's making a decision about whether to vote for Mehmet Oz or John Fetterman - Like, if we were to take everybody whose votes were conditional, like people who voted who were thinking about maybe not doing, people who didn't vote - who thought about it, but decided not to - and people who decided their votes at the last minute, I would venture to guess that zero of them made the decision because of what Fetterman said on his website about abortion.\n\nIt was much more identitarian, much more, \"Do I basically trust this guy? Do I trust him enough to overcome my prior that all Democrats are evil? Do I trust...\" you know, etc., etc. In the Fetterman case, we seriously considered putting a lot of support behind Conor Lamb because we thought he'd be a stronger candidate against Mehmet Oz.\n\nRG: He was begging for it, publicly.\n\nDM: Oh yeah.\n\nRG: Begging for a super PAC intervention. Yeah.\n\nDM: Oh yeah. And basically, we decided that Fetterman's attributes outweighed his downsides, in our view. So, his attributes in this identitarian fight were that: He was tall, he had tattoos, he wore baggy shorts. He was a very physical candidate. If he hadn't had that stroke, I think he would have crushed Oz, because his physicality really impressed people.\n\nAnd if you looked at focus groups of swing voters in Pennsylvania and asked them about - including Republicans - and asked them about Fetterman versus Oz, Oz was from New Jersey, he was effete, he was college-educated, he was rich, he was Turkish. Fetterman was active, had tattoos, was relatable, was strong. That's what they cared about. Now, if Fetterman had instead taken the abortion position that I'd recommended, rather than the more aggressive one that he'd taken, would that have cost him any votes? In my view, probably not. Because there was no way that that was going to be the central issue for those voters.\n\nIn a race where you've got Oz, and Shapiro, and all these other folks going on, in Pennsylvania, the gift to Democrats in Pennsylvania was that the Republicans nominated Doug Mastriano. And in Michigan, it was that they nominated Tudor Dixon. And those people - by virtue of their extremism on many issues, including abortion - made the debate about abortion where it needed to be.\n\nRG: The risk, to me, about this kind of politics - I'm curious for your take on this - is that it then winds up electing a Democratic Party that doesn't do anything. Because, I mean, that's ultimately what I care about. Maybe I'm - well, I think polls show I clearly am in the minority - but what are we in this for, if we're not in it to make the country a better place?\n\nAnd so, if the issues don't matter one way or the other, why not at least have a robust agenda that you plan to accomplish? And then go ahead and beat up your opponent for being an extremist nut job who wants forced birth for 12-year-olds, but then, when in power, actually do things that people like.\n\nDM: So, a couple of things. There's two broad things about this. Well, actually, let me start with the more important point for the purposes of this conversation, which is winning elections. If the debate is fundamentally about, Mastriano is crazy and Oz is a carpetbagger, then, yeah, it doesn't really matter what your issues are. But If you add them up, it can be a lot, right?\n\nSo, maybe you get a little bit more progressive? It's not enough to break through. But the further and further you go down the progressive route, the greater the risk is that you open yourself up to an attack that actually loses you the election.\n\nSo, for example, one of the groups that we pay close attention to is the group of folks on the democratic side who monitor the efficacy of television advertisements, right? And they monitor it in the way that I was dismissing earlier, which is that you insert the television ad into an otherwise banal set of online engagement, and then you test whether the ad effectively changed people's views. So, you do an in-survey placement, you ask people at the beginning of the survey, you ask people at the end of the survey. In the best designed versions of this, you then follow those same people and ask them again a week later. And you do all that, and you try to say, like, OK, did this content move people? It's not perfect, because the salience is so different from the election, but it's one of the least bad things we have, so we do that.\n\nBased on that, the Republicans did something in 2022 that previously Democrats did. So, Democrats in 2016 ran a bunch of ads that made Democrats feel good, made democratic donors feel good. These were ads about how Trump was a dangerous jerk. And in retrospect, it appears pretty likely that those ads elected Trump, because the electorate wanted a dangerous jerk. And so, if we had taken the hundreds of millions of dollars we'd spent on those ads, and spent them instead on a big national party on something entirely different, Hillary Clinton would be president. Like, those ads elected Trump. And we did it because we were appealing to our own donors and activists, rather than really paying good attention to what the voters potentially wanted.\n\nThe Republicans appeared to have done the same thing in 2022. They ran on crime and the border - and a little bit on Chris Rufo identitarian stuff - but they ran on crime and the border, and wokeness and whatever. Our analysis - and by \"our,\" I don't mean just, you know, Team Dmitri, I mean the entire Democratic Party that has an operation assessing this stuff - showed that we were vulnerable on abortion. If the Republicans had spent more money explaining that they were not abortion extremists, then the post-Dobbs energy could have cost us a few of those seats. If Kari Lake had run those ads, she would be the governor, and we would be in a world of hurt because of it. But they didn't, because they believed crime was better, and it wasn't. But the more you go into places that it looks really likely that the place you are could actually lose you some votes, the bigger the risk is that you take.\n\nNow, going to the second point that you made that I think is quite important is: why get involved in politics? You want to do things. I would just say to you - and this is the point of the David Graeber book, about \"The Dawn of Everything\" - being not another thing can help you be a thing, right? If you are not the extremists, that has implications for governance, right?\n\nSo, just taking this specific example, there are women all over the country - girls all over the country - who are dealing with a pregnancy caused by a rape. And if you can get into office, and forcefully and unambiguously give them rights, you have done a good thing for them. Even if your motivation was to stop the extremists, that's good. And once you've done that - I mean, you know the whole girl effect thing that was at Nike - like, once you have enabled these girls to have a normal life rather than being saddled with that, all sorts of downstream positive effects happen.\n\nA similar example, by the way, we've talked a lot about abortion, but like, guns, right? There's a mainstream position on guns, there's a Democratic position on guns, there's a lot of positions on guns, but there is also a 90 percent position on guns, which is background checks. And you could imagine an entire campaign just around the first four words of the Second Amendment, a well-regulated militia means you don't put powerful weapons in the hands of people with severe mental illness. The only way you find that out is background checks. It's got 80-90 percent public support. That could be the issue, and if we pass that, it would be a good thing.\n\nNow, are there other things that might be good, like, you know, an assault weapons ban or whatever? Sure, sure. But it is still an objectively good thing to have background checks.\n\nSo, your point, that you want to get into office to do good things, I would just make the gradualist plea that stopping really bad things is part of doing good things.\n\nRG: I guess another way of making my point would be that we're not talking about any of this in a vacuum. You know, Trump didn't come from nowhere - although this gets back to your symptom-or-disease question - but if the country is coming apart at the seams, it feels like, at some point, you're going to run out of duct tape trying to keep it together. And the tricks aren't going to work anymore, and you're going to become overwhelmed. Because the idea that Trump is the disease himself, to me, is undermined by the fact that you've got Trumps popping up everywhere you look around the world.\n\nAnd so, to me, if the left and the center-left don't come back with a forceful kind of recreation of a better world that stems the tide of this rising fascist energy, at some point they're going to be over overwhelmed by it, no matter how kind of popular, and clever, and, you know, 80 percent you can make your issues that you're running on.\n\nDM: Yeah. It's a good argument and a good question, Ryan, and I guess I would put it back to you this way: The history of humanity, as well as the history of the United States of America, is full of figures like Trump. Every human being, even you, even me, everyone on this podcast, every listener, every nation, every family, every tribe, we all have good and evil in us, all of us, because we're human. And the particular kind of evil that Mr. Trump represents is a common kind of evil in human history. His governance style is, up until about three or 400 years ago, that was the norm. You know, total control of truth and what counts as truth. Absolute tribalism and misogynistic violence. Use of power to reward friends and hurt enemies; this is what Carl Sagan called \"The Demon-Haunted World.\" It existed up until the founding of America. And guess what? When America was founded, it continued.\n\nIf you look at the American South, between the Compromise of 1877 and the Civil Rights Movement, roughly half our country was governed the way that Trump would govern in a second term, which would be the use of violence to make sure that his side stayed in power for decades, right? This is all familiar.\n\nThe reason why I say that Trump is the disease is, until Trump came along, there were a lot of things that were outside of the Overton window of U.S. politics. Especially, you know, there's been a particular moment in the last 50 or 60 years, since the visual evidence came out of the Holocaust in the '40s and '50s, and the visual evidence came out of the American South in the '50s and '60s about how abusive, the Bull Connor stuff. And there became a consensus for about five or six decades that certain things were a little bit beyond the pale.\n\nAnd so, when you had people like Richard Nixon, and Ronald Reagan, and Bob Dole, saying at their Republican nominating conventions, \"If you are a racist, the exits are right there, we have no room for you in our party.\" I mean, come on. Like, we have their tapes, we know they're racist, we know what they were saying. We know this was not a thing that struck them as a deep moral imperative. There was a consensus, including in the Republican Party, that you had to disavow that kind of race-based fascism in order to win. And once Trump breaks that taboo, we're now at year zero in a new era where that is back on the table. And once that's on the table, once it is possible that you will have a rejuvenation of the kind of governance that happened, for example, in the American South for those many decades, the job is to eliminate that.\n\nAnd your point about, versions of him are popping up all over? Yeah, cancer is metastatic, that's why you've got to stop it. But the central fight - I mean, I actually think the central fight is the war in Europe and Putin's invasion - but, like, the number two fight, in terms of where the world's going, in terms of \"the demon-haunted world\" versus a rule of law world is, can we keep Trump out of the White House in '24?\n\nRG: And last question for you - and I know a lot of people who are listening to this who are practitioners of politics will be curious - how are you thinking about 2024 Democratic primaries? And I've written about this before but, you know, Mainstream Democrats, the group that you've mentioned, plus Democratic Majority for Israel, which works very closely with Mainstream Democrats, really transformed what was possible for progressive left-wing candidates in democratic primaries in the last cycle.\n\nI'm curious if you think you have essentially tamed the left to the point where you're kind of moving on from Democratic primaries? Or are you guys gearing up for another test in 2024, that if you see progressive candidates that you think are too progressive popping up, that the super PACs are going to come out guns blazing on them?\n\nDM: I think we're OK now. For example, when No Labels did their big launch, I think No Labels is a real threat to elect Trump again. You know, the No Labels effort?\n\nRG: For people who aren't familiar, this is the centrist group - corporate-backed that is - getting a ballot line on all, what, 50 states? Threatening to run, like, a Manchin-type, or a Manchin candidate, against both parties.\n\nDM: Yeah. It's worth unpacking just a little bit. All of that is right. The No Labels group was founded a while ago, before the current era, as, essentially, look, there's this cloakroom consensus that exists between legislators of both sides, that there's certain things that we just need to get done, and a lot of political posturing prevents us from doing it, and we need to just do it. And you know, a lot of it was fiscal, a lot of it was regulatory, whatever. That was the idea.\n\nBut this group of people, it's led by Mark Penn. Who, as you may know, is the pollster and political advisor who famously lost the 2008 primary to Barack Obama, and then who got sufficiently angry about being correctly blamed for that, that he became anti-Democrat. And then, Nancy Jacobson, who's the prolific fundraiser, who has a bunch of-\n\nRG: His wife.\n\nDM: Yeah. His wife. And she has raised a bunch of money from New York Democrats. And they live in an environment where it's easy to attack President Biden from the center-right. So, \"Oh, do you see what he did on inflation?\" And, \"Oh, do you see who he appointed to this position? And oh my gosh, Lina Khan is so bad, and all these people are so bad.\" And so, they get themselves worked up to this place where Biden's really bad, Trump's really bad, and then they do these polls that, like, out of a million people, who would you want to be president? It turns out neither Trump nor Biden comes to the top. And they're like, oh, that means we can successfully run a third party that could win.\n\nAnd people like Larry Hogan, and Joe Manchin, and so forth, you know, they like to think that they could be president someday. And so, they have this dance with donors and everybody, where they create this fiction that someone else can win.\n\nAnd Bill Galston is a Brookings Institute scholar, who was one of the founders of No Labels, and he actually just published a piece in The Wall Street Journal doubling down on this point that I'm making, which is that, if you run a No Labels centrist, like a Joe Manchin, as an independent ballot line in every state, you will split the anti-Trump coalition, and therefore Trump will win. That's the risk. And I think it's a huge risk. It is one of the top five ways that Trump could get reelected, is if Nancy Jacobson and Mark Penn and Joe Lieberman continue in this path, and put this ballot line in every state.\n\nWhen they launched this effort - this absurd, venal, effort - one of the things that they did in their video promotion is they talked about how bad the two parties were. And the visual images they included were Donald Trump on the right and AOC on the left. And so, they're ignoring the existence of Biden. Now, I don't think it works. I actually think No Labels has a real risk of collapsing in this effort, and I hope that they do. And I think that, in general, if you listen to the way Bernie Sanders is talking about endorsing Joe Biden, I am quite confident right now that the actual extremes of the left are pretty severely marginalized. That's in general.\n\nAt the margins it's a little bit like, for example, when a judge gave a ruling that was really unhelpful; this is the judge with the abortion pill. And AOC comes out and says, we should just ignore the ruling. Like, AOC is siding with JD Vance. The two of them are both like, \"Yeah, rulings that we don't like, we shouldn't do it.\" And it makes it hard to build a coalition of donors around the rule of law. But in terms of general voters, I don't think it's a problem anymore, and I don't think we need to do more to fight back against it, at the moment.\n\nRG: Well, good news and bad news for the left. They won't be bombed by super PACs, but that's because they've been thoroughly beaten down into the ground.\n\nDM: Yes.\n\nRG: There you go, congratulations.\n\nThank you for joining me.

A Jacobin analysis shows that she's been covered unlike any other accuser in the post-Me Too era.\n\nJoe Biden delivers remarks about the coronavirus outbreak at the Hotel Du Pont on March 12 in Wilmington, DE. (Drew Angerer / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nNearly a year ago, journalist E. Jean Carroll wrote an essay in which she publicly accused the president of the United States of sexually assaulting her in a dressing room more than two decades ago. The accused, or rather, his press team, called it \"false.\" There was no evidence Carroll could point to - how could there be? - except for two people she had told at the time, who confirmed the memory to New York magazine.\n\nThe story was left off the front pages of the nation's top newspapers, including the New York Times , which banished it to its book section , and was nowhere to be found among the 164 stories on the paper's homepage (executive editor Dean Baquet later admitted the Times had been \"overly cautious\" and had underplayed the story). On TV, the Sunday shows largely gave it a pass. The most powerful man in the world had been credibly accused of sexual assault, and no one seemed to care.\n\nFast-forward nine months later. A woman has come forward to publicly accuse the frontrunner to become the next president of the United States of sexually assaulting her in a Senate office more than two decades ago. The accused's team has called the story \"false.\" There is no evidence, except the two people still living whom the accuser confided in at the time, who confirmed to the Intercept their memory of being told the story.\n\nThe result has again been media silence, only this time with a twist. Because not only has Tara Reade and her allegation against Democratic frontrunner and now presumptive nominee Joe Biden inexplicably received perhaps the least mainstream media attention of any high-profile sexual assault allegation of the past three years, but it is some of the news outlets most critical of the media's treatment of Carroll and other survivors who are choosing to ignore the story - or, in some cases, undermining their gravity.\n\nAfter Hillary Clinton's loss, liberals harshly criticized the press for reporting on hacked Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign emails, whose revelations damaged her campaign against Trump. The Times itself charged that every major news outlet became \"a de facto instrument of Russian intelligence\" for doing their jobs. Some journalists have publicly questioned their decision to report negatively on Trump's opposition, such as the Times 's own Amy Chozik .\n\n\"The choice wasn't between getting it right and getting it first,\" the Washington Post's Aaron Blake reflected in December 2016 on reporting about the leaks; \"it was between getting it first and playing to the potential agenda of an anonymous source - a source who could have been an adversarial world power such as Russia or a more nefarious source or just some random hacker.\"\n\nDonald Trump is an odious figure who deserves scorn and criticism. But as one observes the demonstrably different standards the media have applied to a sexual assault allegation against the man many see as his best-placed rival, it's hard not to suspect that parts of the press have unhealthily internalized partisan accusations that their reporting put him in power.\n\nThe mainstream media silence around Reade was abruptly broken on Sunday, when the New York Times reported on her allegation, leading to a flood of stories from other mainstream outlets. But it's worth taking stock of where the situation was at the end of last week.\n\nTwo weeks after the Intercept first broke the story, and after the world first heard the details of what allegedly happened to Reade in interviews with Katie Halper and Rising 's Krystal Ball , the national, mainstream outlets that had covered Reade's allegation could be counted squarely on both hands: Yahoo News , Newsweek , the Huffington Post , Vox , the Economist , the Guardian , and Democracy Now! , which interviewed Reade.\n\nNone of the country's biggest newspapers had covered the allegation whatsoever, including the New York Times , Wall Street Journal , Los Angeles Times , Chicago Tribune , Boston Globe , USA Today and the Washington Post . Only the latter had even mentioned Reade's allegation: a single time, in a reader question about the odds of New York governor Andrew Cuomo becoming the nominee \"in light of the Tara Reade bombshell\"; in his answer, the Post' s Aaron Blake - the same person who years earlier mused that accurate reporting that potentially serves a pro-Trump agenda \"adds a whole new element to the journalistic equation\" - avoided even referencing the allegation. Reporting about it was absent from Politico , too.\n\nNor was it covered by CNN or MSNBC, in either their political coverage or interviews with the former vice president. According to Newsbusters , a right-wing media watchdog, Biden sat for at least four interviews with cable news hosts in the six days that followed the allegation, including an hour-long CNN town hall. None of the forty-one questions he fielded were about the allegation.\n\nIndeed, one of the ironies of Reade's story is that while the mainstream press ignored the story, it was being extensively covered by right-wing media, including Fox News , the Washington Examiner , the Washington Times , Reason , and the Daily Wire . Where the past three years have seen mainstream and left-leaning news outlets devote increasing resources to reporting on sexual misconduct by powerful men and grant survivors a larger platform, right-wing outlets such as these have been openly skeptical, even disdainful, when accusations have targeted conservatives.\n\nWith a powerful Democrat now under the spotlight, the roles have seemingly reversed. And much of the conservative coverage of Reade's story is now aimed at hitting mainstream outlets for hypocrisy.\n\nCompared to the dearth of coverage of Reade, Carroll's allegation was treated like the story of the century. Carroll may have inexplicably been relegated to the New York Times book section, but the paper at least devoted an entire piece to it the day it broke. Under criticism for under-covering the story, the Times followed up six days later with a much more in-depth, prominent feature on it. Even as four of the \"big five\" TV networks left her off their coverage in the days that followed her essay, Carroll's story was nonetheless covered by MSNBC , NBC News' online portal , NPR , the Atlantic , and Vanity Fair , among others.\n\nBy contrast, until Sunday, none of these outlets so much as mentioned the existence of Reade's allegation. Some still haven't.\n\nOf the major newspapers named above that failed to cover Reade's allegation two weeks later, all but one reported on Carroll's the same day it was revealed: the New York Times , the Washington Post , the Wall Street Journal , the LA Times , the Tribune , and the Boston Globe , typically after interviewing Carroll and getting corroboration from her friend. Often, they ran follow-up pieces in the days after. USA Today ran its piece on Carroll's allegation a day after it first broke . In the days and months since, Carroll's story received a steady amount of media attention, and she was invited onto CNN three days after her story broke. By June 26, five days after the story first ran, it was fodder for late-night talk show hosts .\n\nAt the time, the muted response to Carroll's allegation saw news outlets big and small noting , sometimes angrily, the lack of media coverage that greeted it. The fact that Carroll's story didn't receive the \"wall-to-wall coverage\" comedian Samantha Bee felt it deserved led her to launch a celebrated takedown of the press within a week of the story breaking. Others followed suit.\n\n\"E. Jean Carroll accused the president of sexual assault - and the media didn't seem to care,\" wrote Vanity Fair.\n\n\"Why Has the Reaction to a Rape Allegation Against the President Been So Muted?\" asked New York magazine, which had broken the story.\n\nSimilar pieces have been written about Reade's allegation, but they've been limited to outlets that covered it from the start, such as the Hill and Huffington Post . The outlets that railed against Carroll's relative erasure from the press failed to muster the same outrage about Reade, who received far less attention.\n\nMSNBC's silence particularly stands out. It was the Democrat-aligned network that first allowed Carroll to recount her story, appearing with Joy Reid, who charged that the media had \"relatively buried\" it, and thundered that \"in any other universe, in any other presidency, in any other news cycle, E. Jean Carroll's bombshell revelations against the sitting president of the United States would have been the lead story all week long, as soon as they dropped.\" Elsewhere, MSNBC host Joe Scarborough complained that \"there are a lot of Democrats out there that are saying, 'Wait a second. Joe Biden placed his hands on a woman's shoulders, and that got more press coverage on every Sunday show than [Carroll's accusations].'\" (\"How balanced do you have to be when one side is irrational?\" Scarborough once said about his attacks on Trump.)\n\nMSNBC finally reported on Reade's allegation about Biden on Sunday , ending the report by \"underscor[ing] that the current sitting president has also faced multiple accusations that he denies.\"\n\nBeyond Carroll's story, it's difficult to comport the lack of Reade's coverage with how the stories of other accusers of powerful men have been treated in the media. Take Christine Blasey Ford and her accusation against Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh, another allegation whose existence, as with Reade, was first revealed by the Intercept's Ryan Grim, who reported on a letter being withheld from the Judiciary Committee.\n\nTwo days later, Ronan Farrow first revealed the content of that letter for the New Yorker , namely that it accused Kavanaugh of holding down a girl at a party and trying to force himself on her as a high-school student in the early 1980s. The allegation was immediately and widely covered across the media the same day Farrow's piece ran, with outlets ranging from the New York Times , USA Today , and the Guardian to CNN, the Washington Post , and NPR re-reporting its details. At the time, several of the key elements that have lent credibility to Reade's allegation were absent: Blasey Ford's identity wasn't known, no journalist had spoken to her, and no one had yet corroborated her accusation.\n\nThe treatment of Reade's story by the New York Times , the first major paper to even acknowledge the existence of Reade or her allegation, is particularly difficult to square with its coverage of other accusers.\n\nOne is the time frame. Though the paper says it \"began reporting on her account and seeking corroboration\" as soon as the Intercept broke the story, it ultimately took the Times nearly three weeks to put out a report. By contrast, the paper's report on Carroll dropped the same day that the rest of the world found out about it, and the same goes for its story on Blasey Ford's letter.\n\nSome have defended the Times , arguing that it takes time to get the reporting right. But while the paper no doubt needed time to interview dozens of former Biden staffers for its in-depth evaluation of Reade's allegation, it could've reported on the existence of the allegation at the time it surfaced by simply speaking to Reade's witnesses. This is exactly what it did in the case of Carroll and Trump, writing an initial report after interviewing the two friends Carroll confided in at the time, before releasing a longer, more detailed profile of Carroll six days later that featured the testimony of many more interviewees.\n\nIt's even harder to square with the Times 's reporting on the accusation against Kavanaugh: the paper reported on the allegations the day the broke, basing its report entirely on an anonymous letter the paper admitted it hadn't even seen.\n\nThe content also raises eyebrows. Though the most newsworthy part of the Times 's report is that it further corroborates Reade's story - there is now a third person who recalls Reade telling her about it at the time, and two former interns confirm Reade was suddenly pulled off her duties, as she has repeatedly claimed - the paper instead framed the piece around denials by Biden's staff, most of whom were never told about the incident in the first place. \"Former Senate office staff members do not recall such an incident,\" the paper concludes in the article's subhead.\n\nMystifyingly, the paper devotes two paragraphs to detailing Trump's history of sexual misconduct, which the paper informs readers \"went far beyond the accusations against Mr. Biden.\"\n\nIt's a stark contrast to the sympathetic treatment the Times offered Kavanaugh accuser Deborah Ramirez, who the Times reported on two days after her allegation surfaced, without interviewing her or being able to find a witness (the New Yorker confirmed one fellow student remembered the incident in question, and a year later the Times published a more detailed report corroborating it further). Unlike when covering Reade, denials from those loyal to the accused were relegated to the bottom of the piece, which centered Ramirez and her story, and made her struggle to find a corroborating witness part of a tender opening to the piece.\n\nNonetheless, the Times piece opened the floodgates in the mainstream press, as several other outlets apparently spontaneously concluded their own weeks-long investigations into the allegation on the same day, including the Washington Post and NBC News .\n\nWhen Kavanaugh was accused in 2018, all three of these outlets had reported on the allegation against him the day it broke, when the only source was a letter none of the reporters involved had even seen; when it was Biden, they took nearly three weeks, despite the existence of two people corroborating the accuser's story from the beginning.\n\nWhile most outlets chose to simply ignore Reade, others took a different tack: playing down or even attempting to discredit her allegation. In an added twist, it's some of the most vocal forums of liberal feminism who took on this task.\n\nSome simply ignored it. New York magazine, which had broken the Carroll story and noted its lack of media coverage, didn't report on Reade's story, only updating a year-old round-up of Biden accusers on Sunday with Reade's new allegation. It published a standalone piece later that day .\n\nOthers have taken an explicitly skeptical tone. Salon 's Amanda Marcotte wrote a piece purporting to set the record straight on the controversy, arguing the press was rightly taking \"a slow and careful approach.\" Various \"red flags\" in Reade's story - namely, the fact that she added details to her story over time, was publicly complimentary of Biden, supported some of his rivals, and that his longtime staff issued denials - mean what's \"likely driving the silence - so far - is a genuine reluctance to dive into a story that contains such a high number of complicating factors and proves difficult to pin down.\"\n\nMarcotte was less sanguine when the accuser in question was Carroll and the accused was Donald Trump. \"Trump accused of rape, major media yawns,\" she wrote only three days after Carroll's story broke. For Marcotte, that case was \"an incredibly serious story, deserving of at least the wall-to-wall coverage and outrage that greeted\" the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, concluding that \"the main reason the media is underplaying this story is that women are still not taken seriously as full citizens and participants in our democracy.\" Carroll's story was not a \"he said/she said,\" she wrote, but \"backed by significant evidence,\" citing the friends Carroll had spoken to at the time - an aspect Marcotte treats with far less significance in the Reade case.\n\nMarcotte's reasoning that \"red flags\" in Reade's story justify media inaction is difficult to comport with how \"imperfect\" survivors have been treated by the press in the past, including by Marcotte herself. Inconsistencies and gaps in Blasey Ford's testimony hadn't stopped Marcotte from deciding she had been an \"oasis of clear-headed competence, decency and genuine commitment to the value of truth and civic duty.\"\n\nThe fact that Reade's \"public statements about Biden were entirely positive\" was a red flag for Marcotte that muddied the waters for reporters. Elsewhere, Marcotte has cited Trump accuser Jill Harth, without taking the time to weigh the \"red flags\" of Harth's own personal history , which included dating Trump after he attempted to rape her, and a year earlier sending his campaign emails asking for a job and stating that she was \"definitely on Team Trump.\"\n\nIt was a similar situation with feminist outlet Jezebel , which, unlike its treatment of presidential candidate Trump's sexual misconduct , took six days to cover Reade's allegation, and has only done so once. Though acknowledging Reade's story was \"both harrowing and credible,\" Jezebel chose to frame its coverage of the bombshell not around a leading presidential candidate's alleged assault of a staffer, but around a critique of Halper's handling of the story even as it acknowledges Halper had confirmed Reade's account with her brother and friend - the core of what Reade is alleging.\n\nJezebel has taken a very different approach to reporting on accusations made against other powerful men. Just four days earlier, it had quickly reported on a rape allegation against rapper French Montana, based entirely on anonymous allegations made in a lawsuit. The same applies to other political figures already mentioned. Jezebel wrote early and often on the accusations against Kavanaugh , including when Blasey Ford's accusation was still an anonymously penned, uncorroborated letter reporters hadn't actually seen. It likewise covered Ramirez's allegation the day it was first reported , at a time when the New Yorker was only able to find a single classmate to corroborate it - less than the \"lack of corroboration\" the outlet now claims for Reade's story.\n\nAnd it raged at the \"absence of effect\" and lack of \"attention and outrage\" that greeted Carroll's story, excoriating the Times for its cautious treatment of the story even though the paper had \"taken the time to re-corroborate Carroll's story with the two friends she spoke to after the alleged assault - a detail that New York had already explicitly, prominently fact-checked.\" As with Marcotte, what was significant evidence for Jezebel when Trump was accused became buried by handwringing when it was Biden in question.\n\nDespairing at the lack of coverage for Carroll, the outlet had waved away attempts to justify media silence on the issue. The words and actions of a powerful political figure, it concluded,\n\nregardless of how petty, how baseless - will always remain the domain of news, while the words and recounting of the woman he allegedly assaulted - no matter how exactingly constructed her story, how righteous her message, how broad her platform - will remain fodder for analysis.\n\nA year later, it reads as an indictment of the treatment Jezebel itself has given Reade's story.\n\nJacobin sent the Times , Marcotte, and Jezebel a detailed list of questions about what the editorial thought process was behind covering Reade's allegations differently to previous accusers. Only Jezebel responded, though it declined to answer any of the questions:\n\nJezebel wrote about and reported on Reade's credible story, as we did with Christine Blasey Ford, E. Jean Carroll, an anonymous Al Franken accuser, and countless others. Your questions suggest that there was some ulterior motive for not covering Reade's story with more frequency, which is both disingenuous and insulting.\n\nIt's fair to say that Tara Reade has been treated unlike any high-profile accuser of the past three years.\n\nWhile previous accusers of powerful men were widely covered in mainstream print, digital, and TV media, only a handful of outlets trickled out stories on Reade's allegation. While widespread coverage greeted past accusers almost instantly, it has taken nearly three weeks for Reade's mere existence to be acknowledged by a single major newspaper. And while there was no shortage of articles fiercely criticizing the media's underplaying of another survivor's story, those same critics have now taken to justifying the even more egregious media silence over Reade's.\n\nDefenders of this particular media silence are right to insist on vetting accusers' claims, no matter how long it takes. Yet Reade's story started out with as much corroboration as previous claims that saw no similar delay in reporting - in fact, it had more than several key cases.\n\n\"The model going forward will likely involve Republican media covering Democratic corruption and Democratic media covering Republican corruption,\" Matt Taibbi lamented in August 2016.\n\nWith Reade's case, we appear to be seeing that playing out in real time. And that approach will fail not only political discourse, but future accusers of sufficiently powerful men or women.\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .

Jean Carroll wrote an essay in which she publicly accused the president of the United States of sexually assaulting her in a dressing room more than two decades ago. The accused, or rather, his press team, called it \"false.\" There was no evidence Carroll could point to - how could there be? - except for two people she had told at the time, who confirmed the memory to New York magazine.\n\nThe story was left off the front pages of the nation's top newspapers, including the New York Times , which banished it to its book section , and was nowhere to be found among the 164 stories on the paper's homepage (executive editor Dean Baquet later admitted the Times had been \"overly cautious\" and had underplayed the story). On TV, the Sunday shows largely gave it a pass. The most powerful man in the world had been credibly accused of sexual assault, and no one seemed to care.\n\nFast-forward nine months later. A woman has come forward to publicly accuse the frontrunner to become the next president of the United States of sexually assaulting her in a Senate office more than two decades ago. The accused's team has called the story \"false.\" There is no evidence, except the two people still living whom the accuser confided in at the time, who confirmed to the Intercept their memory of being told the story.\n\nThe result has again been media silence, only this time with a twist. Because not only has Tara Reade and her allegation against Democratic frontrunner and now presumptive nominee Joe Biden inexplicably received perhaps the least mainstream media attention of any high-profile sexual assault allegation of the past three years, but it is some of the news outlets most critical of the media's treatment of Carroll and other survivors who are choosing to ignore the story - or, in some cases, undermining their gravity.\n\nAfter Hillary Clinton's loss, liberals harshly criticized the press for reporting on hacked Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign emails, whose revelations damaged her campaign against Trump. The Times itself charged that every major news outlet became \"a de facto instrument of Russian intelligence\" for doing their jobs. Some journalists have publicly questioned their decision to report negatively on Trump's opposition, such as the Times 's own Amy Chozik .\n\n\"The choice wasn't between getting it right and getting it first,\" the Washington Post's Aaron Blake reflected in December 2016 on reporting about the leaks; \"it was between getting it first and playing to the potential agenda of an anonymous source - a source who could have been an adversarial world power such as Russia or a more nefarious source or just some random hacker.\"\n\nDonald Trump is an odious figure who deserves scorn and criticism. But as one observes the demonstrably different standards the media have applied to a sexual assault allegation against the man many see as his best-placed rival, it's hard not to suspect that parts of the press have unhealthily internalized partisan accusations that their reporting put him in power.\n\nThe mainstream media silence around Reade was abruptly broken on Sunday, when the New York Times reported on her allegation, leading to a flood of stories from other mainstream outlets. But it's worth taking stock of where the situation was at the end of last week.\n\nTwo weeks after the Intercept first broke the story, and after the world first heard the details of what allegedly happened to Reade in interviews with Katie Halper and Rising 's Krystal Ball , the national, mainstream outlets that had covered Reade's allegation could be counted squarely on both hands: Yahoo News , Newsweek , the Huffington Post , Vox , the Economist , the Guardian , and Democracy Now! , which interviewed Reade.\n\nNone of the country's biggest newspapers had covered the allegation whatsoever, including the New York Times , Wall Street Journal , Los Angeles Times , Chicago Tribune , Boston Globe , USA Today and the Washington Post . Only the latter had even mentioned Reade's allegation: a single time, in a reader question about the odds of New York governor Andrew Cuomo becoming the nominee \"in light of the Tara Reade bombshell\"; in his answer, the Post' s Aaron Blake - the same person who years earlier mused that accurate reporting that potentially serves a pro-Trump agenda \"adds a whole new element to the journalistic equation\" - avoided even referencing the allegation. Reporting about it was absent from Politico , too.\n\nNor was it covered by CNN or MSNBC, in either their political coverage or interviews with the former vice president. According to Newsbusters , a right-wing media watchdog, Biden sat for at least four interviews with cable news hosts in the six days that followed the allegation, including an hour-long CNN town hall. None of the forty-one questions he fielded were about the allegation.\n\nIndeed, one of the ironies of Reade's story is that while the mainstream press ignored the story, it was being extensively covered by right-wing media, including Fox News , the Washington Examiner , the Washington Times , Reason , and the Daily Wire . Where the past three years have seen mainstream and left-leaning news outlets devote increasing resources to reporting on sexual misconduct by powerful men and grant survivors a larger platform, right-wing outlets such as these have been openly skeptical, even disdainful, when accusations have targeted conservatives.\n\nWith a powerful Democrat now under the spotlight, the roles have seemingly reversed. And much of the conservative coverage of Reade's story is now aimed at hitting mainstream outlets for hypocrisy.\n\nCompared to the dearth of coverage of Reade, Carroll's allegation was treated like the story of the century. Carroll may have inexplicably been relegated to the New York Times book section, but the paper at least devoted an entire piece to it the day it broke. Under criticism for under-covering the story, the Times followed up six days later with a much more in-depth, prominent feature on it. Even as four of the \"big five\" TV networks left her off their coverage in the days that followed her essay, Carroll's story was nonetheless covered by MSNBC , NBC News' online portal , NPR , the Atlantic , and Vanity Fair , among others.\n\nBy contrast, until Sunday, none of these outlets so much as mentioned the existence of Reade's allegation. Some still haven't.\n\nOf the major newspapers named above that failed to cover Reade's allegation two weeks later, all but one reported on Carroll's the same day it was revealed: the New York Times , the Washington Post , the Wall Street Journal , the LA Times , the Tribune , and the Boston Globe , typically after interviewing Carroll and getting corroboration from her friend. Often, they ran follow-up pieces in the days after. USA Today ran its piece on Carroll's allegation a day after it first broke . In the days and months since, Carroll's story received a steady amount of media attention, and she was invited onto CNN three days after her story broke. By June 26, five days after the story first ran, it was fodder for late-night talk show hosts .\n\nAt the time, the muted response to Carroll's allegation saw news outlets big and small noting , sometimes angrily, the lack of media coverage that greeted it. The fact that Carroll's story didn't receive the \"wall-to-wall coverage\" comedian Samantha Bee felt it deserved led her to launch a celebrated takedown of the press within a week of the story breaking. Others followed suit.\n\n\"E. Jean Carroll accused the president of sexual assault - and the media didn't seem to care,\" wrote Vanity Fair.\n\n\"Why Has the Reaction to a Rape Allegation Against the President Been So Muted?\" asked New York magazine, which had broken the story.\n\nSimilar pieces have been written about Reade's allegation, but they've been limited to outlets that covered it from the start, such as the Hill and Huffington Post . The outlets that railed against Carroll's relative erasure from the press failed to muster the same outrage about Reade, who received far less attention.\n\nMSNBC's silence particularly stands out. It was the Democrat-aligned network that first allowed Carroll to recount her story, appearing with Joy Reid, who charged that the media had \"relatively buried\" it, and thundered that \"in any other universe, in any other presidency, in any other news cycle, E. Jean Carroll's bombshell revelations against the sitting president of the United States would have been the lead story all week long, as soon as they dropped.\" Elsewhere, MSNBC host Joe Scarborough complained that \"there are a lot of Democrats out there that are saying, 'Wait a second. Joe Biden placed his hands on a woman's shoulders, and that got more press coverage on every Sunday show than [Carroll's accusations].'\" (\"How balanced do you have to be when one side is irrational?\" Scarborough once said about his attacks on Trump.)\n\nMSNBC finally reported on Reade's allegation about Biden on Sunday , ending the report by \"underscor[ing] that the current sitting president has also faced multiple accusations that he denies.\"\n\nBeyond Carroll's story, it's difficult to comport the lack of Reade's coverage with how the stories of other accusers of powerful men have been treated in the media. Take Christine Blasey Ford and her accusation against Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh, another allegation whose existence, as with Reade, was first revealed by the Intercept's Ryan Grim, who reported on a letter being withheld from the Judiciary Committee.\n\nTwo days later, Ronan Farrow first revealed the content of that letter for the New Yorker , namely that it accused Kavanaugh of holding down a girl at a party and trying to force himself on her as a high-school student in the early 1980s. The allegation was immediately and widely covered across the media the same day Farrow's piece ran, with outlets ranging from the New York Times , USA Today , and the Guardian to CNN, the Washington Post , and NPR re-reporting its details. At the time, several of the key elements that have lent credibility to Reade's allegation were absent: Blasey Ford's identity wasn't known, no journalist had spoken to her, and no one had yet corroborated her accusation.\n\nThe treatment of Reade's story by the New York Times , the first major paper to even acknowledge the existence of Reade or her allegation, is particularly difficult to square with its coverage of other accusers.\n\nOne is the time frame. Though the paper says it \"began reporting on her account and seeking corroboration\" as soon as the Intercept broke the story, it ultimately took the Times nearly three weeks to put out a report. By contrast, the paper's report on Carroll dropped the same day that the rest of the world found out about it, and the same goes for its story on Blasey Ford's letter.\n\nSome have defended the Times , arguing that it takes time to get the reporting right. But while the paper no doubt needed time to interview dozens of former Biden staffers for its in-depth evaluation of Reade's allegation, it could've reported on the existence of the allegation at the time it surfaced by simply speaking to Reade's witnesses. This is exactly what it did in the case of Carroll and Trump, writing an initial report after interviewing the two friends Carroll confided in at the time, before releasing a longer, more detailed profile of Carroll six days later that featured the testimony of many more interviewees.\n\nIt's even harder to square with the Times 's reporting on the accusation against Kavanaugh: the paper reported on the allegations the day the broke, basing its report entirely on an anonymous letter the paper admitted it hadn't even seen.\n\nThe content also raises eyebrows. Though the most newsworthy part of the Times 's report is that it further corroborates Reade's story - there is now a third person who recalls Reade telling her about it at the time, and two former interns confirm Reade was suddenly pulled off her duties, as she has repeatedly claimed - the paper instead framed the piece around denials by Biden's staff, most of whom were never told about the incident in the first place. \"Former Senate office staff members do not recall such an incident,\" the paper concludes in the article's subhead.\n\nMystifyingly, the paper devotes two paragraphs to detailing Trump's history of sexual misconduct, which the paper informs readers \"went far beyond the accusations against Mr. Biden.\"\n\nIt's a stark contrast to the sympathetic treatment the Times offered Kavanaugh accuser Deborah Ramirez, who the Times reported on two days after her allegation surfaced, without interviewing her or being able to find a witness (the New Yorker confirmed one fellow student remembered the incident in question, and a year later the Times published a more detailed report corroborating it further). Unlike when covering Reade, denials from those loyal to the accused were relegated to the bottom of the piece, which centered Ramirez and her story, and made her struggle to find a corroborating witness part of a tender opening to the piece.\n\nNonetheless, the Times piece opened the floodgates in the mainstream press, as several other outlets apparently spontaneously concluded their own weeks-long investigations into the allegation on the same day, including the Washington Post and NBC News .\n\nWhen Kavanaugh was accused in 2018, all three of these outlets had reported on the allegation against him the day it broke, when the only source was a letter none of the reporters involved had even seen; when it was Biden, they took nearly three weeks, despite the existence of two people corroborating the accuser's story from the beginning.\n\nWhile most outlets chose to simply ignore Reade, others took a different tack: playing down or even attempting to discredit her allegation. In an added twist, it's some of the most vocal forums of liberal feminism who took on this task.\n\nSome simply ignored it. New York magazine, which had broken the Carroll story and noted its lack of media coverage, didn't report on Reade's story, only updating a year-old round-up of Biden accusers on Sunday with Reade's new allegation. It published a standalone piece later that day .\n\nOthers have taken an explicitly skeptical tone. Salon 's Amanda Marcotte wrote a piece purporting to set the record straight on the controversy, arguing the press was rightly taking \"a slow and careful approach.\" Various \"red flags\" in Reade's story - namely, the fact that she added details to her story over time, was publicly complimentary of Biden, supported some of his rivals, and that his longtime staff issued denials - mean what's \"likely driving the silence - so far - is a genuine reluctance to dive into a story that contains such a high number of complicating factors and proves difficult to pin down.\"\n\nMarcotte was less sanguine when the accuser in question was Carroll and the accused was Donald Trump. \"Trump accused of rape, major media yawns,\" she wrote only three days after Carroll's story broke. For Marcotte, that case was \"an incredibly serious story, deserving of at least the wall-to-wall coverage and outrage that greeted\" the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, concluding that \"the main reason the media is underplaying this story is that women are still not taken seriously as full citizens and participants in our democracy.\" Carroll's story was not a \"he said/she said,\" she wrote, but \"backed by significant evidence,\" citing the friends Carroll had spoken to at the time - an aspect Marcotte treats with far less significance in the Reade case.\n\nMarcotte's reasoning that \"red flags\" in Reade's story justify media inaction is difficult to comport with how \"imperfect\" survivors have been treated by the press in the past, including by Marcotte herself. Inconsistencies and gaps in Blasey Ford's testimony hadn't stopped Marcotte from deciding she had been an \"oasis of clear-headed competence, decency and genuine commitment to the value of truth and civic duty.\"\n\nThe fact that Reade's \"public statements about Biden were entirely positive\" was a red flag for Marcotte that muddied the waters for reporters. Elsewhere, Marcotte has cited Trump accuser Jill Harth, without taking the time to weigh the \"red flags\" of Harth's own personal history , which included dating Trump after he attempted to rape her, and a year earlier sending his campaign emails asking for a job and stating that she was \"definitely on Team Trump.\"\n\nIt was a similar situation with feminist outlet Jezebel , which, unlike its treatment of presidential candidate Trump's sexual misconduct , took six days to cover Reade's allegation, and has only done so once. Though acknowledging Reade's story was \"both harrowing and credible,\" Jezebel chose to frame its coverage of the bombshell not around a leading presidential candidate's alleged assault of a staffer, but around a critique of Halper's handling of the story even as it acknowledges Halper had confirmed Reade's account with her brother and friend - the core of what Reade is alleging.\n\nJezebel has taken a very different approach to reporting on accusations made against other powerful men. Just four days earlier, it had quickly reported on a rape allegation against rapper French Montana, based entirely on anonymous allegations made in a lawsuit. The same applies to other political figures already mentioned. Jezebel wrote early and often on the accusations against Kavanaugh , including when Blasey Ford's accusation was still an anonymously penned, uncorroborated letter reporters hadn't actually seen. It likewise covered Ramirez's allegation the day it was first reported , at a time when the New Yorker was only able to find a single classmate to corroborate it - less than the \"lack of corroboration\" the outlet now claims for Reade's story.\n\nAnd it raged at the \"absence of effect\" and lack of \"attention and outrage\" that greeted Carroll's story, excoriating the Times for its cautious treatment of the story even though the paper had \"taken the time to re-corroborate Carroll's story with the two friends she spoke to after the alleged assault - a detail that New York had already explicitly, prominently fact-checked.\" As with Marcotte, what was significant evidence for Jezebel when Trump was accused became buried by handwringing when it was Biden in question.\n\nDespairing at the lack of coverage for Carroll, the outlet had waved away attempts to justify media silence on the issue. The words and actions of a powerful political figure, it concluded,\n\nregardless of how petty, how baseless - will always remain the domain of news, while the words and recounting of the woman he allegedly assaulted - no matter how exactingly constructed her story, how righteous her message, how broad her platform - will remain fodder for analysis.\n\nA year later, it reads as an indictment of the treatment Jezebel itself has given Reade's story.\n\nJacobin sent the Times , Marcotte, and Jezebel a detailed list of questions about what the editorial thought process was behind covering Reade's allegations differently to previous accusers. Only Jezebel responded, though it declined to answer any of the questions:\n\nJezebel wrote about and reported on Reade's credible story, as we did with Christine Blasey Ford, E. Jean Carroll, an anonymous Al Franken accuser, and countless others. Your questions suggest that there was some ulterior motive for not covering Reade's story with more frequency, which is both disingenuous and insulting.\n\nIt's fair to say that Tara Reade has been treated unlike any high-profile accuser of the past three years.\n\nWhile previous accusers of powerful men were widely covered in mainstream print, digital, and TV media, only a handful of outlets trickled out stories on Reade's allegation.

(Spencer Platt / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nMore than a year on, the saga of Tara Reade - the woman who accused Joe Biden of sexually assaulting her nearly thirty years ago, before being vilified by the liberal press - continues to be unrivaled in the post-Me Too era for the way it was treated and litigated. And newly released exhibits and testimony from the New York attorney general's investigation into former governor Andrew Cuomo's allegations of sexual harassment show it was something else, too: a potential model for other embattled politicians to bat away allegations of their own.\n\nAt its heart, the Cuomo sexual harassment story was a workplace tale as old as time: a boss uses his power to mistreat, demean, and try and coerce his underlings, who, because their jobs and future careers depend on staying in his good graces, have to find a way to fend off the harassment without alienating him. In Cuomo's case, this behavior often took the form of clumsy, embarrassing sexual advances, along with even more serious cases of unwanted groping and kissing.\n\nWhile the Cuomo administration scrambled to neutralize what would turn out to be career-ending allegations from eleven women, his staffers looked to the Biden campaign's successful suppression of the Reade allegation for how to do so, raw exhibits and transcripts released last week from attorney general Letitia James's investigation into the accusations show. As has been typical of coverage of Reade since she came forward, the revelations have so far been ignored entirely by every sector of the press except for conservative outlets hostile to Biden.\n\nThe same day that initial Cuomo accuser Lindsey Boylan publicly leveled her claim online in December, Dani Lever - Cuomo's former press secretary, who remained part of his inner circle of confidantes working on the political crisis even though she had moved on to a communications position at Facebook - looked to the Biden campaign circa April 2020 for how to respond. \"Pull what Biden said when he was accused during campaign,\" Lever wrote to her colleagues.\n\nThat would be Biden's April 2020 statement that \"this absolutely did not happen\" and that while \"women have a right to be heard,\" those \"claims should also be diligently reviewed by an independent press.\" It was a statement that happened to foreshadow a flurry of markedly negative press coverage of Reade and her life that had little to do with the substance of her allegation and that no modern accuser has been subjected to before or since. \"I think we can victim shame on the record,\" Lever concluded.\n\nThis isn't the only time Biden's name appears in the materials released last week. Former Cuomo chief of staff Linda Lacewell, another confidante who worked on handling the matter despite having moved on to a new job , was asked by investigators about having \"done some research about how President Biden and Mike Bloomberg handled allegations of sexual harassment\" and testified she was trying \"to identify how other individuals had responded and put that into the mix of the conversation and the analysis and the discussion.\" A different exhibit appears to show Lacewell emailing herself the Biden statement four months after Boylan's accusation, after two more women had come forward with their own stories of Cuomo's harassment.\n\nLever and Lacewell were both implicated by the attorney general's report in August in an attempt to discredit Boylan by attacking her character, though it was not known until now that the Biden campaign served as their template. The \"victim sham[ing]\" that Lever urged took the form of leaking \"confidential\" and \"privileged\" files to the press showing complaints against Boylan by other staffers when she worked for the state, both impugning her character and challenging her claims about why she left Cuomo's office.\n\nThese efforts were soon undercut, however. A set of other scandals, including Cuomo's involvement in covering up thousands of nursing home deaths during the pandemic and securing immunity for campaign donors who were implicated, had weakened Cuomo politically, creating the space for Boylan and other women's stories to be taken seriously. Finally, an official investigation by the attorney general whose results were released in August confirmed that Boylan's was not one isolated case, but one of many, all involving accusers who later testified under oath.\n\nHad this set of circumstances not unfolded, Boylan could very well have ended up like Reade did. Applying the standards of the post-Me Too era of reporting on sexual misconduct - which stressed the fallibility of survivors and the importance of corroboration over personal foibles - Reade's story had a lot going for it. It was corroborated by a friend she told at the time it happened, her brother, a tape of her mother calling in to Larry King not long after the alleged assault, decades-old divorce documents , a neighbor she told about the incident a few years later, and at least three other people whom she confided to about the incident in varying detail over the years. (For some perspective, Donald Trump accuser E. Jean Carroll had two people who recalled her telling them about her assault, and Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh's accuser Christine Blasey Ford, who was widely viewed as credible, was unable to produce any contemporaneous corroboration).\n\nInstead, once the slow-rolling allegation showed signs of doing political damage to Biden, who had rooted his challenge to Trump in \"decency\" and personal character, media coverage of Reade turned sharply negative in precisely the ways reporters had sworn off just a few years earlier. Reporters churned out pieces going into Reade's financial difficulties, her turbulent personal life, and printing statements from disgruntled landlords and other past acquaintances, turning the saga into a test of Reade's personal qualities and credibility, instead of a test of the corroborative evidence.\n\nIt all harkened back to the treatment Bill Clinton's accusers had received at the hands of reporters and political operatives more than two decades earlier. When the Intercept later published a detailed analysis of documents disputing the widely reported charge Reade had knowingly lied under oath about her academic history, the story wasn't picked up. The transcripts and exhibits released last week suggest Cuomo and his team hoped to engineer a similar outcome against Boylan: to leave her looking publicly isolated while maligning her character and credibility.\n\nIn another transcript , top Cuomo strategist Melissa DeRosa testifies on the process of putting together a letter in defense of Cuomo from dozens former female staffers, which would make a variety of charges: that Boylan was self-interested, that her timing was convenient, that she had initially withheld parts of her story, that she had spoken positively about Cuomo, and that they had never seen such behavior from the governor.\n\nThe effort paralleled the response from Biden's campaign and the anti-Trump press to Reade's allegation in early 2020, which drew on denials from copious former staffers and longtime Biden loyalists to throw cold water on the charge against the man who was by then solidified as Trump's election opponent.\n\n\"There was a consensus among the group that the negative op-ed was not the right way to go,\" DeRosa testified, referring to an earlier idea to have the governor \"push back on Lindsey\" by publishing an article lobbing personal and professional attacks on Boylan. That op-ed would be shared with and edited by Tina Tchen, the former head of Time's Up, a victim's advocacy organization set up in 2018 to give legal representation and public relations assistance to accusers of powerful sexual abusers and whose public relations firm was headed by Biden adviser Anita Dunn. (Tchen has now resigned over her covert assistance to Cuomo's team.) Reade herself had taken her case to Time's Up in January 2020 long before going public but was abruptly dropped after being told that they couldn't legally represent an accuser of a federal candidate because it would be a conflict of interest - a claim that's been disputed by others.\n\nAs DeRosa testified, the op-ed was ultimately nixed anyway, with advisors fearing it would do more harm than good, and the team decided to try put together the letter of support and denials from former staffers, taking a cue from the Biden camp. \"We thought that this was a more constructive, positive exercise to engage in, and that if ultimately we needed to put something out, this was something that Joe Biden had done,\" she explained.\n\nElsewhere, Lis Smith - Cuomo's former spokesperson who went on to serve as senior adviser for Pete Buttigieg's presidential campaign - testified regarding a message she wrote about her discussions with the New York Times about a piece on another Cuomo accuser , Anna Ruch. Asked what she meant when she wrote, \"I'm trying to get them to Biden in this story,\" she explained that she wanted them to \"put it in context that . . . that was a story about the hands, which is that, you know, that Biden had faced similar criticisms during the presidential campaign.\"\n\nSmith was referring to a different set of allegations Biden had faced early in his campaign, when seven women - Reade among them - had come forward complaining about the candidate's inappropriate handsiness in their interactions with him, which included stroking hair and putting his hand on a thigh. Like Cuomo later would , Biden cast the allegations as a case of misinterpreted friendliness and changing social mores . In an initial piece covering the Reade allegation, the Times had infamously written that it had \"found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden, beyond the hugs, kisses and touching that women previously said made them uncomfortable,\" before quietly deleting the second part of that sentence at the request of the campaign.\n\nOther testimony suggests Cuomo's team took note of the Biden camp's framing.\n\n\"Once the Anna Ruch thing happened, I think that we were apprehensive that there could be more things like that, like where it could be like a Joe Biden situation of, like, you know, older guy who is out of touch, who is taking photos with people in a way that made them feel uncomfortable,\" testified DeRosa.\n\nBiden wasn't the only figure Cuomo's team learned from. The governor's brother and now-fired CNN anchor Chris Cuomo testified that he and the governor had discussed Donald Trump and the raft of assault allegations against him in the context of Cuomo's case, specifically about \"the nature of what was resonating and what wasn't and why and what that meant about what was happening in society and the media.\" The governor, his brother said, determined\n\nthat it is highly political in perspective, that we haven't gotten to a place where we all see things the same way. And that was something that he believed very much politically benefited the former president, that it was very different how things were viewed in his camp, I guess you'd call it.\n\nCuomo seems to have been referring to the role today's partisan and cultural polarization has played in shaping the reception of such allegations, with polling support, attitudes, and media arguments virtually swapped between partisans when a Republican has been accused versus when Biden was. But he may also have overestimated this phenomenon: While Biden, as the only alternative to Trump, may have been too big to fail for many liberals, for Cuomo in deep blue New York, there was no similar force at work to make him unexpendable.\n\nThere was also another, perhaps more important factor: the launching of an official, independent investigation of the charges against Cuomo, where witnesses and the accused testified under oath. It was this, coupled with a push for impeachment and criticism from a collection of party leaders and legislators, which finally made Cuomo's insistence on staying in power untenable.\n\nThe demand to \"believe women\" was always meant as a call to take such allegations seriously and investigate them, rather than as an evidentiary standard. It is, after all, possible for accusers to level false charges for political and other reasons, as we saw in the cases of Alex Morse and Judy Munro-Leighton , who admitted inventing her allegation against Brett Kavanaugh, even as other accusations against him were corroborated. The question is how to litigate such claims without producing the kind of character assassination and personal danger that alleged survivors have typically faced when coming forward in the past.\n\nAnita Hill - who herself was viciously defamed and disbelieved about her own sexual harassment allegations against Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas and whose testimony against him was serially undermined by Biden himself - has pointed to James's investigation as a \" model \" for investigating accusations. \"It put to rest a lot of the follow-ups that we hear in these cases where people say, 'Well, we don't know what happened. We don't have any evidence. We can never know. It's just a he said-she said thing,'\" Hill has said .\n\nFor her part, Reade says she would testify under oath and cooperate with any investigation into what she says happened between her and Biden in 1993 and hopes his staffers could be forced to testify, too. \"It is one thing if they protect Biden in the media, but very different for them to go under oath,\" she says. \"Also, an investigative process might provide a safer venue for others to step forward with their own experiences with Joe Biden.\"\n\nThe New York attorney general's report shows that an unscrupulous politician and his loyalists viewed the Biden campaign as model for how to suppress serious allegations of sexual misconduct. But perhaps that same report can be a model for how to ensure justice for both accusers and the accused going forward.\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .

TV news needs more anchors like him.\n\nMSNBC\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nAfter being studiously ignored for weeks, Tara Reade's sexual assault allegation against presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden is finally breaking through in earnest into mainstream news coverage. On cable news, her accusation got one of its most extended and sympathetic airings last night thanks to MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes's brave decision to cover it.\n\n\"There have been moments I think for many of us, all of us, where we have heard about accusations against someone that we find ourselves desperately wanting not to believe,\" he said, opening the segment.\n\nBut part of the difficult lesson of the MeToo era is not that every accusation is true and everything should be believed on its face, but that you do have to fight yourself when you feel that impulse. You have to do that in order to take seriously what is being alleged and what the evidence is and to evaluate it. And that is the case with the accusation by a woman named Tara Reade against Joe Biden.\n\nHayes's treatment wasn't exhaustive. He left out that two people close to Reade had told reporters who broke her story that they recalled her telling them about it at the time; he didn't mention the phone call her mother made to Larry King Live at the time about unnamed problems her daughter was having in a senator's office; and he mentioned that Reade's official paper complaint can't be located, but didn't explain that one potential location - Biden's senatorial papers - will be locked to the public for years by the University of Delaware. (The Washington Post and others have called on Biden to release them).\n\nNonetheless, Hayes informed MSNBC viewers about a pivotal new development in the case: that Reade's former neighbor, a Biden supporter, has come forward to say Reade told her about the allegation in the mid-1990s.\n\nHayes invited on journalist Rebecca Traister, the author of an important new piece on what the allegations mean, who affirmed the story's rising credibility and called on Biden himself to personally address it. And he pushed viewers to move past their own unconscious biases and to take the story seriously. The segment is worth watching - though as MSNBC mystifyingly hasn't put clips of it up on either its official website or YouTube channel and a transcript isn't yet available, you'll have to do so in pieces .\n\nWhy was this brave? After all, this is Hayes's job. And if anything, coverage of Reade is still falling short of the woefully underplayed accusation last year against Trump by columnist E. Jean Carroll, who was quickly personally invited onto MSNBC then CNN in the days after her allegation went public. (At the time, Carroll's allegation had the same level of corroboration as Reade's; it now has far less. Reade has only appeared on TV on Hill.TV's Rising and on Democracy Now! ).\n\nThe answer lies in the structure of MSNBC, which since Trump's victory has constructed a ratings-chasing alternative universe for its mostly older viewers, where Trump is an unprecedentedly immoral and depraved political actor, the singular cause of everything that ails the United States (typically at the direction of one or another sinister foreign power), and must be vehemently opposed even on the rare occasions his actions line up with those of previous Democratic presidents, or even contradict older stances the network once opposed .\n\nAs part of this mission, the network has elevated and protected Biden's candidacy from criticism since the primary race last year - Hayes's show being a notable exception - and sold its largely Democratic-voting audience on the idea that he is the safest, least risky choice to go up against Trump.\n\nThough we can't know how Hayes's segment was received by most viewers, his decision to lightly challenge some of the core precepts fed to the network's viewers for the past four years ignited a minor rebellion . The hashtag #FireChrisHayes quickly started trending after the segment aired, with a host of Democrat-aligned Twitter users ripping Hayes for supposedly helping Trump's reelection chances with this segment.\n\nThe backlash to Hayes's segment is only the latest development in the 180-degree turn establishment Democrats have made on the matter of sexual assault, now that it stands to damage the current Democratic nominee. After adopting a maximalist stance on the issue in the wake of MeToo - arguing that any accuser's word was sufficient evidence, and using such allegations to go after political opponents, but also allies in some cases - Democrats have suddenly become far more conservative on the issue now it's their standard-bearer in question.\n\nFor more than a month, Democratic lawmakers simply ignored the allegation. Once it became impossible to avoid, they responded by closing ranks around Biden. The very day Reade's Biden-supporting former neighbor backed up her story, Biden received the endorsements of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton .\n\nA parade of Democrats who have called on the public to \"believe women\" when Republican sexual misconduct was the topic have either stayed mum on this latest news, or explicitly defended Biden , urging the public to believe the former vice president - with his own serious credibility problems - over an alleged survivor, and falsely claiming he had been exonerated by a New York Times investigation. This includes politicians who have built entire political identities on a hard-line stance on sexual assault allegations, such as Kirsten Gillibrand .\n\nThe reaction was much worse among Democrat-aligned media. A host of liberal and feminist columnists began drawing on the kinds of arguments typically used by Republicans and the Right more generally to dismiss sexual assault allegations.\n\nMother Jones blogger Kevin Drum deployed a carbon-copy of the Republicans' own case for dismissing Brett Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford: I'm sure she's not lying; she's just confused . Laurence Tribe, one of the fiercest liberal critics of both Trump and Kavanaugh , approvingly shared a USA Today piece dismissing Reade's story by heavily relying on just about every argument Democrats and liberals have correctly said for the past three years are inappropriate and insufficient to cast doubt on such an allegation. And the less said about the people convinced Reade is a Kremlin agent the better.\n\nSo Hayes deserves all the credit in the world for his work here, as do any other MSNBC anchors willing to hold Democrats' feet to the fire over this. There is clearly little appetite within MSNBC and other establishment media to treat this story in the way they've covered accusations against Republicans, and at least some vocal segment of the network's audience is unhappy that it's being covered at all. Biden will reportedly address the allegation directly tomorrow morning on MNSBC; it's an open question at this point if the network or CNN will give his accuser the same opportunity.\n\nBut it's also important to note how Biden's candidacy alone is already having a conservatizing effect on not just the Democratic Party, but liberal political culture. Less than three years after liberal commentators celebrated the way MeToo had changed the discourse around sexual misconduct and power relationships, some of those same commentators are now moonwalking in the opposite direction in a panic. At least some have even downplayed Biden's disastrous decision to get advice on economic recovery from Larry Summers, even as it refutes Biden's public pledge to govern as the \"most progressive president since FDR.\"\n\nShould he become president, we can look forward to at least four years of these quarters justifying a host of conservative policy decisions by his administration, lest the party leader be damaged.\n\nThere is a conversation to be had about what standards exactly the media should use when reporting on high-profile sexual assault allegations after this. What level of corroboration is enough? Were the two witnesses Reade started out with sufficient to break the story there and then? Should media outlets have reported Christine Blasey Ford's accusation when their sourcing consisted entirely of an anonymous letter they hadn't even seen? These and others are fair questions that may not have easy answers.\n\nBut the decision by Democrats and some of their media allies to change their standards and flip-flop shamelessly on this issue depending on how it suits their partisan interests is not part of this conversation, and does no favors to either the Democratic Party or, more importantly, survivors themselves. Chris Hayes deserves credit for refusing to join their ranks.\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .

(Spencer Platt / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nMore than a year on, the saga of Tara Reade - the woman who accused Joe Biden of sexually assaulting her nearly thirty years ago, before being vilified by the liberal press - continues to be unrivaled in the post-Me Too era for the way it was treated and litigated. And newly released exhibits and testimony from the New York attorney general's investigation into former governor Andrew Cuomo's allegations of sexual harassment show it was something else, too: a potential model for other embattled politicians to bat away allegations of their own.\n\nAt its heart, the Cuomo sexual harassment story was a workplace tale as old as time: a boss uses his power to mistreat, demean, and try and coerce his underlings, who, because their jobs and future careers depend on staying in his good graces, have to find a way to fend off the harassment without alienating him. In Cuomo's case, this behavior often took the form of clumsy, embarrassing sexual advances, along with even more serious cases of unwanted groping and kissing.\n\nWhile the Cuomo administration scrambled to neutralize what would turn out to be career-ending allegations from eleven women, his staffers looked to the Biden campaign's successful suppression of the Reade allegation for how to do so, raw exhibits and transcripts released last week from attorney general Letitia James's investigation into the accusations show. As has been typical of coverage of Reade since she came forward, the revelations have so far been ignored entirely by every sector of the press except for conservative outlets hostile to Biden.\n\nThe same day that initial Cuomo accuser Lindsey Boylan publicly leveled her claim online in December, Dani Lever - Cuomo's former press secretary, who remained part of his inner circle of confidantes working on the political crisis even though she had moved on to a communications position at Facebook - looked to the Biden campaign circa April 2020 for how to respond. \"Pull what Biden said when he was accused during campaign,\" Lever wrote to her colleagues.\n\nThat would be Biden's April 2020 statement that \"this absolutely did not happen\" and that while \"women have a right to be heard,\" those \"claims should also be diligently reviewed by an independent press.\" It was a statement that happened to foreshadow a flurry of markedly negative press coverage of Reade and her life that had little to do with the substance of her allegation and that no modern accuser has been subjected to before or since. \"I think we can victim shame on the record,\" Lever concluded.\n\nThis isn't the only time Biden's name appears in the materials released last week. Former Cuomo chief of staff Linda Lacewell, another confidante who worked on handling the matter despite having moved on to a new job , was asked by investigators about having \"done some research about how President Biden and Mike Bloomberg handled allegations of sexual harassment\" and testified she was trying \"to identify how other individuals had responded and put that into the mix of the conversation and the analysis and the discussion.\" A different exhibit appears to show Lacewell emailing herself the Biden statement four months after Boylan's accusation, after two more women had come forward with their own stories of Cuomo's harassment.\n\nLever and Lacewell were both implicated by the attorney general's report in August in an attempt to discredit Boylan by attacking her character, though it was not known until now that the Biden campaign served as their template. The \"victim sham[ing]\" that Lever urged took the form of leaking \"confidential\" and \"privileged\" files to the press showing complaints against Boylan by other staffers when she worked for the state, both impugning her character and challenging her claims about why she left Cuomo's office.\n\nThese efforts were soon undercut, however. A set of other scandals, including Cuomo's involvement in covering up thousands of nursing home deaths during the pandemic and securing immunity for campaign donors who were implicated, had weakened Cuomo politically, creating the space for Boylan and other women's stories to be taken seriously. Finally, an official investigation by the attorney general whose results were released in August confirmed that Boylan's was not one isolated case, but one of many, all involving accusers who later testified under oath.\n\nHad this set of circumstances not unfolded, Boylan could very well have ended up like Reade did. Applying the standards of the post-Me Too era of reporting on sexual misconduct - which stressed the fallibility of survivors and the importance of corroboration over personal foibles - Reade's story had a lot going for it. It was corroborated by a friend she told at the time it happened, her brother, a tape of her mother calling in to Larry King not long after the alleged assault, decades-old divorce documents , a neighbor she told about the incident a few years later, and at least three other people whom she confided to about the incident in varying detail over the years. (For some perspective, Donald Trump accuser E. Jean Carroll had two people who recalled her telling them about her assault, and Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh's accuser Christine Blasey Ford, who was widely viewed as credible, was unable to produce any contemporaneous corroboration).\n\nInstead, once the slow-rolling allegation showed signs of doing political damage to Biden, who had rooted his challenge to Trump in \"decency\" and personal character, media coverage of Reade turned sharply negative in precisely the ways reporters had sworn off just a few years earlier. Reporters churned out pieces going into Reade's financial difficulties, her turbulent personal life, and printing statements from disgruntled landlords and other past acquaintances, turning the saga into a test of Reade's personal qualities and credibility, instead of a test of the corroborative evidence.\n\nIt all harkened back to the treatment Bill Clinton's accusers had received at the hands of reporters and political operatives more than two decades earlier. When the Intercept later published a detailed analysis of documents disputing the widely reported charge Reade had knowingly lied under oath about her academic history, the story wasn't picked up. The transcripts and exhibits released last week suggest Cuomo and his team hoped to engineer a similar outcome against Boylan: to leave her looking publicly isolated while maligning her character and credibility.\n\nIn another transcript , top Cuomo strategist Melissa DeRosa testifies on the process of putting together a letter in defense of Cuomo from dozens former female staffers, which would make a variety of charges: that Boylan was self-interested, that her timing was convenient, that she had initially withheld parts of her story, that she had spoken positively about Cuomo, and that they had never seen such behavior from the governor.\n\nThe effort paralleled the response from Biden's campaign and the anti-Trump press to Reade's allegation in early 2020, which drew on denials from copious former staffers and longtime Biden loyalists to throw cold water on the charge against the man who was by then solidified as Trump's election opponent.\n\n\"There was a consensus among the group that the negative op-ed was not the right way to go,\" DeRosa testified, referring to an earlier idea to have the governor \"push back on Lindsey\" by publishing an article lobbing personal and professional attacks on Boylan. That op-ed would be shared with and edited by Tina Tchen, the former head of Time's Up, a victim's advocacy organization set up in 2018 to give legal representation and public relations assistance to accusers of powerful sexual abusers and whose public relations firm was headed by Biden adviser Anita Dunn. (Tchen has now resigned over her covert assistance to Cuomo's team.) Reade herself had taken her case to Time's Up in January 2020 long before going public but was abruptly dropped after being told that they couldn't legally represent an accuser of a federal candidate because it would be a conflict of interest - a claim that's been disputed by others.\n\nAs DeRosa testified, the op-ed was ultimately nixed anyway, with advisors fearing it would do more harm than good, and the team decided to try put together the letter of support and denials from former staffers, taking a cue from the Biden camp. \"We thought that this was a more constructive, positive exercise to engage in, and that if ultimately we needed to put something out, this was something that Joe Biden had done,\" she explained.\n\nElsewhere, Lis Smith - Cuomo's former spokesperson who went on to serve as senior adviser for Pete Buttigieg's presidential campaign - testified regarding a message she wrote about her discussions with the New York Times about a piece on another Cuomo accuser , Anna Ruch.

The segment is worth watching - though as MSNBC mystifyingly hasn't put clips of it up on either its official website or YouTube channel and a transcript isn't yet available, you'll have to do so in pieces .\n\nWhy was this brave? After all, this is Hayes's job. And if anything, coverage of Reade is still falling short of the woefully underplayed accusation last year against Trump by columnist E. Jean Carroll, who was quickly personally invited onto MSNBC then CNN in the days after her allegation went public. (At the time, Carroll's allegation had the same level of corroboration as Reade's; it now has far less. Reade has only appeared on TV on Hill.TV's Rising and on Democracy Now! ).\n\nThe answer lies in the structure of MSNBC, which since Trump's victory has constructed a ratings-chasing alternative universe for its mostly older viewers, where Trump is an unprecedentedly immoral and depraved political actor, the singular cause of everything that ails the United States (typically at the direction of one or another sinister foreign power), and must be vehemently opposed even on the rare occasions his actions line up with those of previous Democratic presidents, or even contradict older stances the network once opposed .\n\nAs part of this mission, the network has elevated and protected Biden's candidacy from criticism since the primary race last year - Hayes's show being a notable exception - and sold its largely Democratic-voting audience on the idea that he is the safest, least risky choice to go up against Trump.\n\nThough we can't know how Hayes's segment was received by most viewers, his decision to lightly challenge some of the core precepts fed to the network's viewers for the past four years ignited a minor rebellion . The hashtag #FireChrisHayes quickly started trending after the segment aired, with a host of Democrat-aligned Twitter users ripping Hayes for supposedly helping Trump's reelection chances with this segment.\n\nThe backlash to Hayes's segment is only the latest development in the 180-degree turn establishment Democrats have made on the matter of sexual assault, now that it stands to damage the current Democratic nominee. After adopting a maximalist stance on the issue in the wake of MeToo - arguing that any accuser's word was sufficient evidence, and using such allegations to go after political opponents, but also allies in some cases - Democrats have suddenly become far more conservative on the issue now it's their standard-bearer in question.\n\nFor more than a month, Democratic lawmakers simply ignored the allegation. Once it became impossible to avoid, they responded by closing ranks around Biden. The very day Reade's Biden-supporting former neighbor backed up her story, Biden received the endorsements of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton .\n\nA parade of Democrats who have called on the public to \"believe women\" when Republican sexual misconduct was the topic have either stayed mum on this latest news, or explicitly defended Biden , urging the public to believe the former vice president - with his own serious credibility problems - over an alleged survivor, and falsely claiming he had been exonerated by a New York Times investigation. This includes politicians who have built entire political identities on a hard-line stance on sexual assault allegations, such as Kirsten Gillibrand .\n\nThe reaction was much worse among Democrat-aligned media. A host of liberal and feminist columnists began drawing on the kinds of arguments typically used by Republicans and the Right more generally to dismiss sexual assault allegations.\n\nMother Jones blogger Kevin Drum deployed a carbon-copy of the Republicans' own case for dismissing Brett Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford: I'm sure she's not lying; she's just confused . Laurence Tribe, one of the fiercest liberal critics of both Trump and Kavanaugh , approvingly shared a USA Today piece dismissing Reade's story by heavily relying on just about every argument Democrats and liberals have correctly said for the past three years are inappropriate and insufficient to cast doubt on such an allegation. And the less said about the people convinced Reade is a Kremlin agent the better.\n\nSo Hayes deserves all the credit in the world for his work here, as do any other MSNBC anchors willing to hold Democrats' feet to the fire over this. There is clearly little appetite within MSNBC and other establishment media to treat this story in the way they've covered accusations against Republicans, and at least some vocal segment of the network's audience is unhappy that it's being covered at all. Biden will reportedly address the allegation directly tomorrow morning on MNSBC; it's an open question at this point if the network or CNN will give his accuser the same opportunity.\n\nBut it's also important to note how Biden's candidacy alone is already having a conservatizing effect on not just the Democratic Party, but liberal political culture. Less than three years after liberal commentators celebrated the way MeToo had changed the discourse around sexual misconduct and power relationships, some of those same commentators are now moonwalking in the opposite direction in a panic. At least some have even downplayed Biden's disastrous decision to get advice on economic recovery from Larry Summers, even as it refutes Biden's public pledge to govern as the \"most progressive president since FDR.\"\n\nShould he become president, we can look forward to at least four years of these quarters justifying a host of conservative policy decisions by his administration, lest the party leader be damaged.\n\nThere is a conversation to be had about what standards exactly the media should use when reporting on high-profile sexual assault allegations after this. What level of corroboration is enough? Were the two witnesses Reade started out with sufficient to break the story there and then? Should media outlets have reported Christine Blasey Ford's accusation when their sourcing consisted entirely of an anonymous letter they hadn't even seen? These and others are fair questions that may not have easy answers.\n\nBut the decision by Democrats and some of their media allies to change their standards and flip-flop shamelessly on this issue depending on how it suits their partisan interests is not part of this conversation, and does no favors to either the Democratic Party or, more importantly, survivors themselves. Chris Hayes deserves credit for refusing to join their ranks.\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .

      "text": "Appeals Court Upholds $5 Million E. Jean Carroll Verdict\n\nJohn Lamparski NurPhoto/Zuma\n\nOn Monday, a federal appeals court tossed out Donald Trump's attempt to overturn the verdict against him in the 2023 civil suit filed by writer E. Jean Carroll.\n\n\"We conclude that Mr. Trump has not demonstrated that the district court erred in any of the challenged rulings,\" the ruling said . \"Further, he has not carried his burden to show that any claimed error or combination of claimed errors affected his substantial rights as required to warrant a new trial.\"\n\nIn March of last year, a federal jury found Trump liable for sexual abuse after Carroll alleged that he had raped her at Bergdorf Goodman in 1996. The jury also found that Trump had defamed her with his repeated denials. Trump was subsequently ordered to pay Carroll $5 million in compensatory and punitive damages, a ruling that he has been fighting since September.\n\nSince challenging the verdict, Trump has only repeated similarly defamatory comments about Carroll. During one press conference, he accused her of stealing her story from an episode of Law & Order and calling a photo of the two of them \"AI-generated.\"\n\nThose attacks have continued. Earlier this week, Trump reposted a photo of Carroll with the caption \"Should a woman go to jail for falsely accusing a man of rape? Retruth if you want justice for Trump,\" hinting once again that he's hoping to prosecute his perceived enemies upon returning to office.\n\nCorrection, December 30: This post has been updated to note that a civil court in the 2023 case found Trump liable.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "A Federal Judge Has Gone to Great Lengths to Make Clear Trump Really Did Rape E. Jean Carroll\n\nElizabeth Williams/AP\n\nDistrict Judge Lewis Kaplan has said it multiple times: Donald Trump raped E. Jean Carroll in 1996. Kaplan wrote it in May 2023, when he presided over one of the trials against Trump. And he reminded jurors of the rape this week, during the latest proceedings in the multi-layered, winding rape and defamation cases brought against Trump by Carroll.\n\nLast spring, author and journalist Carroll sued Trump, testifying that he had raped her decades ago and had defamed her since by denying the accusations. Carroll won that suit. The jury found Trump liable for sexual assault and said he must pay $5 million-but they came short of saying he had raped her due to the legal scope of New York State's penal code.\n\nIn New York, someone can only be convicted of rape if they can prove vaginal penetration by a penis. In Carroll's testimony, which mirrored what she had described privately for decades and publicly for the first time in 2019, she said Trump used both his fingers and his penis in the assault. But during the trial, the jury had only concluded that Trump had \"deliberately and forcibly penetrated Ms. Carroll's vagina with his fingers, causing immediate pain and long lasting emotional and psychological harm,\" Kaplan's decision from last year reads.\n\nThat the jurors did not find that Carroll had proven rape, Kaplan explained, \"does not mean that she failed to prove that Mr. Trump 'raped' her as many people commonly understand the word 'rape.'\" \"Indeed,\" he continued, \"as the evidence at trial recounted below makes clear, the jury found that Mr. Trump in fact did exactly that.\"\n\nFederally, rape is defined as \"penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.\" This broader explanation, while still dependent on penetration, would include assaults using fingers.\n\nEven though Carroll's case has taken place in the national spotlight, it exists within the confines of civil law. The reason Donald Trump was not found to have raped E. Jean Carroll has less to do with the events detailed in her story, and more to do with the fine print of the state's legal code. The minutiae of New York's law allows the former president, his supporters, and sexual violence cynics alike to tout the case as proof that Trump is not a rapist (notwithstanding the tens of other accusations of sexual misconduct against him). Following Carroll's initial testimony, Republican senators did just that. \"The whole case is a joke,\" Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said. \"It makes me want to vote for him twice,\" Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) told HuffPost .\n\nHad this case happened outside of New York, however, the verdict could have been different.\n\nAcross the country, states' criminal and civil legal systems vary quite a bit in how they define rape and other charges of sexual violence. Some, like Idaho , explicitly require penile penetration to be present for a rape charge, while others like Maine and Maryland have a more expansive definition of sexual violence that encompasses non-penetrative acts. Several states don't have any \"rape\" charge at all, but opt for language like \" criminal sexual assault \" or \" sexual battery .\" Similarly, the phrase \"sexual intercourse\" takes on different meanings depending on the legal text.\n\nIn short, the same person could commit precisely the same crime and be charged with entirely different things based on the court room's address. This dissonance deepens the complexities of trying to obtain justice for survivors. And, as Mother Jones has previously reported , more women who come forward with their experiences of assault are being met with libel claims-instances that, as Carroll's case has shown, depend greatly on what language is used by the state to describe sexual violence.\n\nIn the court room on Tuesday, Carroll explained the fear she's endured over the past years, citing that she now sleeps with a gun next to her bed. \"I was attacked. I was attacked on Twitter. I was attacked on Facebook, I was attacked on news blogs,\" she said. \"I was brutally attacked.\" These threats include, amongst other things, that she ought to be raped.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Trump Must Pay E. Jean Carroll $83.3 Million for Defamation in Rape Case\n\nMichael M. Santiago/Getty; Brynn Anderson/AP\n\nJurors in the defamation case against Donald Trump took less than three hours to decide that Trump should pay $83.3 million to writer E. Jean Carroll for defaming her after she claimed Trump raped her in the 1990s in a downtown New York City department store. A jury in a related trial last year determined that Trump was liable for the rape and concluded that he owed Carroll $5 million for denigrating her in public in the fall of 2022. This second trial relates to comments Trump made in 2019, when Carroll first went public with her story. At that time, Trump denied that he had ever even met her and said she was not his \"type,\" among other things. Carroll testified at both trials that Trump's attacks unleashed an avalanche of online hatred, put her in fear for her life, and left her career and personal reputation in tatters.\n\nIn court on Friday, Carroll's attorneys asked jurors to award her $24 million in damages in this case.\n\n\"One of the questions you have to decide is whether he acted with malice,\" Shawn Crowley, a Carroll attorney, told the jurors during closing statements. \"What could be more on-brand for Donald Trump than malice?\"\n\n\"This isn't a campaign rally-it's not a press event. This is a court of law. And it's Ms. Carroll's life,\" Crowley added. \"Donald Trump sexually assaulted her. He defamed her. He keeps defaming her. He is not the victim. This is her life. Help her take it back. Make it stop. Make him pay enough so that he will stop.\"\n\nThe jury was sent to deliberate about 1:45 p.m. on Friday afternoon, and by 4:30 p.m. it had reached a verdict. The jurors weren't asked in this case to determine whether Trump had raped Carroll. Federal court judge Lewis Kaplan repeatedly explained to the them that, legally, this question had already been decided. Their job was to focus on the alleged defamation. The jury awarded Carroll $7.3 million to compensate for her loss in reputation, $11 million to help repair her reputation, and $65 million in punitive damages.\n\nLast week, when Donald Trump started complaining loudly in the courtroom where he was on trial, Kaplan warned the former president to behave himself or face consequences.\n\n\"You can't control yourself,\" Kaplan told Trump.\n\n\"You can't either,\" Trump shot back.\n\nBy the end of the trial, Kaplan did mostly control Trump, limiting his testimony to a mere three minutes and cutting Trump off whenever he strayed from the topic at hand. On Friday, Trump tried one last act of defiance: standing and walking out of the courtroom while Roberta Kaplan, an attorney for Carroll (who is not related to the judge), delivered a closing statement to jurors. While such an act is not strictly forbidden, it does violate accepted decorum for a federal court proceeding. Judge Kaplan ordered Trump's departure to be noted for the record.\n\nTrump stormed out after Kaplan told the jury that Trump had spent the whole trial \"continuing to engage in defamation.\"\n\nLast year, in another civil trial, jurors were asked to evaluate Carroll's story-that she ran into Trump in a fancy Manhattan department store in the mid-1990s and after flirtatious banter he cornered her in a dressing room and raped her. They also had to determine if he had defamed her with his denials. That jury found that Trump was liable for the sexual assault and said Trump owed Carroll $5 million for defamation. At the beginning of this trial, Judge Kaplan ruled that it was fact that Trump had raped Carroll and that the only question left to jurors was how much she was owed in damages.\n\nKaplan told the jurors that Trump had continued to defame Carroll throughout this trial-in loud whispers in the courtroom, at press conferences outside the court, and on social media, as he continued to claim he had never met her. She even played clips of Trump's recent press conferences for jurors on Friday. For his part, Trump posted on Truth Social numerous screeds against Carroll and Kaplan .\n\nTrump returned to the courtroom for the closing statements of his attorney, Alina Habba, who assailed Carroll, asserting she had invited the notoriety and has enjoyed all the attention generated by these cases. Habba also argued with Judge Kaplan, who cut her off when she tried to say Carroll's allegation of assault wasn't true.\n\n\"In our country you have the right to speak,\" Habba complained.\n\n\"You have a constitutional right to some kinds of speech and not others,\" Judge Kaplan told her.\n\nTrump was not in the courtroom when the verdict was read. Following the verdict, Kaplan dismissed the jurors but advised them they might want to protect their anonymity.\n\n\"My advice to you is that you never disclose that you were on this jury,\" Kaplan said.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Is Anyone Really Listening to E. Jean Carroll?\n\nMother Jones; Luiz C. Ribeiro/NY Daily News/Getty\n\nUpdate, May 9: On Tuesday, a federal jury found Donald Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation in E. Jean Carroll's civil lawsuit. The former president has been ordered to pay Carroll $5 million.\n\nIs Donald Trump a rapist?\n\nThe question is at the center of E. Jean Carroll's civil suit against the former president, in which the writer and former advice columnist accuses him of sexual assault and defamation. Carroll, who in 2019 came forward with allegations that Trump attacked her inside a dressing room in the 1990s, is seeking unspecified damages.\n\nBut is anyone actually paying attention? I can't help but feel as though the concrete things said and done in the courtroom have failed to truly puncture the public consciousness.\n\nIt makes sense, on some level. Though Carroll's allegations are the most serious among the sexual assault claims that have been made against Trump, the public has endured years of similar stories pointing to his endless misdeeds-even these specific misdeeds. Still, I've still been taken aback by what has felt like a collective apathy toward the catastrophic description of a woman's trauma.\n\nIt's true that news outlets, including this magazine , have reported on the trial with dutiful rigor. But within the public discourse, there's been far less chatter as the drama continues to unfold-as Carroll, deftly and movingly, testifies. Measure public awareness of E. Jean C arroll v. Donald Trump against the obsessive coverage of Trump's four-mile hike downtown to get arrested last month, and sexual assault charges against the former president finally getting a day in court, feels strangely small. Put it up against the impeachment proceedings, and there's no contest. Perhaps it's because this isn't a criminal trial; Trump, no matter the verdict, will not be a convicted rapist nor will he face real punishment beyond a potential monetary one.\n\nStill, to pass over Carroll's poignant testimony, along with Trump lawyer Joe Tacopina's snarling cross-examination tactics, would be to miss several critical indictments far beyond the matter of Trump's guilt.  Here's one telling snapshot, from my colleague Russ Choma , in which Carroll pushes back against Tacopina as he browbeats her:\n\nWhen Tacopina tried to challenge Carroll about why she did not scream when Trump was allegedly raping her violently, Carroll ultimately delivered a strong rebuke.\n\n\"I'm not a screamer, I was in too much of a panic, I was fighting,\" she responded to his initial query.\n\nTacopina pressed further-and Carroll pushed back. \"You can't beat up on me for not screaming,\" she said, firmly.\n\n\"I'm not beating you up!\" Tacopina said, appearing flustered.\n\n\"Women who don't come forward-one of the reasons they don't come forward is because they all get asked, 'Why didn't you scream?'\" Carroll said, her voice rising. \"Some women scream, some women don't. It keeps them silent.\"\n\n\"You'd better have a good excuse as to why you didn't scream; if you don't scream, you weren't raped ,\" Carroll continued, mocking his line of questioning. \"I'm telling you, he raped me, whether I screamed or not!\"\n\nAt this point, Carroll began to cry.\n\nTacopina asked whether she needed a moment. \"No, you go on,\" she said icily. \"I don't need an excuse for not screaming.\"\n\nSuch scenes, alternatingly maddening and captivating, feel ripped from a bygone era. Tacopina's questions are shining examples of what not to ask a rape victim. That they are taking place in a high-profile civil suit only five years after #MeToo erupted into a global movement is perhaps the clearest evidence that accounts of sexual assault still are not taken seriously.\n\nThat Carroll's time on the stand hasn't reached every inch of the public discourse reveals how we treat trauma when it fails to be about punishment. It has not enticed a weary audience that has become convinced that stories of Trump's hideous behavior, relentless and overwhelming, don't matter. Maybe they're even boring now. It seems there is only one question people seem to care about: Is Trump finally going to jail?\n\nIn the case of Carroll's trial, countless factors could have contributed to such nihilism. For one, there's her age. At 79, she is long past the point when women say they begin to feel invisible and overlooked . (In a cruel twist, Carroll's age, according to her skeptics, underscores how much time has passed since her alleged encounter with Trump, and is therefore suspicious.)\n\nAnd then there's the lack of video or audio recordings from inside the courtroom, denying Carroll's remarks the fuel to hit social media virality, which has become an unfortunate barometer of newsworthiness. So, we're left to read in order to keep abreast of the trial, and reading Carroll's description of profound suffering is no easy task; it's somewhat understandable why one would skip over such difficult material. But then, what is lost when we fail to pay attention to those who are willing to come forward? The question is all the more urgent when allegations relate to Donald Trump, a man who, thus far, has escaped accountability for endless sins.\n\n\"I regretted it about 100 times,\" Carroll said on Wednesday when asked about her decision to go public, \"but in the end being able to get my day in court...I'm crying, but I got to tell my story in court.\" Carroll testified in another moment: \"His hand, his finger went into my vagina, which was extremely painful. It was a horrible feeling. He put his hand inside me and curved his finger. As I sit here today, I can still feel it. Then he inserted his penis.\"\n\nImagine that those words emerged not today but in October 2016. Would they have carried the same electoral threat that the Access Hollywood tape did? There's a reason Carroll's lawyers fought to play the recording as evidence for jurors. But nearly seven years after unabating scandals and now a likely Biden-Trump rematch, it's somewhat incredible to recall how much \"grab them by the pussy\" once shocked us. Trump and his henchmen no longer surprise us. But why aren't we horrified?\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Donald Trump Has One Week Left to Pay E. Jean Carroll. But Will He?\n\nMother Jones illustration; Edna Leshowitz/ZUMA; Patrick Semansky/AP\n\nLawyers for E. Jean Carroll are urging the judge in her defamation case against Donald Trump to reject the former president's last-minute request to avoid paying the $83.3 million Carroll had been awarded as he appeals the ruling.\n\nIn a new filing on Thursday, Carroll's lawyers blasted the request, arguing that it amounted to little more than a \"trust me\" written on a \"paper napkin\" by a cash-poor man with a long record of stiffing legal bills , incurring enormous debts , flouting financial deadlines , and inflating his wealth . They also pointed to the other legal battles Trump is mired in-including the civil fraud case in which Trump has been ordered to pay a $454 million penalty-as reason to deeply question his cash position.\n\n\"Trump does not even mention, much less address, these developments, which are obviously highly relevant to his ability to satisfy the judgment here,\" Carroll's lawyers wrote in their filing. \"Nor does Trump mention the four criminal cases he is currently facing, including one set to go to trial on March 25, 2024.\"\n\nSince winning her defamation case against Trump, Carroll has since publicly vowed to use the $83.3 million award for \" something good ,\" hinting that she may dedicate the money to assisting other women who have accused Trump of sexual assault. \"If it'll cause him pain for me to give money to certain things, that's my intent,\" Carroll told George Stephanopoulos in January.\n\nSo what happens next? If the judge denies Trump's request to delay payment, the former president is hoping that he'll be allowed to post a bond to only partially cover the $83.3 million award. But as the New York Times reports, posting a bond poses its own challenges as that option would require the company providing one to pay up if Trump ends up dodging responsibility. It's unclear what would happen if Trump simply refuses to pay. But in the situation of his civil fraud case, New York Attorney General Letitia James has already signaled that she is coming for his properties .\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Jury to Decide Whether Donald Trump Raped and Defamed E. Jean Carroll\n\nStephanie Keith/Getty; Robert Perry/Getty\n\nAttorneys for both sides in Donald Trump's sexual assault and defamation civil lawsuit made their final pleas to the jury Monday, with rival attorneys for Trump and E. Jean Carroll, the writer who says Trump raped her in a department store dressing room in 1996, talking for hours, trying to sum up their cases.\n\nCarroll's attorneys said Trump wanted jurors to believe that not only was she lying, so were two friends who testified that Carroll told them of the alleged attack at the time it happened, two other women who testified about similar experiences with Trump, and multiple witnesses who testified that Carroll's recollection of the Bergdorf Goodman department store, where Carroll says the attack took place, was accurate. \"This is not a he said, she said,\" Roberta Kaplan, one of Carroll's attorneys, told jurors. \"It's what Donald Trump says vs. what all 11 of these witnesses said in that chair over there.\"\n\n\"In order for you to find for him, you need to conclude that Donald Trump, the nonstop liar, is the only person in this courtroom who has been telling the truth,\" she added.\n\nKaplan said that Trump actually wanted jurors to believe that all these people had concocted a giant conspiracy-a \"big lie\" to get Trump-for political reasons. \"I'm sorry, seriously? \" she said scoffing. \"That's just ridiculous. There's no evidence, not a shred, that a conspiracy exists.\"\n\nBut that is exactly what Trump's lawyer, Joe Tacopina , claimed during his nearly two-and-a-half-hour closing argument. He meandered at times, eventually building up to a shouting crescendo, calling Carroll a liar, and insisting there was indeed a conspiracy against his client. Tacopina's strategy seemed to involve sowing doubt in every way possible, as he offered a variety of ways the conspiracy might have developed and blamed various people, primarily Carroll. He claimed that Trump's accuser and her two friends, Lisa Bernbach and Carol Martin-the ones who testified she'd told them about the incident shortly after-cooked up a story because they hated Trump for his politics.\n\nUntil she began working on her 2019 book, Carroll contends, Bernbach and Martin were the only people she had told in the decades since the assault. \"She told two very, very close friends to go along with a story that started off as a book,\" Tacopina told jurors. \"They hated him with a passion and never thought it would go further.\"\n\nTacopina said that after Carroll encountered Republican operative George Conway, a prominent anti-Trump Republican who Tacopina repeatedly mislabled a \"Democratic attorney,\" Conway \"got his hooks into her\" and convinced her to sue. The lawyer focused on a text Martin had sent to another friend in 2021, discussing Carroll's involvement with an initially unsuccessful New York bill that would have given sexual assault victims a one-year window to sue their attackers, no matter how old the incident. The bill did pass the following year, allowing Carroll to sue Trump. In the text, Martin had complained that Carroll was celebrating something that \"hasn't really happened.\"\n\nTacopina said the message referred to Carroll's assault story. But her attorneys countered that it referred to the bill's passage, which had not yet occurred.\n\nCarroll's attorneys spent most of their closing argument focusing on a theme similar to one from their opening-that Trump has a modus operandi with women. He used it in his alleged attack on Carroll, they said, and on multiple others who testified about alleged assaults; Trump described it himself in the infamous Access Hollywood tape .\n\nCarroll previously testified that she ran into Trump at Bergdorf Goodman, across from Trump Tower, in early spring 1996. Carroll said that after he asked her to help him find a gift for a woman, they wandered the store flirting, and then he led her into a dressing room where he abruptly lunged at her, slamming her against the wall, forcefully kissing her and grabbing her genitals before raping her.\n\nTwo witnesses related their own, similar stories for the jury: One is journalist Natasha Stoynoff, who testified that Trump had grabbed her and pushed her against the wall and kissed her at Mar-a-Lago. The other is Jessica Leeds, who alleges Trump grabbed her, groped her, and forcefully kissed her when they were seated next to each other on an airplane. Carroll's attorneys also repeatedly played the Access Hollywood tape, in which Trump was caught on a hot mic bragging about how he took one woman shopping and tried to seduce her-and suggesting that he sometimes approaches women he desires by kissing them and grabbing their genitals.\n\nTacopina tried to downplay the tape, calling it an example of \"locker room talk,\" but Carroll attorney Mike Ferrara begged to differ: \"I have another word for it. It was a confession,\" he said. \"Locker room talk can be crude. That's not what that was. That video is a confession.\"\n\nTacopina also defended himself to jurors about a testy exchange he had with Carroll when she was on the stand, in which he pressed her about why she didn't scream during the alleged assault. Carroll said she didn't need an excuse. As I wrote previously , Carroll turned the tables on Tacopina that day:\n\n\"Women who don't come forward-one of the reasons they don't come forward is because they all get asked, 'Why didn't you scream?'\" Carroll said, her voice rising. \"Some women scream, some women don't. It keeps them silent.\"\n\n\"You'd better have a good excuse as to why you didn't scream; if you don't scream, you weren't raped ,\" Carroll continued, mocking his line of questioning. \"I'm telling you, he raped me, whether I screamed or not!\"\n\nOn Monday, Tacopina insisted he wasn't wrong to question Carroll on why she didn't scream or call the police.\n\n\"I'm a father of two daughters. I would never tell a real rape victim on how they should act,\" Tacopina said.\n\nFerrara shot back in a rebuttal after Tacopina spoke: \"It feels like the defense has this idea of the perfect rape victim,\" he said. \"The perfect rape victim never flirts. The perfect rape victim always screams. The prefect rape victim never goes back to where they were raped. The perfect rape victim tells the police but never speaks about it in public. In their version, a perfect rape victim burns whatever clothes they were wearing, and never laughs again, never tries to hold their rapist accountable. It's the defense's out of date view-as wrong as it is offensive.\"\n\nThe jury will receive its final jury instructions Tuesday morning and begin deliberations. They will be asked to consider both whether Trump assaulted Carroll and whether he defamed her when he called her a liar and said she was \"not my type\" after she went public.\n\nOn the first question-the assault-jurors will decide based on a preponderance of evidence, a much lower standard than the one used in criminal cases. It only requires jurors to conclude that Trump more likely than not assaulted Carroll. If they do find Trump liable, they will then decide whether Trump defamed her, with a slightly higher standard of evidence, and decide how much money, if any, Carroll is entitled to. In closing arguments, Carroll's attorneys said they were not asking for a specific sum because Carroll has said her case is not about money, but about restoring her reputation.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Trump Asked to Appeal His Defamation Verdict, Then Spent 40 Minutes Insulting His Victims\n\nStefan Jeremiah/AP\n\nI'm no legal expert, but I've got a sneaky suspicion that if you've just asked a judge to reconsider the verdict in your defamation case, you probably shouldn't repeat similarly defamatory statements during a press conference later that same day.\n\nBut, of course, that's precisely what Donald Trump did.\n\nAfter appearing in a federal appeals court to fight his verdict in the E. Jean Carroll defamation case, Donald Trump proceeded to bash Carroll and several other women who've accused him of sexual assault for nearly an hour during a press conference on Friday.\n\nLast year, the ex-president was ordered to pay Carroll $5 million after a civil court found him liable for sexually assaulting her in the mid-1990s and then subsequently defaming her once she told the public her story.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump was found liable yet again in a separate civil lawsuit for additional remarks he'd made in 2019 when she first came forward, including the assertion that she \"wasn't his type\"-a venomous insult that made a reappearance during today's press conference.\n\n\"She would not have been the chosen one,\" said Trump, referencing an unnamed woman who he allegedly assaulted in the '70s on an airplane-one of many sexual assault allegations that Trump dredged up during this conference.\n\nBut this wasn't the only such remark Trump made that afternoon. He also took aim at Carroll directly, claiming again that he didn't know who she was and accusing her of stealing her story from a Law & Order episode.\n\nHe also claimed to have never met her, called a picture of them together potentially \" AI-generated ,\" and then later admitted that they did meet but claimed that meeting didn't count.\n\nHe also, for whatever reason, insulted his own lawyers, who were standing right behind him, saying, \"I'm disappointed in my legal talent, to be honest with you.\"\n\nThe entire rant was chaotic, even by Trump's standards. It will be interesting to see how it impacts the GOP presidential nominee's chances at an appeal in the coming weeks-according to a report before his rambling speech today, the judge was already \"skeptical.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Donald Trump Sexually Abused and Defamed E. Jean Carroll, Jury Finds\n\nJohn Minchillo/AP\n\nA federal jury has found Donald Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation in a civil lawsuit brought by writer E. Jean Carroll, who alleged that Trump raped her in 1996 in the dressing room of a New York City department store. The jury found that Carroll's attorneys had failed to prove the rape allegation, but the jurors did agree that Trump had forcibly sexually abused her. The jury determined that Trump must pay Carroll $5 million.\n\nThe nine-person jury-a panel of six men and three women-took less than three hours to deliberate. The short deliberation was something of a surprise. Carroll herself was on the stand for several days, describing the alleged incident. Trump's attorney, Joe Tacopina, talked for more than two-and-a-half hours in his closing argument on Monday, nearly as long as the jury deliberated.\n\nCarroll wrote a book in 2019 in which she accused Trump of the assault, which she said took place after she ran into him at the Bergdorf Goodman department store, located across the street from Trump Tower. On the stand, Carroll testified that she immediately told two friends, both of whom testified on her behalf, but that she didn't tell anyone else about the alleged attack until 2018, when she began work on her book. After Carroll went public with the story, Trump lashed out, calling her a liar and saying she wasn't \"my type\"-which Carroll testified she interpreted to mean she was \"too ugly to rape.\" She sued him for defamation, but the case got bogged down in arguments over whether Trump was protected from the lawsuit because of his role as president. But when Trump repeated his comments in November 2022, Carroll filed a new lawsuit.\n\nTrump did not attend the trial, and Tacopina presented no witnesses on his behalf. But in both his opening and closing statements, Tacopina aggressively accused Carroll of lying, saying she was trying to harm Trump's political fortunes and make herself a celebrity. The jury clearly disagreed.\n\nWhile jurors didn't find Trump liable for raping Carroll, the verdict was largely a vindication of her story. The jury had three options to choose from if they believed Trump committed battery: They could have found that Trump had raped her; that he had sexually abused her; or that he had forcibly touched her. By choosing the second option, the jurors apparently indicated they believed the bulk of Carroll's story-that Trump pounced on her, threw her against the wall of a dressing room, forcibly kissed her, and shoved his hand up her dress and grabbed her genitals. Carroll said that Trump had also inserted his penis, but the jury evidently did not believe that Carroll's attorneys had proved that allegation.\n\nAfter the verdict, Trump immediately took to his Truth Social platform, where he called the outcome \"A DISGRACE - A CONTINUATION OF THE GREATEST WITCH HUNT OF ALL TIME!\" Carroll, who left the court with a broad smile, gave no comment to reporters there.\n\nUpdate: Carroll released a statement Tuesday evening saying it was a victory for all victims of sexual assault who aren't believed.\n\n\"I filed this lawsuit against Donald Trump to clear my name and to get my life back. Today, the world finally knows the truth. This victory is not just for me but for every woman who has suffered because she was not believed,\" she said.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Jean Carroll Case\n\nEdna Leshowitz/Zuma\n\nA federal judge on Friday shot down Donald Trump's attempt to delay a defamation lawsuit from writer E. Jean Carroll, calling the former president's appeal \"frivolous.\"\n\nIn May, a Manhattan jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing Carroll and defaming her in a series of public comments after her accusation. In 2019, before that lawsuit, Carroll had filed a separate defamation suit, which is now working its way through the federal court system.\n\nThe original defamation suit has been delayed over arguments about whether Trump deserved presidential immunity since he was in office at the time the suit was filed. In June, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan found that Trump did not deserve presidential immunity and that the defamation case could move forward. Trump appealed that decision, claiming that he would suffer irreparable harm from a trial scheduled for January 15, 2024. But Kaplan appears to have grown tired of Trump's delay tactics.\n\n\"The only purported harm Mr. Trump reasonably may claim he would suffer in this case would be having to stand trial,\" he wrote. \"This court certifies that the appeal itself is frivolous.\"\n\nRead the judge's opinion here:\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Trump Defamed E. Jean Carroll Again, Federal Court Finds\n\nJohn Minchillo/AP\n\nA federal court has, for the second time this year, ruled that Donald Trump defamed E. Jean Carroll, who accused the former president of sexually assaulting her in a New York department store dressing room in 1996. On Wednesday, US District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan declared that Carroll had sufficiently proved in a previous civil case that Trump's comments about her sexual assault allegations were libelous. Now, the upcoming trial-slated for January 2024-will focus only on what the billionaire owes Carroll in damages.\n\nIn 2019, after Carroll published a book containing the sexual violence allegations, Trump attacked her credibility and physical appearance in the press. As my colleague Russ Choma previously wrote , another jury found Trump culpable for both sexual abuse and defamation in May, convinced by Carroll's account of Trump's assault.\n\nAfter Carroll went public with the story, Trump lashed out, calling her a liar and saying she wasn't \"my type\"-which Carroll testified she interpreted to mean she was \"too ugly to rape.\" She sued him for defamation, but the case got bogged down in arguments over whether Trump was protected from the lawsuit because of his role as president. But when Trump repeated his comments in November 2022, Carroll filed a new lawsuit.\n\nAfter only three hours of deliberation, the jury found Trump's 2022 comments defamatory. That verdict became the basis for Kaplan's determination of whether or not Trump's comments in 2019 were similarly disparaging.\n\n\"The truth or falsity of Mr. Trump's 2019 statements therefore depends-like the truth or falsity of his 2022 statement-on whether Ms. Carroll lied about Mr. Trump sexually assaulting her. The jury's finding that she did not therefore is binding in this case and precludes Mr. Trump from contesting the falsity of his 2019 statements,\" Kaplan wrote, according to NBC News .\n\nKaplan's decision is only the most recent loss for Trump's legal team. In August, another federal judge tossed out the ex-president's appeal in the 2019 case, calling it \"frivolous.\" Now, Trump will have to pay Carroll an undetermined amount in damages-adding to the $5 million he already owes her from the previous defamation case.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Jean Carroll, my mother and the power of staying visible\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nIt took a Manhattan jury less than three hours to decide that Donald Trump should pay E. Jean Carroll $83.3 million for defamation. This was just the damages part of the trial. Last year Trump was found liable for sexually abusing Carroll in the spring of 1996. For many of us, watching Trump actually being held accountable for something  felt like a shock to the system. We so often see him evade responsibility, kick the can or, worse, we see others take the blame while he remains relatively unscathed.\n\nWomen like my mother and Carroll have seen some of their biggest victories of our society reversed by Trump.\n\nGiven that so far after the verdict Trump seems to be refraining from making potentially defamatory statements about Carroll , (something he struggled with throughout the trial) the damages number was probably an appropriate amount.\n\nI don't remember when I met the glamorous advice columnist E. Jean Carroll, but I do know that it was through my mom, feminist writer Erica Jong. They were very similar types, women in media in New York City. My mother wrote books; Carroll wrote an advice column. Both women are now in their 80s. They were contemporaries of now-77-year-old Trump. They went to the same parties, knew the same people, appeared on the same talk shows, frequented the same gossip pages. Shopped in the same stores, like Bergdorf Goodman, the department store where a jury found the sexual abuse happened.\n\nMy mother and Carroll are older now and just don't have the same kind of command over parties and news cycles. Women like my mother and Carroll have seen some of their biggest victories of our society reversed by Trump. Guarantees of rights they thought they'd always have, like Roe v. Wade, are gone. The Equal Rights Amendment was never passed. Many of their dreams of female equality today seem depressingly out of reach. They burned their bras, but we still very much wear ours.\n\nAmerica has a deeply misogynistic edge to it. As women get older, we're often treated with more and more contempt, if not altogether ignored by society. Age discrimination is significantly worse for women than for men. The irony of Trump, a man who's received numerous allegations of sexual assault and misconduct (he continues to deny them, even when found liable by law), finally being held accountable by a woman his own age, who he said was \" not his type ,\" is all the more gratifying because of this.\n\nI feel a bit of personal ownership around this case; Carroll met lawyer George Conway at my house, who introduced her to lawyer Robbie Kaplan, who represented her in her case against Trump. I remember a little of the conversation. Conway was going on about how impressive Kaplan was, who at the time was most famous for bringing down the Defense of Marriage Act, leading Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy to write that DOMA Section 3 \"violates basic due process and equal protection principles applicable to the Federal Government.\" Both Kaplan and Carroll are the kind of strong, accomplished women that tend not to hang around a Mar-a-Lago fashion show. Both believe that women should have more rights and not less.\n\nThere's more irony to the case: None of this could have even happened were it not for the Adult Survivors Act , the 2019 legislation that allowed victims of sexual assault to initiate civil suits past the normal statutory deadline. This legislation likely wouldn't have ever been enacted had it not been for the Me Too movement, which gained momentum in the years following the 2016 election of Trump and the misogynistic culture he promoted . So all of this is a product of a kind of Mobius strip of events and legislation.\n\nAt the time of the verdict, Carroll released a statement : \"I filed this lawsuit against Donald Trump to clear my name and to get my life back. This victory is not just for me but for every woman who has suffered because she was not believed.\"\n\nThe women of my mother's generation were born during World War II. They spent years fighting to matter the way men did. They were subjected to the kind of sexist treatment that would horrify millennials. These women fought ferociously for decades to expand their rights only to watch those rights begin to evaporate after 2016.\n\nWomen like my mother, Kaplan and Carroll have paid dearly in their fight to earn more rights for their daughters like me, and for future generations. Because of Trump, they're still fighting. And we need them. If anything, Thursday's verdict proves there is a very important place for women like them in society, women with the wisdom, tenacity and deep understanding of people who keep turning back time, limiting our rights and trying to ignore them.\n\nMolly Jong-Fast is a political analyst for MSNBC, special correspondent for Vanity Fair and host of the podcast \"Fast Politics with Molly Jong-Fast.\"\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

The former president has plenty of other things to talk about - rumor has it that the presidential general election phase is now underway - and as his lawyers have probably explained to the Republican, it would be in his financial interests to focus his rhetorical fire elsewhere.\n\nBut Trump just can't help himself. NBC News reported :\n\nFormer President Donald Trump on Saturday reiterated his claim that writer E. Jean Carroll had levied \"false accusations\" against him, even as similar remarks have resulted in large court judgments against him. Speaking at a Georgia campaign rally ... Trump reiterated a number of grievances, Carroll's civil court victories among them.\n\n\"I just posted a $91 million bond, $91 million on a fake story, totally made-up story,\" he said, referencing the bond he posted last week as he appeals a jury verdict against him. Trump added, \"Ninety-one million based on false accusations made about me by a woman that I knew nothing about, didn't know, never heard of, I know nothing about her.\"\n\nI can just picture the former president's defense counsel listening to the public remarks and smacking their foreheads.\n\nFor good measure, Trump spoke to CNBC this morning and went after Carroll once more , labeling her accusations as \"false,\" and describing her as \"Miss Bergdorf Goodman.\"\n\nTo briefly recap , it was last year when a jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing Carroll , and jurors awarded the writer $5 million in damages for her battery and defamation claims.\n\nThe jury did not find the defendant liable for \"rape\" as defined in the applicable state law, though the judge in the case later concluded that the former president, for all intents and purposes, \"'raped' her as many people commonly understand the word 'rape.'\"\n\nA couple of months ago, the matter became even more serious for Trump: A separate jury concluded that the former president must pay his accuser an additional $83 million in damages for repeatedly defaming her, including $65 million in punitive damages.\n\nBoth cases are being appealed. It would be in the defendant's interests to simply stop talking about the plaintiff.\n\nHe apparently doesn't want to. \"This woman is not a believable person,\" Trump told his followers on Saturday, though jurors came to the opposite conclusion.\n\nAs a New York Times report noted, \"Attacking Ms. Carroll is not free of risk for Mr. Trump: She could file a fresh defamation claim for new attacks. Her lawyer, Roberta Kaplan - who is not related to the judge - declined to comment.\"\n\nIt was against this backdrop that MSNBC's Jen Psaki asked Neal Katyal whether the former president had once again defamed Carroll. \"It sure sounds like it,\" the former acting solicitor general replied.\n\n\"And Jen, there are many days that I wish I was Roberta Kaplan, who is Jean Carroll's extraordinary lawyer, she's just so phenomenal as a lawyer. But, boy, today is the day I wish I was, because Donald Trump is basically just writing the third lawsuit,\" Katyal added.\n\nThis post updates our related earlier coverage .\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

      "text": "Why Trump showed up in court for his appeal of E. Jean Carroll's trial win\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nBy Lisa Rubin\n\nOn Thursday, Judge Tanya Chutkan held a status conference in Washington, D.C., to discuss how Donald Trump's federal election interference case - which carries four felony charges against the former president - should progress and how fast. Trump himself, however, was nowhere to be found.\n\nFast forward 24 hours to an ornate, immaculate courtroom in Manhattan's federal appeals court, where a three-judge panel heard oral argument on Trump's appeal of E. Jean Carroll's first civil trial verdict that found him liable for sexual abuse and defamation. Yet after skipping the entirety of the first Carroll trial and despite not being obligated to attend, Trump showed up for the argument.\n\nWith four of his lawyers already seated at their assigned table, Trump entered slowly, flanked only by four Secret Service agents and trailed by two of his most loyal legal and political advisers, Alina Habba and Boris Epshteyn. The Republican presidential nominee wore his classic business formal outfit: dark suit, white shirt, and a long, shiny red tie.\n\nThe Carroll case, on the other hand, plays right into the twin pillars of Trump's messaging: martyrdom and misogyny.\n\nAnd before the argument began, Trump did two notable - and chilling - acts. First, while still standing, he wheeled around and surveyed the gallery of assembled press and members of the public. Eyes narrowed, he glowered in an echo of trial days past . Then, taking his seat at the head of a table immediately behind his legal team, he turned to his right, seeming to appraise a tall blonde seated at a table directly across the room. But Carroll, in a nipped-waist skirt suit with her hair tied back with a girlish, satiny bow, stared straight ahead, just as she had for nearly all of her two trials.\n\nThus, even before the judges arrived, the scene was riveting. But a more fundamental question remains: Why did Trump come to court at all, especially given that this case involves his smallest outstanding liability and civil litigants are never required to appear?\n\nLet me posit a few potential reasons.\n\nFirst, should Trump win the November election, many legal experts assume he will either order his Department of Justice to withdraw the two federal cases against him and/or direct the attorney general to fire special counsel Jack Smith. But as president, he would have no ability to expunge any civil liabilities or halt his civil cases. Put another way, while a president could arguably pardon himself or end any criminal cases against him, Trump simply cannot campaign his way out of any of the civil judgments against him.\n\nStill, the first Carroll trial, which dealt with statements Trump made in fall 2022 , yielded a $5 million award for Carroll. That's a gargantuan sum to most of us. But even assuming Trump's self-proclaimed net worth is exaggerated , that's likely pocket change to him. So why would he care? Because although Friday's argument was technically limited to evidentiary issues at the first trial, it could also impact the much larger, $83.3 million verdict in the second trial, which concerned Trump's June 2019 statements .\n\nLast year, the trial judge overseeing both Carroll cases, Lewis Kaplan, determined that the first trial verdict established that Trump's substantively \"identical\" 2019 statements were also defamatory and, therefore, Trump's liability had already been adjudicated. All that was left for the second jury, Kaplan ruled, was to decide Carroll's damages. The flip side of Kaplan's decision, however, is that if the appeals court overturns the first verdict, it would necessarily destroy the second. And it could have been that hope - specifically, the hope of erasing nearly $90 million owed to Carroll - that brought Trump to watch the appeal.\n\nYet my guess is that his wallet wasn't the only or even primary reason Trump cared enough to visit yet another courtroom. Rather, it was his supporters' wallets that prompted Trump to go to court and then hold court at Trump Tower for nearly an hour .\n\nTrump and his campaign advisers well understand the perverse relationship between his perceived victimization through the civil and criminal cases against him , on the one hand, and his popularity among his base, on the other. And they recognize that Trump's fundraising peaks when he is - or simply portrays himself to be - in serious legal peril.\n\nFor example, according to Politico , Trump's best online fundraiser day of the first quarter of the year - and his third best overall since launching his presidential campaign in November 2022 - came on the same day that New York Attorney General Letitia James \"took initial steps toward seizing his assets in the event he failed to make bond\" in her civil fraud case, where she won a $450 million-plus verdict .\n\nSimilarly, The Associated Press reported that of Trump's $141 million fundraising haul in May, more than a third came from online contributions in the 24 hours after a jury found Trump guilty on all 34 felony fraud counts in his New York hush money case. But by August - shortly after the Supreme Court handed Trump a huge victory through its presidential immunity decision and while virtually all of Trump's cases were quiet, if not dormant - Trump's fundraising total fell below May levels while Vice President Kamala Harris raised $361 million, nearly tripling Trump for the month .\n\nThe Carroll case, on the other hand, plays right into the twin pillars of Trump's messaging: martyrdom and misogyny. Put another way, Trump stewed silently during court so he could unleash his grievances after, all with the goal of filling his campaign coffer and pushing back on Harris' \"prosecutor versus sexual abuser\" framing .\n\nAfter all, sometimes you can only win by losing. And Trump knows that well.\n\nLisa Rubin is an MSNBC legal correspondent and a former litigator.

      "text": "Who's afraid of Donald Trump?\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nBy Lisa Rubin\n\nEarlier this month, in a Manhattan courtroom practically coated in gleaming wood and brass, I saw what trauma looks like in a seated position. It looks like writer and advice columnist E. Jean Carroll on the first day of her second defamation trial against former President Donald Trump : not comfortably settled in her chair, but perched on its edge, her back ruler-straight, as if she were being pulled as far away from her assaulter, who sat two rows behind her, as possible - millimeter by millimeter.\n\nAnd she never turned around, not even during breaks in the action, much less got up. In those moments, E. Jean , usually the epitome of comportment and resolve, was so petrified that she appeared positively squirrel-like.\n\nAnd instead of looking down or away, she smiled, she was animated, she was emboldened. Once the hunted, she was now the fox.\n\nBut by the trial's last day, as one of her lawyers, Roberta Kaplan, delivered her closing argument, a different Carroll revealed herself. No longer fixing her gaze directly ahead, hands gripping the armrests, she swiveled around in her chair to enjoy Kaplan on the podium, a view that included Trump himself, until he unceremoniously walked out . And instead of looking down or away, she smiled, she was animated, she was emboldened. Once the hunted, she was now the fox.\n\nOn Monday night, just a few days after winning her second defamation trial against Trump for a combined award of $88.3 million, the fox explained that transformation to MSNBC's Rachel Maddow. Coming face-to-face with Trump for the first time in nearly 30 years was not the living nightmare she had imagined just days before the trial, when she had \"an actual breakdown,\" losing even her capacity to speak because of her fear. Rather, she told Rachel, she quickly observed that he was \"like a walrus snorting,\" adding:\n\nAmazingly, I looked out, and he was nothing. He was nothing. He was a phantom. It was the people around him who were giving him power. He himself was nothing. It was an astonishing discovery for me. He's nothing. We don't need to be afraid of him.\n\nIn the wake of Friday's verdict, I have been asked countless times: \"How long do you think it will take E. Jean to collect all that money?\" But that misunderstands what Carroll has been fighting for since 2019 and seems to have now secured: a freedom from fear of Trump - the freedom, at 80, to excavate and revive her witty, \"ebullient\" self, as her former boss Robbie Myers described the E. Jean she knew.\n\nAnd it's that freedom that makes Carroll even more remarkable. She encased herself in armor, only to find her assaulter reduced to a naked emperor. Meanwhile, millions of Americans remain utterly enthralled - or cowed - by Trump. What if, like E. Jean Carroll, the rest of us saw him for what he is and always has been: someone worth our bravest fight but \"nothing\" deserving of our deepest fear?\n\nLisa Rubin is an MSNBC legal correspondent and a former litigator.

Jean Carroll departs a Manhattan federal court at the conclusion of her defamation suit against Donald Trump on January 26, 2024, in New York City.\n\nIt took the jury less than three hours to hit disgraced former president Donald Trump with another massive legal loss, awarding writer E. Jean Carroll $83.3 million in compensatory and punitive damages for defaming her after an earlier jury found Trump liable for sexually assaulting her and ordered a fine of $5 million.\n\nJudge Lewis Kaplan instructed the jurors to keep their identities secret. He took the MAGA threats against court officials and jurors so seriously that he urged the jurors not to use their real names in their deliberations with one another. The jurors, according to MSNBC reporters, weren't all tony, elite Manhattanites. Several didn't attend college and had working-class jobs. They came from the Bronx and Putnam Counties and other outer boroughs. Yes, they're based in New York City, but they resemble the demographic profile of many of Trump's MAGA followers. Only two were women. But seeing him up close and personal, these nine New Yorkers believed the liberal writer Carroll, not the former president.\n\nAs I wrote earlier this week, it was sometimes painful to watch the accomplished Carroll tell the story of what happened to her when Trump denied he assaulted her, insisting that he didn't even know her and that she wasn't his type anyway. (A high point of his deposition in the earlier trial came when Trump, shown a picture of himself alongside Carroll at a party, identified her as his second wife, Marla Maples. He didn't even seem to recognize his then-wife, the late Ivana Trump.)\n\nCarroll testified that as a result of Trump's abuse, she received rape threats and death threats; an e-mailer instructed her \"to stick a gun in my mouth and pull the trigger.\" She rescued a pit bull, and \"I bought bullets for the gun I had inherited from my father,\" Carroll said. \"I was attacked,\" she told the courtroom .\n\n\"I was attacked on Twitter. I was brutally attacked on Facebook. I was attacked in news blogs. I was attacked in messages. As I said, it was a new world. I had left the world of facts, a lovely world, and I was living in a new universe.\"\n\n\"It ended the world that I had been living in,\" Carroll testified.\n\nTrump's lawyer Alina Habba tried to make the case that, far from being damaged by Trump's words and actions, Carroll had her reputation enhanced, becoming friends with celebrities and the toast of the then-liberal Twittersphere. \"Previously, I was known simply as a journalist,\" Carroll countered, \"and now I'm known as the liar, the fraud and the 'wack job.'\"\n\nThe jury believed her, not Trump. The histrionic president showed up in court several times, even as he was winning early contests in Iowa and New Hampshire. He seethed and blustered and was rebuked by Judge Kaplan, as was Habba. Trump walked out of the courtroom Friday when Carroll's attorney Robbie Kaplan began her closing argument, and didn't show up when the jury's verdict was read. With this, he may have reminded the jury that he views not just Carroll and Judge Kaplan but the jurors themselves with contempt. That might have cost him some additional money.\n\nTrump has already promised to appeal the verdict. But that will cost him money in itself. In civil cases, the loser is often forced to put all or most of the damages into a trust while they appeal. Interestingly, his immediate Truth Social posts on Friday continued to deny that he'd done anything wrong. All during the second trial, the question has been what amount of damages would cause Trump to shut up and stop abusing Carroll. Well he didn't shut up, but his post-verdict social media didn't mention the journalist, and that's a victory in itself. (He railed against \"this whole Biden Directed Witch Hunt.\") Maybe he's finally taking Kaplan at his word that the judge will let Carroll come back, if necessary, to seek more damages.\n\nNot far away in Lower Manhattan, Trump will be back in court next week to hear Judge Arthur Engeron's decision as to what he must pay for years of business fraud. Though the two cases are very different, in both the facts were not in dispute; all that's up for consideration is the amount of damages Trump must pay. If Attorney General Letitia James gets the $300 million she is seeking, suddenly, between that and the two Carroll awards, Trump is dangerously close to the $400 million he has testified he has in cash on hand. He won't be forced to fork over all the damages at once, since he's appealing, but having to post bail just to appeal the verdicts puts him in a financially precarious situation nonetheless.\n\nOf course, he'll likely turn to the MAGA faithful to pay his legal bills, but that's money he can't spend on his campaign. If I'm Nikki Haley, I'm hanging around at least until the South Carolina primary and maybe even Super Tuesday on March 5, just to see if his money woes-and other legal troubles-begin to pinch. Haley has shown no sisterly solidarity with Carroll, unbelievably claiming that she was unfamiliar with the details of the case. But Carroll has given Haley a minor victory nonetheless.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Jean Carroll's brave and extraordinary second legal showdown with serial sexual abuser Donald Trump: To convince a jury that he should pay her damages for defamation-denying he even knew her, let alone sexually assaulted her; in effect, saying that she was too unattractive for him to rape-this dignified, accomplished woman has to prove that she was, in fact, damaged. I found poignancy in what Carroll did on the witness stand Wednesday and Thursday, testifying to her pain, fear, and vulnerability, and the collapse of her stellar journalism career, in the wake of Trump's false and cruel claims about her. (Remember that in May a jury found him liable for sexually assaulting her almost 20 years ago and also awarded her damages.) She'd spent her life after growing up in Middle America-she was Miss Indiana University in the 1960s-building a successful, even glamorous, social and professional life, an \"only in New York\" life. And now she had to deconstruct it and show the extent to which she became a victim. First of sexual assault (in Bergdorf Goodman-\"only in New York\"), which the last jury believed and found Trump liable for, and, after she went public with the assault, of Trump's lies, and the resulting violent threats and abuse of his supporters. On the other hand, we have to remember that Carroll chose to tear down that façade herself, because the pain of pretending Trump's assault didn't happen intensified for her over the years. She has spoken about how, as the #MeToo movement exploded, coincidentally or not in the wake of Trump's election, women began writing in to her hilarious and beloved \"Ask E. Jean\" advice column in Elle magazine, wondering if they should come forward about the sexual affronts and even abuse they too had suffered. She began to feel like a hypocrite suggesting that other women do the brave thing. So she came forward, and her world came undone. I heard bits and pieces of Carroll's testimony on the stand over the last two days, from reporters who were in the courtroom; no cameras were permitted. Predictably, of course, Trump's histrionics, and not Carroll's quiet dignity, grabbed the headlines. And I get that. It's newsworthy. But I think it's important to listen to what she had to say.

April 24, 2025 Chris Van Hollen Shows Us One Person Can Make a Difference April 21, 2025 Trump Could Bring Kilmar Abrego Garcia Home if He Wanted To April 16, 2025 F irst, here's just a smidgen of Trump's trademark narcissism and compulsive outrage. On Wednesday, Judge Lewis Kaplan repeatedly warned him to stop glowering, chuckling, huffing and puffing, banging the table, and whispering loudly about Carroll and her lawyers' alleged lies. (His equally ridiculous lawyer, Alina Habba, was formally rebuked by Kaplan at least 14 times, according to Business Insider .) This might be the best/most awful Trump-Kaplan clash, following one of the disgraced ex-president's many outbursts: Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas Books & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas Books & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins Judge Kaplan : \"Mr. Trump, I hope I don't have to consider excluding you from the trial.

You just can't control yourself in this circumstance, apparently.\" Trump ( sullenly ): \"You can't either.\" I know you are but what am I? Yes, this disturbed delinquent grade schooler is currently leading President Joe Biden in most polls. So that got the most attention, but Carroll's brave testimony mattered more. She described the abuse she suffered once Trump not only denied her sexual assault claim against him in mid-2019 but began insulting her and calling her some variation on \"deranged.\" \"I was attacked,\" she told the courtroom . \"I was attacked on Twitter. I was brutally attacked on Facebook. I was attacked in news blogs. I was attacked in messages. As I said, it was a new world. I had left the world of facts, a lovely world, and I was living in a new universe.\" She described how she went from a journalist published in Rolling Stone , Esquire , New York , and of course Elle , where she had a perch for more than two decades, to a struggling but widely lauded Substacker . Maybe more important, she described the violent threats she received, and how they shook her. \"I bought bullets for the gun I had inherited from my father,\" Carroll said. She rescued a pitbull, a companion and potential protector. Her voice quavered when she read a violent e-mail she'd received, telling her \"to stick a gun in my mouth and pull the trigger.\" Being a writer, she elaborated: \"When a woman sees the words, we can't help but think of the image.... And I imagine that many of us now can picture that.\" We can. Appallingly, Habba's Trump defense consisted of telling Carroll that because she has more celebrity friends now since she went public with Trump's abuse, and more followers on \"Twitter\"-I guess she's missed the decomposition of that hellsite-she can't claim damages. Carroll persevered. \"Previously, I was known simply as a journalist,\" she countered, \"and now I'm known as the liar, the fraud and the 'wack job.'\" She acknowledged that more people know who she is, but added, \"I'm hated by more people too.\" Habba then claimed Carroll brought that on herself by continuing to talk about what Trump had done, worsening rather than \"mitigating the damage.\" Habba, surprisingly, was widely judged effective when she cross-examined former Trump lawyer turned Trump exposer Michael Cohen during the Trump organization business fraud trial late last year. But she didn't lay a finger on Carroll. Most attorneys I saw commenting about her tactics felt she'd failed. Her gambit to prove that Carroll damaged herself by going public with her Trump abuse story-a story a jury found Trump liable for in May, recall-failed miserably, with Judge Kaplan asking her to back up her novel argument that a victim has \"a duty to mitigate damages\" when the trial resumes next week. I predict it won't go well for her. C arroll repeatedly admitted the pain she suffered not only from the sexual assault but the abuse from Trump and his MAGA followers. \"I'm known as a liar, a wack job, a paid political operative. I'm none of those things. I'm 80 years old. I'm a journalist,\" she testified. And when her lawyer asked how it felt when Trump made ugly comments about her appearance, she confessed: \"It makes it hard for a girl to get up in the morning,\" and continued, \"I know I'm old. I know I'm 80. I know I'm not a pretty young woman, but it makes it tough to go on with the day.\" As a woman of not quite that age, but past a certain age, that stung me a little. Barbarians like Trump still think they can judge us, even if we're happy to be past the age of being judged. Men never, ever suffer that. But I want to highlight the journalist's hint of the only good that's come of this ordeal: getting to know her whole self. \"The public E. Jean Carroll is the cheerleader, the buoyant, indestructible old lady, who counsels her friends on how to be happy,\" she told the court. \"The private E.Jean is quiet; sometimes she feels pain. I've gotten to know that E. Jean better, and I like her. She and I are becoming better and better acquainted.\" I wouldn't wish her ordeal on anyone, but that's worth savoring. In this non-lawyer's opinion, she still deserves damages. Meanwhile, Trump bleated, \"I, frankly, am the one that suffered damages.\" He is by far the most damaged, but nobody did that to him but himself. Editor's Note: This article initially misstated the location where E. Jean Carroll was sexually assaulted by Donald Trump. The article has been corrected.\n\nI found poignancy in what Carroll did on the witness stand Wednesday and Thursday, testifying to her pain, fear, and vulnerability, and the collapse of her stellar journalism career, in the wake of Trump's false and cruel claims about her. (Remember that in May a jury found him liable for sexually assaulting her almost 20 years ago and also awarded her damages.)

On Wednesday, Judge Lewis Kaplan repeatedly warned him to stop glowering, chuckling, huffing and puffing, banging the table, and whispering loudly about Carroll and her lawyers' alleged lies. (His equally ridiculous lawyer, Alina Habba, was formally rebuked by Kaplan at least 14 times, according to Business Insider .)

You just can't control yourself in this circumstance, apparently.\" Trump ( sullenly ): \"You can't either.\" I know you are but what am I? Yes, this disturbed delinquent grade schooler is currently leading President Joe Biden in most polls. So that got the most attention, but Carroll's brave testimony mattered more. She described the abuse she suffered once Trump not only denied her sexual assault claim against him in mid-2019 but began insulting her and calling her some variation on \"deranged.\" \"I was attacked,\" she told the courtroom . \"I was attacked on Twitter. I was brutally attacked on Facebook. I was attacked in news blogs. I was attacked in messages. As I said, it was a new world. I had left the world of facts, a lovely world, and I was living in a new universe.\" She described how she went from a journalist published in Rolling Stone , Esquire , New York , and of course Elle , where she had a perch for more than two decades, to a struggling but widely lauded Substacker . Maybe more important, she described the violent threats she received, and how they shook her. \"I bought bullets for the gun I had inherited from my father,\" Carroll said. She rescued a pitbull, a companion and potential protector. Her voice quavered when she read a violent e-mail she'd received, telling her \"to stick a gun in my mouth and pull the trigger.\" Being a writer, she elaborated: \"When a woman sees the words, we can't help but think of the image.... And I imagine that many of us now can picture that.\" We can. Appallingly, Habba's Trump defense consisted of telling Carroll that because she has more celebrity friends now since she went public with Trump's abuse, and more followers on \"Twitter\"-I guess she's missed the decomposition of that hellsite-she can't claim damages. Carroll persevered. \"Previously, I was known simply as a journalist,\" she countered, \"and now I'm known as the liar, the fraud and the 'wack job.'\" She acknowledged that more people know who she is, but added, \"I'm hated by more people too.\" Habba then claimed Carroll brought that on herself by continuing to talk about what Trump had done, worsening rather than \"mitigating the damage.\" Habba, surprisingly, was widely judged effective when she cross-examined former Trump lawyer turned Trump exposer Michael Cohen during the Trump organization business fraud trial late last year. But she didn't lay a finger on Carroll. Most attorneys I saw commenting about her tactics felt she'd failed. Her gambit to prove that Carroll damaged herself by going public with her Trump abuse story-a story a jury found Trump liable for in May, recall-failed miserably, with Judge Kaplan asking her to back up her novel argument that a victim has \"a duty to mitigate damages\" when the trial resumes next week. I predict it won't go well for her. C arroll repeatedly admitted the pain she suffered not only from the sexual assault but the abuse from Trump and his MAGA followers. \"I'm known as a liar, a wack job, a paid political operative. I'm none of those things. I'm 80 years old. I'm a journalist,\" she testified. And when her lawyer asked how it felt when Trump made ugly comments about her appearance, she confessed: \"It makes it hard for a girl to get up in the morning,\" and continued, \"I know I'm old. I know I'm 80. I know I'm not a pretty young woman, but it makes it tough to go on with the day.\" As a woman of not quite that age, but past a certain age, that stung me a little. Barbarians like Trump still think they can judge us, even if we're happy to be past the age of being judged. Men never, ever suffer that. But I want to highlight the journalist's hint of the only good that's come of this ordeal: getting to know her whole self. \"The public E. Jean Carroll is the cheerleader, the buoyant, indestructible old lady, who counsels her friends on how to be happy,\" she told the court. \"The private E.Jean is quiet; sometimes she feels pain. I've gotten to know that E. Jean better, and I like her. She and I are becoming better and better acquainted.\" I wouldn't wish her ordeal on anyone, but that's worth savoring. In this non-lawyer's opinion, she still deserves damages. Meanwhile, Trump bleated, \"I, frankly, am the one that suffered damages.\" He is by far the most damaged, but nobody did that to him but himself. Editor's Note: This article initially misstated the location where E. Jean Carroll was sexually assaulted by Donald Trump. The article has been corrected.\n\nOn the other hand, we have to remember that Carroll chose to tear down that façade herself, because the pain of pretending Trump's assault didn't happen intensified for her over the years. She has spoken about how, as the #MeToo movement exploded, coincidentally or not in the wake of Trump's election, women began writing in to her hilarious and beloved \"Ask E. Jean\" advice column in Elle magazine, wondering if they should come forward about the sexual affronts and even abuse they too had suffered. She began to feel like a hypocrite suggesting that other women do the brave thing. So she came forward, and her world came undone. I heard bits and pieces of Carroll's testimony on the stand over the last two days, from reporters who were in the courtroom; no cameras were permitted. Predictably, of course, Trump's histrionics, and not Carroll's quiet dignity, grabbed the headlines. And I get that. It's newsworthy. But I think it's important to listen to what she had to say.

I had left the world of facts, a lovely world, and I was living in a new universe.\" She described how she went from a journalist published in Rolling Stone , Esquire , New York , and of course Elle , where she had a perch for more than two decades, to a struggling but widely lauded Substacker . Maybe more important, she described the violent threats she received, and how they shook her. \"I bought bullets for the gun I had inherited from my father,\" Carroll said. She rescued a pitbull, a companion and potential protector. Her voice quavered when she read a violent e-mail she'd received, telling her \"to stick a gun in my mouth and pull the trigger.\" Being a writer, she elaborated: \"When a woman sees the words, we can't help but think of the image.... And I imagine that many of us now can picture that.\" We can. Appallingly, Habba's Trump defense consisted of telling Carroll that because she has more celebrity friends now since she went public with Trump's abuse, and more followers on \"Twitter\"-I guess she's missed the decomposition of that hellsite-she can't claim damages. Carroll persevered. \"Previously, I was known simply as a journalist,\" she countered, \"and now I'm known as the liar, the fraud and the 'wack job.'\" She acknowledged that more people know who she is, but added, \"I'm hated by more people too.\" Habba then claimed Carroll brought that on herself by continuing to talk about what Trump had done, worsening rather than \"mitigating the damage.\" Habba, surprisingly, was widely judged effective when she cross-examined former Trump lawyer turned Trump exposer Michael Cohen during the Trump organization business fraud trial late last year. But she didn't lay a finger on Carroll. Most attorneys I saw commenting about her tactics felt she'd failed. Her gambit to prove that Carroll damaged herself by going public with her Trump abuse story-a story a jury found Trump liable for in May, recall-failed miserably, with Judge Kaplan asking her to back up her novel argument that a victim has \"a duty to mitigate damages\" when the trial resumes next week. I predict it won't go well for her. C arroll repeatedly admitted the pain she suffered not only from the sexual assault but the abuse from Trump and his MAGA followers. \"I'm known as a liar, a wack job, a paid political operative. I'm none of those things. I'm 80 years old. I'm a journalist,\" she testified. And when her lawyer asked how it felt when Trump made ugly comments about her appearance, she confessed: \"It makes it hard for a girl to get up in the morning,\" and continued, \"I know I'm old. I know I'm 80. I know I'm not a pretty young woman, but it makes it tough to go on with the day.\" As a woman of not quite that age, but past a certain age, that stung me a little. Barbarians like Trump still think they can judge us, even if we're happy to be past the age of being judged. Men never, ever suffer that. But I want to highlight the journalist's hint of the only good that's come of this ordeal: getting to know her whole self. \"The public E. Jean Carroll is the cheerleader, the buoyant, indestructible old lady, who counsels her friends on how to be happy,\" she told the court. \"The private E.Jean is quiet; sometimes she feels pain. I've gotten to know that E. Jean better, and I like her. She and I are becoming better and better acquainted.\" I wouldn't wish her ordeal on anyone, but that's worth savoring. In this non-lawyer's opinion, she still deserves damages. Meanwhile, Trump bleated, \"I, frankly, am the one that suffered damages.\" He is by far the most damaged, but nobody did that to him but himself. Editor's Note: This article initially misstated the location where E. Jean Carroll was sexually assaulted by Donald Trump. The article has been corrected.\n\nJudge Kaplan : \"I know you would like it. You just can't control yourself in this circumstance, apparently.\" Trump ( sullenly ): \"You can't either.\" I know you are but what am I? Yes, this disturbed delinquent grade schooler is currently leading President Joe Biden in most polls. So that got the most attention, but Carroll's brave testimony mattered more.

Her gambit to prove that Carroll damaged herself by going public with her Trump abuse story-a story a jury found Trump liable for in May, recall-failed miserably, with Judge Kaplan asking her to back up her novel argument that a victim has \"a duty to mitigate damages\" when the trial resumes next week. I predict it won't go well for her. C arroll repeatedly admitted the pain she suffered not only from the sexual assault but the abuse from Trump and his MAGA followers. \"I'm known as a liar, a wack job, a paid political operative. I'm none of those things. I'm 80 years old. I'm a journalist,\" she testified. And when her lawyer asked how it felt when Trump made ugly comments about her appearance, she confessed: \"It makes it hard for a girl to get up in the morning,\" and continued, \"I know I'm old. I know I'm 80. I know I'm not a pretty young woman, but it makes it tough to go on with the day.\" As a woman of not quite that age, but past a certain age, that stung me a little. Barbarians like Trump still think they can judge us, even if we're happy to be past the age of being judged. Men never, ever suffer that. But I want to highlight the journalist's hint of the only good that's come of this ordeal: getting to know her whole self. \"The public E. Jean Carroll is the cheerleader, the buoyant, indestructible old lady, who counsels her friends on how to be happy,\" she told the court. \"The private E.Jean is quiet; sometimes she feels pain. I've gotten to know that E. Jean better, and I like her. She and I are becoming better and better acquainted.\" I wouldn't wish her ordeal on anyone, but that's worth savoring. In this non-lawyer's opinion, she still deserves damages. Meanwhile, Trump bleated, \"I, frankly, am the one that suffered damages.\" He is by far the most damaged, but nobody did that to him but himself.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

He was charged with falsifying business records to cover up hush money he paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels, so she wouldn't reveal their affair on the eve of the 2016 election. He wasn't charged in connection with his treatment of the woman he mocked as \"Horseface,\" too unattractive to merit attention from the wealthy windbag, even though she told believable details of a brief and crude 2005 dalliance with Trump that occurred only months after his third wife, Melania, gave birth to his son Barron. The charges had to do with business fraud and campaign finance rules. But many women, including me , found them reparative, and vindicating to Daniels, nonetheless. On Tuesday, a nine-person civil jury found unanimously that Trump sexually abused writer E. Jean Carroll in the dressing room of a department store-Fifth Avenue's Bergdorf Goodman, by the way-more than 25 years ago, then defamed her, and it ordered Trump to pay Carroll $5 million in damages. The jury did not find that he had \"raped\" Carroll, since such a charge requires evidence of vaginal penetration, and I guess the jurors couldn't unanimously agree on whether that happened. The courage of Daniels, in telling her tawdry story to the public, and the phenomenal bravery of Carroll, now 79, savaged on the witness stand by Trump lawyer Joe Tacopina, benefited all women with stories like theirs. In a statement Tuesday afternoon Carroll said as much: \"This victory is not just for me but for every woman who has suffered because she was not believed.\" Indeed. Related Articles Is Donald Trump's Luck About to Run Out in a Manhattan Court? Francis Wilkinson Donald Trump Is Proud of Being a Sexual Predator Joan Walsh Trump was his own worst enemy. Even though he did not testify, the jury got to see his video deposition, where he again defamed Carroll repeatedly, as a \"sick person,\" a \"wack job\" and a liar, and also insulted lawyer Robbie Kaplan gratuitously. Maybe most unbelievably, shown a photo of him with his late ex-wife, Ivana, along with Carroll and her then-husband John Johnson, Trump identified Carroll as his mistress turned wife turned second ex-wife, Marla Maples. Something in the video that didn't get enough attention: Trump does not seem able to identify the woman he's with as Ivanka. Is he losing it? He claimed the photo was blurry; it was not. Next to mistaking the \"not my type\" Carroll for Maples, who was so much his type that he cheated on Ivana with her and then married her, Trump's craziest self-incrimination came when asked about what he said on the infamous Access Hollywood tape, revealed in October 2016, which was essentially boasting of sexual assault. The short version: \"If you're a star, they let you do it.... Grab 'em by the pussy.\" Trump all but doubled down in his deposition when Kaplan asked him about the tape. Current Issue View our current issue \"Well, historically, that's true, with stars,\" he replied. Kaplan then asked if he stood by his \"grab them by the pussy\" comment. He did: \"If you look over the last million years I guess that's been largely true, not always, but largely true, unfortunately or fortunately.\" Kaplan then asked him, \"And you consider yourself to be a star?\" And he replied, \"I think so, yeah.\" As I wrote last week : \"That isn't legal confirmation that Trump raped Carroll. But it shows that he'd rather boast about being a 'star,' and the 'fortunate' sexual prerogatives of stardom, than find a way to sound like less of a sexual predator.\" The jury seems to have agreed. The nine members remain anonymous; Judge Lewis Kaplan cited \"a very strong risk that jurors will fear harassment.\" We've yet to hear any comment from individual jurors. Trump continued to rail against Carroll and the verdict on social media Tuesday night, calling it a \"disgrace\" and a \"witch hunt.\" Flanked by American flags in a poorly lit video , Trump raged on, promising to appeal the verdict. \"We're gonna have to fight this stuff. We cannot let our country go into this abyss.\" The \"abyss\" of sexual abuse victims getting their day in court? And juries believing them? Sounds good to me. Looming ahead is CNN's town hall with Trump on Wednesday night. I'd say the verdict gives the network a good reason to cancel it, but they won't. \"Tune in! It will be ratings gold!\" Trump adviser (and fellow sexual predator) Jason Miller told Politico. I wonder whether CNN could face a lawsuit for allowing Trump to continue to defame Carroll. Fox had to pay $787 million for allowing guests and anchors to lie about and defame Dominion Voting Systems just last month. Maybe we'll find out.

Fox had to pay $787 million for allowing guests and anchors to lie about and defame Dominion Voting Systems just last month. Maybe we'll find out. Meanwhile, I hope the verdict gives Carroll the peace, finally, that she deserves.\n\nFrancis Wilkinson\n\nJoan Walsh\n\nTrump was his own worst enemy. Even though he did not testify, the jury got to see his video deposition, where he again defamed Carroll repeatedly, as a \"sick person,\" a \"wack job\" and a liar, and also insulted lawyer Robbie Kaplan gratuitously. Maybe most unbelievably, shown a photo of him with his late ex-wife, Ivana, along with Carroll and her then-husband John Johnson, Trump identified Carroll as his mistress turned wife turned second ex-wife, Marla Maples. Something in the video that didn't get enough attention: Trump does not seem able to identify the woman he's with as Ivanka. Is he losing it? He claimed the photo was blurry; it was not. Next to mistaking the \"not my type\" Carroll for Maples, who was so much his type that he cheated on Ivana with her and then married her, Trump's craziest self-incrimination came when asked about what he said on the infamous Access Hollywood tape, revealed in October 2016, which was essentially boasting of sexual assault. The short version: \"If you're a star, they let you do it.... Grab 'em by the pussy.\" Trump all but doubled down in his deposition when Kaplan asked him about the tape. Current Issue View our current issue \"Well, historically, that's true, with stars,\" he replied. Kaplan then asked if he stood by his \"grab them by the pussy\" comment. He did: \"If you look over the last million years I guess that's been largely true, not always, but largely true, unfortunately or fortunately.\" Kaplan then asked him, \"And you consider yourself to be a star?\" And he replied, \"I think so, yeah.\" As I wrote last week : \"That isn't legal confirmation that Trump raped Carroll. But it shows that he'd rather boast about being a 'star,' and the 'fortunate' sexual prerogatives of stardom, than find a way to sound like less of a sexual predator.\" The jury seems to have agreed. The nine members remain anonymous; Judge Lewis Kaplan cited \"a very strong risk that jurors will fear harassment.\" We've yet to hear any comment from individual jurors. Trump continued to rail against Carroll and the verdict on social media Tuesday night, calling it a \"disgrace\" and a \"witch hunt.\" Flanked by American flags in a poorly lit video , Trump raged on, promising to appeal the verdict. \"We're gonna have to fight this stuff. We cannot let our country go into this abyss.\" The \"abyss\" of sexual abuse victims getting their day in court? And juries believing them? Sounds good to me. Looming ahead is CNN's town hall with Trump on Wednesday night. I'd say the verdict gives the network a good reason to cancel it, but they won't. \"Tune in!

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Jean Carroll but not for raping her-and what's the difference anyway? Welcome to the decade-long battle in New York state to change the definition of rape in the first degree (aka Rape 1). In New York, a victim needs to convince a jury that a man put his penis in her vagina without her consent in order to prove rape. This is the layman's translation of Rape 1, currently defined in criminal statute as forcible compulsion through \"penetration, however slight, of the penis into the vaginal opening.\" It's harder to prove than it sounds, because juries tend to get really hung up on the physics of a rape. Did the penis penetrate or merely have \"contact\" with the victim's vagina? What if it wasn't his penis, but just a finger-perhaps the view taken by some of the jurors in Carroll's case (though she says both)? If she was also anally penetrated-which is not technically rape-can she be sure that she was also vaginally penetrated? None of this amounts to a hell of a lot of difference to the victim-who has to sit through the humiliation of a trial splitting hairs over which human organ touched which of her body parts and to what degree to the satisfaction of 12 random strangers. More From Alexis Grenell Dominance Does Not Equal Competence April 15, 2025 Andrew Cuomo Is Not Black October 30, 2024 Hochul Is Using Public Money to Defend Cuomo July 31, 2024 This is the scenario Lydia Cuomo had to deal with. A Bronx school teacher, Cuomo was violently assaulted at gunpoint in 2011 by a drunk, off-duty cop on her way to work one morning. A jury found the assailant, Michael Pena, guilty of predatory sexual assault and sentenced him to 75 years to life in prison, but they deadlocked on the rape charge. The defense argued that there wasn't sufficient DNA or eyewitness evidence to prove rape, despite the fact that Pena's semen was found in Cuomo's underwear. That was apparently enough to confuse one juror, who also thought it odd that Cuomo couldn't recall the specific color of a parked car, so how could she be sure she was vaginally penetrated? This is the actual shit women have to deal with at trial-random leaps of logic that have absolutely no bearing on anything. Pena later admitted to rape, which earned him a concurrent sentence of 10 years to life. Cuomo was obviously furious , though, and two years later went to bat for a bill to change the definition of Rape 1: \"I knew I had been raped and I had this jury say, 'Well, it wasn't really rape, it was sexual assault.' But there was still this kind of unresolved idea that he's going to prison, but not as a rapist.

Incidentally, it would also define nonconsensual anal and oral \"contact\" as rape rather than just sexual assault, meaning men would also qualify as rape victims for the first time. This matters because, as Cuomo put it: Sexual assault sounds so vague and I don't think the word \"sexual\" should be involved in it at all. There's nothing sexual about it-detest, disgusting violation of someone.... Survivors and victims who had this happen to them, your mind plays a lot of tricks on you.

Jean Carroll's Big Win for Women Joan Walsh Who opposes this? An unholy alliance of prosecutors, public defenders, and criminal defense attorneys. Their reasons vary, but all are frankly terrible. The District Attorneys Association of New York doesn't have a problem with eliminating the vaginal penetration requirement, but thinks that consolidating oral and anal contact under the rape statute will interfere with consecutive sentencing, meaning less jail. The Chief Defenders Association (CDANY) opposes it, thinking it would result in more jail. The criminal defense attorneys just hate it because it'll make their job of smearing rape victims harder. What's particularly obnoxious about the public defenders' argument, though, is that they cite Pena's conviction and sentence as a clear example of how the law already works. I guess because they're categorically opposed to any expansion of the criminal legal system this makes sense, but nothing about the system works for victims. And the added burn that we need to accept verdicts even though \"it can be tempting to change laws when we feel one outcome was wrong,\" as a CDANY opposition memo put it, betrays a stunning ignorance of the scope of the problem. To be clear: Donald Trump is technically not liable for rape because of the existing narrow definition in law. And it's not just him. There are thousands of less-famous people who've had to sit through the brutality of a civil or criminal trial and have their very bodies litigated by the centuries-deep misogyny that permeates our culture and courts. But that might finally change. For the first time in a decade, the bill is pending a floor vote in the state Senate after passing the state Assembly. If the Senate passes it and the governor signs it into law, rape will finally be rape in 2024. That'll still be too late for Carroll, because the civil look-back window that allowed her to sue Trump for a 30-year-old crime closes in six months, but it'll make a whole world of difference.\n\nIn New York, a victim needs to convince a jury that a man put his penis in her vagina without her consent in order to prove rape.

A Bronx school teacher, Cuomo was violently assaulted at gunpoint in 2011 by a drunk, off-duty cop on her way to work one morning. A jury found the assailant, Michael Pena, guilty of predatory sexual assault and sentenced him to 75 years to life in prison, but they deadlocked on the rape charge. The defense argued that there wasn't sufficient DNA or eyewitness evidence to prove rape, despite the fact that Pena's semen was found in Cuomo's underwear. That was apparently enough to confuse one juror, who also thought it odd that Cuomo couldn't recall the specific color of a parked car, so how could she be sure she was vaginally penetrated? This is the actual shit women have to deal with at trial-random leaps of logic that have absolutely no bearing on anything. Pena later admitted to rape, which earned him a concurrent sentence of 10 years to life.

Jean Carroll in a department store dressing room almost 30 years ago. But at times in his video deposition for Carroll's civil suit against him charging battery and defamation, he implicitly seemed to confirm it. This is not a legal judgment-I'm not a lawyer-but a psychological one. On Wednesday and Thursday, Carroll's attorney, Robbie Kaplan, played parts of Trump's deposition for the jury, including his reaction to the 2005 Access Hollywood tape, in which he famously bragged to host Billy Bush about his approach to women: \"I just start kissing them, it's like a magnet. Just kiss. When you're a star, they let you do it,\" he told Bush. \"You can do anything,\" he added. \"Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.\" Technically, of course, Trump was confessing to sexual assault, which is defined as any sexual contact without consent. We knew it then; we know it now. So it was fascinating, if stomach-turning, to see Trump's response when Kaplan asked him about the tape in his deposition. Related Article Is Donald Trump's Luck About to Run Out in a Manhattan Court? Francis Wilkinson \"Well, historically, that's true, with stars,\" he replied. Kaplan then asked if he stood by his \"grab them by the pussy\" comment. He did. \"If you look over the last million years I guess that's been largely true, not always, but largely true, unfortunately or fortunately.\" Unfortunately or fortunately? For whom would it be fortunate? But I digress. Kaplan asked him calmly: \"And you consider yourself to be a star?\" \"I think so, yeah,\" Trump answered. Let me be clear: That isn't legal confirmation that Trump raped Carroll. But it shows that he'd rather boast about being a \"star,\" and the \"fortunate\" sexual prerogatives of stardom, than find a way to sound like less of a sexual predator. It's not the only time in the deposition Trump came off as a misogynist ogre. He reiterated several times his key defense: He couldn't have raped Carroll because she wasn't his \"type.\" He went out of his way to insult Kaplan the same way: \"You wouldn't be a choice of mine, either, to be honest,\" he told the prominent feminist lawyer. \"I wouldn't in any circumstances have any interest in you.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal Trump Left No Doubt That He and Musk Are Coming for Social Security Trump Left No Doubt That He and Musk Are Coming for Social Security John Nichols Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal Trump Left No Doubt That He and Musk Are Coming for Social Security Trump Left No Doubt That He and Musk Are Coming for Social Security John Nichols Again, as we all know, creepy men assault even women they don't find \"attractive.\" It's about power and degradation more than lust. This is not a defense against an accusation of rape. Even so, Kaplan had his number on that front, too. She showed him a picture of Carroll from the mid-1990s, and he mistakenly identified her as his second wife, Marla Maples. \"That's Marla, yeah. That's my wife.\" \"I take it the three women you've married are all your type?\" Kaplan asked him. \"Yeah,\" he replied. Again: not proof that he raped Carroll, just proof that in the mid-1990s the writer was attractive enough to be his \"type.\" If not his second wife. Bizarrely, he also claimed that in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, Carroll said that she \"loved\" the rape he didn't commit, that she found it \"sexy.\" In fact, Carroll told Cooper that \"the word 'rape' carries so many sexual connotations. This was not-this was not sexual. It just hurt,\" adding, \"I think most people think of rape as being sexy.\" Trump's comments reminded me of O.J. Simpson's book, If I Did It , in which Simpson put forth a \"hypothetical\" description of how he killed his wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman. If Trump raped Carroll, she would have \"loved\" it and found it \"sexy.\" What a narcissistic monster. In terms of defending himself against Carroll's charge of defamation, Trump didn't do the best job there, either. He called her \"a nut job,\" \"a wack job,\" and \"a sick person,\" adding, \"Really sick. Something is really wrong with her.\" None of this means the jury will find for Carroll. But it certainly didn't help Trump. His rambling, offensive, grievance-filled set of replies to Kaplan's self-composed questioning showed us the man many of us have come to despise, self-righteous but with the self-awareness of a brick. His lead attorney, Joe Tacopina, has done no better. During his at times vicious cross-examination of Carroll, in which she was eloquent and emotional, he made the landmark mistakes of a bad litigator. At times, he asked questions he didn't know the answer to. And rather than fashioning queries that would require a simple yes or no from the journalist, he let her repeat her story of Trump's vicious assault in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room many times over. When the jury goes to deliberate, likely next week, they will have those details well-established in their memories. Meanwhile, Trump claimed that he was cutting short a trip to Ireland on Thursday in order to return to testify in the trial. When reporters asked Tacopina if that were true, he replied with a terse \"no.\" Such a move would be a disaster for Trump. But his video deposition has been a disaster, too, so maybe he thinks it can't get worse. He's essentially putting on an insanity defense, so why not play it to the hilt? Either way, we're supposed to hear closing arguments from both attorneys early next week. I don't know what will happen, but I'd put my money on Kaplan over Tacopina. Trump will only face financial damages if he loses the case, and it's not certain Carroll would see any of that money, since he always finds a way to stiff people. But it would be a victory for her and for all the women who've accused Trump of assault if the jury holds Trump accountable.\n\nDonald Trump has repeatedly, publicly, and cruelly denied raping the writer E.

You can do anything.\" Technically, of course, Trump was confessing to sexual assault, which is defined as any sexual contact without consent. We knew it then; we know it now. So it was fascinating, if stomach-turning, to see Trump's response when Kaplan asked him about the tape in his deposition. Related Article Is Donald Trump's Luck About to Run Out in a Manhattan Court? Francis Wilkinson \"Well, historically, that's true, with stars,\" he replied. Kaplan then asked if he stood by his \"grab them by the pussy\" comment. He did. \"If you look over the last million years I guess that's been largely true, not always, but largely true, unfortunately or fortunately.\" Unfortunately or fortunately? For whom would it be fortunate? But I digress. Kaplan asked him calmly: \"And you consider yourself to be a star?\" \"I think so, yeah,\" Trump answered. Let me be clear: That isn't legal confirmation that Trump raped Carroll. But it shows that he'd rather boast about being a \"star,\" and the \"fortunate\" sexual prerogatives of stardom, than find a way to sound like less of a sexual predator. It's not the only time in the deposition Trump came off as a misogynist ogre. He reiterated several times his key defense: He couldn't have raped Carroll because she wasn't his \"type.\" He went out of his way to insult Kaplan the same way: \"You wouldn't be a choice of mine, either, to be honest,\" he told the prominent feminist lawyer. \"I wouldn't in any circumstances have any interest in you.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal Trump Left No Doubt That He and Musk Are Coming for Social Security Trump Left No Doubt That He and Musk Are Coming for Social Security John Nichols Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal Trump Left No Doubt That He and Musk Are Coming for Social Security Trump Left No Doubt That He and Musk Are Coming for Social Security John Nichols Again, as we all know, creepy men assault even women they don't find \"attractive.\" It's about power and degradation more than lust. This is not a defense against an accusation of rape. Even so, Kaplan had his number on that front, too. She showed him a picture of Carroll from the mid-1990s, and he mistakenly identified her as his second wife, Marla Maples. \"That's Marla, yeah. That's my wife.\" \"I take it the three women you've married are all your type?\" Kaplan asked him. \"Yeah,\" he replied. Again: not proof that he raped Carroll, just proof that in the mid-1990s the writer was attractive enough to be his \"type.\" If not his second wife. Bizarrely, he also claimed that in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, Carroll said that she \"loved\" the rape he didn't commit, that she found it \"sexy.\" In fact, Carroll told Cooper that \"the word 'rape' carries so many sexual connotations. This was not-this was not sexual. It just hurt,\" adding, \"I think most people think of rape as being sexy.\" Trump's comments reminded me of O.J. Simpson's book, If I Did It , in which Simpson put forth a \"hypothetical\" description of how he killed his wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman. If Trump raped Carroll, she would have \"loved\" it and found it \"sexy.\" What a narcissistic monster. In terms of defending himself against Carroll's charge of defamation, Trump didn't do the best job there, either. He called her \"a nut job,\" \"a wack job,\" and \"a sick person,\" adding, \"Really sick. Something is really wrong with her.\" None of this means the jury will find for Carroll. But it certainly didn't help Trump. His rambling, offensive, grievance-filled set of replies to Kaplan's self-composed questioning showed us the man many of us have come to despise, self-righteous but with the self-awareness of a brick. His lead attorney, Joe Tacopina, has done no better. During his at times vicious cross-examination of Carroll, in which she was eloquent and emotional, he made the landmark mistakes of a bad litigator. At times, he asked questions he didn't know the answer to. And rather than fashioning queries that would require a simple yes or no from the journalist, he let her repeat her story of Trump's vicious assault in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room many times over. When the jury goes to deliberate, likely next week, they will have those details well-established in their memories. Meanwhile, Trump claimed that he was cutting short a trip to Ireland on Thursday in order to return to testify in the trial. When reporters asked Tacopina if that were true, he replied with a terse \"no.\" Such a move would be a disaster for Trump. But his video deposition has been a disaster, too, so maybe he thinks it can't get worse. He's essentially putting on an insanity defense, so why not play it to the hilt? Either way, we're supposed to hear closing arguments from both attorneys early next week. I don't know what will happen, but I'd put my money on Kaplan over Tacopina. Trump will only face financial damages if he loses the case, and it's not certain Carroll would see any of that money, since he always finds a way to stiff people. But it would be a victory for her and for all the women who've accused Trump of assault if the jury holds Trump accountable.\n\nOn Wednesday and Thursday, Carroll's attorney, Robbie Kaplan, played parts of Trump's deposition for the jury, including his reaction to the 2005 Access Hollywood tape, in which he famously bragged to host Billy Bush about his approach to women: \"I just start kissing them, it's like a magnet.

And rather than fashioning queries that would require a simple yes or no from the journalist, he let her repeat her story of Trump's vicious assault in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room many times over. When the jury goes to deliberate, likely next week, they will have those details well-established in their memories. Meanwhile, Trump claimed that he was cutting short a trip to Ireland on Thursday in order to return to testify in the trial. When reporters asked Tacopina if that were true, he replied with a terse \"no.\" Such a move would be a disaster for Trump. But his video deposition has been a disaster, too, so maybe he thinks it can't get worse. He's essentially putting on an insanity defense, so why not play it to the hilt? Either way, we're supposed to hear closing arguments from both attorneys early next week. I don't know what will happen, but I'd put my money on Kaplan over Tacopina. Trump will only face financial damages if he loses the case, and it's not certain Carroll would see any of that money, since he always finds a way to stiff people. But it would be a victory for her and for all the women who've accused Trump of assault if the jury holds Trump accountable.\n\nUnfortunately or fortunately? For whom would it be fortunate? But I digress. Kaplan asked him calmly: \"And you consider yourself to be a star?\" \"I think so, yeah,\" Trump answered. Let me be clear: That isn't legal confirmation that Trump raped Carroll. But it shows that he'd rather boast about being a \"star,\" and the \"fortunate\" sexual prerogatives of stardom, than find a way to sound like less of a sexual predator. It's not the only time in the deposition Trump came off as a misogynist ogre. He reiterated several times his key defense: He couldn't have raped Carroll because she wasn't his \"type.\" He went out of his way to insult Kaplan the same way: \"You wouldn't be a choice of mine, either, to be honest,\" he told the prominent feminist lawyer. \"I wouldn't in any circumstances have any interest in you.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal Trump Left No Doubt That He and Musk Are Coming for Social Security Trump Left No Doubt That He and Musk Are Coming for Social Security John Nichols Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal Trump Left No Doubt That He and Musk Are Coming for Social Security Trump Left No Doubt That He and Musk Are Coming for Social Security John Nichols Again, as we all know, creepy men assault even women they don't find \"attractive.\" It's about power and degradation more than lust. This is not a defense against an accusation of rape. Even so, Kaplan had his number on that front, too. She showed him a picture of Carroll from the mid-1990s, and he mistakenly identified her as his second wife, Marla Maples. \"That's Marla, yeah. That's my wife.\" \"I take it the three women you've married are all your type?\" Kaplan asked him. \"Yeah,\" he replied. Again: not proof that he raped Carroll, just proof that in the mid-1990s the writer was attractive enough to be his \"type.\" If not his second wife. Bizarrely, he also claimed that in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, Carroll said that she \"loved\" the rape he didn't commit, that she found it \"sexy.\" In fact, Carroll told Cooper that \"the word 'rape' carries so many sexual connotations. This was not-this was not sexual. It just hurt,\" adding, \"I think most people think of rape as being sexy.\" Trump's comments reminded me of O.J. Simpson's book, If I Did It , in which Simpson put forth a \"hypothetical\" description of how he killed his wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman. If Trump raped Carroll, she would have \"loved\" it and found it \"sexy.\" What a narcissistic monster. In terms of defending himself against Carroll's charge of defamation, Trump didn't do the best job there, either. He called her \"a nut job,\" \"a wack job,\" and \"a sick person,\" adding, \"Really sick. Something is really wrong with her.\" None of this means the jury will find for Carroll. But it certainly didn't help Trump. His rambling, offensive, grievance-filled set of replies to Kaplan's self-composed questioning showed us the man many of us have come to despise, self-righteous but with the self-awareness of a brick.

Bizarrely, he also claimed that in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, Carroll said that she \"loved\" the rape he didn't commit, that she found it \"sexy.\" In fact, Carroll told Cooper that \"the word 'rape' carries so many sexual connotations. This was not-this was not sexual. It just hurt,\" adding, \"I think most people think of rape as being sexy.\" Trump's comments reminded me of O.J. Simpson's book, If I Did It , in which Simpson put forth a \"hypothetical\" description of how he killed his wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman. If Trump raped Carroll, she would have \"loved\" it and found it \"sexy.\" What a narcissistic monster. In terms of defending himself against Carroll's charge of defamation, Trump didn't do the best job there, either. He called her \"a nut job,\" \"a wack job,\" and \"a sick person,\" adding, \"Really sick. Something is really wrong with her.\" None of this means the jury will find for Carroll. But it certainly didn't help Trump. His rambling, offensive, grievance-filled set of replies to Kaplan's self-composed questioning showed us the man many of us have come to despise, self-righteous but with the self-awareness of a brick. His lead attorney, Joe Tacopina, has done no better. During his at times vicious cross-examination of Carroll, in which she was eloquent and emotional, he made the landmark mistakes of a bad litigator. At times, he asked questions he didn't know the answer to. And rather than fashioning queries that would require a simple yes or no from the journalist, he let her repeat her story of Trump's vicious assault in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room many times over. When the jury goes to deliberate, likely next week, they will have those details well-established in their memories. Meanwhile, Trump claimed that he was cutting short a trip to Ireland on Thursday in order to return to testify in the trial. When reporters asked Tacopina if that were true, he replied with a terse \"no.\" Such a move would be a disaster for Trump. But his video deposition has been a disaster, too, so maybe he thinks it can't get worse. He's essentially putting on an insanity defense, so why not play it to the hilt? Either way, we're supposed to hear closing arguments from both attorneys early next week. I don't know what will happen, but I'd put my money on Kaplan over Tacopina. Trump will only face financial damages if he loses the case, and it's not certain Carroll would see any of that money, since he always finds a way to stiff people.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

This is apparently a confusing and controversial proposition to some. But rest assured, there is nothing in Article II of the US Constitution, and nothing in any part of the US statutory code, not even the footnotes, that lists \"defaming alleged rape victims\" as one of the privileges or responsibilities of the office of the president. We could, and in fact do, have a fully functioning Executive Branch without granting civil immunity to presidents who decide to call rape victims \"ugly\" \"liars\" in their personal capacity as edgelord bully on Twitter. Those who argue otherwise are making a choice. They're choosing to defend a president's use of the loudest microphone in the land to shame and bully women who accuse him of sexual assault or misconduct. They're choosing to allow a president to frustrate even the simplest operations of civil law so that he might never be held accountable-even for actions committed prior to taking office. They're choosing to value the institution of the presidency over the victims of presidential misconduct. They're choosing power over justice, and they're choosing poorly. Unfortunately, some of the people who are making that bad choice are very powerful. This week, Merrick Garland's Department of Justice announced that it would continue defending Donald Trump in his ongoing attempts to dodge rape allegations by E. Jean Carroll. Carroll claims that Trump raped her in a department store in the mid-1990s. Trump claims that Carroll is \"ugly\" and \"not [his] type.\" Carroll sued Trump for defamation for these comments (Trump is also facing another defamation lawsuit from Summer Zervos, whom Trump also slandered after she accused him of sexual assault), but Bill Barr's Justice Department sought to intervene on Trump's behalf. Barr argued that Trump was a federal employee whose statements were part of his employment duties and who was thus entitled to protection under the Westfall Act, which grants civil immunity to federal employees for actions that are part of their jobs. Barr's argument has already been rejected by a district court-again, because defaming alleged rape victims is not really a part of anybody's \"job.\" But Garland's DOJ decided to take up Barr's position and continue appealing the case to the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. It's important to understand that the DOJ did not have to do this. There is no legal requirement that the current Justice Department has to continue to advance bad arguments made by the previous Justice Department. The DOJ is supposed to represent the people of the United States. There is no good argument for why our tax dollars are being used to argue that Trump is immune from a lawsuit related to a rape he allegedly perpetrated before taking office and the lies he may have told about that rape while in office. The same would be true of Joe Biden or Barack Obama or any future president who finds themselves accused of defaming alleged rape victims. It's entirely possible to live in a country where the president needs to hire his own lawyers when he's accused of rape or lying about rape.

He's offering absolute immunity from these charges and is willing to offer it on the taxpayers' dime. That's simply unnecessary. Trump is well capable of paying for (or misappropriating charitable contributions for) his own defense. There are plenty of lawyers who'd take the work. Current Issue View our current issue Reaching the opposite conclusion-that defaming alleged rape victims is so fundamental to the ability of presidents to perform their duties that the Justice Department must argue for their absolute immunity from the charges-requires jumping on some Penrose stairs and never thinking beyond their never-ending loop. Unfortunately, many DOJ supporters and otherwise reasonable legal commentators are willing to accept the closed institutional logic of Barr and Garland that seems to value defense of the presidency above all else. Trump's best case is fairly straightforward: His allegedly defamatory conduct is like other allegedly defamatory conduct committed by other federal employees whom courts have already granted absolute immunity from such charges. There are a few cases here that work in Trump's favor. In Wuterich v. Murtha , the D.C. Circuit appeals court ruled that Representative John Murtha could not be sued for defamation after making disparaging remarks about US soldiers involved in the Haditha Massacre during the war in Iraq. In another case, Council on American Islamic Relations v. Ballenger , Representative Case Ballenger made allegedly defamatory comments about Muslims while on the phone with a reporter who was asking about his failed marriage. Again, the D.C. Circuit ruled that the congressman was immune from liability. Any lawyer advertising on a subway poster can make that argument for Trump. The problem is that the Trump situation is not a point-and-click application of these precedents. (I can also make the argument that both of those cases were wrongly decided, especially Ballenger : If talking to reporters were a required part of Congress's job, I could make Joe Manchin respond to my e-mails. But that's not at issue here.) The issue here is that criticizing US soldiers who arguably committed a war crime from one's perch as a representative of that government (the Murtha case) is objectively different from slagging off a woman who claims you raped her. Murtha and Ballenger were not defaming people who had accused them of a crime, and the court's decision to extend them immunity, even wrongly, was not part of a gambit to cut off investigation of or accountability for that crime. That's an argument E. Jean Carroll's lawyer (the fierce Roberta Kaplan) is fully capable of making in court. What the rest of us should be doing is questioning why the DOJ is opposing Carroll's case in the first place. Even if you agree with the above precedents and think defaming women who were allegedly raped is a presidential prerogative, the Department of Justice is not bound by those cases. Precedents bind courts (unless you allow conservatives on your court, in which case precedents aren't worth a damn). But the DOJ is not a court. It is an executive agency whose constituents are the American people, not just the president. If the DOJ is going to support an interpretation of law, or if it's going to try to extend a legal interpretation into an uncharted area, it better have a good reason for why its interpretation advances the cause of justice or fairness or equality-or something -\"for all.\" In this case, Garland and his defenders have no such reason. A world in which presidents are immune, both criminally and civilly, for everything they do while in office is not a good or just one-and it's certainly not one that can be sustained under a republican form of government. Sure, we don't want presidents to be sued by QAnon people who write lawsuits by cutting out letters from magazine articles. Sure, we also don't want run-of-the-mill federal employees catching a lawsuit every time they do \"big government\" in a way that pisses off some dude hoarding canned beans in his doomsday bunker. But there simply must be some measure of conduct that is illegal even if the president does it, and drawing the line at defaming women who accuse presidents of rape seems as good a place to start as any. I'd also argue that shooting people on Fifth Avenue should not be defended by the Justice Department, for what it's worth. But I'm not an institutionalist. I do not believe justice is a goal that can only be achieved through a bunch of institutions that jealously guard their own interests and shamelessly aggrandize their own power. I believe justice is a requirement of law, not the lucky byproduct of people myopically hiding behind procedure. Garland's DOJ evidently disagrees. This is now the third decision in which his DOJ has decided to support the bad arguments and unjust legal maneuvers enacted by Barr's DOJ: It decided to defend Barr's lies about the Mueller report ; it asked a judge to throw out lawsuits against Trump and Barr for gassing peaceful protesters so Trump could take a photo with a Bible; and now this. None of these decisions are required by law. None are particularly good. None reflect the will of the people who voted against the Trumpian policies of lies and cruelty. More from Mystal Why Is Merrick Garland's DOJ Carrying Water for Bill Barr? Elie Mystal Joe Manchin Cares More About 'Bipartisanship' Than Fighting Jim Crow Elie Mystal But all of them are motivated by the misguided belief that institutional continuity is more important than seeking actually just outcomes. Garland was asked about Carroll's defamation suit in a Senate hearing on Wednesday. His main argument for continuing the case was that, while he himself would not have taken some of Barr's positions, his hands were magically tied: \"Sometimes we have to make decisions about the law that we would never have made and that we strongly disagree with as a matter of policy.\" That is not justice. That is bullshit. If Garland disagrees with the policy of defaming alleged rape victims, all he has to do is stop defending it. The fact that he won't stop is a problem with him and his department, not the law.\n\nThose who argue otherwise are making a choice. They're choosing to defend a president's use of the loudest microphone in the land to shame and bully women who accuse him of sexual assault or misconduct.

Sure, we also don't want run-of-the-mill federal employees catching a lawsuit every time they do \"big government\" in a way that pisses off some dude hoarding canned beans in his doomsday bunker. But there simply must be some measure of conduct that is illegal even if the president does it, and drawing the line at defaming women who accuse presidents of rape seems as good a place to start as any. I'd also argue that shooting people on Fifth Avenue should not be defended by the Justice Department, for what it's worth. But I'm not an institutionalist. I do not believe justice is a goal that can only be achieved through a bunch of institutions that jealously guard their own interests and shamelessly aggrandize their own power. I believe justice is a requirement of law, not the lucky byproduct of people myopically hiding behind procedure. Garland's DOJ evidently disagrees. This is now the third decision in which his DOJ has decided to support the bad arguments and unjust legal maneuvers enacted by Barr's DOJ: It decided to defend Barr's lies about the Mueller report ; it asked a judge to throw out lawsuits against Trump and Barr for gassing peaceful protesters so Trump could take a photo with a Bible; and now this. None of these decisions are required by law. None are particularly good. None reflect the will of the people who voted against the Trumpian policies of lies and cruelty.

Elie Mystal Joe Manchin Cares More About 'Bipartisanship' Than Fighting Jim Crow Elie Mystal But all of them are motivated by the misguided belief that institutional continuity is more important than seeking actually just outcomes. Garland was asked about Carroll's defamation suit in a Senate hearing on Wednesday. His main argument for continuing the case was that, while he himself would not have taken some of Barr's positions, his hands were magically tied: \"Sometimes we have to make decisions about the law that we would never have made and that we strongly disagree with as a matter of policy.\" That is not justice. That is bullshit. If Garland disagrees with the policy of defaming alleged rape victims, all he has to do is stop defending it. The fact that he won't stop is a problem with him and his department, not the law.\n\nUnfortunately, some of the people who are making that bad choice are very powerful. This week, Merrick Garland's Department of Justice announced that it would continue defending Donald Trump in his ongoing attempts to dodge rape allegations by E. Jean Carroll. Carroll claims that Trump raped her in a department store in the mid-1990s. Trump claims that Carroll is \"ugly\" and \"not [his] type.\" Carroll sued Trump for defamation for these comments (Trump is also facing another defamation lawsuit from Summer Zervos, whom Trump also slandered after she accused him of sexual assault), but Bill Barr's Justice Department sought to intervene on Trump's behalf. Barr argued that Trump was a federal employee whose statements were part of his employment duties and who was thus entitled to protection under the Westfall Act, which grants civil immunity to federal employees for actions that are part of their jobs. Barr's argument has already been rejected by a district court-again, because defaming alleged rape victims is not really a part of anybody's \"job.\" But Garland's DOJ decided to take up Barr's position and continue appealing the case to the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. It's important to understand that the DOJ did not have to do this. There is no legal requirement that the current Justice Department has to continue to advance bad arguments made by the previous Justice Department. The DOJ is supposed to represent the people of the United States. There is no good argument for why our tax dollars are being used to argue that Trump is immune from a lawsuit related to a rape he allegedly perpetrated before taking office and the lies he may have told about that rape while in office. The same would be true of Joe Biden or Barack Obama or any future president who finds themselves accused of defaming alleged rape victims. It's entirely possible to live in a country where the president needs to hire his own lawyers when he's accused of rape or lying about rape.

He's offering absolute immunity from these charges and is willing to offer it on the taxpayers' dime. That's simply unnecessary. Trump is well capable of paying for (or misappropriating charitable contributions for) his own defense. There are plenty of lawyers who'd take the work. Current Issue View our current issue Reaching the opposite conclusion-that defaming alleged rape victims is so fundamental to the ability of presidents to perform their duties that the Justice Department must argue for their absolute immunity from the charges-requires jumping on some Penrose stairs and never thinking beyond their never-ending loop. Unfortunately, many DOJ supporters and otherwise reasonable legal commentators are willing to accept the closed institutional logic of Barr and Garland that seems to value defense of the presidency above all else. Trump's best case is fairly straightforward: His allegedly defamatory conduct is like other allegedly defamatory conduct committed by other federal employees whom courts have already granted absolute immunity from such charges. There are a few cases here that work in Trump's favor. In Wuterich v. Murtha , the D.C. Circuit appeals court ruled that Representative John Murtha could not be sued for defamation after making disparaging remarks about US soldiers involved in the Haditha Massacre during the war in Iraq. In another case, Council on American Islamic Relations v. Ballenger , Representative Case Ballenger made allegedly defamatory comments about Muslims while on the phone with a reporter who was asking about his failed marriage. Again, the D.C. Circuit ruled that the congressman was immune from liability. Any lawyer advertising on a subway poster can make that argument for Trump. The problem is that the Trump situation is not a point-and-click application of these precedents. (I can also make the argument that both of those cases were wrongly decided, especially Ballenger : If talking to reporters were a required part of Congress's job, I could make Joe Manchin respond to my e-mails. But that's not at issue here.) The issue here is that criticizing US soldiers who arguably committed a war crime from one's perch as a representative of that government (the Murtha case) is objectively different from slagging off a woman who claims you raped her. Murtha and Ballenger were not defaming people who had accused them of a crime, and the court's decision to extend them immunity, even wrongly, was not part of a gambit to cut off investigation of or accountability for that crime. That's an argument E. Jean Carroll's lawyer (the fierce Roberta Kaplan) is fully capable of making in court. What the rest of us should be doing is questioning why the DOJ is opposing Carroll's case in the first place. Even if you agree with the above precedents and think defaming women who were allegedly raped is a presidential prerogative, the Department of Justice is not bound by those cases. Precedents bind courts (unless you allow conservatives on your court, in which case precedents aren't worth a damn). But the DOJ is not a court. It is an executive agency whose constituents are the American people, not just the president. If the DOJ is going to support an interpretation of law, or if it's going to try to extend a legal interpretation into an uncharted area, it better have a good reason for why its interpretation advances the cause of justice or fairness or equality-or something -\"for all.\" In this case, Garland and his defenders have no such reason.

He's offering absolute immunity from these charges and is willing to offer it on the taxpayers' dime. That's simply unnecessary. Trump is well capable of paying for (or misappropriating charitable contributions for) his own defense. There are plenty of lawyers who'd take the work. Current Issue View our current issue Reaching the opposite conclusion-that defaming alleged rape victims is so fundamental to the ability of presidents to perform their duties that the Justice Department must argue for their absolute immunity from the charges-requires jumping on some Penrose stairs and never thinking beyond their never-ending loop. Unfortunately, many DOJ supporters and otherwise reasonable legal commentators are willing to accept the closed institutional logic of Barr and Garland that seems to value defense of the presidency above all else. Trump's best case is fairly straightforward: His allegedly defamatory conduct is like other allegedly defamatory conduct committed by other federal employees whom courts have already granted absolute immunity from such charges. There are a few cases here that work in Trump's favor. In Wuterich v. Murtha , the D.C. Circuit appeals court ruled that Representative John Murtha could not be sued for defamation after making disparaging remarks about US soldiers involved in the Haditha Massacre during the war in Iraq. In another case, Council on American Islamic Relations v. Ballenger , Representative Case Ballenger made allegedly defamatory comments about Muslims while on the phone with a reporter who was asking about his failed marriage. Again, the D.C. Circuit ruled that the congressman was immune from liability. Any lawyer advertising on a subway poster can make that argument for Trump. The problem is that the Trump situation is not a point-and-click application of these precedents. (I can also make the argument that both of those cases were wrongly decided, especially Ballenger : If talking to reporters were a required part of Congress's job, I could make Joe Manchin respond to my e-mails. But that's not at issue here.) The issue here is that criticizing US soldiers who arguably committed a war crime from one's perch as a representative of that government (the Murtha case) is objectively different from slagging off a woman who claims you raped her. Murtha and Ballenger were not defaming people who had accused them of a crime, and the court's decision to extend them immunity, even wrongly, was not part of a gambit to cut off investigation of or accountability for that crime. That's an argument E. Jean Carroll's lawyer (the fierce Roberta Kaplan) is fully capable of making in court. What the rest of us should be doing is questioning why the DOJ is opposing Carroll's case in the first place. Even if you agree with the above precedents and think defaming women who were allegedly raped is a presidential prerogative, the Department of Justice is not bound by those cases. Precedents bind courts (unless you allow conservatives on your court, in which case precedents aren't worth a damn). But the DOJ is not a court. It is an executive agency whose constituents are the American people, not just the president. If the DOJ is going to support an interpretation of law, or if it's going to try to extend a legal interpretation into an uncharted area, it better have a good reason for why its interpretation advances the cause of justice or fairness or equality-or something -\"for all.\" In this case, Garland and his defenders have no such reason. A world in which presidents are immune, both criminally and civilly, for everything they do while in office is not a good or just one-and it's certainly not one that can be sustained under a republican form of government. Sure, we don't want presidents to be sued by QAnon people who write lawsuits by cutting out letters from magazine articles. Sure, we also don't want run-of-the-mill federal employees catching a lawsuit every time they do \"big government\" in a way that pisses off some dude hoarding canned beans in his doomsday bunker. But there simply must be some measure of conduct that is illegal even if the president does it, and drawing the line at defaming women who accuse presidents of rape seems as good a place to start as any. I'd also argue that shooting people on Fifth Avenue should not be defended by the Justice Department, for what it's worth. But I'm not an institutionalist. I do not believe justice is a goal that can only be achieved through a bunch of institutions that jealously guard their own interests and shamelessly aggrandize their own power. I believe justice is a requirement of law, not the lucky byproduct of people myopically hiding behind procedure. Garland's DOJ evidently disagrees. This is now the third decision in which his DOJ has decided to support the bad arguments and unjust legal maneuvers enacted by Barr's DOJ: It decided to defend Barr's lies about the Mueller report ; it asked a judge to throw out lawsuits against Trump and Barr for gassing peaceful protesters so Trump could take a photo with a Bible; and now this. None of these decisions are required by law. None are particularly good. None reflect the will of the people who voted against the Trumpian policies of lies and cruelty.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

To break it down still further: Trump is saying that demeaning and lying about a woman who has credibly accused him of rape is part of his job as president, and therefore he cannot be sued over his statements. He's making taxpayers foot the bill for this defense. There is now no meaningful distinction between Trump the person and the US government. Somewhere, King George III is wondering why we threw away his tea. The defamation suit Trump is trying to dodge is the one filed by author E. Jean Carroll last fall. Carroll accused Trump of raping her in the mid-1990s. In response to the allegations, which Carroll published last summer , Trump went into the usual round of angry denials that we've seen after each of the 25 women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct came forward. Trump called Carroll a liar and claimed that he had never met her. There's a photo of the two of them together in the '80s, because if Donald Trump says he never met someone, you can almost bank on there being a photo of the two of them together. Carroll sued Trump for defamation last November over his apparent lies about their meeting. Trump argued, as he always does, that a sitting president is entitled to civil immunity for his private behavior. That is the argument he lost in front of a New York court last month. It was always obvious that Trump was going to lose. We knew he was going to lose because Bill Clinton lost on the same argument more than 20 years ago. Clinton argued that as a sitting president, he could not be sued by Paula Jones over his private conduct-in that case, alleged sexual harassment. Clinton v. Jones went all the way to the Supreme Court, where the court ruled unanimously that a sitting president had no such immunity. After losing, however, President Clinton did not enlist the Department of Justice to substitute for his private defense lawyers. He did not ask US taxpayers to support his web of lies. And if he had asked the DOJ to run interference for him, I imagine Janet Reno would have told Slick Willy precisely where he could stick it.

It's illegal in the same way it's illegal for the president to claim the right to consummate any marriage that takes place within his realm. There's no statute that says \" droit du seigneur is prohibited in these lands,\" because we don't need one: It's just not a power inherent to the office of the president of the United States. The presidency is an office whose powers are limited to those conferred in the Constitution, so unless the president can point to a specific constitutional grant, he does not have the authority. You can tell Trump has no legal authority for the move because the court papers filed yesterday by Attorney General William Barr and the DOJ effectively try to invent the authority they suddenly claim to have. The DOJ argues that the Federal Tort Claims Act grants the president, and every federal employee, immunity from private lawsuits. They then insist that since the president is claiming Federal Tort Claim immunity, he is entitled to be represented by the government. Their argument is fallacious, and insultingly so, but you have to know a little bit about the Federal Tort Claims Act to understand why. The act does indeed grant all government employees personal immunity from civil lawsuits, but that immunity extends only to civil lawsuits arising out of their government responsibilities. It exists so that one of these live-free-or-die fools can't sue the head of the IRS personally for \"theft\" over enforcement of tax laws. It exists so that the head of the zoning board doesn't get sued by a homeowner who is angry because they can't build a zeppelin mooring mast on top of their McMansion. It exists because we live in a litigious society and workaday government employees shouldn't need to keep a lawyer on retainer to protect them from whatever crazy conspiracy QAnon comes up with next. The Federal Tort Claims Act is there for government employees who do their jobs-not ones who spend their days watching Fox News while calling their sexual assault accusers \"ugly\" and tweeting on a toilet bowl. When government employees are sued for their private actions, they are not protected by the statute and they do not get access to government lawyers. While there is a case of a congressman's getting FTCA protection for defamatory statements he made regarding Hezbollah, we haven't seen elected officials try to stretch immunity to cover their private sex lives. There have been quite a few government employees accused of sexual assault over the years, and none of them have had the DOJ come riding to their rescue. It would, in fact, be unworkable if every government employee protected by the Federal Tort Claims Act got a government lawyer every time they were accused of private misconduct. I fully expect Trump to lose this argument, just like he's lost all the other ones in this case. It's a bad argument and would set an untenable precedent for future presidents and for every government employee in the country. Still, focusing simply on the faulty legal reasoning of the argument somehow fails to grasp the full depth of Trump's and Barr's debasement of their offices. The statement from Carroll's lawyer, Roberta Kaplan (who, full disclosure, I believe is one of the best attorneys in the country), starts to get at the true despotic nature of what is going on here. Kaplan says: Realizing that there was no valid basis to appeal that decision in the New York courts, on the very day that he would have been required to appeal, Trump instead enlisted the U.S. Department of Justice to replace his private lawyers and argue that when he lied about sexually assaulting our client, explaining that she \"wasn't his type,\" he was acting in his official capacity as President of the United States. Even in today's world, that argument is shocking. It offends me as a lawyer, and offends me even more as a citizen. Trump's effort to wield the power of the U.S. government to evade responsibility for his private misconduct is without precedent, and shows even more starkly how far he is willing to go to prevent the truth from coming out. Mystal on Barr How Yale Became the Latest Target in the Plot to Kill Affirmative Action Elie Mystal Congrats, Dems: You Just Let Trump's Chief Henchman Off the Hook Elie Mystal The Trump Administration Is on a Capital Punishment Killing Spree Elie Mystal We can't lose sight of the fact that Trump is being accused of rape. We can't forget that Trump is bringing the full weight of the federal government down upon a single woman to defend himself from rape accusations after the usual tactics of screaming, shaming, and bullying failed to bring about the desired result. Trump, the defendant, is getting due process, but that's not enough for him. He wants immunity from ever having to even answer for these charges, and he's now willing to use lawyers from the Department of Justice-which is there to prosecute mobsters and terrorists-to achieve his goals. We also can't forget that should this dumpster fire of an argument make it all the way to the Supreme Court, there will be at least one person who has also been credibly accused of rape waiting there to protect the president. We can't overlook the personal trauma Trump is willing to cause Carroll-and we also must think about the damage Trump is willing to inflict on the whole country. If this is what Trump is willing to do when he realizes he has no valid basis to appeal a lawsuit, what will he be willing to do when he realizes that he has no valid way to win an election? What will he do should he lose that election and realize he has no valid way to stay in power? If Barr is willing to use the Justice Department for this kind of lawlessness to protect Trump from having to sit in a deposition, what will Barr be willing to do to help him stay in power? And what will Secretary of Defense Mike Esper be willing to do? What will Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley be willing to do? What evidence do we have that these men aren't every bit as craven and depraved as Barr? What evidence do we have that the sycophantic Republican Party has the strength or dignity to stand up to Trump's abuses of power? History tells us that it is during the last days of a despotic regime that things get really bad. It's when the strongman starts to lose his grip on power that his paranoia and desperation lead to the most suffering and the highest body counts. As Trump starts to feel the legal and electoral walls close in around him, he'll become ever more dangerous. If nobody in his party or his military is willing to stand up to Trump and his ruling junta now, the transition of power, whenever it comes, will not be peaceful.\n\nTo break it down still further: Trump is saying that demeaning and lying about a woman who has credibly accused him of rape is part of his job as president, and therefore he cannot be sued over his statements.

It's illegal in the same way it's illegal for the president to claim the right to consummate any marriage that takes place within his realm. There's no statute that says \" droit du seigneur is prohibited in these lands,\" because we don't need one: It's just not a power inherent to the office of the president of the United States. The presidency is an office whose powers are limited to those conferred in the Constitution, so unless the president can point to a specific constitutional grant, he does not have the authority. You can tell Trump has no legal authority for the move because the court papers filed yesterday by Attorney General William Barr and the DOJ effectively try to invent the authority they suddenly claim to have. The DOJ argues that the Federal Tort Claims Act grants the president, and every federal employee, immunity from private lawsuits. They then insist that since the president is claiming Federal Tort Claim immunity, he is entitled to be represented by the government. Their argument is fallacious, and insultingly so, but you have to know a little bit about the Federal Tort Claims Act to understand why. The act does indeed grant all government employees personal immunity from civil lawsuits, but that immunity extends only to civil lawsuits arising out of their government responsibilities. It exists so that one of these live-free-or-die fools can't sue the head of the IRS personally for \"theft\" over enforcement of tax laws. It exists so that the head of the zoning board doesn't get sued by a homeowner who is angry because they can't build a zeppelin mooring mast on top of their McMansion. It exists because we live in a litigious society and workaday government employees shouldn't need to keep a lawyer on retainer to protect them from whatever crazy conspiracy QAnon comes up with next. The Federal Tort Claims Act is there for government employees who do their jobs-not ones who spend their days watching Fox News while calling their sexual assault accusers \"ugly\" and tweeting on a toilet bowl. When government employees are sued for their private actions, they are not protected by the statute and they do not get access to government lawyers. While there is a case of a congressman's getting FTCA protection for defamatory statements he made regarding Hezbollah, we haven't seen elected officials try to stretch immunity to cover their private sex lives. There have been quite a few government employees accused of sexual assault over the years, and none of them have had the DOJ come riding to their rescue. It would, in fact, be unworkable if every government employee protected by the Federal Tort Claims Act got a government lawyer every time they were accused of private misconduct. I fully expect Trump to lose this argument, just like he's lost all the other ones in this case. It's a bad argument and would set an untenable precedent for future presidents and for every government employee in the country. Still, focusing simply on the faulty legal reasoning of the argument somehow fails to grasp the full depth of Trump's and Barr's debasement of their offices. The statement from Carroll's lawyer, Roberta Kaplan (who, full disclosure, I believe is one of the best attorneys in the country), starts to get at the true despotic nature of what is going on here. Kaplan says: Realizing that there was no valid basis to appeal that decision in the New York courts, on the very day that he would have been required to appeal, Trump instead enlisted the U.S. Department of Justice to replace his private lawyers and argue that when he lied about sexually assaulting our client, explaining that she \"wasn't his type,\" he was acting in his official capacity as President of the United States. Even in today's world, that argument is shocking. It offends me as a lawyer, and offends me even more as a citizen. Trump's effort to wield the power of the U.S. government to evade responsibility for his private misconduct is without precedent, and shows even more starkly how far he is willing to go to prevent the truth from coming out.

We can't forget that Trump is bringing the full weight of the federal government down upon a single woman to defend himself from rape accusations after the usual tactics of screaming, shaming, and bullying failed to bring about the desired result. Trump, the defendant, is getting due process, but that's not enough for him. He wants immunity from ever having to even answer for these charges, and he's now willing to use lawyers from the Department of Justice-which is there to prosecute mobsters and terrorists-to achieve his goals. We also can't forget that should this dumpster fire of an argument make it all the way to the Supreme Court, there will be at least one person who has also been credibly accused of rape waiting there to protect the president. We can't overlook the personal trauma Trump is willing to cause Carroll-and we also must think about the damage Trump is willing to inflict on the whole country. If this is what Trump is willing to do when he realizes he has no valid basis to appeal a lawsuit, what will he be willing to do when he realizes that he has no valid way to win an election? What will he do should he lose that election and realize he has no valid way to stay in power? If Barr is willing to use the Justice Department for this kind of lawlessness to protect Trump from having to sit in a deposition, what will Barr be willing to do to help him stay in power?

What evidence do we have that these men aren't every bit as craven and depraved as Barr? What evidence do we have that the sycophantic Republican Party has the strength or dignity to stand up to Trump's abuses of power? History tells us that it is during the last days of a despotic regime that things get really bad. It's when the strongman starts to lose his grip on power that his paranoia and desperation lead to the most suffering and the highest body counts. As Trump starts to feel the legal and electoral walls close in around him, he'll become ever more dangerous. If nobody in his party or his military is willing to stand up to Trump and his ruling junta now, the transition of power, whenever it comes, will not be peaceful.\n\nCarroll sued Trump for defamation last November over his apparent lies about their meeting. Trump argued, as he always does, that a sitting president is entitled to civil immunity for his private behavior. That is the argument he lost in front of a New York court last month. It was always obvious that Trump was going to lose. We knew he was going to lose because Bill Clinton lost on the same argument more than 20 years ago. Clinton argued that as a sitting president, he could not be sued by Paula Jones over his private conduct-in that case, alleged sexual harassment. Clinton v. Jones went all the way to the Supreme Court, where the court ruled unanimously that a sitting president had no such immunity. After losing, however, President Clinton did not enlist the Department of Justice to substitute for his private defense lawyers. He did not ask US taxpayers to support his web of lies.

Still, focusing simply on the faulty legal reasoning of the argument somehow fails to grasp the full depth of Trump's and Barr's debasement of their offices. The statement from Carroll's lawyer, Roberta Kaplan (who, full disclosure, I believe is one of the best attorneys in the country), starts to get at the true despotic nature of what is going on here. Kaplan says: Realizing that there was no valid basis to appeal that decision in the New York courts, on the very day that he would have been required to appeal, Trump instead enlisted the U.S. Department of Justice to replace his private lawyers and argue that when he lied about sexually assaulting our client, explaining that she \"wasn't his type,\" he was acting in his official capacity as President of the United States. Even in today's world, that argument is shocking. It offends me as a lawyer, and offends me even more as a citizen. Trump's effort to wield the power of the U.S. government to evade responsibility for his private misconduct is without precedent, and shows even more starkly how far he is willing to go to prevent the truth from coming out. Mystal on Barr How Yale Became the Latest Target in the Plot to Kill Affirmative Action Elie Mystal Congrats, Dems: You Just Let Trump's Chief Henchman Off the Hook Elie Mystal The Trump Administration Is on a Capital Punishment Killing Spree Elie Mystal We can't lose sight of the fact that Trump is being accused of rape. We can't forget that Trump is bringing the full weight of the federal government down upon a single woman to defend himself from rape accusations after the usual tactics of screaming, shaming, and bullying failed to bring about the desired result. Trump, the defendant, is getting due process, but that's not enough for him. He wants immunity from ever having to even answer for these charges, and he's now willing to use lawyers from the Department of Justice-which is there to prosecute mobsters and terrorists-to achieve his goals. We also can't forget that should this dumpster fire of an argument make it all the way to the Supreme Court, there will be at least one person who has also been credibly accused of rape waiting there to protect the president. We can't overlook the personal trauma Trump is willing to cause Carroll-and we also must think about the damage Trump is willing to inflict on the whole country. If this is what Trump is willing to do when he realizes he has no valid basis to appeal a lawsuit, what will he be willing to do when he realizes that he has no valid way to win an election? What will he do should he lose that election and realize he has no valid way to stay in power? If Barr is willing to use the Justice Department for this kind of lawlessness to protect Trump from having to sit in a deposition, what will Barr be willing to do to help him stay in power? And what will Secretary of Defense Mike Esper be willing to do? What will Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley be willing to do? What evidence do we have that these men aren't every bit as craven and depraved as Barr? What evidence do we have that the sycophantic Republican Party has the strength or dignity to stand up to Trump's abuses of power? History tells us that it is during the last days of a despotic regime that things get really bad. It's when the strongman starts to lose his grip on power that his paranoia and desperation lead to the most suffering and the highest body counts. As Trump starts to feel the legal and electoral walls close in around him, he'll become ever more dangerous. If nobody in his party or his military is willing to stand up to Trump and his ruling junta now, the transition of power, whenever it comes, will not be peaceful.\n\nYou can tell Trump has no legal authority for the move because the court papers filed yesterday by Attorney General William Barr and the DOJ effectively try to invent the authority they suddenly claim to have. The DOJ argues that the Federal Tort Claims Act grants the president, and every federal employee, immunity from private lawsuits. They then insist that since the president is claiming Federal Tort Claim immunity, he is entitled to be represented by the government. Their argument is fallacious, and insultingly so, but you have to know a little bit about the Federal Tort Claims Act to understand why. The act does indeed grant all government employees personal immunity from civil lawsuits, but that immunity extends only to civil lawsuits arising out of their government responsibilities. It exists so that one of these live-free-or-die fools can't sue the head of the IRS personally for \"theft\" over enforcement of tax laws. It exists so that the head of the zoning board doesn't get sued by a homeowner who is angry because they can't build a zeppelin mooring mast on top of their McMansion. It exists because we live in a litigious society and workaday government employees shouldn't need to keep a lawyer on retainer to protect them from whatever crazy conspiracy QAnon comes up with next. The Federal Tort Claims Act is there for government employees who do their jobs-not ones who spend their days watching Fox News while calling their sexual assault accusers \"ugly\" and tweeting on a toilet bowl. When government employees are sued for their private actions, they are not protected by the statute and they do not get access to government lawyers. While there is a case of a congressman's getting FTCA protection for defamatory statements he made regarding Hezbollah, we haven't seen elected officials try to stretch immunity to cover their private sex lives. There have been quite a few government employees accused of sexual assault over the years, and none of them have had the DOJ come riding to their rescue. It would, in fact, be unworkable if every government employee protected by the Federal Tort Claims Act got a government lawyer every time they were accused of private misconduct.

He wants immunity from ever having to even answer for these charges, and he's now willing to use lawyers from the Department of Justice-which is there to prosecute mobsters and terrorists-to achieve his goals. We also can't forget that should this dumpster fire of an argument make it all the way to the Supreme Court, there will be at least one person who has also been credibly accused of rape waiting there to protect the president. We can't overlook the personal trauma Trump is willing to cause Carroll-and we also must think about the damage Trump is willing to inflict on the whole country. If this is what Trump is willing to do when he realizes he has no valid basis to appeal a lawsuit, what will he be willing to do when he realizes that he has no valid way to win an election? What will he do should he lose that election and realize he has no valid way to stay in power? If Barr is willing to use the Justice Department for this kind of lawlessness to protect Trump from having to sit in a deposition, what will Barr be willing to do to help him stay in power? And what will Secretary of Defense Mike Esper be willing to do? What will Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley be willing to do? What evidence do we have that these men aren't every bit as craven and depraved as Barr? What evidence do we have that the sycophantic Republican Party has the strength or dignity to stand up to Trump's abuses of power? History tells us that it is during the last days of a despotic regime that things get really bad. It's when the strongman starts to lose his grip on power that his paranoia and desperation lead to the most suffering and the highest body counts. As Trump starts to feel the legal and electoral walls close in around him, he'll become ever more dangerous. If nobody in his party or his military is willing to stand up to Trump and his ruling junta now, the transition of power, whenever it comes, will not be peaceful.\n\nRealizing that there was no valid basis to appeal that decision in the New York courts, on the very day that he would have been required to appeal, Trump instead enlisted the U.S. Department of Justice to replace his private lawyers and argue that when he lied about sexually assaulting our client, explaining that she \"wasn't his type,\" he was acting in his official capacity as President of the United States. Even in today's world, that argument is shocking. It offends me as a lawyer, and offends me even more as a citizen. Trump's effort to wield the power of the U.S. government to evade responsibility for his private misconduct is without precedent, and shows even more starkly how far he is willing to go to prevent the truth from coming out.

Carroll's case, accusing Trump of sexual assault in a Manhattan department store dressing room in the 1990s, serves as a bookend to the Access Hollywood tape, which cemented Trump's reputation for both sexual assault and immunity to consequences. But it also raises the question: Will Trump slither away again? 1 Despite a decades-long history of fleecing contractors on his building projects, diverting charitable contributions to his personal use, and defrauding students at his bogus university, Trump avoided arrest until earlier this month, when he showed up for his New York arraignment in the case of falsified reports of a hush-money payment to a porn star, a matter that is arguably the Trumpiest concoction of them all. Many people, including The Nation 's Elie Mystal, believe that the legal scaffolding for that prosecution is shaky, and that Trump is likely to wriggle out of other legal difficulties as well. After all, The New York Times once accused Trump of committing \" outright fraud ,\" and backed it up with thousands of words of documentation. Nothing happened. 2 Yet, with criminal investigations in Atlanta and Washington, D.C., soon reaching their decision points, Trump's crime spree may not keep paying quite so well. Trump has proved unable to fool all of the people all of the time. Can he really beat all the raps all the time? 3 Related Articles Donald Trump Has Been Indicted. Don't Get Your Hopes Up.

The state's lawsuit against Trump's skeevy \"university\" reached a similar end , with the scam shut down and Trump paying out $25 million in restitution. 5 Trump's reflexive lying is not a useful talent in the legal system. Neither is grievance-mongering, blame-shifting, whataboutism, misogyny, racial aggression, ad hominem attacks, or other Trump core competencies. Courts are partial to facts, which have never been partial to Trump. Courts likewise reward preparation, discipline, and coherence, which can help steer fact patterns onto favorable terrain. Trump, by contrast, is a notoriously sprawling mess. Out of one side of his mouth he shouts that the classified documents found at Mar-a-Lago are his rightful property, while out of the other he claims they were planted by the FBI. If you're looking to establish consciousness of guilt, it's hard to beat declaring that the papers taken from your office were planted by the deep state. Crooked cops, after all, don't plant evidence of innocence. 6 Perhaps the prosecutors investigating Trump in New York, Washington, D.C., and Atlanta will all prove to be incompetent bumpkins. But that seems unlikely. Even Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney who is generally perceived to have the weakest hand, is acutely aware of the stakes. For better or worse, this case will define his career. Would he have indicted Trump on only the flimsiest of proof? Possibly. But I wouldn't bet on it. 7 Current Issue View our current issue Trump's current predicament calls to mind the right-wing scammers who made long careers propagating baseless allegations of election fraud. Kris Kobach, Hans von Spakovsky, and others had a consequence-free run-until the ACLU brought a lawsuit against a Kobach-promoted voter law in Kansas. With witnesses under oath, handcuffed to facts, Kobach was publicly humiliated in the process of losing the case. Similarly, it was the threat of testimony under oath that threw a $787.5 million wrench into Rupert Murdoch's lie factory earlier this month. 8 Trump will be tried in at least one jurisdiction where red caps are not much in demand. Having backed himself into a corner with a litany of lies, he can't strike a plea deal without it being accurately perceived as surrender. And if he hopes for rescue by the Supreme Court, one-third of which he installed, he may discover that the right-wing politicos on the bench are ingrates. If they have to choose between saving Trump's bacon, or ridding their party of an electoral anvil, the bacon is, well, toast. 9 More From Francis Wilkinson Representative Jim Jordan's Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Hearings April 11, 2023 How sure am I that Trump will face the music?

Activate your online access\n\nRecent events have shown that Trump does not have to impose a new regime of censorship if the press censors itself first.\n\nDonald Trump is a clear and present danger to the freedom of the press. He tells his violent and rabid supporters that the media is an \"enemy of the people,\" sues news outlets over coverage he doesn't like, and constantly threatens to change the laws to limit freedom of the press. Still, for all of his rhetorical bluster and real legal aggression, he is not the greatest danger to the press. That dystopian honor goes to the people who own the press themselves.\n\nIn December, ABC News settled a defamation lawsuit brought by Trump, agreeing to offer a written apology and make a $15 million \"charitable contribution\" to Trump's future presidential foundation and museum. The settlement was rightly viewed as a major legal victory for the grifter in chief, but it also, and more crucially, represented a massive failure by a news media that is simply unwilling to defend itself against Trump's attacks.\n\nTrump's lawsuit concerned comments made by This Week anchor George Stephanopoulos. During a March 2024 interview, he referred to the case brought against Trump by E. Jean Carroll, noting that \"judges and two separate juries have found [Trump] liable for rape and for defaming the victim of that rape.\"\n\nStephanopoulos's use of the term rape was technically inaccurate. The jury in the Carroll case found Trump liable for sexual abuse and awarded her $5 million, but it did not find him liable for rape. Under New York State law, rape requires penetration by a penis, while sexual abuse does not. But in the common parlance, the events Carroll described for which Trump was held liable are often referred to as rape. You don't have to take my word for it. In 2023, Judge Lewis Kaplan (a Bill Clinton appointee) dismissed a defamation lawsuit Trump had brought against Carroll, writing: \"Indeed, the jury's verdict in [ Carroll ] establishes...the fact that Mr. Trump 'raped' her, albeit digitally rather than with his penis. Thus, it establishes against him the substantial truth of Ms. Carroll's 'rape' accusations.\"\n\nKaplan's ruling could have been applied to the Trump lawsuit against Stephanopoulos, but in July 2024, Judge Cecilia Altonaga (a George W. Bush appointee) refused to dismiss Trump's case, arguing that \"Stephanopoulos's statements dealt not with the public's usage of that term [ rape ], but the jury's consideration of it during a formal legal proceeding.\" While I found Altonaga's ruling dubious, it nonetheless set the stage for a discovery process (during which Trump's legal team would have had access to internal ABC News e-mails), a trial, and perhaps a lengthy appeals process, by which point Trump would be a sitting president again.\n\nInstead of fighting Trump, ABC News and its parent company, Disney, decided to capitulate. Never mind that Trump's case was weak, even after Altonaga's ruling. The bar to defame a public figure is very high in this country; indeed, First Amendment protections are arguably at their strongest when talking about politicians and certainly the president. To win, Trump's legal team would have had to prove not only that Stephanopoulos's statement was false and defamatory-something that would be up to a jury to determine-but also that Stephanopoulos acted with malice.\n\nNever mind also that Disney is a global behemoth with a market cap of more than $200 billion, meaning that, even if Trump had ultimately been successful in his claims, the legal damages would not have been financially crippling. Trump is already widely regarded by people likely to be watching Stephanopoulos as a man of low character who can't be trusted. While defaming such a person is possible, it's hard to come up with a theory of how Stephanopoulos's words damaged Trump's already scummy reputation beyond \"slap on the wrist\" money.\n\nWhat makes the ABC case so troubling is that, as craven a display of preemptive obeisance as it was, it was hardly singular. We have seen a lot of this cowardice from the media these past few months-from the decisions of the owners of the Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post to forgo endorsing a presidential candidate to the choice of morning-show hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski to travel to Mar-a-Lago to kiss Trump's ring. The most powerful forces in the media seem to have decided that keeping Trump happy is their prime mission.\n\nOf course, Trump has taken all this media genuflecting as license to go farther. Just before the election, he filed a $10 billion lawsuit against CBS, claiming that the network had edited its 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris to make her look good. And in December, he sued The Des Moines Register ; its parent company, Gannett; and the pollster Ann Selzer for publishing her poll suggesting Trump was going to lose Iowa. That poll turned out to be incredibly wrong, but threatening a news organization because its polling was wrong illustrates just how fiercely Trump plans to harass media outlets that don't give him the narratives he wants.\n\nStill, as bad as harassment is, it's not the same as changing the law to weaken press freedoms. Before his first term, Trump talked about \"opening up the libel laws\" to make it easier for people like him to sue the press. He did not, however, make good on that promise (admittedly a hard task, given that libel laws are determined primarily by the states), and while some judges appear squishy about press freedoms, there hasn't been a major recision of First Amendment protections since Trump emerged on the scene. The law, in broad strokes, has not changed on core free-press issues.\n\nBut the law does not have to change if the press will not fight for its freedoms. If Jeff Bezos, Disney, and Warner Bros. Discovery (which owns CNN) simply cower in the face of Trump, he and his loyal Supreme Court justices do not have to change the laws to silence the press. Trump does not have to impose a new regime of censorship if the press censors itself first. And that, I believe, is what we are witnessing now: a press that gives away its First Amendment rights before Trump takes them away. A press that will not speak truth to power if power threatens to kick their owners off a cocktail party list or gum up their operations.\n\nThe debasement of the press will continue until readers and viewers reject the media that would rather lie to them than tell the truth to Trump. The people who run these publications and news organizations are betting that we won't.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

Jean Carroll last May, and awarded her $5 million. The law that let Carroll sue Trump for an assault she said happened in the mid-1990s was the Adult Survivors Act, which opened a one-year window for people who suffered sexual abuse to bring civil suits against their abusers. That window closed last week. So it's fitting that Trump bid adieu to the law on his failing Truth Social platform on Wednesday, pointing to two prominent New York Democrats who were also sued under its provisions. \"I hope that Mayor Eric Adam's [sic], Andrew Cuomo, and all of the others that got sued based on this ridiculous law where someone can be sued decades later, and with no proof, will fight it on being totally unfair and UNCONSTITUTIONAL,\" the disgraced former president ranted. (Spoiler alert: It's not unconstitutional.) Indeed, Adams and Cuomo were sued under the law's provisions , but unlike Trump, they have not yet been found liable, and may not be. That's how it works, the law's original sponsor, Assembly member Linda Rosenthal told me. \"You still have to go to court,\" she said. I spoke to Rosenthal the same day Trump spewed bile about the law she cosponsored with state Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal. The pair, and others, are assessing the way it worked-it led to almost 3,000 lawsuits-and whether its provisions should be extended. Our conversation has been condensed for length and clarity. * * * So obviously Donald Trump is the most famous target of the Adult Survivors Act-and other prominent people include not just Adams and Cuomo, but also celebrities like Sean Combs [who settled with his accuser last week], Harvey Weinstein, Mike Tyson, Russell Brand. They get the headlines. But I wanted to talk to you about less-well-known targets. The New York Times reported there were 479 suits related to abuse at Rikers Island, at least 300 against New York hospitals and health systems. What else should people know?

At last count, there were 1,696 in the court of claims and 1,555 through the Supreme Court. That's a really interesting aspect of it. I think that's why some people in government were wary of this-that so many state and city agencies would be on the hook.

This has provided a venue for people who feel they were sexually assaulted or abused under city or state care. We're going to find a lot of instances that will change practices in those facilities. Do you have examples of policy change? Or is it too early? Not yet. I'm pretty sure I will going forward. What I've heard more recently is people calling and saying they missed the deadline. I certainly think once we get more details about hospitals, or foster care, we'll have our work cut out for us in terms of changing practices and changing standards. People have to know they will be held accountable. That's why we had this look-back window: We didn't want abusers to say, well, if they haven't sued me by now, I can keep doing what I'm doing. With this they can't. The fact that people say they missed the deadline is sad. I'd heard about the law, but the first I really learned about it was when Carroll brought her suit against Trump. I think some people didn't know about it, or certainly didn't know about the deadline. So what are you thinking about going forward? All of this started with the Child Victims Act [which Rosenthal cosponsored], and at that time you had the Catholic Church and others fighting tooth and nail, it took 14 years. But in the end, most legislators voted for it-because most people support these laws. I think through that process, people learned about trauma, how people process it, that it can take 20 to 30 years. Victims-survivors-deserve that chance to cope with it and try to take some action. Then there were some people, maybe fresh out of law school, who said, well we have statutes of limitation for a reason. And we do. But we have exceptions. And should there be a statute of limitations for sex crimes? In 2006 we removed the statute of limitations of rape in the first degree. We extended the statutes for rape in the second degree, for child sexual assault, but there are still limitations. And should there be? You know, with Agent Orange [a chemical used by US forces in the Vietnam War that not only killed Vietnamese people but caused cancer and death in American soldiers], we extended the statute of limitations. So what rises to the level of consideration to extend those statutes? Certain types of harm aren't understood right away-whether it's Agent Orange's effects, or the effects of rape and trauma... Right, and who wrote all these laws? Mostly men. Now that we have more women in the system, and women are more likely to be victims, maybe that will change. Some people have said, what about the rights of the accused, after all those years? Obviously we care about the rights of the accused. The accuser still has to go to court and prove it-I mean, you can proclaim it, but this actually provides a fairer atmosphere for those accused to redeem themselves. There are disingenuous claims. But I believe the majority of them are valid, from all the survivors I've talked to over the years. You're not going to go through the trauma of re-explaining your case, and getting evidence, if you don't have a good reason. So what are you planning going forward? I'm discussing it with my colleagues, activists, advocates. Should we add another year? With the Child Victims Act we did that, and in the last year there were another 11,000 cases filed. In this case, we're still getting calls: I didn't know about it at all, or I didn't know there was a deadline, or the deadline snuck up on me. For a lot of people, just coping with it is a lot. So the question is, should we extend it another year? Or should we do it permanently? Nothing is decided yet. Do you have a preference? Not right now. I do have a bill to remove the statute of limitations on child sexual assault-perhaps there should not be one, especially for children. But then we got caught up with passing the Adult Survivors Act. But that's still on the table as well.\n\nSo it's fitting that Trump bid adieu to the law on his failing Truth Social platform on Wednesday, pointing to two prominent New York Democrats who were also sued under its provisions. \"I hope that Mayor Eric Adam's [sic], Andrew Cuomo, and all of the others that got sued based on this ridiculous law where someone can be sued decades later, and with no proof, will fight it on being totally unfair and UNCONSTITUTIONAL,\" the disgraced former president ranted. (Spoiler alert: It's not unconstitutional.) Indeed, Adams and Cuomo were sued under the law's provisions , but unlike Trump, they have not yet been found liable, and may not be. That's how it works, the law's original sponsor, Assembly member Linda Rosenthal told me. \"You still have to go to court,\" she said. I spoke to Rosenthal the same day Trump spewed bile about the law she cosponsored with state Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal. The pair, and others, are assessing the way it worked-it led to almost 3,000 lawsuits-and whether its provisions should be extended. Our conversation has been condensed for length and clarity. * * * So obviously Donald Trump is the most famous target of the Adult Survivors Act-and other prominent people include not just Adams and Cuomo, but also celebrities like Sean Combs [who settled with his accuser last week], Harvey Weinstein, Mike Tyson, Russell Brand. They get the headlines. But I wanted to talk to you about less-well-known targets. The New York Times reported there were 479 suits related to abuse at Rikers Island, at least 300 against New York hospitals and health systems. What else should people know?

I do have a bill to remove the statute of limitations on child sexual assault-perhaps there should not be one, especially for children. But then we got caught up with passing the Adult Survivors Act. But that's still on the table as well.\n\n* * * So obviously Donald Trump is the most famous target of the Adult Survivors Act-and other prominent people include not just Adams and Cuomo, but also celebrities like Sean Combs [who settled with his accuser last week], Harvey Weinstein, Mike Tyson, Russell Brand. They get the headlines. But I wanted to talk to you about less-well-known targets. The New York Times reported there were 479 suits related to abuse at Rikers Island, at least 300 against New York hospitals and health systems. What else should people know?

That's not up to me. And also, if the complaints are brought against [public] agencies, they have to be filed in the court of claims. And over the year, there were actually more filed in the court of claims than in the New York Supreme Court. At last count, there were 1,696 in the court of claims and 1,555 through the Supreme Court. That's a really interesting aspect of it. I think that's why some people in government were wary of this-that so many state and city agencies would be on the hook.

This has provided a venue for people who feel they were sexually assaulted or abused under city or state care. We're going to find a lot of instances that will change practices in those facilities. Do you have examples of policy change? Or is it too early? Not yet. I'm pretty sure I will going forward. What I've heard more recently is people calling and saying they missed the deadline. I certainly think once we get more details about hospitals, or foster care, we'll have our work cut out for us in terms of changing practices and changing standards. People have to know they will be held accountable. That's why we had this look-back window: We didn't want abusers to say, well, if they haven't sued me by now, I can keep doing what I'm doing. With this they can't. The fact that people say they missed the deadline is sad. I'd heard about the law, but the first I really learned about it was when Carroll brought her suit against Trump. I think some people didn't know about it, or certainly didn't know about the deadline. So what are you thinking about going forward? All of this started with the Child Victims Act [which Rosenthal cosponsored], and at that time you had the Catholic Church and others fighting tooth and nail, it took 14 years. But in the end, most legislators voted for it-because most people support these laws. I think through that process, people learned about trauma, how people process it, that it can take 20 to 30 years. Victims-survivors-deserve that chance to cope with it and try to take some action. Then there were some people, maybe fresh out of law school, who said, well we have statutes of limitation for a reason. And we do. But we have exceptions. And should there be a statute of limitations for sex crimes? In 2006 we removed the statute of limitations of rape in the first degree. We extended the statutes for rape in the second degree, for child sexual assault, but there are still limitations. And should there be? You know, with Agent Orange [a chemical used by US forces in the Vietnam War that not only killed Vietnamese people but caused cancer and death in American soldiers], we extended the statute of limitations. So what rises to the level of consideration to extend those statutes? Certain types of harm aren't understood right away-whether it's Agent Orange's effects, or the effects of rape and trauma... Right, and who wrote all these laws? Mostly men. Now that we have more women in the system, and women are more likely to be victims, maybe that will change. Some people have said, what about the rights of the accused, after all those years? Obviously we care about the rights of the accused. The accuser still has to go to court and prove it-I mean, you can proclaim it, but this actually provides a fairer atmosphere for those accused to redeem themselves. There are disingenuous claims. But I believe the majority of them are valid, from all the survivors I've talked to over the years. You're not going to go through the trauma of re-explaining your case, and getting evidence, if you don't have a good reason. So what are you planning going forward? I'm discussing it with my colleagues, activists, advocates. Should we add another year? With the Child Victims Act we did that, and in the last year there were another 11,000 cases filed. In this case, we're still getting calls: I didn't know about it at all, or I didn't know there was a deadline, or the deadline snuck up on me. For a lot of people, just coping with it is a lot.

But that's still on the table as well.\n\nAll of this started with the Child Victims Act [which Rosenthal cosponsored], and at that time you had the Catholic Church and others fighting tooth and nail, it took 14 years. But in the end, most legislators voted for it-because most people support these laws. I think through that process, people learned about trauma, how people process it, that it can take 20 to 30 years. Victims-survivors-deserve that chance to cope with it and try to take some action. Then there were some people, maybe fresh out of law school, who said, well we have statutes of limitation for a reason. And we do. But we have exceptions. And should there be a statute of limitations for sex crimes? In 2006 we removed the statute of limitations of rape in the first degree. We extended the statutes for rape in the second degree, for child sexual assault, but there are still limitations. And should there be? You know, with Agent Orange [a chemical used by US forces in the Vietnam War that not only killed Vietnamese people but caused cancer and death in American soldiers], we extended the statute of limitations. So what rises to the level of consideration to extend those statutes? Certain types of harm aren't understood right away-whether it's Agent Orange's effects, or the effects of rape and trauma... Right, and who wrote all these laws? Mostly men. Now that we have more women in the system, and women are more likely to be victims, maybe that will change. Some people have said, what about the rights of the accused, after all those years? Obviously we care about the rights of the accused. The accuser still has to go to court and prove it-I mean, you can proclaim it, but this actually provides a fairer atmosphere for those accused to redeem themselves. There are disingenuous claims. But I believe the majority of them are valid, from all the survivors I've talked to over the years. You're not going to go through the trauma of re-explaining your case, and getting evidence, if you don't have a good reason. So what are you planning going forward? I'm discussing it with my colleagues, activists, advocates. Should we add another year? With the Child Victims Act we did that, and in the last year there were another 11,000 cases filed. In this case, we're still getting calls: I didn't know about it at all, or I didn't know there was a deadline, or the deadline snuck up on me. For a lot of people, just coping with it is a lot.

Jean Carroll, is contending that he doesn't have to pay the $83 million he owes for defaming her.\n\nBy Benjamin Weiser\n\nBenjamin Weiser covers the federal courts and the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan, and the justice system more broadly.\n\nPresident Trump and the writer E. Jean Carroll are arguing over whether a Supreme Court decision affording him substantial criminal immunity also shields him from having to pay tens of millions in damages for insulting her and saying she lied about his sexually assaulting her.\n\nMr. Trump made his arguments last year in his appeal of the $83.3 million verdict by a jury that found him liable for defaming Ms. Carroll in 2019 after she accused him of a decades-old attack. On Monday, Ms. Carroll pushed sharply back.\n\nHer lawyer, Roberta A. Kaplan, argued in a brief that Mr. Trump's view of the Supreme Court's ruling, which protected him from charges that he tried to overturn the 2020 election, was too expansive. His statements calling Ms. Carroll's accusation \"a complete con job\" and \"a Hoax and a lie,\" were strictly personal, she wrote. She said they fell far outside the boundaries of the official acts that presidential immunity protects.\n\n\"If there were ever a case where immunity does not shield a president's speech, this one is it,\" Ms. Kaplan said in her brief.\n\nThe dispute over the Supreme Court's landmark decision, which addressed the scope of a president's immunity from prosecution, comes as Mr. Trump has seen criminal cases against him in two states come to an end, and a third delayed indefinitely. In a fourth case, in New York, after Mr. Trump was found guilty of 34 counts in a trial stemming from a hush-money payment to a porn star, the judge imposed no jail time.\n\nBut Ms. Carroll's legal battle with Mr. Trump - fought in two lawsuits spanning more than half a decade and now based in the federal appeals court for the Second Circuit in Manhattan - continues to move forward.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Jean Carroll, but called her a liar. The award was \"a huge defeat for every bully who has tried to keep a woman down,\" she said.\n\nBy Benjamin Weiser Jonah E. Bromwich Maria Cramer and Kate Christobek\n\nFormer President Donald J. Trump was ordered by a Manhattan jury on Friday to pay $83.3 million to the writer E. Jean Carroll for defaming her in 2019 after she accused him of a decades-old rape, attacks he continued in social media posts, at news conferences and even in the midst of the trial itself.\n\nMs. Carroll's lawyers had argued that a large award was necessary to stop Mr. Trump from continuing to attack her. After less than three hours of deliberation, the jury responded by awarding Ms. Carroll $65 million in punitive damages, finding that Mr. Trump had acted with malice. On one recent day, he made more than 40 derisive posts about Ms. Carroll on his Truth Social website.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Trump had already left the courtroom for the day when the judge, Lewis A. Kaplan, called in the nine-member jury shortly after 4:30 p.m., warning the lawyers, \"We will have no outbursts.\" The verdict was delivered nine minutes later to utter silence in the courtroom.\n\nIn addition to the $65 million, jurors awarded Ms. Carroll $18.3 million in compensatory damages for her suffering. Mr. Trump's lawyers slumped in their seats as the dollar figures were read aloud. The jury was dismissed, and Ms. Carroll, 80, embraced her lawyers. Minutes later, she walked out of the courthouse arm in arm with her legal team, beaming for the cameras.\n\n\"This is a great victory for every woman who stands up when she's been knocked down and a huge defeat for every bully who has tried to keep a woman down,\" Ms. Carroll said in a statement, thanking her lawyers effusively.\n\nMr. Trump, who had walked out of the courtroom earlier during the closing argument by Ms. Carroll's lawyer, said in a Truth Social post that the verdict was \"absolutely ridiculous.\"\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Trump - a world of possibility opened before her: How to use the money?\n\nThe amount vastly eclipsed the $5 million awarded to her by a jury last spring in a different trial against Mr. Trump. It could take years before she sees the money, as Mr. Trump has said he will appeal, but she is already considering how she might use the money once she obtains it.\n\n\"I'm not going to waste a cent of this,\" she said. \"We're going to do something good with it.\"\n\nFiguring that out will take some time, she added. But she will splurge on one luxury, she said - for her Great Pyrenees and her pit bull. \"I'm going to be able to buy some premium dog food now,\" she said.\n\nMs. Carroll, appearing relaxed and happy in her lawyers' offices on Saturday, spoke in her first interview since the Manhattan jury's award in her favor a day earlier.\n\nMs. Carroll, 80, sued Mr. Trump, 77, for defamation after he called her a liar in June 2019, when she first publicly accused him, in a magazine article , of sexually assaulting her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room decades earlier. Mr. Trump continued to attack Ms. Carroll, in posts on his Truth Social website that lasted right into the trial, as well as in news conferences and on the campaign trail.\n\nAfter the verdict on Friday, Mr. Trump, issued a new attack on social media: \"Our Legal System is out of control, and being used as a Political Weapon.\" But he avoided criticizing Ms. Carroll, a silence that spoke volumes.

But the former president still claims he does not know who she is.\n\nBy Benjamin Weiser Maggie Haberman and Maria Cramer\n\nA Manhattan jury will be asked a narrow question this week: How much money must former President Donald J. Trump pay the writer E. Jean Carroll for defaming her after she accused him of raping her?\n\nMs. Carroll's chance encounter decades ago at the Bergdorf Goodman department store, in which she said Mr. Trump shoved her against a dressing room wall, pulled down her tights and forced himself on her, was already the focus of a trial last year. A jury in May awarded Ms. Carroll just over $2 million for the assault and nearly $3 million for defamation over Mr. Trump's remark in October 2022 calling her claim \"a complete con job.\"\n\nThe trial starting Tuesday focuses on separate statements by Mr. Trump in June 2019, directly after Ms. Carroll disclosed her allegation in New York magazine . At the time, Mr. Trump called her claim \"totally false,\" saying that he had never met Ms. Carroll, a former Elle magazine advice columnist, and that she invented a story to sell a book.\n\nNow, Mr. Trump says he wants to attend and testify at Ms. Carroll's trial, something he didn't do in the earlier case. That's sparked a bitter dispute between lawyers for Ms. Carroll, 80, and Mr. Trump, 77, over what the former president could say if he took the stand, and whether he would stray beyond strict boundaries the judge has set .\n\nThe judge, Lewis A. Kaplan, has ruled that given the jury's findings in the first trial, Mr. Trump cannot now contest Ms. Carroll's version of events - as he frequently does in public statements.\n\n\"Mr. Trump is precluded from offering any testimony, evidence or argument suggesting or implying that he did not sexually assault Ms. Carroll, that she fabricated her account of the assault or that she had any motive to do so,\" Judge Kaplan wrote in an opinion on Jan. 9.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

I find it perplexing how women of integrity can seemingly compartmentalize his abhorrent behavior and still cast their ballots for a notorious womanizer.\n\nWhat's even more disturbing is his public trashing, maligning and dehumanizing of anyone who dares to hold him accountable. Remarkably, the women who support him believe his lies, many asserting that his policies trump his behavior.\n\nAdditionally, the numerous indictments and upcoming trials seem to, unbelievably, only bolster his popularity.

Jean Carroll, whom Donald Trump assaulted decades ago, seeks millions to deter his verbal attacks, the former president tries to make a political virtue of his legal travails.\n\nBy Benjamin Weiser Maggie Haberman Maria Cramer and Kate Christobek\n\nHours after Donald J. Trump cemented his political standing with a romp through the caucus rooms of Iowa, he arrived Tuesday morning in his other world: a courtroom.\n\nThe former president's motorcade drove through wet snow to the federal courthouse in Lower Manhattan, where he rode to the 26th floor. There, a jury was selected to hear arguments in a trial over how much money, if any, the former president would have to pay the writer E. Jean Carroll for defaming her after she accused him of raping her nearly three decades ago.\n\nMs. Carroll, 80, has said she encountered Mr. Trump in the mid-1990s at the Bergdorf Goodman department store in Manhattan, where he shoved her against a dressing room wall and forced himself on her. Mr. Trump, 77, has vigorously denied that he assaulted Ms. Carroll ever since she first accused him of doing so more than four years ago.\n\nThe trial is the second in eight months in which Ms. Carroll will face off against the former president. Last May, a jury awarded her just over $2 million after finding Mr. Trump liable for sexually assaulting her in the dressing room and nearly $3 million for defamation when he called her story a lie.\n\nThe civil trial that began on Tuesday focuses on separate statements that Mr. Trump made in June 2019 after Ms. Carroll revealed her allegations in New York magazine , but the judge has ruled that Ms. Carroll does not need to prove abuse and defamation a second time, given the jury's decision last May.\n\nMr. Trump, who was still in office in 2019, called Ms. Carroll's rape claim \"totally false,\" saying that he had never met Ms. Carroll, a former Elle magazine advice columnist, and that she had invented the story to sell a book.

Jean Carroll Over Rape Accusation\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nJoseph Tacopina asked Ms. Carroll to retell her story in minute detail, probing for inconsistencies. His aggressive questioning irritated the judge.\n\nBy Benjamin Weiser Lola Fadulu Hurubie Meko and Kate Christobek\n\nIn a Manhattan courtroom on Thursday, a lawyer for former President Donald J. Trump asked E. Jean Carroll, the writer who has accused Mr. Trump of raping her nearly three decades ago, whether she had screamed for help.\n\n\"I'm not a screamer,\" Ms. Carroll responded, adding that she was in a panic during the encounter in a dressing room. \"I was fighting,\" she said. \"You can't beat up on me for not screaming.\"\n\nMr. Trump's lawyer, Joseph Tacopina, said he was not doing that, but Ms. Carroll, her voice rising, said from the witness stand that women often keep silent about an attack because they fear being asked what they could have done to stop it. \"They are always asked, 'Why didn't you scream?'\" Ms. Carroll said.\n\n\"I'm telling you, he raped me, whether I screamed or not,\" she declared.\n\nThe highly charged exchange came as Ms. Carroll underwent hours of cross-examination by Mr. Tacopina, who made it clear he was seeking to undermine her testimony about what she says was a vicious attack by Mr. Trump after they ran into each other at the Bergdorf Goodman store on Fifth Avenue in the mid-1990s.\n\nMr. Trump is avoiding the trial - he is running to regain the presidency and made a campaign appearance in New Hampshire on Thursday afternoon - and the cross-examination by Mr. Tacopina could be pivotal to his defense.\n\nThe lawyer pressed Ms. Carroll repeatedly about basic facts, probing for inconsistencies and asking about her inability to remember precisely when in 1995 or 1996 the encounter occurred.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "E. Jean Carroll Discusses Trump's Comeuppance\n\nAfter decades of showing disdain for the rule of law, Donald Trump may finally have encountered the intimations of his demise, in the form of E. Jean Carroll, the former advice columnist for Elle magazine. According to Carroll, Trump raped her in the mid-nineteen-nineties in a dressing room at Bergdorf Goodman-a department store situated, as it happens, on Fifth Avenue, precisely where Trump had always said he could commit any crime he wished and \"wouldn't lose any voters, O.K.?\" Trump leads the field of Republican Presidential candidates for 2024, and his confounding hold over tens of millions of Americans persists, but it's now sinking in that his campaign schedule will be regularly inconvenienced by depositions, indictments, trials, and judgments that he won't be able to ignore or dismiss.\n\nOn May 9th, a Manhattan jury awarded Carroll five million dollars in damages in a civil case against Trump. Though the jury did not find sufficient evidence of rape, it did hold Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation. (He is appealing the judgment.) On Monday, Carroll's lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, filed court documents seeking at least another ten million dollars in a separate case, because the former President, at a live town hall on CNN \"doubled down\" on defaming Carroll. I spoke by Zoom with Carroll and Kaplan on Tuesday for The New Yorker Radio Hour . Carroll was at her cabin in the Hudson Valley; Kaplan, who goes by Robbie, was in her office, in New York City. I asked Carroll if she thought the judgment against Trump in her case-to say nothing of the legal jeopardy he faces in other courts-had finally eroded his façade of invulnerability and self-possession.\n\n\"I think we're ending it,\" she said. \"Now it's not just Robbie Kaplan, me, and the nine jurors. I think people are starting to recognize that when Donald Trump defames someone, or when Donald Trump lies, people tend to believe it, and they act on it. So, hence, they attacked the Capitol when he said he won the election. They attacked me because he said I'm a liar. . . . I think people are going to get pretty sick of 'figuring out' that Americans are acting on his lies.\" She added, \"The one way to stop him is to make him pay for lying. And if he were made to pay for 'shooting somebody on Fifth Avenue,' I don't think he would've shot him. Money is precious to him, and Robbie is going to go get some of his money for his lying.\"\n\nWas this Trump's moment of comeuppance?\n\n\"I think it just may be,\" she said.\n\nCarroll's emotional experience in recent weeks has been one of radical highs and lows. \"The happiest day of my life was on May 9th,\" she said. \"Robbie and I stood in that courtroom and heard nine jurors respond that we had been telling the truth. The moment of joy was so incredible. It was like a new world had opened up to me.\" Carroll and Kaplan went to Kaplan's law offices to celebrate. There was music, champagne, food, dancing, tears. \"The next day, we are just getting used to being so happy in a new world. And I was so tired from being happy. I was in bed when CNN started with the former President.\" Carroll said she slept through Trump's smug and bullying session with the anchor Kaitlan Collins and a loyal audience of New Hampshire Republicans.\n\n\"The next morning . . . it was like being hit by a deluge of hatred on Twitter,\" she said. \"And I didn't understand what was going on.\" Kaplan sent Carroll a transcript of the CNN town hall and she finally read Trump's remarks calling her a \"wack job\" and claiming that she had retailed a \"fake story.\" Trump claimed that Carroll had named her dog or cat (he couldn't remember which) \"Vagina.\" He had a theory of the case: \"What kind of a woman meets somebody and brings them up and within minutes you're playing hanky-panky in a dressing room?\"\n\nThe transcript was plenty shocking to Carroll, but what she could not sense fully was the sound of people laughing along with Trump's insults and accusations. When she later watched footage of the town hall, she admitted, it was painful to hear the laughter that followed Trump's comments, but she understood. \"People believe what he has to say, and they're going to go along with it,\" she said. \"And so the plunge was thorough. It was just an absolute plunge from heaven-and it's an old song-from heaven into hell, boom. But I quickly climbed out.\"\n\nAlthough Carroll has regained her sense of vindication and triumph, she is still shaken by the crowd's derisive laughter. \"It was not a slap against me,\" she said. \"It was a slap against almost every single woman who was hearing him. Every woman who's just been 'merely' pinched or grabbed. And then the guy laughs and denies\" what he's done. \"Hearing him saying those terrible things about me-I'm sure they were hurt like I was.\"\n\nKaplan told me that, despite her latest filing against Trump, she doubted that he would cease making attacks and slurs directed at Carroll. \"Not in the near term, I don't think he will,\" she said. \"I don't think he can help himself, honestly. I don't think he has enough development of the frontal lobe of his brain to do that.\"\n\nWere there any legal mechanisms to force Trump to stop attacking Carroll? \"You won't be surprised to learn, it's very rare, for a defamation defendant who's lost, to continue the defamation,\" Kaplan said. \"So there's not a lot of case-law precedent for this. There was an option, and there still is an option, to seek what's essentially a gag order. And great First Amendment experts, like Floyd Abrams, have told me that this would be maybe the best possible case, to get such a gag order. But even if we were able to succeed, there's no question it would be wrapped up in appellate issues for years and years, and there would be serious First Amendment concerns.\" The other avenue, which Kaplan chose, was to seek additional punitive damages.\n\nIt is hard to discern what percentage of the millions of Americans who say they will vote again for Trump would join in the laughter at E. Jean Carroll's expense. She said she chooses to remain upbeat.\n\n\"I love this country. I love how the federal court worked. I loved how the jury worked. I love it. We got a bad egg here, Donald Trump,\" she said, adding that she thought her case might help to persuade voters, particularly in swing states such as Michigan and Wisconsin, to abandon the former President even though \"there's a lot of women-haters in this country.\"\n\nCarroll said she hoped that she and Kaplan and the jurors who sided with her will help demonstrate that \"Donald Trump is a liar. He dragged me through the mud and he ground my face into the dirt. And yes, it happened, he raped me. I think we can turn just enough women and men at the polls to make sure he doesn't become the next President.\"\n\nCarroll is seventy-nine. She just adopted a new dog, a Great Pyrenees. \"She's right here, Miss Havisham, Sham for short,\" she said, gesturing offscreen.\n\n\"My life goes on. . . . I will go on living in this tiny cabin,\" Carroll said. \"But one thing has changed. I am going to dedicate myself to somehow figuring out a way for the women who don't have my platform to hold men accountable. Robbie and I are going to put our heads together.\" She continued, \"That's how my life is going to change. I'm a crone. I'm an elderly woman on a mountaintop. But I think we've got a few good years left to figure out a way to end the culture of sexual violence. That's what I want to do.\" ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "The Vindication of E. Jean Carroll\n\nFamously, Donald Trump once fantasized about committing murder on the street outside his apartment. \"I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any voters,\" he said, during a 2016 campaign stop in Sioux Center, Iowa. In the recent civil trial that the writer E. Jean Carroll brought against Trump in New York, she didn't accuse the former President of shooting her outside Trump Tower. She said that he had raped her, just up the block, in the nineteen-nineties. A jury in Manhattan , after listening to the evidence presented to them during the past two weeks, awarded her five million dollars in damages in a civil battery and defamation case. (They stopped short of branding Trump a rapist, settling for a definition of \"battery\" that includes \"sexual abuse.\")\n\nCarroll, a former advice columnist for Elle and media personality, went public with her allegations in 2019, in a New York magazine article , in which she wrote that Trump forced himself on her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room. When she first filed a lawsuit against Trump, a few months after the article ran, he was still the President, and many considered the suit hopeless. How could a private citizen get justice through the courts in a case like this, against Trump of all people? And yet on Tuesday, Carroll was vindicated, in a trial that marks the first time jurors have been tasked with determining whether a former President was a rapist or merely a sexual abuser.\n\nCarroll's lawyers called Carroll herself to the stand (she was also cross-examined by Trump's lawyers for two days), and then called two friends whom Carroll told about the encounter with Trump shortly after it happened. They also called two other women who have publicly accused Trump of sexual assault-Jessica Leeds and Natasha Stoynoff-as well as an expert in psychological trauma, and two former employees of Bergdorf Goodman, who both supported elements of Carroll's account, with one testifying that he had seen Trump in the store. Trump skipped the trial, and his lawyers called no witnesses of their own. Joseph Tacopina, Trump's lead lawyer, said that his client didn't need to mount a defense, because his case had \"emerged\" through cross-examination of Carroll's witnesses. He also pointed to dredged-up text messages and e-mails in which Carroll's friends seemed to express concerns and frustrations with her. And he offered a number of implausible counter-theories, such as one in which Carroll and her friends had concocted a scheme to frame Trump based on the plot of a 2012 episode of \"Law & Order: SVU.\" Carroll's lawyers made much of Trump's absence. They also didn't shy away from politics. Several times during the trial, they played the contents of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape for the jury, including Trump's boasts of grabbing women \"by the pussy.\" During closing arguments, one of Carroll's lawyers suggested to the jury that they consider the \"Access Hollywood\" video a \"confession.\"\n\n\"You saw for yourself, E. Jean Carroll wasn't hiding anything,\" Roberta Kaplan, Carroll's lead lawyer, told the jury on Monday, as the trial reached its conclusion. As her lawyers readily acknowledged, Carroll could not remember exactly what night her encounter with Trump took place. She could find no witnesses who saw the two of them together. And though she told two friends about the assault soon after it occurred, she otherwise kept the story to herself for more than two decades. Trump's lawyers argued that these gaps undercut Carroll's credibility. \"What they want is for you to hate him enough that you'll ignore the facts,\" Tacopina told the jury during his own summation. Carroll, Tacopina said, was abusing the system, bringing a false claim. \"We cannot let her profit to the tune of millions of dollars.\" Those lines might have played well with Tacopina's client, but they didn't sway the jury, which unanimously found in Carroll's favor after less than three hours of deliberation. (Trump told Fox News Digital that he plans to appeal, and has \"no idea\" who Carroll is.)\n\nTrump, despite his denials, appeared to understand the seriousness of Carroll's claims, as both a legal matter and a political one. \"She's accusing me of rape, of raping her, the worst thing you can do, the worst charge,\" he said, in a deposition taken last year. Trump is once again running for President, and recent polling suggests that his opponents in the Republican primaries are wilting in the face of his popularity and the pressure he puts on others to fight on his terms. And yet every month this year has brought escalating legal peril to Trump. Seven years ago, he imagined what his supporters would do if he committed a heinous act on Fifth Avenue. Now it's no longer hypothetical. It's a matter of record. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "E. Jean Carroll's Accusation Against Donald Trump, and the Raising, and Lowering, of the Bar\n\nOne of the things I have feared most since the night of the 2016 election is the inevitable hardening of my own heart-and what such hardening might lead to, especially if it were experienced by many other people as well. Specifically, I feared that the Trump era would bring a surfeit of bad news, and that I would compartmentalize this bad news in order to remain functional, and that this attempt to remain functional would itself be so demoralizing that it would contribute to the despair and distraction that allowed all this bad news to occur.\n\nWhen I imagined specifics, back in November, 2016, I pictured something like last week-or part of it. I imagined that undocumented families would be openly and cruelly persecuted in America, and that there would be plans of mass raids and internment , and that as this was happening I would not be rioting in the street as I ought to but depressively checking things off my Google Calendar to-do list and probably writing a blog post about a meme. What I didn't imagine, though-and what actually occurred last week-is that a respected and well-known writer would accuse the President of raping her , and that I would be so sad and numb, after years of writing about Trump's many accusers , after watching Brett Kavanaugh get confirmed to the Supreme Court in the face of credible sexual-assault allegations , that I would not even have the courage to read the story for days.\n\nE. Jean Carroll, now seventy-five years old, is a longtime advice columnist for Elle . Her approach to life is distinctive: brisk, stylish, tough, compassionate. Her columns provided an early and crucial model for me-when I was little and waist-deep in the mistake of trying to understand life through women's glossies-of never giving my personal problems more weight than was absolutely necessary. The essay that she published last week, in New York , titled \" My List of Hideous Men \"-it's an excerpt from a forthcoming book-performs the tremendous and awful feat of bringing her sharp-edged breeziness to bear on a story about being raped. Carroll's \"hideosity bar is high,\" she writes. A boy who shoved a stick or rock up her genitals when she was a girl doesn't make the list. Hunter S. Thompson, slicing her pants off with a knife in a hot tub, doesn't make it either, because, she writes, \"to me there is a big difference between an 'adventure' and an 'attack.' \"\n\nCarroll goes on to detail multiple sexual assaults: by a college suitor, by a boss who chased her down a hotel hallway, by the former CBS president and C.E.O. Les Moonves . (Moonves denies the allegation.) \"By now, Silent Generation aside, the question has occurred to you: Why does this woman seem so unfazed by all this horrible crap?\" she writes. \"Well, I am shallower than most people. I do not dwell on the past. I feel greater empathy for others than for myself. I do not try to control everything.\" Plus, she adds, she's a born cheerleader: she was a cheerleader in grade school, in high school, and was even the winner of a competition called Miss Cheerleader U.S.A. For years, in her advice columns, she cheered for each correspondent to \"pick herself up and go on.\"\n\nBut there are two men, she writes, whom she wishes she'd spoken about sooner. One is a camp director who repeatedly molested her when she was twelve. The other is Donald Trump. The incident happened in the fall of 1995 or the spring of 1996, she writes. She and Trump ran into each other at Bergdorf Goodman; Trump convinced her to help him shop for a present in the lingerie department; Carroll-\"and as I write this, I am staggered by my stupidity,\" she states-went into the fitting room with him; Trump shoved her against the wall, unzipped his pants, and forced his penis inside her. Eventually, Carroll fought him off and ran away. She still carries around the shrapnel of this encounter, myriad pointed details lodged in her mind-such as the fact that, at the beginning of the struggle, she was so shocked that she was laughing. There is a limit, for everyone, to the uses of compartmentalization. Whether it's \"my age, the fact that I haven't met anyone fascinating enough over the past couple of decades to feel 'the sap rising,' as Tom Wolfe put it, or if it's the blot of the real-estate tycoon, I can't say,\" Carroll writes, closing her essay. \"But I have never had sex with anybody ever again.\"\n\nA lot of hearts seem to have hardened not just in response to Carroll's story but in the long lead-up to it. When the piece appeared online, there was an immediate unspoken sense, I thought-although it's certainly possible that I'm projecting-that it would tell us only what we already knew. Trump accused himself of sexual assault, on tape, in 2005, while filming \"Access Hollywood,\" and we found out about it just before the election, and, because any man who boasts about grabbing women by the pussy is likely to have done so and worse, repeatedly and with no compunction, it's all been extremely, deadeningly predictable from there. The White House said in a statement that Carroll's story was \"false and unrealistic\" and was \"created simply to make the President look bad.\" Trump later stated that Carroll was just trying to sell books, and claimed that he had never met her, despite New York running a photo of the two of them talking at a party. \"It is a disgrace and people should pay dearly for such false accusations,\" he said. On Monday, in an interview with The Hill, Trump, deploying a blatant grotesquerie that was surely intended to play to his base, said, \"Number one, she's not my type. Number two, it never happened.\"\n\nBut a public figure accusing the President of rape is news. Even though Carroll is at least the twenty-second woman to accuse Trump of sexual misconduct , she is only the second to accuse him of rape. (The first was Ivana Trump, who later downplayed her story.) Though Carroll received the pride of place at New York that she deserved, appearing on the cover of the magazine, her story did not make the front page of the New York Times , the Wall Street Journal , the Los Angeles Times , or the Chicago Tribune. The New York Post deleted a story about Carroll's allegations on Friday. The Times was slow to feature the story online and didn't run its piece in print until Sunday. Weekend talk shows mostly ignored the topic; on Sunday, Brian Stelter, on CNN, discussed the lack of attention the story was getting, citing the possibility-the reality-of media fatigue . There have been so many accusations against Trump that none has been able to receive the undivided attention that it ought to, Stelter suggested. And the news cycle itself is so quick-moving and chaotic that every important story, regardless of its subject, is metabolized too fast.\n\nThere are other explanations, too, though none of them are particularly satisfactory. Newspapers tend to prioritize stories that they've broken in house. There are also good journalistic reasons for seeking independent confirmation of a story before giving it prominence. But, on Monday, Dean Baquet, the executive editor of the Times , acknowledged that the paper had \"underplayed the article.\" Though Carroll's account was vetted by New York -two friends confirmed that she told them the story contemporaneously with the event-it was a first-person account rather than an investigative report. And it gets harder to tell this story over and over and over, as a lesson we learned in 2016 only becomes clearer: there are many people in this country, including, apparently, the majority of Republicans who hold national office, who don't believe that rape is that big of a deal . As we saw during the Kavanaugh hearings, a portion of those people may grow to like a man better after he is accused of sexual assault. In her essay for New York , Carroll acknowledges the risk that she might make Trump more popular by telling the story of how he raped her. In these cases, the accuser is not so much disbelieved as conscripted into a narrative of women attempting to victimize men by arousing public sympathy. The powerful solidify their power by pretending that they have been threatened and attacked. This dynamic is central to both fascism and abuse.\n\nIt has felt impossible, in the Trump era, to hope even for a second that our governing systems will operate on any standard of morality. What we have instead is a standard of consistency. If the President had ever convincingly espoused ideas of respect for people who are not like him, or of equal rights for women, it's possible that he would be held accountable for his actions. Instead, he promised mass campaigns of cruelty against undocumented immigrants, and he is delivering. He said that he grabbed women by the pussy, and many women-twenty-two, so far-explained that, yes, he did that, or something like it, to them. Carroll's essay-exceptional, devastating, decades in the making-has made me consider how hard it is to understand right away that you've been exhausted into submission, especially when submission and endurance feel inextricable. It's reminded me of how high I've let my own hideosity bar get lately, and also of the fact that no one can lower it again but me.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "There's a Lot More to E. Jean Carroll's Book than Trump\n\nI first saw E. Jean Carroll, the longtime advice columnist for Elle and author of the book \" What Do We Need Men For? A Modest Proposal ,\" onstage at Wordfest, in Calgary, this past October. She was wearing a vintage flight suit, a garment that is not only stylish but practical: rather than carry a suitcase, she had used its multiple pockets to pack for the weekend-the author as human duffelbag. The extra padding had, of course, aroused the suspicions of airport-security officials, which resulted in a vigorous pat-down. She joked that it was the closest she'd come to sex in years.\n\nWhen Carroll's book came out, last July, it got swamped in the news cycle, because an excerpt , published in New York magazine, described a scene at Bergdorf Goodman, the luxury department store on Fifth Avenue, circa 1995-96, in which a certain real-estate tycoon who lived in a nearby tower enlisted the advice columnist's help in choosing a gift for a girl, and then allegedly steered her into the lingerie-department dressing room, and forced himself on her without removing his overcoat. (Carroll admits that there is no proof-only her memory, sometimes faulty, sometimes vivid-but, as has been said before, who would make up such a thing?) The accused, now President of the United States, denied the incident, saying that he had never met the author. Then he insulted her and moved on, the news churning in his wake, as usual. The sordid incident, though it takes up only about seven of two hundred and seventy-four pages, came to define the book, and that is too bad, because there is much more to \"What Do We Need Men For?\" than a single brutish act. The book is a work of comic genius.\n\nThe \"modest proposal\" of the subtitle (after Jonathan Swift) grew out of the advice columnist's observation that most problems-at least the ones that women write to Elle about-can be traced to one source: men. Her proposal is that men be harvested for their component elements (iodine, phosphorous, carbon, hydrogen, etc.), which could be sold on the open market, where each bloke's essence would fetch about a dollar. Lest this seem harsh, our advice columnist gives men a chance to be redeemed: she goes on the road, stopping only in places named for women-Elnora, Cynthiana, Anita, Bonnie-and wherever she goes she asks the people she meets the title question: What do we need men for? \"Yard work\" is one answer.\n\nE. Jean travels with her dog, a standard poodle named Lewis Carroll, in a Prius that she calls Miss Bingley (after the mean girl in Jane Austen's \" Pride and Prejudice \"). The travelogue is enlivened by various lists, including \"The Most Hideous Men in My Life List,\" a subject that gives a girl a lot of material. The current President, whom history will remember as No. 45 and No. 3-third to be impeached-comes in at No. 20. Carroll grew up in Indiana. She must have originally been named Elizabeth Jean, because she refers to her younger self once as Betty Jean, but she was mostly called Jeanie; perhaps E. Jean is a twist on Jean E.? She was a cheerleader-in fact, she was Miss Cheerleader U.S.A. in 1964-and a sorority girl (Pi Phi). For the \"What Do We Need Men For?\" road trip, with its feminist slant, she packed clothes designed by women, including a Donna Karan kilt and a Korean driving cap, and ate food associated with women, heating up Amy's burritos in the motel microwave, snacking on Girl Scout cookies, and stopping at Dairy Queen. She addresses her audience the way she addresses regular readers of her column-\"Ladies!\"-and every chapter, every paragraph, every sentence contains some fresh, good-humored turn of phrase, such as \"Ladies, have you ever fallen for a heel?\"\n\nIn Calgary, at Wordfest, Carroll was asked to read the passage from her book documenting the alleged department-store rape, but she preferred to have her interlocutor, Rita Sirignano, read it instead. She said that she had never read the passage aloud in public and wasn't sure how it would affect her. Maybe she would cry, maybe she would be rendered speechless, or maybe she would be afflicted with helpless laughter, as sometimes happens when one is traumatized. Laughter bubbled up during the incident itself and again afterward when she told a friend, who insisted that she go to the police (\"He raped you\"): \"and this is one of the strangest facts of all-I could not stop laughing.\" The passage ends, \"I've never had sex with anybody ever again.\"\n\n\"Do not be alarmed, Ladies,\" Carroll writes, early in the book. \"I have been attacked by far, far better men than the president.\" She was in her early fifties that long-ago day in Bergdorf's-she is now seventy-six-and the statute of limitations on charges of sexual abuse has passed. But the President, in denying that he ever met her, gave her cause to sue for defamation of character. He then attempted to have that suit dismissed, on the ground that when he made his comments he was not physically present in New York. (Carroll on Twitter: \"When you've sexually assaulted a woman, argue you can't be sued in New York!\") This legal strategy was rejected by Justice Doris Ling-Cohan, of the State Supreme Court, a victory for Carroll and her lawyer, Roberta Kaplan. Meanwhile, the President's impeachment trial is unfolding in Washington, and the trial of Harvey Weinstein (\"who looks like he's been stuffed by an inebriated taxidermist,\" Carroll writes in her book) is starting up in New York, major legal proceedings in which our advice columnist takes a deep personal interest. \"I wish there had been a third Article of Impeachment,\" she wrote on Twitter: \"The Abuse Of Women.\"\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "The Donald Trump Doom Loop\n\nAt Donald Trump 's first criminal arraignment , in April, the security measures were out of a Hollywood action movie. Several blocks surrounding the Manhattan Criminal Courthouse were closed off, as were entire floors of the building itself. Lower Manhattan was flooded with police. A few days before the hearing, Trump had warned of \"potential death and destruction\" if he was charged-in this case, for paying hush money to a porn star before the 2016 election. Inside the courtroom, the atmosphere was so tense that I half expected the defendant to be wheeled into the courtroom on a dolly while wearing a straitjacket, Hannibal Lecter-style. Armed law-enforcement agents were stationed at the end of each row, keeping watch over the few reporters allowed in the room, many of whom had begun waiting in a line outside the courthouse some twenty-four hours before. Politico : \"It's uncharted territory for the legal system, the government and the country.\" The Associated Press : \"The historic indictment of former President Donald Trump thrust the 2024 presidential election into uncharted territory.\" CNN : \"The decision is sure to send shockwaves across the country, pushing the American political system . . . into uncharted waters.\" When Trump finally appeared in the courtroom, even he seemed unsure of himself: he walked slowly to the defense table, his big red tie swinging, and he answered the judge's questions in subdued monosyllables.\n\nThis past Tuesday, Trump appeared yet again in a Manhattan courtroom, for the first day of a lawsuit brought against him by the writer E. Jean Carroll . The atmosphere outside the Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse, on Pearl Street, was positively permissive by the standards of post-9/11 New York City; a few extra cops and some metal barriers were all that had been deemed necessary. I strolled in about an hour before Trump's appearance, and joined a line mostly comprising members of the public reporting for jury duty . Save for a second metal detector set up outside Judge Lewis Kaplan's courtroom, it was business as usual in the courthouse. Thoroughly charted territory, and waters. Trump has had that effect, over and over again, turning the unthinkable into the ordinary.\n\nIn the Carroll case, it was literally déjà vu. Last spring, Kaplan presided over an earlier Carroll lawsuit against Trump. A nine-person jury unanimously found that Trump had sexually assaulted Carroll in a dressing room of a midtown Manhattan department store, in 1996, and that he had defamed her after she published an account of the assault in New York magazine, in 2019. \"Con job,\" he's called her. \"Whack job.\" Several times, he suggested that she was too ugly for him to assault, and that he'd never met her, even though Carroll's lawyers found a black-and-white photograph of Trump and Carroll making animated small talk at a black-tie event around 1987. The jury ultimately awarded Carroll five million dollars in damages.\n\nFor complicated legal reasons, Carroll's second case against Trump, which had been filed earlier than the sexual-assault case, took several years longer to reach the trial phase. In a pretrial order, Kaplan indicated that this case would not be a \"do-over\" of the earlier case-that Trump assaulted and defamed Carroll were established facts, not up for dispute again. When several dozen prospective jurors were brought into his courtroom on Tuesday morning, Kaplan told them that all they would be asked to do on a jury was consider what amount of damages to award Carroll for statements that Trump made about her after her account of the assault ran in New York . \"Having heard what you have heard about this case so far, would you be unable to give both sides a fair trial?\" Kaplan asked. Only three jurors put up their hands, to indicate that they'd have trouble being impartial.\n\nOne difference between the first Carroll case and the second one is that Trump showed up for the second one, at least for a few hours on Tuesday. He sat impassively beside his lawyers as one, Alina Habba, argued with Kaplan about whether the case would be adjourned so that Trump could be at his mother-in-law's funeral on Thursday, in Florida. And he seemed to take an interest in jury selection. When Kaplan asked the prospective jurors if they believed the 2020 election was stolen, three raised their hands-and so did Trump. While he sat in the courtroom, his account on his proprietary social-media site, Truth Social, was unleashing a series of posts denouncing Carroll and Kaplan. \"The only right, honest, and lawful thing that Clinton-appointed Judge Lewis Kaplan, who has so far been unable to see clearly because of his absolute hatred of Donald J. Trump (ME!), can do is to end this unAmerican injustice being done to a President of the United States, who was wrongfully accused by a woman he never met, saw, or touched,\" his account said. Who was speaking here? Was it the man in the courtroom, or somebody else? Just when you think you've been dulled to Trump's outrages, his particular blend of incoherence, rage, and omnipresence surprises you again.\n\nAfter a lunch break, Trump did not return to Kaplan's courtroom. The case proceeded without him, with both sides presenting their opening arguments. Shawn Crowley, one of Carroll's lawyers, made note of Trump's posts just minutes before. She told the nine New Yorkers picked to sit in the jury box that the case was about \"damages,\" about the criminal-justice system finding a material way to address the harms Trump has caused her client. \"For more than four years, he has not stopped,\" Crowley said. \"How much money will it take to make him stop?\" In this case, Carroll is seeking at least ten million dollars.\n\nIn a just and sane world, it would take only one jury finding a former President guilty of sexual assault to sideline that former President politically forever. Carroll was also in the courtroom on Tuesday. She is eighty years old. She made her name as a sassy, knowing, charming advice columnist for Elle in the heyday of women's magazines. All Tuesday morning, she calmly sat a few feet from the man who'd attacked her, who has promised to take revenge on his enemies if he is reëlected President this November. Crowley said that Carroll now sleeps with a loaded gun next to her bed.\n\nTrump-who is facing an additional civil case, a fraud case , related to his private business dealings brought by the New York State attorney general's office, and criminal cases in Georgia , Florida, and Washington, D.C., related to his conduct around the 2020 election-seems to have grown comfortable with his extreme legal peril. \"It's a terrible thing you've done!\" Trump barked at the judge in his fraud case, at a hearing in November. (\"I beseech you to control him, if you can,\" the judge told Trump's lawyers.) On Monday, Trump easily won the Iowa Republican Party caucuses . On Tuesday night, he held a campaign rally in New Hampshire. The cases against him have been neatly incorporated into his campaign themes of grievance and vengeance. In fact, he argued that the cases had helped his showing in Iowa. \"If I didn't get indicted all these times, and if they didn't unfairly go after me, I would have won, but it would have been much closer,\" he said, on Tuesday night. \"I go to a lot of courthouses because of Biden, because they're using that for election interference.\" Trump is expected to be back in Kaplan's courtroom this week or next, to testify in his own defense, to keep up his only purpose in life now, the reason the whole country is stuck in this political doom loop, subjected to a repeat of the 2020 election and to the daily rantings of a bitter, hateful old man. Trump is trying to outrun his own consequences. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Will Trump's Crimes Matter on the Campaign Trail?\n\nFor the past two weeks, in a courtroom in lower Manhattan, the journalist E. Jean Carroll has made a straightforward case: a quarter century ago, she says, Donald Trump raped her. The account she gave in the courtroom was the same as it has been since she first revealed this story, in an excerpt of her memoir which was published in New York magazine , in 2019. Carroll had a chance encounter with Trump in Bergdorf Goodman, she has said, and, flirting, she and Trump moved through the store, picking up a lacy bodysuit and going together into an unlocked dressing room. Maybe she should try the bodysuit on, he suggested. Maybe he should try it on, she suggested. Then, according to Carroll, Trump pulled down her tights, pushed her against the wall, and raped her. Within a few days, Carroll told two friends of the attack: the writer Lisa Birnbach, and the television anchor Carol Martin. Both of them testified this week, and Martin acknowledged that she had initially advised Carroll not to go public, saying, \"I just volunteered that she shouldn't do anything because it was Donald Trump and he had a lot of attorneys and he would just bury her.\"\n\nNow Carroll has a prominent attorney, too: Roberta Kaplan, who famously represented Edie Windsor in the Supreme Court case that struck down the Defense of Marriage Act. In order to establish a pattern of behavior, Kaplan this week called two other witnesses who said that they had been sexually assaulted by the former President. A stockbroker named Jessica Leeds said that Trump groped her on a flight in the late nineteen-seventies-when he was not yet famous-sending her fleeing from first class to coach. Natasha Stoynoff, a People magazine writer, alleged that, while she was on assignment to interview Donald and Melania Trump at Mar-a-Lago, in 2005, Donald Trump had shut a door, trapping her in a room with him, and forcibly kissed her before being interrupted by a butler. Carroll's story has, from the start, been missing a few details that Kaplan would like to have: there is no physical evidence (no sales receipt, no security-camera footage) to confirm that she and Trump were ever in Bergdorf together, or even that she had been there at all. And Carroll could only place the timing of the alleged assault in late 1995 or early 1996. Trump has denied all of this. But the presence of Leeds and Stoynoff on the witness stand was a reminder of how often Trump has been accused of sexual assault and misconduct (by more than two dozen women, in a period of several decades) and what an enormous conspiracy, or coincidence, it would be if they were all making it up.\n\nA basic uncertainty has shadowed the court proceedings this week. Does this story amount to a political cataclysm or nothing at all? If you just describe the situation neutrally, like a news anchor might-a civil suit in which a magazine writer has accused the former President of the United States of rape will go to a jury trial next week-then it certainly sounds like front-page material. And yet it simply hasn't been. The trial didn't crack the front page of the Times last week, losing out to the latest economic news, the war in Sudan , warnings about artificial intelligence , the ongoing effort to bin New York's trash, and the tsunami of press surrounding the killing of an unhoused person on the subway. Even the courtroom itself, by week's end, was just about half full. Had you been in lower Manhattan, and interested, you could have just wandered in.\n\nI suspect there are two reasons that the trial hasn't been bigger news. First, its details aren't really news at all. As with many of the other investigations of the former President (in New York, for allegedly falsifying business records related to the hush money paid to Stormy Daniels ; in Georgia, for allegedly seeking to persuade election officials to overturn the results of the 2020 Presidential election; in Washington, D.C., for allegedly refusing to return classified documents and for his actions surrounding the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot), the basic story has mostly been told in the press, even if it has never before been presented in a court. Perhaps more significantly, Trump has faced two impeachments, and countless accusations of wrongdoing. He fomented an insurrection. And yet his approval rating and political position are, on the whole, pretty much unchanged. (According to FiveThirtyEight's rolling averages , about forty-five per cent of Americans view him favorably, and fifty-one per cent unfavorably.) It sometimes seems that Trump's superpower is to have been accused of so many transgressions that no single one can change the public's perception of him.\n\nBut that might underestimate how much even a small amount of tractability could matter. The margins in American politics are tiny right now. Trump first won the Presidency, and then lost it, because of shifts of tens of thousands of voters in a few critical states. Earlier this year, Ron DeSantis briefly threatened Trump's position as Republican standard-bearer because of Trump's insistence on relitigating the 2020 election and his promotion of subpar Republican candidates willing to do the same. Then DeSantis took some extreme social-conservative stances, and Trump effectively mocked him. In each case, events happened, minds changed. The story of Trump's ascendence has never been only about the diehards who back him no matter what. His final coalitions have always depended on those who are willing to make excuses for him-Republican politicians and operatives, and swing voters-and his elections have swung on what they will and will not abide.\n\nJury trials are unpleasant affairs for most politicians-in Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu is presently assenting to a far-right takeover of his country's government in order to overhaul the country's judicial system amid his own corruption trial-and Trump himself seems to be taking his legal troubles seriously. As his indictment in the Stormy Daniels case approached, the former President reportedly fixated on stage management. (Would there be a perp walk? A mug shot?) Though his media profile is still vast, he does not currently have the same ability he had, in 2016 and during his Presidency, to displace a story he did not like by doing or saying something wild. Trump has been saying plenty of bizarre things lately, among them that, if reëlected, he plans to make homelessness illegal, and to forcibly remove homeless people from city centers to camps of \"high-quality tents\" in the suburbs. But the media has largely ignored them. In a video deposition that played at the trial this week, Trump said, \"She's accusing me of rape-of raping her, the worst thing you can do, the worst charge.\"\n\nIf the Carroll case is a first glimpse at how Trump plans to fight any upcoming trials, then his team has got off to a rocky start. Trump wavered on basic strategy; he told Sky News that he would likely fly to New York to testify, but on the same day his courtroom lawyer, Joe Tacopina, said that he would not mount a defense, essentially counting on the jury to find that Carroll had not met her burden of proof. (The judge in the case, perhaps hinting that might not be so wise, told Tacopina he would consider any change in plan as late as Sunday.)\n\nBut what the Carroll case has begun to suggest is that the gravity of these charges may be difficult to stage-manage away, or to strategize against: rape, election fraud, sedition. When accusations of this magnitude move from the realm of political ads to detailed accounts on the witness stand, they may become harder to ignore. One way to read the politics around Trump right now is that, with partisan allegiances so entrenched, nothing matters. But another interpretation is more compelling: with margins so tight, everything does. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "How to Choose a Jury of Trump's Peers\n\nOn Tuesday morning, forty-eight unsuspecting New Yorkers were ushered into a courtroom in lower Manhattan and told that the federal judiciary needed their help determining whether former President Donald Trump had once raped the writer E. Jean Carroll . Together, the potential jurors made a decent cross-section of New York: people of different ages, races, genders, and social classes. They'd come to court wearing jeans, sweatshirts, windbreakers, blazers, and at least one Kangol cap. If any of them felt any emotion upon hearing Judge Lewis Kaplan describe the basics of the case-Carroll claims that Trump assaulted her in a department-store dressing room, in the nineteen-nineties, and then defamed her when she went public with her story, in 2019-it didn't register on their faces. (Trump has denied Carroll's accusations.)\n\nOut of the forty-eight people summoned, nine would be selected as jurors, to hear evidence and testimony in the civil trial, which is expected to last through next week. Carroll, who is seventy-nine, and for many years wrote a popular advice column for Elle magazine, was in the courtroom when the prospective jurors were marched in. Recognizing a friend in the section of the courtroom reserved for spectators, she pressed a hand to her heart and smiled. Trump's lawyers, led by a burly litigator named Joseph Tacopina, appeared on his behalf. (In the days leading up to the trial, Tacopina said that Trump wanted to be there but was concerned about the \"logistical and financial burdens\" that his attendance would place on the court.)\n\nKaplan, a jowly senior judge with silver hair, told the prospective jurors that their identities would remain secret, even to him. Their names were being kept \"in a vault.\" In the courtroom, they would be referred to only by assigned numbers, and they would be chauffeured to and from the courthouse by U.S. Marshals. \"This is all for your protection,\" Kaplan said. Trump is facing legal proceedings in numerous jurisdictions, and the spectre of violence, intimidation, and special security procedures hangs over all of the cases-a situation that he has done nothing to dispel. (In March, in a post on his proprietary social-media platform, Truth Social, he warned that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's intention to bring criminal charges against him would bring \"death & destruction\" to the entire country.) Kaplan suggested that the jurors in the Carroll lawsuit even avoid using their real names with one another. \"If you're normally Bill, you can be John for a couple of days,\" he said.\n\nFor the next hour, Kaplan read from a list of questions that he'd prepared in consultation with the lawyers from both sides of the lawsuit. He asked the jurors to indicate their answers by either raising their hands or standing. Question: Was there anything about the nature of the case or the parties that would make it difficult for them to be impartial and fair to both sides? Anything at all? The reporters in the gallery shook their heads. Who could be impartial here? But only nine of the forty-eight indicated that they'd have a problem. Those nine were immediately excused from the courtroom.\n\nDid any of them know Carroll personally? No one did. Did any of them know Trump personally? No one did. Had any of them personally had any \"dealings\" with Trump or his company? No one did. Did any of them know anyone else who'd had any \"dealings\" with Trump or his company? A voice spoke up. \"Your honor-possibly,\" a man near the back of the courtroom said. It was Juror No. 23. \"A client of mine is an attorney for the defendant in some other cases,\" he said. Kaplan asked Juror No. 23 for his occupation. \"I'm a literary agent,\" he said.\n\nKaplan kept asking questions. Had any of the jurors \"read, seen, or heard\" anything about the case prior to that morning? Eight people indicated that they had, including Juror No. 23. Follow-up question: Would their prior knowledge of the case \"interfere\" with their ability to render a fair verdict? Juror No. 11 indicated that it would. Juror No. 11 was excused.\n\n\"Raise your hand if you're registered to vote,\" Kaplan said. All the jurors seated in the jury box did so. \"Everybody?\" Kaplan said, surprised. \"Something to be said for our democracy.\" Kaplan asked if they were registered with a particular party, without asking them to specify which. Most of the jurors indicated that they were. Would party loyalty-\"if you have any\"-make it hard to decide the case impartially? Silence. \"No affirmative response,\" Kaplan said, for the benefit of the court stenographer.\n\nHad anyone in the jury pool ever donated money to former President Trump or to any organization affiliated with him? \"I'm a maybe,\" Juror No. 96, a blond, middle-aged man, said. \"I'm a tax principal at Deloitte, the accounting firm, and they had a PAC , who contributed to everybody, I think.\" Had anyone in the jury pool ever donated money to Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, or Joe Biden? Juror No. 96 and Juror No. 23, the literary agent, said yes. So did Juror No. 42. Would these donations \"impact\" their ability to render fair judgment? Jurors No. 96 and 23 said that they would not. Juror No. 42 said that they would. She was excused.\n\nKaplan asked if any prospective jurors had ever belonged to, or supported, QAnon , Antifa , the Proud Boys , the Oath Keepers , the Boogaloo Bois, the Ku Klux Klan , the Communist Party U.S.A., or several other fringe groups. Kaplan announced to the stenographer, \"No affirmative response.\" Did anyone believe that the 2020 election was stolen? \"No affirmative response.\" Did anyone hold any opinions of the #MeToo movement that would make it difficult for them to serve as a juror? Juror No. 25, a young woman wearing a blue blouse and a face mask, stood up and said yes. She was excused without further questioning. Was anyone a user of Truth Social? \"No affirmative response.\" Had anyone ever previously heard about allegations of sexual misconduct levelled against Trump? More than a dozen of the remaining prospective jurors indicated that they had. Would this make it difficult for them to decide the case fairly? None said that it would.\n\nKaplan said that he had just two questions left. \"Raise your hand or stand if you haven't been vaccinated against COVID -19,\" he said. Juror No. 8 raised her hand. \"Anyone uncomfortable serving on a jury with an unvaccinated person?\" Kaplan asked. Silence. \"No affirmative response.\" Juror No. 8 was excused anyway.\n\nAt this point, Kaplan said that the hard part was over. Now he wanted the remaining prospective jurors to give a little more personal information about themselves. Nothing that would reveal their identities-just their age; where they lived; their level of education; what they did for a living; their marital status; the occupation of their spouse, if any; their kids' ages and occupations, if any; and where they typically got their news. Juror No. 48 was a married physical therapist from the Bronx who will turn sixty-five in June. \"CNN,\" he said, when asked about his news-consumption habits. Juror No. 71 was a thirty-one-year-old security guard. \"News I tend to avoid,\" he said, although \"every now and then I'll listen to a podcast.\" Juror No. 31 was a twenty-five-year-old Bronx man who worked at Yankee Stadium. \"I don't barely watch the news-I just watch YouTube,\" he said. Juror No. 89 was a voice teacher in Manhattan with two kids who reads the Times and listens to NPR. Juror No. 68 was a forty-five-year-old data analyst with an M.B.A. and a toddler. \"News is a little tough; the two-year-old is a bit much,\" he said. Juror No. 18 was a retired dentist from Rockland County with two kids and three grandchildren. \"I generally listen to AM 880,\" he said. Juror No. 84 works in retail in Westchester County. \"I don't have a television,\" she said. \"But when I can, I try to sample all of it.\"\n\nKaplan announced a ten-minute recess. Both Carroll's lawyers and Trump's lawyers would be able to confer, and then submit three juror numbers to disqualify from the pool. As the room waited for them to return, I thought about the contrast between all the prognosticators and experts weighing in publicly on the merits and prospects of Trump's various legal entanglements. Ultimately, much of the power in these cases would rest in the hands of people like those sitting quietly in the courtroom around me-people cut free from the discourse, not loyal to one faction or party. This wasn't a blue-state mob out to get Trump. These were people who'd answered a jury summons. The lawyers returned, and submitted their numbers to Kaplan. \"We have selected the jury,\" he announced. The matter of E. Jean Carroll v. Donald J. Trump will be decided by Jurors No. 10, 48, 44, 39, 77, 81, 37, 58, and 80-a group that includes the CNN-watching physical therapist, a college dropout who said he got his news from social media, and a middle-aged woman who works in collections for a health-care facility and who, at one point, when providing information to the judge about her family, said that her eighteen-year-old son's tuition costs \"will probably kill me.\" And with that Kaplan announced a break for lunch, and told those who hadn't been selected that they were free to go.\n\nOn the sidewalk outside the courthouse, several people who'd just missed the cut looked dazed. I found Juror No. 23, the literary agent. His name was Jason Yarn. He represents both fiction and nonfiction writers. I asked him when he'd realized what case he'd been called in on. He said that it was before the prospective jurors had been brought into the courtroom, when a court clerk told them they'd be an anonymous jury. \"I said to somebody downstairs, 'I don't want to be on that case,' \" he said. But he'd been surprised at how sanguine his fellow potential jurors had been, and how confident everyone was that they'd be able to be fair and impartial. \"I'm terminally online,\" he said. \"I know that I'm in my own bubble. Not a right or a left bubble, but just a bubble of absorbing so many takes and so much news. Whereas some people are just, like, 'Eh, I don't care, I don't pay attention.' Those people always surprise me.\" He declined to tell me the name of his client, the lawyer who he believed has had \"dealings\" with Trump. \"He's an attorney who wrote a nonfiction book, not about Trump but about politics,\" he said. \"He's helping on the January 6th cases.\" The book is forthcoming. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "The Genius of E. Jean Carroll's Strategy\n\nLast Friday, after deliberating for only a few hours, a Manhattan jury awarded journalist E. Jean Carroll $83 million in damages for defamation in a lawsuit she filed against Donald J. Trump. The former president, who devoted most of his in-person energy at trial to insulting the judge, bullying the plaintiff, and pitching tiny tantrums, has not only conceded that he was out-lawyered, but has also, perhaps in a historic first, avoided defaming Carroll on social media or in the press in the intervening days, seemingly in actual recognition of this verdict. There seems to be, at least for the moment, a template for stopping a serial harasser, misogynist, and adjudicated sexual abuser from persisting in that behavior.\n\nPerhaps all of our anguish about how the existing legal guardrails are inadequate to hold Trump to account are wrong. Maybe we already know exactly what needs to be done to win against him, in a court of law at least-it demands only rock-ribbed judges, seasoned lawyers, and a jury that can still detect a bully when they smell one .\n\nCarroll's legal team handled the litigation as it handled the prior defamation trial, with competence and focus. Roberta Kaplan, whose law firm represents Carroll, has not only prevailed over Trump in both civil defamation lawsuits, she also beat the Nazis and Klansmen who marched in Charlottesville in 2017, and successfully represented Edie Windsor in a challenge to the Defense of Marriage Act at the Supreme Court, opening the door to marriage equality.\n\nKaplan, who became a chapter in my book, Lady Justice , about women lawyers who fought back against Trump during his presidency, is again receiving plaudits this week for her legal acumen and strategic skills in court (disclosure, Kaplan is a friend). But there's one other quality Kaplan brings to counsel table that perhaps hasn't received sufficient attention. I point it out because it in fact seems critical to her larger successful strategy. I can't take credit for it either-it came to me at a dinner last year when her wife, Rachel, said something that has stuck with me since: Kaplan agreed to represent both E. Jean Carroll and Edie Windsor when almost no one else would because she sees older women as people in full. In a culture that prizes youth and beauty and celebrity, and in a culture where such bias counts double for women, Kaplan prizes lived experience, especially in those dismissed as invisible to reality-TV litigation. And maybe using real women to beat reality-TV lawsuits (and reality-TV lawyers) is ultimately just really smart lawyering.\n\nI'd been thinking about all this because I have been pondering (dreading, really) what another Trump run for president would mean for women in America-beyond just national abortion bans and criminalization of miscarriage. I've been wondering how it will feel to once again see the brazen misogyny of Trump rewarded and celebrated, as directed at Nikki Haley and Taylor Swift and Robbie Kaplan and E. Jean Carroll. This week on Amicus, I spoke with Molly Jong-Fast, who is another friend of Kaplan's and Carroll's as well as a special correspondent for Vanity Fair. One of the things Molly impressed upon me in that conversation was that while Trump has been accused of sexual harassment, abuse, and assault by over two dozen women, it ultimately took an 80-year-old plaintiff to hold him accountable in court.\n\nPart of our conversation, which ranged from contemplation of Carroll's immense courage to dread of what the months ahead will bring for American women, is below, lightly edited for clarity.\n\nMolly Jong-Fast: There are two parts to Trumpism. One is threats and intimidation. I mean, they must have anonymous juries, and that's the kind of thing they do when the jury is looking at an organized crime case.\n\nSo, think about E. Jean. She's 80 years old, and she's going against Trump. She's going against Trump because no one else has been able to successfully go against Trump. He has all of these allegations of sexual assault. So many-so many that I knew that my best friend from high school's mother was one of them. This is how many there are. And, she came out to People magazine . It didn't matter. I mean, she suffered and decided she was going to come out and say he touched her boob. She decided to come out because she couldn't live with herself. And it didn't matter; it didn't move the needle at all. So, I think E. Jean is thinking this is one of these situations where if it's not her, it will not be anyone.\n\nDahlia Lithwick : What you're saying is really something I wanted listeners to think about. He spent last week and this week glowering and glaring at her, glaring at her attorney, making faces at jurors, muttering so much that when the judge threatened eventually to toss him, Trump was like, \" Oh, please throw me out, that's what I want .\" And I think that one of the things that's so strange is that this is a split-screen for Trumpism. For him this is just comedy gold. It's performance gold for each scene he's in.\n\nMolly: She's 80.\n\nDahlia: And she's sitting there in the scariest situation. And here's Alina Habba reading threatening tweets at her .\n\nMolly: E. Jean is a microcosm for Trump's misogyny. And I'm not even just talking about Trump's misogyny. I'm sure you saw this article about the estimation that about 60,000 women in all of these states have been victims of rape and gotten pregnant and had to have their rapist's babies in the states with abortion bans. The point is that it's tens of thousands of women being forced to have their rapist's babies, right?\n\nSo this, in Trumpism, is funny. He says things like, \"I wouldn't rape her. She's not even my type.\" And it's so misogynistic that it strikes me to the core. This misogyny, you pull back and it has real-world consequences. Yes, this is terrible for E. Jean, but E. Jean is definitely going to get at least $5 million and probably more. She has Robbie [Kaplan], she has security, she has people around her. Whereas the woman in Texas who just got raped, who doesn't have the money or the time to take three days off from work, is going to have her rapist's baby. That's the thing with Trumpism, it reverberates, right? Misogyny reverberates. It has real-world consequences for people. And the idea that we're on the precipice of another Trump presidency is very scary.\n\nI think E. Jean didn't feel she had a choice. I think she did what she felt she had to do. And we all owe her a huge debt of gratitude, in my mind, because how long do any of us live; to 90, 100? If it were the last or second-to-last decade of my life, would I want to spend it sitting in court again? Getting death threats from MAGA? I'm not sure anything is worth that. It's one thing to say she has security, which she does, but we only have so much time on this planet. And that, for me, would be a very tough sell. So, I do owe her. I feel as women, we owe her a huge debt of gratitude.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "A Main Problem With the E. Jean Carroll Trial Could Have Been Solved With an Instagram Post\n\nE. Jean Carroll has said that she's certain that former President Donald Trump sexually assaulted her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room. But the 79-year-old advice columnist does not know the year. It may have been 1995. Or it could have been later. Her friend, the writer Lisa Birnbach, whom she called after the attack, testified that it occurred in the spring of 1996.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the jury arrived at a verdict : The jurors rejected Carroll's claim that she was raped, but decided there was a \"preponderance of evidence\" that Trump had committed battery by sexually and physically abusing her and that he had defamed her. Carroll was awarded $5 million.\n\nTrump and his lawyers had made the question of why Carroll didn't recall the date of the alleged assault a main part of their strategy, arguing that it proved that she's lying. (\"She has no idea what day, what week, what month, what year, what decade this so-called 'event' supposedly took place,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social last October.) Without a concrete date, there was no reason to call Trump or any other witness to the stand, Joe Tacopina, Trump's attorney, said in his closing arguments on Monday . \"What could I have asked Donald Trump? 'Where were you on some unknown date, 27 or 28 years ago?' \" Conservative commentators embraced this logic.\n\nThis set up the jury's decision to become not just a referendum on the 2024 presidential contender but also a sort of referendum on dateless crimes. As it turns out, being unable to recall when a traumatic-or even neutral-event occurred is common, several lawyers and forensic investigators told me. But in recent years, technology has largely phased out that litigation obstacle by supplementing victims' memories with digital clues. It's much easier to remember a date if you posted a photo of yourself arriving at the scene of the crime that morning or Googled something relevant on your phone right after. Nonetheless, we're in a tricky moment for courtroom recollections; post-#Metoo, post-Cosby shifts to statutes of limitations have encouraged people like Carroll to demand justice for crimes from the landline era. But now we're all so spoiled by the troves of digital data filling gaps in our timeline-challenged brains that many of us have forgotten that the act of remembering used to be different.\n\nOne of the basic notions Adam Scott Wandt , an attorney and professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, learned over the years is that personal testimony makes for the most inaccurate type of evidence. \"People live through experiences and they get it wrong when they repeat it,\" he said in a recent interview. \"They don't do it on purpose, it's just that people's recollections tend to be pretty poor.\"\n\nWandt believes that litigation changed around the time the first iPhone was released in 2007. That's when Apple and non-Apple users began leaving a larger digital trail. Until then, court cases were heavily reliant on rather unreliable eyewitness testimony. But from 2007 on out, the opportunity to verify dates and facts just kept expanding. Now text messages, emails, digital calendars, social media posts, Ring camera footage, and even pacemaker data can all be used as memory aids. Expecting the average person to produce dates from long ago without supplementation is unrealistic, Wandt believes. (Carroll has said she kept a journal but generally noted only positive developments.)\n\nThis is particularly true when it comes to sexual assault, said Wendy Patrick, a career trial attorney who is a member of the organization End Violence Against Women International . People tend to clearly remember being sexually assaulted decades later. But because it's so traumatizing, they often do not remember the events surrounding the incident. \"It's not usual for people to be unclear when it happened,\" she said.\n\nThe muddiness of temporal memory is a complicating layer to the various efforts to shift statutes of limitations, she said. Last November, New York removed the state's statute of limitations for civil sexual assault claims so long as they are filed by Nov. 24, 2023. (Previously it was seven to 20 years, depending on the claim.) Two months earlier, President Biden signed a bill eliminating the federal statute of limitations for those who were sexually abused as minors, an approach mirrored by numerous states , including Kansas, earlier this year. These shifts follow an earlier expansion of statutes of limitations. In 2015 Oregon increased the state's statute of limitations from six to 12 years for rape victims . The following year, prompted by the Cosby case, California eliminated its 10-year limit for rape and sex crimes .\n\nThese endeavors are helpful because, particularly if a victim knew their perpetrator before the attack, it's not unusual to take a long time to come forward, said Patrick. But the more time that has passed, the less digital backup they'll have. And not being able to remember a date creates complications beyond a veneer of unreliability: For one thing, it's difficult to find witnesses or other corroborating evidence.\n\nFor another,  whether in civil court or criminal court, filing a lawsuit or charging someone typically requires an identifiable date range, partly to allow the accused to prepare a defense. This last item is something that Trump and his lawyers have milked during the recent trial, suggesting that it was part of a scheme to inhibit Trump from providing an alibi.\n\nWandt , the attorney from John Jay College, told me that he believes that the Black Mirror moment when we can verify anything with digital data is ahead of us. Matt Edmondson, who used to conduct digital forensics for the Department of Homeland Security and now teaches open-source intelligence classes, said he thinks the optimal verification moment is already in the past. That's because if he's trying to investigate something from 10 years ago, he has the investigator's dream scenario of being able to draw on lots of digital data without much concern about security or privacy. But if the incident occurred within the past two years, \"we're screwed,\" he said. Lately, Edmondson is typically investigating companies on behalf of a client. But regardless of whom he's working for, he has also found that without digital supplementation, most memories are flawed.\n\nOf course, establishing a clear date is far from the only obstacle that an old rape case faces. Less than 1 percent of sexual assault complaints are resolved through a jury trial, even in the digital era, according to one study. Often, criminal cases are derailed by other limitations that are true, even with a date. Lacking a witness, for example, prosecutors are often reluctant to move forward with a \"he said, she said\" situation. Still, a clear-cut timeline discourages comments like this one: On Monday, Michael Goodwin, a New York Post columnist, told longtime friend of Trump and radio host Mark Simone that he couldn't believe Carroll. Why? Because if you got raped, \"of course you'd remember the date,\" he said. Though the jurors did not find the events Carroll described to be rape, they signaled that they did not require a date to believe that abuse occurred.\n\nAnd that could prove pivotal for other victims. As Patrick, the trial attorney, told me shortly after the verdict was announced: \"Vindication may encourage other victims to come forward even if they cannot remember the exact date with specificity.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Why Donald Trump Took the Stand Against E. Jean Carroll\n\nFormer President and confirmed sexual abuser Donald Trump took the stand Thursday afternoon for a few short moments in the second defamation trial brought by E. Jean Carroll, the former journalist who claimed that Trump raped her in a department store changing room in the mid-'90s (these claims were established in her first trial against him). Because Trump's response to her initial report of the sexual assault came in the form of defamation, and because Carroll lost her job and became the victim of virtually bottomless threats and abuse from Trump and his sex-pest enthusiasts, the question that will go to the jurors in a federal court in this round of litigation is a simple one: How much will Trump's defamation cost him? In a prior trial, in addition to confirming that the assault indeed happened, a jury found unanimously that the former president needed to pay Carroll $5 million for the defamation in the time span it reviewed. Judge Lewis Kaplan has cautioned Trump and his lawyer Alina Habba that this court is not the place to relitigate that question; it is just about how much more money he owes for the rest of the defamation.\n\nBut Trump, in the manner of a small child or a geriatric narcissist, maintains that because he didn't attend that first trial, it must not have actually occurred. So he spent a good deal of his time on Thursday pitching tantrums about issues that were not open to debate. \"I never met the woman,\" Trump hissed at Habba as both sides were discussing the potential scope of his testimony before the jurors entered the room. Funnily enough, saying precisely that thing is one of the acts for which Trump is currently in court.\n\nOnce he got on the stand, one of the very few questions Habba asked was whether he denied the allegation. \"Yes. She said something I considered a false accusation-\" Trump replied. Everything after \"Yes\" was stricken by Kaplan. Perhaps the only question that Trump answered in a way that suggested he even understood what this second trial was about was whether he had ever \"instructed anyone to hurt Ms. Carroll.\" \"No,\" Trump answered. \"I just wanted to defend myself and my family and, frankly, the presidency.\" Everything after \"No\" was erased. So these longer responses happen to be immaterial in this defamation claim, although it squarely locates Trump's defense somewhere between \"crime boss\" and \"stochastic terrorist\" as the presumptive theory of his innocence.\n\nGiven that Trump's testimony was entirely pointless, brutish, and short-he was essentially kicked off the stand after a mere three minutes-the question one must ask is: Why did he bother to testify at all? Certainly he got everything off his chest Wednesday night in his unrebutted Truth Social rage-fest directed at the judge, the plaintiff, George Conway, and every perceived enemy past and future? What possible benefit did he see in taking the stand to say things that don't help him at all in this trial?\n\nI tend to agree with what Amanda Marcotte wrote earlier this week : That for Trump the Bully, the trial became a delicious showcase for how to be a bully. He was quite literally using the courtroom to reenact the behavior for which he is on the hook, threatening and abusing the plaintiff. By the same token, Trump has thus far spent every day of the hearings defaming Carroll in real time, often from inside the courtroom. The ability to replicate the very conduct you are denying having done is a magnificent way to show that you own the law. And Trump is nothing if not the snake swallowing its own tail of performative criminality.\n\nBut Trump, who has abandoned any pretense of abiding by the rule of law, just as he has abandoned any pretense of abiding by a vote count, is doing one more thing, and it's worth clocking it. When a judge tells Trump what he may not do in a courtroom, or on social media, or on the witness stand-as Judges Tanya Chutkan and Arthur Engoron and Kaplan have repeatedly done throughout each of his trials-and Trump does it anyway, as Trump has repeatedly done throughout each of his trials, it's Trump's way of signaling to everyone in the room that he is special; he is above the law. Oh, and remember that the room is actually all of America, because his conduct is immediately broadcast worldwide.\n\nTrump needs to perform that a judge can't constrain him any more than the law can't constrain him, as a means of showing himself to be the center of the moral and legal universe. The act of testifying to things that are going to be stricken from the record is the legal equivalent of a tree falling in a forest when the jury is certainly not allowed to consider it. But for Donald Trump, who separates jurors into friends and foes in the same way Alina Habba asks witnesses whether they voted for Trump, the jury is always rigged in much the same way that the judge is always corrupt. Oh, and also, the first trial that definitely happened and in fact found him liable? It never even happened. Trump wasn't there. What matters to Donald J. Trump is to embody what Donald J. Trump feels in the instant he is feeling it. Any day he can say the thing he has been barred from saying is a great day for him, because it makes him feel powerful.\n\nWhich leads me to conclude something about the tribulations of Trump's former lawyer Joe Tacopina in the earlier trial Trump endured at the hands of E. Jean Carroll. Tacopina's mistake in representing Trump's interests in that first defamation suit lay in trying to win the case in the eyes of the law, which meant keeping Trump far away from the jurors. Trump has corrected for that by retaining Habba, who understands that whether Trump wins or loses matters less than ensuring that he feels like a winner, whatever the verdict. And what is winning if not getting to do the thing you were instructed, under penalty of sanctions, not to do? Habba knows that the outcome of these trials (how much money he has to pay) doesn't matter nearly as much as establishing that Trump is as immune to law, judges, gag orders, and threats of sanctions as he is immune to reality, fact, science, and election results. She is the stage mother who comes to all his ballet recitals and T-ball games and tells him he's a star and that everyone else is doping. And if a little lawyering happens on the side, well, that's a solid day's work.\n\nWhat's frightening about these sequential Trumpian performances of above-the-law-ness is that, as they accrue, he is trained to both believe even more obstinately that the law is what he says it is, and attempt to push the boundaries ever further the next time. For the folks who didn't believe that Trump would testify this week because he had nothing to gain and everything to lose, we missed the foundational point. Losing the jury or the case is less important than showing, yet again, that they are irrelevant constructs in a world in which he declaims his innocence and millions still believe him.\n\nPerhaps the scariest takeaway from the three minutes or so Donald Trump spent on the stand Thursday was that he was really just testifying that he can do and say whatever he wants, and his followers will come away thinking that the law is fake and Trump is real. The chilling irony of the only truly substantive thing Trump said-that he didn't order his followers to harm E. Jean Carroll-is that his trials are seemingly becoming exercises in ordering his followers to disregard the law, as he does, or to choose their own legal endings, as he does. Because if he is above the law, they must be as well.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Why E. Jean Carroll Is Taking Donald Trump Back to Court\n\nDonald Trump can't seem to stay out of the courtroom. On Tuesday, Trump will again face E. Jean Carroll, the journalist and Elle columnist who previously won a lawsuit against him, and this case stems from similar claims of defamation. This time, though, Trump may be on the hook for an even bigger penalty than the $5 million he was initially slapped with when she won her lawsuit against him last year. In that suit, a jury held that Carroll had been sexually abused by the former president in the mid-1990s, when she says he raped her in a Bergdorf Goodman department-store dressing room. The jury also held that Trump later defamed her when he accused her of lying and made other colorful claims in the months after she came forward with the accusation.\n\nThis month, they're back at it, in part because Trump still can't keep his mouth shut. In this upcoming trial, Carroll is seeking additional compensatory and punitive damages for comments Trump made about her in 2019-but the jury will likely also hear about Trump's more recent repeated defamatory statements. In 2019, he was still president when Carroll published her memoir detailing the dressing room rape allegation, which was prominently excerpted in New York magazine . Trump issued an official statement after the magazine piece published, saying he had never met Carroll; that she was making up \"false stories of assault to try to get publicity for themselves or sell a book or carry out a political agenda\"; and asked for information that might tie Carroll or New York magazine to the Democratic Party. In an interview, he then accused her of \"totally lying\" and insulted her appearance, saying she wasn't his type. Carroll produced a photo of herself with the president at an event to prove that they had in fact met, which he waved off, saying, \"I have no idea who she is.\"\n\nIn November 2019, Carroll sued for defamation, listing out many of the former president's comments about her and arguing in her filing that \"Each of these statements was false. Each was defamatory.\" Trump, the suit now shorthanded as \" Carroll I \" said, made the claims knowing they were false, and he made them maliciously. Carroll's reputation was damaged, her work impacted, and her emotional well-being compromised.\n\nThis argument was also made in last year's case , \" Carroll II ,\" in which Trump was found liable for sexual abuse and defamation for separate but substantively similar statements. In that second case, Carroll sued the president for battery over the rape itself-she was able to do so only because the Adult Survivors Act was signed into law. That act opened a one-year window for adults to sue for alleged sexual assaults, no matter when those assaults happened (that law expired late last year, which is why we also saw a flurry of sexual abuse lawsuits toward the end of 2023). Carroll sued for defamation in that same suit, with her lawyers asking the court to merge the two actions. But Trump's team opposed the move, arguing that \"To permit plaintiff to drastically alter the scope and subject matter of this case at such time would severely prejudice defendant's rights.\"\n\nNow, the Carroll I defamation suit is coming before the court. Because Trump was found liable for defamation against Carroll last year, and because Trump's statements about Carroll that are at issue in this suit are substantively the same as the ones already evaluated by a jury and found to be defamatory last year, the judge ruled that the upcoming trial will be about damages only-there's no need for the jury to determine whether Trump defamed Carroll, because a jury already did that. There should be no space for Trump to raise his denials of the sexual abuse claim. The only question is: How much will his words cost him?\n\nTrump has made several (outlandish) attempts to stop this case from going forward, including claiming that he was protected by presidential immunity, as the original comments were made while he was in office. That was rejected. His team has also attempted to push the proceedings back; that was rejected as well. Now, his lawyers are suggesting that Trump himself may testify, and are requesting that previous deposition transcripts be excluded from evidence. This would be new: Trump did not testify in the first trial, and has been conspicuously absent from many of the legal proceedings brought against him. His testimony would likely turn the trial into a clown show. Trump is notoriously undisciplined: Will he constrain his testimony to the issue at hand, which is damages? Or will he try to use the stand as a bully pulpit to deny assaulting Carroll and voice whatever other grievances he can get in before the judge cuts him off? The former president no doubt wants to win in the court of public opinion. But speaking out of turn on the stand could be very bad for him in an actual court of law.\n\nTrump's antics aside, the central question of this trial remains: How much money will a jury say Trump should pay Carroll? Carroll is asking for $10 million in compensatory damages, but punitive damages are the wild card-and that is where a jury may decide to penalize Trump for defaming Carroll over and over again, even after being in effect told by a court to knock it off. Additionally, Carroll has been on the receiving end of a barrage of hateful and no doubt terrifying messages, many of which stem from Trump supporters. If a jury concludes that these attacks inevitably kicked up when the former president went after Carroll-a pattern that occurs whenever the former president goes after any individual by name-they may also up the amount in damages they believe he should pay, because Carroll's suffering from his defamatory statements is so clear.\n\nBut larger questions loom. One of them is whether the former president will continue to make statements about Carroll that are strikingly similar to those a jury has already found to be defamatory-and if, in turn, Carroll will continue to sue. Trump might not care much about the authority of the courts, but he does seem to care about money. If the damages here are significant enough, maybe financial self-interest will eventually be enough to convince him to keep Carroll's name out of his mouth. At what point that could happen, though, remains a mystery.\n\nAnother question is what message this case sends to women like Carroll, who face blistering attacks after accusing men of sexual wrongdoing. One is that women can fight back, and win. Another, though, is that some men behave with such misogynist impunity that even when they lose-officially! in court!-they won't quit their campaigns of character assassination. Surely the outcome of this case, which is so particular to the man doing the defaming, shouldn't be taken as a tipping point one way or the other. But it could be one useful data point that even the most powerful of men may face consequences when they behave absolutely egregiously, and that at least some people do stand behind women who have been wronged.\n\nAnd finally, there's the question of what it will mean for Trump in this year's election. Trump has a long, long history of making grossly misogynistic statements. He has insulted the appearance of so many women. He has launched sexist attacks on his female opponents, real and perceived. And he has boasted about sexually assaulting women. None of this cost him the 2016 election, and none of it seems to have pushed a critical mass of Republican voters toward other candidates in 2024. If anything, his misogyny seems to thrill and inspire some of the men who support him. There's no good reason to think that another E. Jean Carroll courtroom victory will convince any significant number of Trump voters not to vote for him because, suddenly, they're concerned about putting a misogynist in the White House.\n\nIf it does move the needle, then, it won't be because of disgust with Trump's misogyny. Instead, it will be because of exhaustion with his drama. The former president has an absolutely insane schedule of court dates ahead of him in the next year, including in multiple criminal actions. His die-hard followers may believe he's unfairly under siege from a Deep State intent on keeping a righteous man out of office, but independents and more moderate Republicans may simply tire of Trump's victim narrative, or of the fact that this guy cannot seem to stay out of legal trouble. A president obsessed with extracting revenge from his enemies and attaining even greater power so he can exact even more revenge is not a president who is going to do much for the American people. Trump's inevitable emotional spiral if the jury awards Carroll hefty damages again may reinforce to the vanishingly small number of reasonable but might-vote-for-Trump Republicans that this man is simply unstable, and that he makes wildly irrational decisions-like continuing to defame a woman after being found liable for defamation of her. The inevitable public tantrum if he loses does not suggest he will use the Oval Office for an agenda of greatness, but of pettiness.\n\nOr maybe, Trump's supporters will rally around him no matter how egregiously he behaves, seemingly believing that he (and perhaps they) should never have to face consequences for wrongdoing.\n\nWhatever comes to pass, what is certain is that it will not be the last time Trump has to face some consequences in a courtroom this year. For my part, I hope the former president finally leaves E. Jean Carroll alone-and that she walks away with an even bigger boatload of his money.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "After $80 Million Verdict, Trump Has a Jury Problem Ahead of Criminal Trial\n\nDespite my being a regular and caustic critic of the courtroom tactics and performances of Donald Trump and his lawyers, Friday's whopping verdict against the former president in the second E. Jean Carroll civil case requires me to acknowledge that in this instance, they were right about one thing.\n\nTeam Trump's strategic decision to seek to avoid the result of the first Carroll trial-a verdict of $5 million against the former president, who was a no-show during that trial-by having him regularly appear and testify ( sort of ) in the second Carroll trial did indeed bring about a different result. That result, however, was a disastrous $83.3 million verdict against the former president.\n\nThe jurors' ability to witness, upfront and in person, the defendant's grotesque, selfish, rude, and uncontrollable behavior surely made all the difference in the world.\n\nAs a decadeslong trial veteran, I can report that there are certain key courtroom realities that exist whether the case be civil or criminal, federal or state. One of these realities is directly relevant to today's Trump verdict-few jurors serve their critical role with any real understanding of the law, courtroom procedures, or legal terminology. So, the vast majority of jurors fall back on what they do know-human behavior-and really focus on that. This reality is exemplified by the following true story I relate in my book The Vanishing Trial .\n\nMany years ago, a white-collar criminal defense colleague shared his experiences in a lengthy federal trial he had recently completed. After the verdict, he and other attorneys asked the trial judge for permission to interview those members of the jury willing to make themselves available to counsel. Such post-trial postmortems can provide lawyers with invaluable insights into what worked, what didn't, and how the verdict was ultimately decided. Although judges do not frequently grant such interviews, to my friend's great appreciation, the judge in this case did so.\n\nIn the post-trial interview, a juror told my friend that the panel always knew, even before he opened his mouth, whether his cross-examinations would be long or short. Taken aback, he asked how that could be. The juror explained that whenever he would start a long cross-examination, he would unbutton his suit jacket. If he had just a relatively few questions to ask, the jacket would remain buttoned. While my friend had been totally unaware of this personal tic, the jurors were all over it.\n\nHow the Trump lawyers allowed their client to animate and underscore-in real time-the picture being painted by E. Jean Carroll and her attorneys of a coarse, unfeeling, disrespectable, and uncontrollable person is beyond understanding.\n\nThey also ignored-or were unaware of-a second, directly applicable courtroom reality. Jurors assume (sometimes incorrectly) that the trial judge is both all-knowing and evenhanded. After all, always addressed as \"Your Honor,\" the judge presides over the proceedings seated at a bench looming high above everyone else. Each time the judge enters the courtroom, all others must stand in respect. Whenever they leave the bench, all must stand yet again and not move until the judge has left.\n\nEvery time Judge Lewis Kaplan was forced to chastise Trump or firmly repudiated something he said or did, additional, three-dimensional \"evidence\" was offered in real time to support the plaintiff's claims.\n\nHow those on Team Trump allowed their client to expose himself before the jury to Kaplan, a veteran judge famous (or infamous, depending on one's experiences) as a no-nonsense, strict enforcer of the rules in his courtroom, is inexplicable.\n\nIn a recent Slate article , I opined that what happens in Kaplan's courtroom in the Carroll civil case would be an important guidepost for Judge Tanya Chutkan as to the most effective methods of keeping a uniquely uncontrollable defendant under control, with Chutkan presiding over the far more significant 2020 election interference trial in Washington. (That case was scheduled to begin in March but is facing likely delay due to a Trump appeal of Chutkan's rejection of his dismissal motion.)\n\nThe events and results of the second Carroll trial should also be a significant guidepost for Trump's attorneys in the D.C. case, John Lauro and Todd Blanche-two former federal prosecutors with far more experience and skill than the Trump attorneys in the state and federal civil cases.\n\nIn short, because Lauro and Blanche's colleagues were clearly unable to resist their client's crazed, untethered dictates, disaster resulted-a near $100 million verdict would be considered a disastrous result for any client, even a self-professed billionaire. Lauro and Blanche replicating their less-capable co-counsel's inability to control their unruly client would surely result in yet another devastating result, this time with the stakes so much higher.\n\nOf course, as a criminal defendant, Trump will have to appear at the D.C. trial. Given that his personal liberty will be at stake, and given his inability to ever acknowledge his own prior mistakes or admit personal limitations of any kind, Lauro and Blanche will surely have their hands full.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Trump's Second E. Jean Carroll Defamation Trial Begins Today. Here Are the Key Players.\n\nE. Jean Carroll is not done with Trump yet. She's taking him back to court, and this time, her legal team is asking for $10 million in damages over allegedly defamatory statements the former president made about her back in 2019, when Trump was still in the White House. Carroll had just came out publicly accusing the former president of rape, and he vehemently denied it, claiming Carroll was \"totally lying,\" that she was \"not my type,\" and that \"I don't know anything about her.\"\n\nCarroll sued Trump for defamation, but the case (referred to as \" Carroll I \") was paused while the Justice Department intervened to decide whether the former president was acting within the scope of his presidential duties when he made those comments about Carroll's allegations. In the meantime, New York passed the Adult Survivors Act , opening up a lookback window for survivors of sexual assault to be able to sue their abusers.\n\nIn response, Carroll filed a second lawsuit against Trump (known as \" Carroll II \") accusing him of rape (and defamation, for separate but similar comments denying her accusations). Despite its name, Carroll II went to trial first, in May 2023, and a jury determined that Trump was liable for sexual abuse and defamation . The DOJ also concluded that Trump was not acting within the scope of his presidential duties when he made those 2019 comments about Carroll. Now, with Carroll I heading to court, a judge has assessed that given the previous victories, Carroll does not need to prove Trump defamed her again, so this case is only about how much he owes in damages .\n\nTo help make sense of this case-one of so many against Trump-Slate has put together a list of the major characters you need to know.\n\nRole: Writer, plaintiff in the case\n\nKnown for: Carroll is famous for offering advice to women, whether it's about their careers or their sex lives. While in college, she was crowned Miss Indiana University, and soon after graduating she published her first story in Esquire . After that, Carroll started writing for Rolling Stone, Playboy, and Outside magazine, and even did a short stint with Saturday Night Live that earned her an Emmy Award in 1987. A few years later, she landed her very own column at Elle magazine and a cable TV talk show-both named Ask E. Jean . Carroll would continue writing that column for 26 years, with Elle's editor-in-chief Nina Garcia describing her as \"a force of nature, whose natural vibrancy has held readers in rapture for decades.\" But the award-winning writer really catapulted onto the national stage after she published her memoir, What Do We Need Men For?, where she detailed, for the first time, allegations of how Trump raped her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room the mid-1990s. She told the New York Times that she felt she owed it to her \"beloved readers\" to be transparent. \"I can't keep up this facade,\" she said.\n\nStatus: After her first trial win against Trump last year, Carroll told CNN that \"there's a sort of feeling of victory that, at last, somebody has held him accountable in a courtroom.\" Because Carroll's attorneys won a request to ban Trump from arguing in this second trial that he did not rape her, Carroll I will only be about damages.\n\nRole: Federal judge for the Southern District of New York, overseeing the defamation trial\n\nKnown for: Kaplan was appointed to the bench by former president Bill Clinton in 1994, and has served on the Manhattan federal court for well over a decade. He's a graduate of Harvard Law School and has a reputation for being no-nonsense; in a 1997 immigration case he called out the federal government for not acting expeditiously to solve an asylum case by writing, \"This is about as expedited as a glacier going uphill.\" He's worked on a number of high-profile cases, including crypto fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried 's criminal trial, actor Kevin Spacey's sexual assault trial, and Britain's Prince Andrew's sex abuse case.\n\nCurrent status: So far, Kaplan has been unforgiving to Trump, denying Trump's request for a new trial last year after a jury found him liable for sexual abuse and defamation, and agreeing with Carroll's ask that this case won't relitigate that culpability.\n\nRole: Attorney for Trump\n\nKnown for: Tacopina has the reputation of being New York's \"most hated lawyer,\" and has been described as \"an Italian-American version of Johnnie Cochran, down to the flashy style.\" He has a record of working with high-profile individuals, previously representing rappers Meek Mill, ASAP Rocky, and Foxy Brown, and baseball legend Alex Rodriguez. Trump hired Tacopina last year, and he was tasked with handling both of Carroll's lawsuits. During the first Carroll trial in May, Tacopina frequently clashed with Judge Kaplan , even filing a mistrial motion. At one point, Kaplan read aloud the definition of \"an argumentative question\" from a dictionary to Tacopina. After the jury returned a verdict that Trump was liable for sexual abuse and defamation, Tacopina claimed that you \"can't get a fair trial\" in New York. This week, a day before this year's trial was set to open, Tacopina withdrew an appeal of last year's verdict.\n\nCurrent status: It is unclear if Tacopina will return to court to defend Trump in the Carroll I trial.\n\nRole: Attorney for Trump\n\nKnown for: Madaio is a partner at the Habba Madaio & Associates law firm, and is second in command to Alina Habba, who has also represented Trump. Madaio was part of a group of lawyers that tried suing Hillary Clinton, former FBI officials, and the Democratic Party for allegedly conspiring to taint Trump's presidency by suggesting that he colluded with Russia during his 2016 presidential campaign. That case was eventually dismissed and Madaio was one of four lawyers fined $50,000 for filing the frivolous lawsuit. He's also played a role in Trump's New York civil fraud case, writing an appeal that asked for that lawsuit to be paused.\n\nCurrent status: Madaio will continue to serve on Trump's defense team during the Carroll I trial.\n\nRole: Attorney for Carroll\n\nKnown for: Kaplan, who has no relation to Judge Lewis Kaplan, is the white-collar attorney representing Carroll in both of her lawsuits against Trump. She's considered an \"experienced, well-regarded civil rights and commercial litigator known for her reasoned demeanor and practical approach,\" wrote former federal prosecutor Robert Katzberg for Slate . She's most famous for winning the landmark Supreme Court case Obergefell v. Hodges , which affirmed same-sex marriage under the 14 th Amendment. She also previously represented the former president's niece, Mary Trump, in a lawsuit that alleged Trump was defrauding his niece out of her inheritance. (The case was ultimately dismissed .) And for Carroll's lawsuit, Kaplan deposed the former president twice in two weeks, telling Vanity Fair that Trump mistook a photograph of Carroll for his ex-wife Marla Maples.\n\nCurrent status: Kaplan will be in court representing Carroll for the second time in less than one year.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "E. Jean Carroll Has Already Won a Second Trial Against Trump\n\nLast week, in a ruling on a defamation case in New York, a federal judge made a simple statement of fact : Donald Trump sexually assaulted E. Jean Carroll in the 1990s. Therefore, when he denied it, he was lying.\n\nThe ruling marks a victory for Carroll in a second defamation lawsuit she filed against the former president. This one concerns a set of statements he made in 2019 accusing Carroll of being a liar and a money-grubbing left-wing operative who was not his \"type.\" Now, instead of jurors having to determine whether Trump did what Carroll said he did, the jury must only decide how much Trump owes Carroll in damages for defaming her by calling her a liar.\n\nIn many ways, Judge Lewis Kaplan's decision was a no-brainer: A jury already found Trump liable for sexually abusing Carroll in a separate trial held this spring. That case concerned both the sexual assault itself and a set of statements Trump made in 2022 in which he denied assaulting Carroll. Since the first jury found Trump liable for both assaulting Carroll in the 1990s and defaming her in 2022, Kaplan had little choice but to rule that Trump's nearly identical statements in 2019 defamed her as well. As Kaplan wrote in his ruling:\n\nThe truth or falsity of Mr. Trump's 2019 statements ... depends-like the truth or falsity of his 2022 statement-on whether Ms. Carroll lied about Mr. Trump sexually assaulting her. The jury's finding that she did not therefore is binding in this case and precludes Mr. Trump from contesting the falsity of his 2019 statements.\n\nEven so, it is remarkable to see the facts laid out this way in a dispassionate court ruling. No matter how intently Trump insists that he never did what Carroll said he did, the question of whether he sexually assaulted her is no longer up for debate. A jury found him liable. That verdict cannot be erased.\n\nTrump had tried to have this lawsuit dismissed, arguing that the first jury found only that he had sexually abused Carroll, not raped her, as she alleged. In New York state law, rape involves the penetration of a penis into the vagina, while sexual abuse involves \"any touching of the sexual or other intimate parts of a person for the purpose of gratifying the sexual desire of either person.\"\n\nBut the specific quirks of the New York state penal code will not invalidate Carroll's claim. Kaplan ruled that the first jury's verdict can be said to find Trump liable for rape in terms of how the concept is understood by the general public.\n\nThe ease with which Kaplan was able to move the case along drives home the significance of the jury's verdict in May. Carroll's allegation is no longer just an allegation-it has been validated through the (outrageously imperfect) system we have established to punish wrongdoing, mitigate harm, and separate truth from lies. The court no longer has to treat it as a story equally as plausible as Trump's claim (which is that Carroll concocted an imaginary assault in search of a payday). A jury has already assessed their respective levels of credibility and, unsurprisingly, found Carroll to be the more trustworthy source.\n\nThe second trial will go forward in January, but Carroll will not be forced to prove her case in the same way she did in the spring trial. The second jury will be tasked only with settling on a dollar figure that matches the damage Trump caused. But as with the $5 million the first jury awarded Carroll, the money will be a drop in the bucket for Trump-and, to a certain extent, for Carroll, as it is not the primary evidence of her victory. The bigger win is on view this week in Kaplan's ruling: Trump's history as a sexual abuser is no longer merely a set of allegations. As far as this court is concerned, it is a fact.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "There's a Remarkable Piece of Evidence in the E. Jean Carroll Trial\n\nFor a moment there, it was going to be the turning point of Donald Trump's presidential campaign. Published one month before the 2016 election, at the exact right time to land a fatal blow on a candidacy that looked doomed, the 2005 video that has come to be known as the Access Hollywood tape contained what seemed like a disqualifying soundbite for any future politician: \"When you're a star, they let you do it ... Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.\"\n\nThis week-with the start of the civil trial stemming from the rape case E. Jean Carroll filed against Trump-that video will become newly relevant to the GOP's once and future lodestar.\n\nThat's because last month, the federal judge presiding over the trial ruled that Carroll's legal team could include the Access Hollywood tape as evidence to support her claim that Trump raped her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in the mid-1990s. Evidence of a defendant's general propensity for doing something is not usually admissible as proof that they committed a distinct act, but the judge decided that Carroll's case falls within a federal exception to that norm: In civil cases \"based on\" an alleged sexual assault, the plaintiff can provide evidence that the defendant committed any other sexual assault.\n\nAnd the Access Hollywood video can be read as exactly that kind of evidence, the judge ruled.\n\n\"A jury reasonably could find ... that Mr. Trump admitted in the Access Hollywood tape that he in fact has had contact with women's genitalia in the past without their consent, or that he has attempted to do so,\" he wrote in his opinion allowing the tape as evidence.\n\nIn her opening statement on Tuesday, one of Carroll's attorneys, Shawn Crowley, wasted no time bringing it up. After telling the jury that they could expect to view the recording during the trial, Crowley said , of Trump's prior admission that he grabbed women's genitals, \"This is not locker room talk-it's exactly what he did to Ms. Carroll and other women.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the jury heard Carroll recount what she says happened those decades ago. She also described the enduring effects of the trauma, including an inability to develop romantic connections with men. She testified that she has not had sex since the day of the alleged rape. \"I am a happy person, basically, but I am aware that I have lost out on one of the glorious experiences of any human being: being in love with somebody else,\" she said.\n\nThe first time the Access Hollywood tape was presented as evidence of Trump's mistreatment of women, in 2016, it was in the court of public opinion. You probably remember what happened after the video dropped, because barely anything happened at all. There were light disavowals from Republican \" fathers of daughters ,\" some lip service paid to respecting women, the \"locker-room banter\" defense that created a new category of immunity for men. Voters who already hated Trump hated him more, and voters who liked Trump didn't much care. The video landed squarely on the teetering pile of other seemingly disqualifying statements by Trump, but for all its directness and nauseating specificity, it didn't seem to make any measurable impact. Trump won the election anyway.\n\nIn the years since then, the Access Hollywood tape has served as shorthand for the entirety of Trump's misogyny-the irrefutable smoking gun. Of all the memorable moments of bigotry and chauvinism from that campaign, including the remarks and allegations of abuse that bubbled from earlier eras in Trump's life, the Access Hollywood tape was the most vivid encapsulation of Trump's estimation of women's worth.\n\nPart of the tape's staying power stemmed from the language Trump used, which was not just vulgar and dehumanizing, but disturbingly idiosyncratic. (You don't hear much about women being grabbed by the pussy , as if they were misbehaving children being led to timeout by their ears.) The video has also endured in the public memory as an emblem of Trump's maddening impunity, as it revealed how easy it was for Republicans to shrug off the remarks, fall in line, and emerge newly emboldened by the cruelty of their unapologetic leader. If this couldn't take Trump down, or even make a noticeable dent in his outsized career ambitions, whatever could?\n\nBut now, the public narrative of that cursed video is being opened for revisions. This trial marks the chance for a victory both material and symbolic. Trump stands accused of raping Carroll and lying about it; in the lawsuit, the charges are battery and defamation. If the jury finds him guilty, Trump may be forced to pay damages and, for the first time, be labeled in the legal record as a perpetrator of sexual assault.\n\nTo be clear, the Access Hollywood recording does not carry the weight of a confession. Trump did not make those comments under oath or during any kind of lawful interrogation, and they do not directly pertain to Carroll's allegations. But Carroll is entitled to paint for the jury an accurate picture of the man she is accusing of rape-a picture that includes both his own boastful admissions of assault and the stories of two other women, Natasha Stoynoff and Jessica Leeds, who are expected to testify for Carroll's side that Trump assaulted them as well.\n\nThe formality of a courtroom trial will imbue these women's stories with new meaning: no longer accusations, but testimony. Not simply painful recollections, but evidence .\n\nFor years now, Trump has smeared his accusers as vindictive, money- and attention-hungry, politically motivated liars. On Wednesday morning, about an hour before the trial kicked off for the day, he posted on Truth Social that Carroll is running a \"scam\" and a \"witch hunt\" with a \"fraudulent and false story.\" (The judge called the posts \"entirely inappropriate\" and scolded Trump's lawyers for allowing their client to attempt to influence the jury.) Carroll's lawsuit is proving to be a powerful rejoinder to those claims. She has friends willing to testify that she told them about the rape in the immediate aftermath. She has two other women with remarkably similar stories of Trump's sexual aggression. What does he have? A video recording in which he marvels at the privilege of celebrities to grope women at will. In an orderly fashion and under oath, it will all be laid out for the public to judge.\n\nFor those of us following along, all of it-the restated allegations, the re-aired video, Trump's recycled smears against his accusers-can feel like an excruciating wormhole back to the worst days of 2016. But this time, it is playing out in court. Even if Trump is exonerated, there may be closure in this treatment of Trump's accusers with the seriousness they deserve. It is thanks to Carroll that Trump must answer to multiple allegations of sexual violence, and that a video that has come to symbolize our impotent rage at Trump's impunity will finally be treated as the evidence it is.\n\nBefore court adjourned on Wednesday, Carroll acknowledged the significance of the venue. \"To be able to get my day in court, finally, is everything to me,\" she said. \"I'm crying because I'm happy I got to tell my story in court.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

Jean Carroll Trial Will Probably Doom Him in Court Again and Again\n\nAfter hearing evidence for two weeks, it took a jury of Donald Trump's peers less than two and a half hours to find him legally responsible for both sexual assault and defamation , ordering him to pay his victim, E. Jean Carroll, approximately $5 million in damages. The speed of the verdict was even more remarkable considering that the time the jury spent included ordering and eating lunch.\n\nNotwithstanding its swiftness-since the Carroll verdict was readily predictable , given the combination of realities involved-now would be a good time to examine what it may mean for the former president going forward. This is difficult territory to traverse, but at least two signs clearly emerged out of the trial.\n\nFirst, Trump's refusal to appear and testify on his own behalf in the Carroll case underscores a fact of life in the Trump legal world we examined some time ago: The former president is an unimaginably bad witness whose personal testimony would be legal suicide . Even in the very basic \"he said, she said\" Carroll case, while she had plenty to say, he was unable to utter a single word in his own defense.\n\nThe potential burden this imposes on his ability to defend himself in the criminal prosecutions potentially on the horizon, whether emanating from Georgia or D.C., is enormous. Whether attempting to influence the 2020 election, obstructing the Justice Department's attempt to have him return classified documents to the White House, or encouraging his followers to storm the Capitol and prevent Congress from performing its legal functions, the offenses under investigation are all legally premised on his state of mind. As in all white-collar criminal cases, the government must prove that a defendant acted with criminal intent, and there can be no better way to explain to the jury what was really on someone's mind than to have the defendant speak directly to its members. The Carroll trial's result has now underscored how damaging that key option's absence could be for the former president in the coming cases against him.\n\nAnother conclusion that can be reasonably drawn from the proceeding is that the New York attorney general's civil complaint against Trump and members of his family alleging \"staggering fraud\" in their business dealings is likely to be even stronger than initially assumed. After having invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination some 440 times in the first round of depositions, last month his attorneys surprisingly decided to have him answer questions under oath for some seven hours. The extent to which this testimony negates the negative legal inferences one could draw from his first round of Fifth Amendment privilege invocations remains to be seen. What is clear, however, is that if Trump's recent testimony in state Attorney General Letitia James' lawsuit is even remotely as bad as his deposition testimony in the Carroll trial , he has just provided James with even more evidence to use against him. Whether or not he decides to appear at the trial, which is scheduled to begin later this year, the attorney general can use his video deposition testimony to brutalize him the same way Carroll's lawyers did. New York's lawyers will play the most damaging deposition statements Trump made during the trial and play these \"greatest hits\" again in summation.\n\nIn short, the kickoff to Trump's courtroom battles has not only started badly but it has further exposed the limits he himself imposes on his ability to defend himself in all pending matters. At the same time, his decision to testify in the New York attorney general's case has now only strengthened his enemy's hand.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe case could send a big message about the long history of sexual misconduct allegations against Trump.\n\nby Li Zhou\n\nEditor's note, May 9: A jury found former President Donald Trump guilty of sexual abuse and defamation, and awarded E. Jean Carroll $5 million. Read Vox's latest coverage of the verdict here . The story below was originally published on April 24 and last updated on April 27.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is the subject of another court case this week, this time centering on allegations that he raped the writer E. Jean Carroll in the 1990s , a claim he's denied. The case renews the scrutiny on more than 20 sexual misconduct allegations that have been brought against Trump, and adds to the legal troubles he's fielding on everything from allegedly falsifying business records to interfering in the presidential election.\n\nThe lawsuit filed by Carroll is a civil one, meaning Trump would have to pay damages if a jury agrees with her claims, but it doesn't put him at risk of jail time. Carroll has also asked for Trump to retract the denials he's made of the rape allegation if she wins the case.\n\nThe two issues Carroll has raised in the suit include a claim of battery, citing psychological harms she's experienced because of Trump's alleged sexual assault, and a claim of defamation, due to the comments he's made about her manufacturing the allegation. Trump's counsel, meanwhile, has sought to argue that Carroll is raising this allegation for political reasons and for personal fame. Additionally, they've questioned why Carroll doesn't recall the exact date and time of the incident, something she's said she wishes she remembers.\n\nA panel of anonymous jurors will have to decide if Trump is liable on both claims, effectively determining if he should be held accountable for the rape allegation Carroll has levied. Because this is a civil case, the jurors don't have to determine whether he committed an act beyond a reasonable doubt. Rather, they have to decide if there is a preponderance of evidence that Trump assaulted and defamed Carroll.\n\nOn Wednesday, Carroll took the stand and spoke about the alleged assault. \"I am here because Donald Trump raped me, and when I wrote about it, he said it didn't happen,\" Carroll said in her testimony. Two other women who've accused Trump of sexual misconduct, businesswoman Jessica Leeds and People magazine writer Natasha Stoynoff , could also testify, further highlighting his problematic treatment of women. Trump, meanwhile, is not required to take the stand, and it's unclear if he will choose to do so.\n\nA win for Carroll in this case could ultimately send a strong message about Trump's history of alleged sexual assault and underscore the importance of a new New York law, which allows survivors to pursue a lawsuit involving such allegations years after an incident occurred.\n\nFor survivors of sexual assault, any measure of accountability for public figures can have a major impact. \"It's really significant for targets of sexual violence to know that, no matter how powerful the person is, no matter how long ago that happened, the courts are going to take seriously the claims that you have,\" Laura Beth Nielsen, a sociology professor and director of legal studies at Northwestern University, told Vox.\n\nCarroll alleges that Trump raped her after they ran into each other at a department store in the 1990s. She first published the allegations in 2019 in a New York magazine article excerpting her book, What Do We Need Men For?: A Modest Proposal.\n\nIn the article, Carroll, who had a television show responding to audience questions, said she spoke with Trump after he recognized her as the \"advice lady\" when they were both in the department store, Bergdorf Goodman. After their run-in, Trump said he needed her help picking a gift for a woman in his life, ultimately heading to the lingerie department.\n\nOnce there, according to Carroll's allegations, Trump convinced Carroll to go to the dressing room, where he pushed her against a wall and put his mouth on hers. Carroll pushed him away, but he allegedly continued to force himself onto her, pulling down her tights, groping her, and raping her, she says . The description bears striking similarities to other allegations made about Trump involving forcible kissing and groping. Trump has denied this and other allegations.\n\nCarroll explained that she did not go to police when the incident happened, and did not come forward sooner due to concerns that she'd be dismissed. At the time, she told two friends about the incident, both of whom confirmed to New York magazine that she'd relayed the assault to them. Carroll has also said that her decision to speak publicly about the alleged attack changed when allegations against other prominent men like Harvey Weinstein began to emerge.\n\nTrump has issued multiple denials of the allegations in the years since, saying on Truth Social last fall that Carroll's claims were a \"hoax and a lie,\" and a \"complete con job.\"\n\nCarroll filed two suits against Trump after going public with the allegations. The first, which accused him of defaming her by denigrating her allegations, has been stalled in court, while the second suit, which addresses both battery and defamation, is the one that's currently taking place.\n\nThe case puts allegations of Trump's misconduct toward women back into the spotlight and heightens the focus on his legal woes.\n\nAccording to a Business Insider count , 26 women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct. This list includes model Amy Dorris, who said he forcibly kissed and groped her in 1997; businesswoman Jessica Leeds, who said he reached up her skirt and groped her in the 1970s; and People magazine reporter Natasha Stoynoff, who said he pushed her against a wall and forcibly kissed her in 2005. Trump has denied all of these allegations and often sought to undercut the women making them by criticizing their looks and suggesting they're not his type.\n\nIf the jury finds Trump liable, Carroll's case could send a strong signal about the broader allegations against him.\n\nAdditionally, the suit shows the impact of a new New York law, which was passed in 2022 to extend the statute of limitations for pursuing legal claims of sexual assault. The 2022 law, known as the Adult Survivors Act, enables people to file civil claims regarding past allegations of sexual assault including those that happened beyond the state's statute of limitations. It provides a one-year window for survivors to make these claims. which is open until this November. Dozens of cases have been filed already, and more could emerge before the deadline closes this fall.\n\n\"I stayed silent for years after I was attacked, and by staying silent lost my chance to hold my attacker accountable,\" wrote Carroll in letters to lawmakers advocating for the passage of the law. In many cases of sexual assault, survivors don't report immediately because they aren't prepared to do so, haven't processed the incident, or are too traumatized in the moment.\n\nCarroll's could be the latest case to show the impact of policies that give survivors more time to report. Her ability to pursue this suit at all already shows the significance of a proposal like this one. \"Being able to get my day in court, finally, is everything to me,\" Carroll has said.\n\nCarroll's lawsuit is also one of myriad legal problems Trump is navigating. In April, a Manhattan grand jury indicted him on 34 counts of falsifying business records. And he is still fielding two federal probes, one about allegedly holding on to classified documents, and one about potential interference into the peaceful transfer of power after the 2020 election. Finally, there's also a criminal probe in Georgia regarding whether he tried to illegally change the 2020 election results in the state.\n\nIf Trump is found liable on the two claims from Carroll, he'll have to pay financial damages to her. More broadly, it would mean that a jury believes he should face consequences for her allegation of rape and increase the scrutiny he's received for his treatment of women.\n\nThat's a problem that has dogged Trump with women voters since 2016, when a bombshell Washington Post report included footage of him bragging about sexual assault. In the 2020 election, exit polls showed that 57 percent of women voted for Biden, while 42 percent voted for Trump. A 2017 CNN poll also found that 61 percent of respondents believed the sexual misconduct allegations against Trump.\n\nThe Carroll case compounds the controversies surrounding Trump's 2024 candidacy, giving ammunition to his opponents who've suggested he has too much baggage to run successfully.

Jean Carroll doesn't use the word \"rape\" to describe her accusations against Trump\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\n\"Every woman gets to choose her word.\"\n\nby Constance Grady\n\nWhen E. Jean Carroll accused President Donald Trump last week of sexually assaulting her in the mid-1990s, one word was notable for its absence: rape.\n\nThe actions Carroll describes fit the legal definition of rape. According to Carroll, Trump forcibly penetrated her, \"halfway - or completely, I'm not certain,\" before she was able to push him off of her and run. And according to the FBI , rape is legally defined as \"penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object ...without the consent of the victim.\"\n\nBut Carroll has repeatedly chosen not to describe what happened to her as rape. On Thursday, Carroll and two friends who she confided in at the time of the alleged assault appeared on the New York Times podcast The Daily , and all three of them agreed that she has not wanted to use the word \"rape\" from the beginning.\n\n\"I said, 'He raped you?'\" recalled Lisa Birnbach, the author of The Preppy Handbook and the first person Carroll told. \"And you said, 'Eh, I don't ... he pulled down my tights!'\"\n\n\"It was horrible,\" Birnbach continued. \"We fought. And I said, 'Let's go to the police.' 'No.' 'Come to my house.' 'No, I want to go home.' 'I'll take you to the police.' 'No. It was 15 minutes of my life. It's over. Don't ever tell anybody. I just had to tell you.'\"\n\n\"It was an episode,\" Carroll said, \"it was an action, it was a fight, it was not a crime.\"\n\nMegan Twohey, the investigative reporter who in 2017 helped break the Harvey Weinstein story that fueled the current wave of the #MeToo movement, asked Carroll why she chooses not to use the word rape even now, in 2019. Carroll was vehement in her response.\n\n\"Every woman gets to choose her word,\" she said. \"Every woman gets to choose how she describes it. This is my way of saying it. This is my word. My word is fight . My word is not the victim word. I have not been raped. Something has not been done to me. I fought. That's the thing.\"\n\nFrom a feminist perspective, it's tempting to push back against Carroll's word usage here. If you have been raped, that doesn't mean you've been reduced to a victim and nothing more. That's part of the reason for the popularity of the term \"assault survivor\" rather than \"assault victim\": It puts the emphasis on the survivor's strength and the active work they have done to make it through a terrible experience.\n\nThose who choose to identify as a victim of assault rather than survivors are not inherently weak or passive, either. In a recent essay for the Lily , Katie Simon explained why she prefers the term \"victim\" to \"survivor.\"\n\n\"I do not want to be the focus. I want the crime to be the focus. I want the criminal to be the focus,\" Simon wrote. \"When we hear the term victim, we think about the crime, acknowledge its perpetrator. When we hear the term survivor, the perpetrator is erased. Empowering victims, linguistically or otherwise, won't stop rape.\"\n\nBut Carroll's discomfort with the term \"rape\" also makes sense, because all of the vocabulary that we have for sexual violence is fraught and confusing and limiting in ways that speak to our culture's deep ambivalence about sexual assault.\n\nIn 2017, as the #MeToo movement was gaining momentum and a different famous man was being accused of sexual assault every week, I looked at the history of the language we use to talk about sexual violence . What I found is that this vocabulary is profoundly limited. Feminists have constantly had to make up new terms to describe acts that were before nameless, words like \"date rape\" and \"sexual harassment.\" And every time those new words enter our lexicon, the larger culture pushes back against them and works to drain them of meaning. In the public sphere, they become polite euphemisms that describe acts that are silly and trivial and not actually worth complaining about.\n\n\"When these terms are actually used, they're depoliticized,\" linguist Susan Ehrlich told me at the time . \"They lose their force.\"\n\nWe can see that happening in real time with the term \"sexual harassment,\" which has been heavily devalued since Lin Farley coined it in 1975. \"'Sexual harassment' was never meant to be a term that the corporate world would feel comfortable tossing around,\" Farley wrote in a New York Times opinion piece in 2017 . \"It is a vicious practice - one that flourishes because men hold authority over women at work, and they use it to extract sex and to humiliate. If the price of popularizing the notion of sexual harassment has been to dampen its impact, it's now time to reclaim and redefine the term as the ugly thing it is - to imbue it with its initial power.\"\n\nThat is the sort of development arc that led me to write, in 2017:\n\nIt's not that we don't have a vocabulary for talking about sexual violence, because we do. But that vocabulary is inadequate. It is confusing and flattening in ways that make it hard to talk about sexual violence without either trivializing it, obfuscating the systems that enable it, or getting so specific as to become salacious or triggering. So whenever I talk about sexual violence, I feel like I'm translating: taking the acts that actually happened and trying to cram them into the language that I have available to describe them.\n\nAnd the inadequacy of our vocabulary for sexual violence extends to what should arguably be the most basic term of all: rape. Feminists can insist that \"rape\" is not, per Carroll's formulation, \"the victim word,\" because being raped doesn't make victimhood central to your identity - but that logic doesn't just erase all of the cultural baggage that has been piled on top of the word. It doesn't magically make our language feminist.\n\nThere are good reasons for feminists to continue to push back against the idea that to be raped is to be a passive victim. Language is flexible and changes over time, and continuing to be thoughtful and conscious about how we use weighted terms like \"rape\" can help us continue to break down the systems that make sexual violence so prevalent and so difficult to talk about in our culture.\n\nBut while that work is ongoing, it's not fair to expect every woman in the world to align her understanding of her own experiences with one particular political project.

Jean Carroll after he claimed she was a liar following allegations that he raped her in the 1990s.\n\nJudge Lewis Kaplan's decision means that an upcoming civil trial in the case will simply determine how much Trump owes Carroll in damages, rather than focusing on his liability. It's the second time Trump has been found liable for defamation after a jury came to the same conclusion earlier this year . Kaplan concluded that since that jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing Carroll, the question of whether his claims about her fabricating the incident constituted defamation had been settled, negating the need for another trial on the matter.\n\nIt's a big civil legal loss for Trump, and comes as he faces four criminal indictments, as well as several other civil lawsuits, including ones alleging business fraud and that he led a pyramid scheme.\n\nIn the short term, Trump's loss in his case with Carroll will probably have little effect, other than on his finances. Thus far, his popularity among Republican primary voters has only grown as his legal issues have worsened . But should he become the GOP's presidential nominee, the Carroll decision - and his other legal baggage - could limit the support he gets from swing voters while energizing the Democratic voters opposed to his mistreatment of women .\n\nMore broadly, Trump's many lawsuits are a distraction that could affect his ability to campaign, and some have been a drain on resources: His political action committee, for example, is almost broke due, in part, to many of the legal fees it's had to cover .\n\nAs his legal issues pile up, they will continue to have an effect on his bottom line, give his Democratic opponents plenty of material for attack ads, and could put a limit on the backing he sees in the general election.\n\nAs a FiveThirtyEight polling aggregator shows, Trump's standing in Republican primary polls hasn't declined much despite the growing onslaught of lawsuits and indictments he faces. As of early September, he had 53 percent support among Republican primary voters, far surpassing that of the 16 percent held by runner-up Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Additionally, as NPR reports , Trump's support has actually seen a GOP polling uptick following some of the criminal indictments, as he's claimed that he's being politically persecuted.\n\nAs historian Thomas Weber told my colleague Nicole Narea , when it comes to his lawsuits, Trump is \"using - kind of brilliantly, in a moral-free way - the language of victimization to get support behind him, and also very cleverly always says, 'This is not just about me,' but presents himself as the embodiment of the American people, of the underprivileged.\" His strategy has led to a \"rally around the flag\" effect among his supporters, and has effectively neutralized the primary campaigns of his rivals.\n\n[ Related: Why Trump seems to grow more popular the worse his legal troubles become ]\n\nBeyond the Republican primary, however, Trump could see more political fallout from these lawsuits among swing voters. In 2020, a number of swing voters moved away from Trump, a trend that helped cost him the election. In 2016, for example, Trump won 46 percent of independent voters , and in 2020, he won 41 percent, according to exit polls . Similarly, Trump won 40 percent of voters who identified as moderate in 2016, and just 34 percent in 2020. That trend could continue next year as these lawsuits exacerbate the baggage that Trump already had.\n\nAccording to an August ABC News/Ipsos poll , 67 percent and 64 percent of swing voters find the charges in the federal January 6 indictment, and the Georgia indictment, respectively, to be serious. And specifically in relation to the Carroll case, 65 percent of women and 61 percent of independents in a May Yahoo/YouGov poll said Trump should not serve as president again if he was found liable for raping Carroll. (While a jury did not find him liable for rape, they did find him liable for sexual abuse .) An August AP poll also found that while 74 percent of Republicans said they would back him in the 2024 general election, 53 percent of all respondents said they would not vote for him in the general election.\n\nBecause of some of these concerns, other GOP candidates - including DeSantis - have focused on whether Trump will be an electable candidate in the general election. \"You have basically three people at this point that are credible in this whole thing,\" DeSantis said in May . \"Biden, Trump, and me. And I think of those three, two have a chance to get elected president - Biden and me, based on all the data in the swing states.\"\n\nThe lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat - and a closer look at where they should go next.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe E. Jean Carroll verdict illuminates the fraught history of the term's legal definition.\n\nby Constance Grady\n\nThis article contains graphic discussions of sexual violence.\n\nOn May 9, a jury found Donald Trump liable for sexual battery against the journalist E. Jean Carroll in a civil trial, ordering the former president to pay her $5 million. They did not, however, find Trump liable for rape. The murky, vexed distinction the jury made in that verdict speaks to what has been one of the central conflicts since Carroll came forward in 2019 - and to America's persistent cultural queasiness when it comes to talking about rape.\n\nWhen Carroll first accused Trump of attacking her in her 2019 memoir, What Do We Need Men For? , she was very clear about the anatomical details of what had occurred in the mid-1990s.\n\n\"Still wearing correct business attire, shirt, tie, suit jacket, overcoat,\" Carroll wrote , \"he opens the overcoat, unzips his pants, and, forcing his fingers around my private area, thrusts his penis halfway - or completely, I'm not certain - inside me.\"\n\nCarroll was equally clear at the time that she was not going to call this attack a rape. Instead, she called it a fight.\n\n\"Every woman gets to choose her word,\" she said on the New York Times podcast The Daily in June 2019. \"Every woman gets to choose how she describes it. This is my way of saying it. This is my word. My word is fight. My word is not the victim word. I have not been raped. Something has not been done to me. I fought. That's the thing.\"\n\nAs Carroll would later testify, she's a member of the Silent Generation. For a long time in American history, rape has been associated with shame, guilt, and victim-blaming. It was understandable for her to decide that calling the attack a rape would make it feel worse than it had to.\n\nStill, what Carroll was describing did sound like rape, and it had been committed by the man who was now in the White House. That's a news story.\n\nAccordingly, media outlets talked awkwardly around the question of exactly what to call Carroll's story. It amounted to a rape accusation , said The Daily. It fit the legal definition of rape is what I went with. (As we're about to see, \"legal definition\" was a fuzzy word choice on my part.)\n\nThe statute of limitations had long since run out on filing criminal charges against Trump by the time Carroll came forward about his attack. She sought remedy from the civil court system instead, and as she did so, she began to change her preferred terminology. In November 2019, she filed a defamation lawsuit against Trump accusing him of lying about not assaulting her. The filing repeatedly used the word \"rape\" to describe Trump's attack.\n\nIn 2022, in an acknowledgment of the massive social tide swell of the Me Too movement , New York State passed the Adult Survivors Act , which reopened a one-year window for survivors of sexual assault to file civil claims against their attackers. Carroll promptly filed another lawsuit against Trump , this one suing him for rape. When she took the stand to testify against Trump in civil court this April for both suits, she began by saying, \"I'm here because Donald Trump raped me.\"\n\nWe can see some of the ambivalence Carroll expressed around the word rape echoed, though, in the jury's choice to find Trump liable for sexual battery but not rape. To understand the context for the jury's decision, we'll have to dig into the weeds of sexual assault law terminology. Once again, be warned that this gets graphic.\n\nNew York state criminal statutes generally divide sexual assault into several categories. Loosely speaking, rape means penetrative penis-in-vagina sexual intercourse performed by physical force. Aggravated sexual abuse refers to any other penetrative sex act performed by physical force, including oral, anal, or digital penetration or penetration by a foreign object. Finally, sexual abuse means forcible sexual contact, usually the touching of someone's intimate or sexual areas, without penetration.\n\nThe reason we have these categories is to distinguish between which kinds of sex crimes we consider most terrible. It is a value system of sexual morality, codified. New York state's value system is similar to the one we see in a lot of other states.\n\nUnder this system, the violent penetration of the vagina by the penis becomes a singularly terrible crime. Rape of non-vaginal orifices, or rape of the vagina by anything other than the phallus, become aggravated sexual abuse: crimes with a less emotionally charged label, not as grave, not as serious. You might think of it as analogous to reserving the word \"murder\" for killings committed with guns, while calling those committed with knives something like \"aggravated ending of life.\"\n\nLegally, though, we tend to treat rape and aggravated sexual abuse fairly similarly. The line is more strictly defined between aggravated sexual abuse, in which the victim is penetrated in some way, and sexual abuse, in which they are not.\n\n\"It is common to distinguish between penetration and the lack thereof,\" says Deborah Tuerkheimer, a law professor at Northwestern University. \"There is a widespread understanding that penetration of sexual parts is more harmful and causes more injury to the victim, not only physically but also mentally and emotionally. So it's considered more injurious and more reprehensible. Penetration is the most serious sexual offense.\"\n\nCarroll has been very clear and consistent on what Trump did to her. She has said that he penetrated her both with his fingers and with his penis - what the New York state criminal code would label aggravated sexual abuse and rape.\n\nAt the Trump-Carroll trial, however, the options on the jury's verdict form collapsed the categories of aggravated sexual abuse and sexual abuse into a single category. (It's unclear why the jurors were presented with these options, but traditionally the charges are carefully negotiated by the judge and attorneys for both sides. The court seems to have used the term \"sexual battery\" on the jury form as an umbrella category for both rape and sexual abuse.) The jury was asked to determine if it was more likely than not that Trump had raped Carroll (penetrated her with his penis) and if it was more likely than not that he committed sexual battery (touched her intimate areas, either with or without penetration).\n\n\"In a criminal prosecution, getting this granular makes a huge difference,\" says Tuerkhimer. \"In a civil trial, would a jury have cared? Would they have awarded her more damages? It's hard to say.\"\n\nThese categories mean one of the big questions of this decision became \"Did the attacker use his genitals or his hands to attack the victim?\" It's worth asking why we consider that question to be the most important issue for a legal system to focus on when deciding how to handle sex crimes.\n\nThe current international standard on rape law comes from the United Nations' 2011 Istanbul Convention. There, rape is defined as \"all forms of sexual acts which are performed on another person without her or his freely given consent and which are carried out intentionally.\" In many countries, however, and in many US states, this definition is modified by degrees: degrees of contact, of penetration, of which appendages touched which orifices, of how forcefully the attacker overcame the victim's lack of consent. It generally takes active feminist campaigning to get to a definition closer to the UN's standard.\n\nIn the US, the FBI's legal definition of rape persisted unchanged from 1929 to 2013. Just 10 years ago, \"rape\" used to mean \"the carnal knowledge of a female, forcibly and against her will.\" Under that definition, victims were all female. Since \"carnal knowledge\" in legal statutes meant \"heterosexual penetrative intercourse,\" all rape was vaginal. Sex performed without the consent of one party wasn't necessarily rape, as long as it wasn't too violently \"forcible.\" The definition only changed after years of protest from feminist groups like the Women's Law Project and the Feminist Majority Foundation .\n\nIn New York state specifically, there is at least one campaign underway to overhaul the penal code with an updated definition of the word rape. A bill currently making its way through the state senate says it \"removes the penetration requirement from the rape statutes, redefines rape to include oral and anal sexual conduct within the definition of rape and makes conforming changes throughout various areas of law.\"\n\nTamika Payne, the acting executive director of the New York State Coalition Against Sexual Assault, notes that changing a legal definition is a delicate operation that can have massive ripple effects.\n\nOther groups have made similar critiques. In an open letter from 2013, when the so-called \"Rape Is Rape\" bill first reached the New York State Assembly, the District Attorneys Association of the State of New York cautioned that bringing rape and aggravated sexual abuse into the same legal category would make it harder to sentence perpetrators to consecutive prison terms.\n\n\"We are very supportive of the elimination of the penetration requirement in New York's rape statutes,\" says Payne. \"We do not want laws that are exclusionary. We want them to be fully comprehensive, include all sexual violations, not have gendered language, so that we are protecting those who identify as men, those who identify as women, and those who are gender fluid. However, we are supportive of going about that in a way that would minimize unintended consequences of a major overhaul.\"\n\nThe delicacy of this issue, the extreme parsimony of each definition, the careful precision around what exactly we are willing to call a rape - all of it speaks to how little US culture wants to believe that rape exists. We are behaving as though if we make rape a specific enough word, no acts of sexual violence will fit into the category it describes, and then no one will have to admit to having experienced rape at all. As if people who commit aggravated sexual abuse did not rape, and people who survived aggravated sexual abuse are not rape victims. And all these choices allow us to think of the problem as less horrible than it really is.\n\n\"When you look at how society communicates,\" says Payne, \"you see things like, 'Oh, well, it was just fondling. It was just this.' It's like the only really bad thing is way up here .\"\n\nDonald Trump is, if nothing else, highly skilled at knowing how his base communicates. At a CNN town hall the day after the jury's verdict, Trump insisted , \"They said, 'He didn't rape her.'\"\n\nPayne says her organization's mission aims for a different default. \"Every person has a right to bodily autonomy, and should and must give consent to be touched,\" she says. \"When we say we're working toward a world free from sexual violence, that means we're working toward eliminating the 'just' in daily conversation.\"\n\nBetween November 2019, when she came forward with her accusation, and November 2022, when she filed a civil lawsuit against Donald Trump alleging rape, E. Jean Carroll changed her mind about the term. (Carroll did not respond to a request for comment from Vox.) The apparent transformation in her thinking is emblematic of a larger feminist attempt to change the way we use this word: as a mark of shame not on the victim but on the attacker; not as a piece of vocabulary that re-enshrines the primacy of heterosexual sex, but as a label for a category of violent crime.\n\nThe ambiguous verdict speaks to how far there is to go.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nHow Kristi Noem and Karoline Leavitt offer two visions of conservative femininity.\n\nAstrology's enormous appeal, explained for believers and skeptics.\n\nNothing will cure you of perfectionism faster than trying to grow living things.\n\n3 theories for Gen Z's return to God and faith.\n\nTrump's lawyers asked the Supreme Court to reinstate his ban on trans military service, after a lower court blocked it.\n\nHow a day off can (and can't) help children.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThey reaffirm his mistreatment of women and complete disregard for the legal system.\n\nby Li Zhou\n\nAt a Wednesday CNN town hall, former President Donald Trump had his first major appearance since he was found liable for the sexual abuse of writer E. Jean Carroll earlier this week. During it, he opted to take the same approach he's always taken to allegations of sexual misconduct: denying it and mocking the accuser.\n\n\"I have no idea who the hell she is,\" he said, referring to Carroll as a \"whack job.\" The comments were notable given Trump was found not just liable for sexual abuse, but defamation as well. His willingness to continue smearing Carroll despite that defamation verdict echoes how he's treated women, and how he's approached legal issues both during and after his presidency. It's also a reminder that, if elected president, Trump will continue to act as though the law does not apply to him, regardless of the political or policy consequences of that approach.\n\nThe dangers of Trump's disregard for the law were on display elsewhere in the town hall as well. In addition to his statements about Carroll, Trump suggested he'd undermine the legal system if reelected by committing to pardoning January 6 insurrectionists . He also continued his assault on democracy by repeating false claims about election fraud and emphasizing that Vice President Mike Pence should have done more to overturn the 2020 election results. Broadly, the event gave him a forum to continue peddling lies in front of a relatively friendly audience, and to minimize any legal consequences he and his followers have faced.\n\nMuch of the rhetoric was unsurprising coming from Trump and a continuation of stances he's long embraced. His words, however, were striking for demonstrating how little the maelstrom of state and federal investigations, in addition to the Carroll verdict, have affected his outlook, despite jurors in multiple cases now affirming concerns about his behavior. These statements directly speak to how he'd serve in a second term: as a president who isn't accountable to any checks on his actions.\n\nFor years, Trump has denied more than 20 allegations of sexual misconduct , and often attacked the women who've made them. And while it won't change how he approaches the issue or how his supporters perceive it, the Carroll verdict offers Trump's opponents a direct counterpoint to his claims that he isn't liable for anything. Although the jury did not find Trump liable for rape, they did find him liable for sexual abuse, which is defined as \"subjecting a person to sexual contact without consent,\" according to the New York Times.\n\nCarroll spoke to the significance of this verdict and the need for accountability in these cases in a statement after the trial. \"I filed this lawsuit against Donald Trump to clear my name and to get my life back,\" she said in a statement. \"Today, the world finally knows the truth. This victory is not just for me but for every woman who has suffered because she was not believed.\"\n\nIt's notable that even as Trump is continuing to denigrate Carroll and other allegations he's faced, a panel of nine federal jurors is on record disagreeing with him. That's a decision that could have electoral impact too: While Trump's base is deeply loyal and unlikely to be swayed by such developments, as evidenced by the town hall crowd's warm response to his attacks against Carroll, swing voters - including many women - could be affected by them in the general election. In 2020, Biden outperformed Trump with women, according to exit polls, with 57 percent backing him and 42 percent backing his opponent.\n\nIn addition to the Carroll verdict, Trump is also facing other looming court cases which could further dilute any credible attempts to skirt legal responsibility with persuadable voters. In New York, he's also been indicted by a grand jury for falsifying business records and is set to face a trial. In Georgia, he's under investigation for trying to interfere in the state's 2020 election results. And at the federal level, he's under two investigations regarding classified documents and attempts to overturn the 2020 election outcome.\n\nPresident Joe Biden seized on Trump's many falsehoods in the town hall on Wednesday, asking voters in a tweet if they wanted \"four more years of that.\" It's a framing Biden made successful use of in the 2020 election, when he cast himself as someone who could bring normalcy and a reverence for laws to Trump's chaotic Washington. As much as Trump's willingness to dismiss the legal system and undermine US institutions was a preview of a second term, it also put on display everything that distressed grassroots Democrats during Trump's first term. Democrats are likely to continue to use Trump's own words - and his looming legal issues - to turn out more of their own base in addition to making the case to voters in the middle who may also be tired of the drama.\n\nAs the town hall made clear, Trump's penchant for discounting any allegations he faces and acting like he doesn't bear any responsibility for these actions hasn't disappeared. Additionally, many of his supporters will probably remain unfazed by court decisions. But he faces a difficult legal reality. It's one that he and his supporters can continue to ignore, but there's no guarantee all voters will do the same.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

She says the magazine fired her because of Trump.\n\nby Constance Grady\n\nLegendary advice columnist E. Jean Carroll, who accused Donald Trump of raping her and is currently suing him, was fired from her post at Elle magazine because of Trump's defamation, Carroll says.\n\n\"Because Trump ridiculed my reputation, laughed at my looks, & dragged me through the mud, after 26 years, ELLE fired me,\" Carroll tweeted Tuesday night . \"I don't blame Elle. It was the great honor of my life writing 'Ask E. Jean.'\"\n\nCarroll first accused Trump in her 2019 book What Do We Need Men For? , in a passage excerpted in New York magazine that went wildly viral . In the passage, Carroll wrote that Trump attacked her in the dressing room of an upscale department store sometime in the 1990s and raped her as she fought him off. Trump denied Carroll's accusations , claiming variously that he had never met her (although there's photographic proof that he has), that she is not his type , and that she was only trying to boost sales of her book.\n\nIn response, Carroll sued Trump. In November 2019, she filed suit against the president for defamation, arguing that Trump's claims caused her emotional pain, reputational damage, and \"substantial professional harm.\" She and her lawyers have demanded a DNA sample from Trump, saying it would match DNA from the dress Carroll says she was wearing when Trump attacked her.\n\nNow Carroll is arguing that the \"substantial professional harm\" of her complaint has come to include her position as the pen behind Elle's 26-year-old \"Ask E. Jean\" column . In a motion filed to New York state court on Tuesday, Carroll's attorney Roberta Kaplan included an email to Carroll from Elle managing editor Erin Hobday, sent in December, about a month after Carroll filed her suit against Trump.\n\nIn the email, Hobday references a phone conversation she had with Carroll, apparently earlier the same day. She goes on to write, \"It is with deep regret that I am writing to confirm that we are terminating your contract with Elle magazine and neither party will have any further obligation to one another.\" Hobday's email cites no cause for terminating Carroll's contract, saying only, \"We and your readers so appreciate your many years of work for the magazine, and the wonderful columns you contributed to our publication. We will miss you tremendously.\" Representatives from Elle did not respond to a request for comment from Vox.\n\n\"Our client filed this lawsuit to prove that Donald Trump lied about sexually assaulting her and to restore her credibility and reputation,\" Kaplan said in an emailed statement to Vox. \"From the very beginning, Trump has tried every tactic lawyers can think of to halt this case in its tracks and keep the truth from coming out.\"\n\n\"While I can no longer hold Donald Trump accountable for assaulting me more than 20 years ago,\" Carroll said when she filed her suit , \"I can hold him accountable for lying about it and I fully intend to do so.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nHow Kristi Noem and Karoline Leavitt offer two visions of conservative femininity.\n\nDJs, club owners, and patrons alike say there's way too much standing around.\n\nAstrology's enormous appeal, explained for believers and skeptics.\n\nThe surprising truth about milk is hiding in plain sight.\n\n﻿From Dunkin' deodorant to Sabrina Carpenter perfume, smelling good isn't enough - it's all about smelling edible.\n\nA star-studded film explains the hope and hype behind regenerative agriculture.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nE. Jean Carroll's oeuvre shows us how dramatically the way we talk about women's pain has changed.\n\nby Constance Grady\n\nBeloved advice columnist E. Jean Carroll 's new book asks a simple question: What Do We Need Men For? But 15 years ago, Carroll took the importance of men as a given. She even had a suggestion for women trying to meet more men: Why not go on a man-themed road trip?\n\n\"Grab a friend, load up the car, roll back the roof, throw a kiss to the local lads, and hit every burg between Clarence, New York, and Maxwell, California, named after a man,\" Carroll advises in her 2004 book Mr. Right, Right Now!: Man Catching Made Easy . \"If you do it right and stop by the baseball game in Gary, Indiana, and the Fireman's Breakfast in Hannibal, Missouri, you won't even make it to wherever you were heading. You'll be engaged to three different men before you hit Cecil, Pennsylvania.\"\n\nThirteen years after Mr. Right was published, Carroll embarked on the exact inverse of the journey she'd previously suggested. In 2017, she set out to travel across the country, determined to stop at every town with a woman's name between Tallulah, Louisiana, and Eden, Vermont.\n\nCarroll made the trip into a man cleanse. She listened only to music performed by women, wore only clothes designed by women, read only books written by women's and ate only at restaurants with women's names. (Or in a pinch, an Amy's frozen meal, in keeping with the theme.) And everywhere she went, she asked the locals a single question: What do we need men for?\n\nThat road trip is now the basis for What Do We Need Men For?: A Modest Proposal , released July 2. In the new book, Carroll posits that men are at the root of all of the problems she has been called on to solve for women in her role as Elle's long-standing advice columnist , and as an illustration of sorts of the problem of men, she offers readers a running tally of what she calls \"The Most Hideous Men of My Life List.\"\n\nReading What Do We Need Men For? alongside Mr. Right, Right Now is a study in contrasts. The two titles make clear just how dramatically the culture has changed in the past 15 years - and how much pain and anger was always lurking just below the surface of the giddy, gotta-catch-a-man discourse of the 2000s.\n\nMost of the press coverage of What Do We Need Men For? has been devoted to Carroll's Hideous Men List, on which the last man named is President Donald Trump . Carroll accuses Trump of having attacked her in the mid-1990s in a dressing room at New York's Bergdorf Goodman department store; the passage describing the alleged attack went viral when a version of it was excerpted in New York magazine earlier this month . Although Carroll doesn't use the word herself , the attack she describes meets the legal definition of rape. (Trump denied the allegation in a press release, saying \"she's not my type.\" )\n\nBut Trump is just one of many men on the Hideous Men List. (\"I assure you that I have been attacked by far, far better men than the president,\" Carroll says.) He's No. 20, and there are 19 more, ranging from children who Carroll says sexually assaulted her when she was very young to the ex-husband who she says choked her to a man who yells obscenities at her from his car to Carroll herself. (She puts herself on the list for flashing a male college professor during a lecture.)\n\nAll of this listing and cataloging of offenses sounds grim, but What Do We Need Men For? is in actuality a bit of a romp. It's a whimsical book, a book that approaches its high-concept road trip with tongue firmly in cheek. Carroll peppers her sentences liberally with bubbly asides to her readers, whom she always addresses as Ladies : \"I can tell you, Ladies, without reserve, that in normal circumstances, I would be riveted to the ponytail, as I am a great ponytail aficionado and can rank the greatest ponytails I've seen in my life,\" she confides, upon spotting a particularly exemplary high ponytail in Anita, Indiana.\n\nVox Rating:\n\n3.5 out of 5\n\nShe shows us photographs of her car, Miss Bingley (named for the mean girl in Pride and Prejudice ), which she has hand painted with polka dots and frogs. When a girl in Elnora, Indiana, tells Carroll that \" we [women] run things here,\" Carroll celebrates by filling her grocery cart \"to the brim with Amy's! Amy's! Amy's! Amy's! Amy's!\"\n\nBut What Do We Need Men For? is also sincerely horrified by all of the Hideous Men Carroll has experienced in her life, by all of the casual violence and disdain and misogyny that our society has allowed to flourish. The book is a romp mostly because it will be damned if it's going to let those Hideous Men keep it from romping, and when Carroll suggests that all men should be sent off to reeducation camps, her tone suggests that she's only half joking.\n\nAs for the answer to her titular question? Carroll hears plenty of possible responses. She ticks them off at the end of the book, and then dismisses them roundly: \"'Support!' 'Encouragement!' 'Companionship!' 'Comfort!' - all traits that can be supplied by a Maine coon cat.\"\n\n2004's Mr. Right, Right Now is also a romp, but it's a much more determined one. It's a romp with a mission: Carroll is going to tell her readers how to find a man.\n\nWhy? Well, because you want a man. Obviously. Otherwise why else would you ever have picked up this book?\n\nMr. Right, Right Now came out in the era of The Rules , with its fervent strictures against women ever calling a man first or suggesting that they were seeking a commitment. And although Carroll dismissed The Rules and its ilk with a wave of her hand as the work of \"charming dingbats\" and advised her readers firmly to ask men out on dates and call first if they wanted to, there was more than a hint of the Rules ethos in her philosophy.\n\nCarroll's most central piece of advice in Mr. Right is that the most important thing a woman can do to land a man is to stop caring about men - not because men are inessential or unimportant, but because men are in fact deeply important, and if they think a woman doesn't care about them they go wild for her! Just wild! Carroll calls this attitude the Man Catcher way.\n\n\"You know those scraggily gorgeous Swedish girls you see backpacking across Europe with their dusty Tevas and ice-blue sunglasses ... the girls who pull jugs of Chianti out of their rucksacks and, tossing back kilometers of blond hair, gaze up at the sun and smile?\" Carroll writes. \"Well ... that's the kind of nonchalant, casual brain wave a Man Catcher is on, Doll.\"\n\nIt's the kind of description that, had it been published in the 2010s, would have become the subject of a thousand think pieces about the Man Catcher as the new Cool Girl or French Girl , a description that falls neatly into the trap of nearly all romantic aspirations sold to women. The idea is to be beautiful, but not to let the labor that creates your beauty show; to be carefree, but never messy; to be rich enough to casually backpack across Europe with bottles of wine but not rich in a way that seems high maintenance or snobby. It's a fantasy built around the idea of being gazed at by straight men, and it disguises itself with platitudes about how what's really important is to be yourself and not care what anyone else thinks.\n\nBut buried underneath that fantasy is a whole separate concern; namely, how deeply tiring and uncomfortable it is to live out such a fantasy. The work required to do so is so involved that a full book is required to walk the reader through the process, and it's work you have to do less out of sincere desire than sheer obligation.\n\n\"Whatever else is going on, on the other stars and planets and Wiffle balls in the universe,\" writes Carroll, \" here on Planet Man Catcher, everything, whether obvious or oblique, is about females bewitching males and creating the next generation.\"\n\nIn Mr. Right, Right Now , everything in the world is about bewitching men! Queer people do not seem to exist! Children are mandatory! It's an exhausting idea. It's also one that Carroll clearly does not personally espouse.\n\nIn What Do We Need Men For? , Carroll writes that since her encounter with Trump in 1995 or 1996, \"I've never had sex with anybody ever again.\" Mr. Right, Right Now came out in 2004, nearly a decade later.\n\nRead in this light, Mr. Right, Right Now is not only exhausting, it is heartbreaking. All this effort, all this labor, all this single-minded focus on landing a man, and for what? What even is the point of it all?\n\nBut it's not until What Do We Need Men For? that Carroll articulates that question out loud. And what happened in between wasn't that she discovered new wells of pain or anguish that she hadn't known about before, pain that made men seem optional rather than obligatory. Carroll's Hideous Men entered the picture early and stuck around for a long time. She knew all about them and the pain they could cause when she wrote Mr. Right, Right Now .\n\nWhat changed was that the #MeToo movement declared that women did not have to ignore the pain that they had experienced. They could talk about it, they could commiserate over it, they could decide that it mattered to them and did not have to be shoved to the side as unimportant. Pain does not have to be ignored because obligation to catch a man overrules everything else.\n\nInstead, Carroll seems to have included, a woman can decide that she doesn't need a man in her life at all.

He could face major financial consequences.\n\nby Abdallah Fayyad\n\nDonald Trump has a lot of baggage, and unfortunately for him, it's not full of cash.\n\nLast month, a New York judge handed the former president a $454 million penalty , and a three-year ban from serving in a leadership position in any business in New York, for fraudulently inflating his net worth to lenders in order to receive more favorable loan agreements. And in January, a Manhattan jury ordered Trump to pay the writer E. Jean Carroll $83.3 million for defaming her after she accused him of raping her. (A separate jury in May 2023 had found Trump liable for sexually abusing Carroll in the 1990s.)\n\nThese two verdicts alone now have Trump on the hook for half a billion dollars - more than the amount of cash he claimed to have last April. And even though he plans to appeal the decisions, he still has to front the money while that process runs its course.\n\nSign up here for curated picks of the best Vox journalism to read, watch, and listen to every week, from our editors.\n\nThat's something he seems to be struggling with. In a recent court filing, his lawyers revealed that he has been unable to secure an appeal bond for the civil fraud case. And if he can't come up with enough collateral within the next six days, that could have major financial consequences for the former president: The New York attorney general could begin to seize his properties or even freeze his bank accounts.\n\nFor a well-connected billionaire, that might usually amount to nothing more than a temporary headache; after all, Trump could always liquidate some of his assets to cover his short-term obligations. But Trump isn't just one of the country's richest men , with an estimated net worth in the low billions; he's also running to serve a second term as president of the United States. And for any candidate for public office - let alone the presidency - being cash-strapped while owing such significant amounts of money could be a serious liability.\n\n\"It's pretty scary from an ethics perspective,\" said Virginia Canter, the chief ethics counsel at the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , a nonpartisan watchdog group that has chronicled Trump's abuses of power and filed lawsuits against him .\n\nYou don't have to look far to find the reasons why. Trump's first term was riddled with conflicts of interest , and that's in no small part because of his financial well-being (or lack thereof, depending on how you look at it). At the time that he tried to overturn the 2020 election , he was hundreds of millions of dollars in debt , largely stemming from loans to help rehabilitate his struggling businesses, and most of which would be coming due over the subsequent four years. Throughout his presidency, he refused to divest from his businesses, which made millions of dollars in revenue from taxpayers and continued to do work with other countries while he was in office - a practice he indicated he would repeat in a second term.\n\nThe fact that he has so many entanglements with big businesses and other nations leaves plenty of room for things to go awry. That's why a 2020 New York Times exposé uncovering his staggering debt during his first term wasn't just embarrassing for Trump, who has a tendency to claim he's richer than he actually is. It also raised fears about how his debt could implicate national security .\n\nAs the former head of the Justice Department's National Security Division told Time magazine in 2020 , \"For a person with access to U.S. classified information to be in massive financial debt is a counterintelligence risk because the debt-holder tends to have leverage over the person, and the leverage may be used to encourage actions, such as disclosure of information or influencing policy, that compromise U.S. national security.\"\n\nAs Trump campaigns for a second term, his personal finances are becoming increasingly relevant, especially now that he has to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in damages from the two civil lawsuits.\n\nAnd with his criminal cases still looming , things could get even worse for him. His debt \"makes him prime for corruption and really exploiting his office for his own personal gain,\" Canter said.\n\nTrump is known for many things, but a penchant for transparency is not one of them. He famously didn't release his tax returns when he was running for office, and because his company is not publicly traded, its finances are often opaque. As a result, his personal net worth and his business empire's earnings have always been shrouded in mystery.\n\nBut lawsuits, media reports, and his occasional, if narrow, public disclosures have made clear that Trump's often rosy descriptions of his wealth are far from accurate.\n\nIt's particularly unclear just how big his cash reserves are. In a deposition last year, Trump claimed to have $400 million in cash. That is a lot of money, but even if it was accurate, that's still not enough to cover his recent civil damages, which is likely why he is scrambling to secure a bond. (While he can, in some cases, dip into campaign cash to cover certain legal expenses , he generally can't use those funds to pay the damages he owes.)\n\nLawsuits aside, Trump also has plenty of debt on his hands. His financial disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission last year showed that he has at least $200 million in debt. And according to Forbes , his business owed roughly $1.3 billion in 2021.\n\nThat's not as dire as it sounds, especially because Trump has been steadily paying down the money he owed when he was leaving the White House three years ago. For example, he's paid off most of the $295 million he owed Deutsche Bank - a major source of his debt . But some of Trump's debts warrant more scrutiny .\n\nUltimately, it's impossible to know exactly how financially stable Trump is at any given moment. While some signs - like his ability to repay some of his debts or, say, him being a very wealthy man with very wealthy friends - indicate that he's doing just fine, there are still some warning signs for his campaign. Trump has faced a steady stream of hefty legal bills that stem from his four indictments, and that has drained much of his campaign cash. In fact, Trump's campaign has spent more than $50 million on legal fees in the past year alone . According to the Associated Press, 84 percent of spending from Trump's Save America political action committee has gone toward covering legal expenses.\n\nThose aren't exactly the typical spending habits of a normal campaign. But then again, Trump isn't a normal candidate.\n\nOne of the most explosive details in the New York Times's 2020 report on Trump's leaked tax returns is that despite being incredibly rich, there were years that he paid little to no federal income tax. In 2016, when he first won the presidency, he had paid a grand total of $750 in federal income taxes. That could help explain why Trump refused to release his tax returns in the first place, though doing so has been the norm for presidential candidates since the 1970s .\n\nAs serious as it is that Trump ( and other wealthy Americans ) can pay virtually no federal income taxes, there are even bigger consequences to his lack of transparency. Trump's web of business deals also provides ample opportunity for special interests and foreign governments to attempt to buy influence in his administration. Foreign governments, for example, spent millions of dollars at Trump's businesses during his presidency. A Chinese state-owned bank paid $7 million to rent space in Trump Tower in New York during the four years Trump was president. The company stopped renting out space when Trump left office .\n\nTo believe that the potential for that kind of revenue could not influence Trump's agenda, or even travel itinerary, would require an extraordinary level of trust in the former president - something most voters don't have .\n\nAfter all, how could a president fairly pursue a trade deal, for example, with a country he's doing personal business with? It's that kind of behavior that led to accusations that Trump violated the emoluments clauses of the US Constitution, which bar presidents from receiving money from foreign governments, as well as US states or the federal government outside their salary, in order to avoid undue influence.\n\nDuring his presidential term, Trump also had many hidden debts, and while a lot of his creditors were big financial institutions, some were unknown. According to Forbes, for example, Trump had a previously undisclosed loan from a foreign creditor when he became president, owing nearly $20 million to a South Korean company . While Trump paid off that loan within the first six months he was in office, it's just one example of how his potential conflicts of interest are tricky to keep track of.\n\nIn the runup to 2016, Trump misleadingly touted his wealth as a key advantage that furthered the public interest. He promised to self-fund his campaign, saying that he wouldn't be beholden to anybody, but he failed to keep that pledge .\n\nBut the problem for Trump isn't just his inability to self-fund his White House bids. The fact that he is constantly on the lookout for new loans or sources of income gives special interests a vehicle to curry favor with him. After his former lenders cut ties with him in the aftermath of the January 6 insurrection, for example, Axos Bank, whose CEO is a Republican donor, swooped in and loaned the former president some $225 million, helping Trump shore up his finances. (Trump has also reported new income from foreign entities, like a new deal he struck with a Saudi-based firm.)\n\nWhile Trump's lack of transparency might have served him well until now, shielding him from potential legal and political liabilities, it also could have far-reaching consequences should he win a second term this November.\n\n\"A lot of people thought Bernie Madoff was rich,\" Canter said. \"There are a lot of characters who portray themselves as rich, but when you look into the cookie jar, there's nothing there.\"\n\nUpdate, March 19, 11:55 am: This story was originally published on February 16 and has been updated to include news about Trump's struggle to secure a bond.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe Justice Department's institutional obligations do not change because Donald Trump is a horror show.\n\nby Ian Millhiser\n\nThe Biden administration just did something many of its supporters would've thought unthinkable: It backed the Trump administration in a court case involving a rape allegation against Donald Trump. Even the four Justice Department lawyers who filed a brief defending Trump Monday night appear painfully aware they are doing something unseemly.\n\n\"Then-President Trump's response to Ms. Carroll's serious allegations of sexual assault included statements that questioned her credibility in terms that were crude and disrespectful,\" the brief begins. It labels Trump's actions \"unnecessary and inappropriate,\" and at one point appears to concede that the allegations against Trump \"cast doubt\" on his \"fitness for office.\"\n\nAnd yet, the Biden Justice Department ultimately argues that Carroll v. Trump , a case arising out of a rape allegation against the former president, should be dismissed.\n\nE. Jean Carroll is a veteran advice columnist who is also one of many women who've credibly accused Trump of sexual assault . Trump denies the allegation, claiming he's never met Carroll (a 1987 picture shows them at a party together) and that he couldn't have raped her because she's \" not my type .\"\n\nThe Carroll lawsuit does not directly concern the alleged rape. Rather, Carroll sued Trump for defamation after the former president denied the allegation and then made a number of derogatory claims about Carroll, including a claim that Carroll merely accused him of sexual assault because she's \" trying to sell a new book .\"\n\nDOJ, for its part, takes no position on who is telling the truth in this dispute between Carroll and Trump. Rather the Justice Department argues the federal Westfall Act immunizes Trump from Carroll's lawsuit because Trump's denial of Carroll's allegations were made \"within the scope of his office or employment\" as president of the United States.\n\nIt's an argument that the Justice Department first made while Trump was still in office. Now it's decided to reaffirm that argument under President Joe Biden.\n\nDOJ's decision to side with Trump sparked widespread backlash, even from the White House itself. Though the White House said in a statement that it \"was not consulted by DOJ on the decision to file this brief or its contents\" and that it is \"not going to comment on this ongoing litigation,\" its statement also emphasized that \"President Biden and his team have utterly different standards from their predecessors for what qualify as acceptable statements.\"\n\nAnd yet, as fraught as this particular case is, it is not surprising that the Justice Department is making the arguments it is making on Trump's behalf.\n\nOne of the Justice Department's primary functions is to defend the institutional interests of the presidency , even when those interests conflict with some of DOJ's other obligations, such as its obligation to defend the constitutionality of federal laws. The Justice Department is also normally reluctant to change its position in a pending case, lest it give judges the impression that DOJ's arguments are motivated more by politics than by law.\n\nThe Carroll case presents profoundly important questions about when the president can be sued by a private citizen and what sort of suits are permitted against a president. Carroll has strong legal arguments on her side , but if she ultimately prevails, her victory could fundamentally weaken the presidency as an institution - and it could do so when future presidents are sued for conduct far less odious than Trump's.\n\nCarroll , in other words, forced the Justice Department to choose between its institutional responsibilities and avoiding the repugnance of being associated with Trump's behavior. It ultimately decided that its larger responsibilities must prevail.\n\nThe Department of Justice can be a frustrating institution. It's long operated under a web of informal rules and procedural norms that can operate in counterintuitive ways, often placing DOJ at odds with the interests of the sitting president or even much of the country.\n\nAs former Solicitor General Drew Days explained in a 1996 lecture , the Justice Department has traditionally recognized \"a general duty to defend congressional statutes against constitutional challenges,\" even when the president or the president's party opposes that statute.\n\nBut this duty to defend can operate in unexpected ways. In 2012, for example, former Solicitor General Paul Clement laid a brilliant trap for the Obama administration .\n\nThe Justice Department's decision to back Trump in Carroll is consistent with longstanding DOJ practice\n\nClement was the lead attorney challenging the Affordable Care Act in NFIB v. Sebelius (2012), the landmark Supreme Court decision that upheld most of that law. Much of this challenge focused on the law's since-repealed individual mandate, which required most Americans to either obtain health insurance or pay higher taxes. One of Clement's primary arguments was that, if Congress had the authority to enact such a provision, then there would be no limits to its power.\n\nThe reason this was such a clever trap is because the Justice Department isn't simply tasked with defending any one law. It must defend nearly all laws that are passed by Congress, including any hypothetical future laws that might be enacted someday. For this reason, Justice Department lawyers are extraordinarily reluctant to concede that any possible statute is unconstitutional . If DOJ concedes today that Congress could not pass a law requiring people to eat broccoli, that very concession could be used against DOJ years later.\n\nSo when Justice Anthony Kennedy asked a fairly obvious question of then-Solicitor General Donald Verrilli - could Verrilli \" identify for us some limits \" on Congress's ability to regulate? - Verrilli gave a halting and unsatisfying response that did not answer the question.\n\nEven when arguing the biggest case of his life, a case that was an existential threat to the Obama administration's signature legislative accomplishment, Verrilli placed the Justice Department's institutional norms above the interests of Obamacare, President Obama, and the millions of Americans who would benefit from that law.\n\nYet while the Justice Department has traditionally taken its duty to defend even hypothetical federal statutes so seriously that it's sometimes willing to pay an extraordinary price to uphold this duty, the duty is not absolute. In his 1996 lecture, Days lists two instances when it is appropriate for the Justice Department to refuse to defend a federal law.\n\nThe first is when the law is \"patently unconstitutional.\" The second, which has obvious relevance to the Carroll case, is when the law steps on the institutional prerogatives of the president.\n\n\"Solicitors general have always sided with the president in disputes over the constitutionality of congressional attempts to circumscribe presidential power,\" Days explains.\n\nThere's also a third institutional norm that weighs in favor of the Justice Department continuing to defend Trump. DOJ is the ultimate repeat player in federal litigation. It litigates thousands of cases every year. If Justice Department lawyers get a reputation for changing their arguments every time a new president comes into office, judges across the country could decide that those arguments are not credible, and DOJ risks losing many, many cases.\n\nFor this reason, the Justice Department is typically very reluctant to switch positions in a pending case, even after the presidency changes hands. The George W. Bush administration did not switch its position in a single Supreme Court case that had already been briefed by the Clinton administration, and the Obama administration took the same approach to Supreme Court cases briefed by the Bush administration.\n\nAdmittedly, the Trump Justice Department did not respect many of these norms , and that places Attorney General Merrick Garland and his subordinates in a tough spot. Biden's Justice Department has abandoned the Trump administration's position in several pending cases, including a case where Trump's DOJ asked the Supreme Court to strike down Obamacare.\n\nBut that does not change the fact that the DOJ risks its own credibility every time it changes its position in a pending case - including if it had switched its position in the Carroll case.\n\nThe Westfall Act protects federal employees from many lawsuits filed against them while they were \"acting within the scope of [their] office or employment.\" When the Westfall Act applies, the individual federal employee who was originally sued is dropped from the suit, and the United States is replaced as a defendant.\n\nUnder a doctrine known as \"sovereign immunity,\" the United States typically cannot be sued for money damages unless it consents to the suit , and the United States has not consented to being sued for defamation. So if the Westfall Act applies to Trump's case, the case will most likely be dismissed in its entirety.\n\nAt this stage in the Carroll litigation, courts are trying to resolve two questions: whether a sitting president counts as an \"employee of the government\" under the Westfall Act and whether Trump's statements about Carroll were made within the scope of that employment. (A federal district court ruled against Trump on both questions , but the case is now on appeal.)\n\nThe best argument that Trump did not count as an \"employee of the government\" relies on a federal statute that provides that the list of such employees \"includes\" all \"officers or employees of any federal agency.\" Though the president supervises most federal agencies, the White House is typically not regarded as an \"agency\" itself.\n\nBut this argument is not a slam-dunk. In Wilson v. Libby (2008), for example, a federal appeals court applied the Westfall Act to a high-ranking White House staffer - in that case, the vice president's chief of staff. If such a White House staffer can benefit from the Westfall Act, it's not at all clear why the president cannot.\n\nSimilarly, it may seem ridiculous to claim that Trump acted within the scope of his official duties when he denied a rape allegation made by a private citizen, who accused him of assaulting her long before he became president. But an appeals court's decision in Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) v. Ballenger (2006) cuts in Trump's favor.\n\nCass Ballenger was a member of Congress who told a reporter that he was separated from his wife because she did not enjoy life in Washington, DC. Yet, in doing so, Ballenger allegedly made defamatory comments against CAIR, a Muslim civil rights group, claiming CAIR was the \"fund-raising arm for Hezbollah.\"\n\nAfter CAIR sued Ballenger for defamation, the appeals court dismissed the case under the Westfall Act, reasoning that Ballenger's statement was made during the course of his official duties. \"A Member's ability to do his job as a legislator effectively is tied, as in this case, to the Member's relationship with the public and in particular his constituents and colleagues in the Congress,\" the Court reasoned. Thus, \"there was a clear nexus between the congressman answering a reporter's question about the congressman's personal life and the congressman's ability to carry out his representative responsibilities effectively.\"\n\nBoth Wilson and Ballenger were decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and the Carroll case is being heard by the Second Circuit. So the Second Circuit's judges are not bound by these two previous decisions. Nevertheless, the fact that the DC Circuit reached the conclusions that it did in these two cases suggests that, at the very least, Trump has plausible legal arguments on his side.\n\nMoreover, if the courts were to conclude that the Westfall Act does not apply to the presidency or that the scope of the president's official duties should be defined narrowly, that would have significant implications for the presidency as an institution.\n\nImagine, for example, if a cabal of QAnon followers decided to bombard President Biden with meritless lawsuits. If Biden cannot rely on the Westfall Act, he could need to hire private counsel and spend considerable time defending himself against these suits, potentially distracting him from his official duties.\n\nBy backing Trump in the Carroll case, in other words, DOJ can try to convince courts not to interpret the Westfall Act in a way that may damage the presidency.\n\nCarroll is not the first case in which the DOJ has sided with a president who was accused of sexual misconduct. In Clinton v. Jones (1997), Paula Jones sued President Bill Clinton for sexual harassment. Although Clinton was represented by private counsel, the Justice Department also sided with Clinton in this case, arguing that allowing private suits against a sitting president to move forward created \"serious risks for the institution of the presidency.\"\n\nAs in Carroll , the Justice Department believed it had a duty to defend the presidency as an institution. And so it backed Clinton in an attempt to protect the president from lawsuits that could distract him from his official duties.\n\nAll of which is a long way of saying that the Justice Department's decision to back Trump in Carroll is consistent with longstanding DOJ practice. The department's move in Carroll is very similar to its actions in the Jones case.\n\nTrump, however, may not want to take solace in this fact. Clinton lost his case in a unanimous Supreme Court decision .\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nCarroll says Trump sexually assaulted her, then lied about it to the American people.\n\nby Anna North\n\nLawyers for author and advice columnist E. Jean Carroll are demanding a DNA sample from President Trump.\n\nCarroll wrote last year in New York magazine that Trump had sexually assaulted her in the 1990s, forcibly penetrating her in the dressing room of a Manhattan department store. Trump said he had never met Carroll, despite a photograph published in the same piece that showed the two together, and argued that she was accusing him to boost sales of her book.\n\nIn response, Carroll sued Trump for defamation.\n\n\"Each of these statements was false,\" Carroll says in her lawsuit, filed in November 2019 with a New York court. \"Each of them was defamatory.\"\n\nCarroll argues that Trump's statements damaged her reputation , and is seeking a retraction as well as punitive damages. She also says she wants the president to face justice for his words, if not for his actions.\n\n\"While I can no longer hold Donald Trump accountable for assaulting me more than 20 years ago, I can hold him accountable for lying about it and I fully intend to do so,\" Carroll said in a statement to media at the time.\n\nAs part of the suit, Carroll is now seeking a DNA sample to compare with DNA from skin cells found on a dress that Carroll says she was wearing when the assault occurred. \"Unidentified male DNA on the dress could prove that Donald Trump not only knows who I am, but also that he violently assaulted me in a dressing room at Bergdorf Goodman and then defamed me by lying about it and impugning my character,\" Carroll said in a statement Thursday, according to the Associated Press .\n\nThe advice columnist is one of at least 22 women who say Trump has sexually harassed, assaulted, or otherwise violated them. Trump has denied all these allegations, calling all the women liars. And Carroll is not the first to push back by suing - Summer Zervos , a former Apprentice contestant, filed a defamation suit against Trump in 2017, also arguing that Trump had damaged her reputation by calling her a liar. Phone records released as part of that case showed that Trump called Zervos on his cellphone around the same time she says he sexually assaulted her, according to the Washington Post .\n\nInsulting the women who come forward with allegations against him has been part of Trump's playbook since before his presidency began. While Carroll's and Zervos's lawsuits may not be as high-profile as Trump's impeachment , these suits could have an impact on Trump's bid for reelection.\n\nCarroll's allegation against Trump first became public in June, when she wrote in New York magazine that in 1995 or 1996, Trump had assaulted her after they ran into each other at a Bergdorf Goodman department store. The encounter began playfully, she wrote, with Trump asking her to try on lingerie for him, and her telling him that maybe he should do so instead. But when she agreed to go with him to a dressing room, she said, that changed.\n\n\"He lunges at me, pushes me against the wall, hitting my head quite badly, and puts his mouth against my lips,\" Carroll wrote. Then, she wrote, he forcefully penetrated her with his penis before she was able to escape.\n\nTrump responded to the allegation by saying that Carroll was lying, and was just trying to sell copies of her upcoming book, from which the New York magazine story was an excerpt, as Jan Ransom reports at the New York Times . He also said he had never met Carroll, even though the New York magazine story included a photograph of the two of them together.\n\nAnd he said the advice columnist was \"not my type,\" a response he's employed several times to denigrate women who accuse him of sexual misconduct.\n\n\"Trump knew that these statements were false,\" Carroll says in her suit. \"At a bare minimum, he acted with reckless disregard for their truth or falsity.\"\n\nIn the suit, Carroll argues that Trump's comments caused her emotional pain, reputational damage, and \"substantial professional harm.\"\n\n\"Carroll filed this lawsuit to obtain redress for those injuries and to demonstrate that even a man as powerful as Trump can be held accountable under the law,\" the suit states.\n\nTrump responded by trying to get the lawsuit thrown out, arguing that New York courts did not have jurisdiction over the case because he does not live in the state. But in January, Justice Doris Ling-Cohan of the State Supreme Court in Manhattan ruled against him. According to the New York Times , the judge wrote that Trump had provided nothing, \"not even a tweet,\" in support of his motion, only a statement from his attorney that \"the President of the United States has resided in the White House for the past three years.\"\n\n\"We look forward to moving ahead in this case and proving that Donald Trump lied when he told the world that he did not rape our client and had not even met her,\" Carroll's lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, said in a statement in response to the decision.\n\nThen, on Thursday, Carroll's legal team sent Trump a notice to submit a DNA sample, the AP reports . Carroll wrote in New York magazine that she had worn a particular black coatdress on the day that Trump assaulted her, and that she hadn't worn it since. She put it back on, though, for a photo shoot to accompany the story.\n\nNow her lawyers have had the dress tested, finding skin cells from at least four people, at least one of them male. Several of the people were involved in the New York magazine photo shoot, the AP reports. But now Carroll's team wants to find out if any of the unidentified cells belong to Trump.\n\nThe president has not responded to the notice, according to the AP, though a court could potentially step in and compel him to provide DNA.\n\nAs the AP notes, this isn't the first time a president has faced questions about DNA on a dress. After President Clinton's DNA was found to match a sample on a dress belonging to former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, he admitted to having a relationship with her.\n\nClinton was eventually impeached over his statements about Lewinsky. Of course, Trump has already been impeached, and the inquiry has nothing to do with Carroll's suit. But that doesn't mean the suit won't have an impact.\n\nCarroll joins Summer Zervos in filing a defamation suit against Trump for insults levied after an allegation of sexual misconduct. Zervos says that Trump sexually assaulted her in 2007, kissing her without her consent, touching her breast, and pressing his genitals against her when she met him for a meal at the Beverly Hills Hotel. She spoke out publicly in 2016, after the Access Hollywood tape was released showing Trump bragging about his ability to grab women \"by the pussy.\"\n\nBut after Zervos and others came forward with allegations, Trump said \"every woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign.\" He also specifically denied Zervos's allegation, and his campaign released a statement by her cousin arguing that she had made it for personal gain.\n\nZervos sued Trump for defamation in 2017 and her case has been working its way through the courts ever since. In November, phone records released as part of the case showed that Trump called Zervos on his cellphone around the time she says he sexually assaulted her, the Post reported .\n\nTrump had previously said of Zervos that he \"never met her at a hotel or greeted her inappropriately a decade ago.\" But Trump's private calendar, also released in the case, shows that he checked into the Beverly Hills Hotel on December 21, 2007. His phone records also show a 3-minute phone call he made to Zervos that day.\n\nZervos's lawyer Mariann Wang told the Post in November the records corroborated Zervos's account \"with a degree of precision that [Zervos] could not have known were she not telling the truth about those interactions.\" Trump's legal team, meanwhile, released a statement saying that the fact that Trump \"may have had several phone calls with Ms. Zervos\" did not corroborate her allegations, and that Zervos \"was pestering Mr. Trump for a job.\"\n\nFor a time, some believed the discovery process in the Zervos case could lead to Trump's impeachment. But Zervos's suit and the more than 20 sexual misconduct allegations against Trump faded from public view somewhat amid the impeachment inquiry dealing with his alleged attempts to pressure Ukraine into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nCarroll's suit could bring those allegations back to the fore, at least to some degree. It also means Trump will potentially be tied up in not one but two lawsuits having to do with sexual misconduct allegations leading up to his 2020 reelection campaign.\n\nOf course, many women had already come forward with allegations against Trump by November 2016 - and yet he was voted into office anyway. It's not clear if things will be different this time.\n\nBut one thing is clear: Carroll is not going to let Americans forget about her story. \"I am filing this on behalf of every woman who has ever been harassed, assaulted, silenced, or spoken up only to be shamed, fired, ridiculed, and belittled,\" Carroll said in her November statement. \"No person in this country should be above the law - including the president.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nAn exhausting - if not exhaustive - timeline of J.K.

Jean Carroll suffered damages as a result of Trump's statements, and, if so, how much they award Carroll in both compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nFollowing Judge Lewis Kaplan's instructions to jury members, the jury has retired to deliberate.\n\nThe judge gave the parties 45 minutes to get lunch, so the court will not accept a jury note or a verdict until starting at 2:25 p.m. ET.\n\nIf there is no verdict by 4:30 p.m. ET, court will break for the day unless the jury signals a desire to stay later.\n\nFormer President Trump has made a post to his social media account attacking E. Jean Carroll and Judge Lewis Kaplan as proceedings continue in his damages defamations trial.\n\nTrump, who left the courtroom during the plaintiff's closing statements but returned for the defense closings, repeated his claim in the post that he had never met Carroll, and accused her and the judge of having political motives."

On Friday, he vowed to appeal the verdict.\n\nSitting feet from Trump in court for five days, Carroll described that her fears leading up to the trial about interacting with the former president washed away as soon as the trial began.\n\n\"It was like he was like nothing, like an emperor without clothes,\" Carroll said. \"All my terror leading up to it, and there he is. He's just something in a suit.\"\n\nTrump's in-person attendance at the trial - after missing last year's trial - briefly interrupted the proceedings, including when the former president muttered defamatory statements in earshot of the jury or walked out during the closing statement delivered by Carroll's lawyer Roberta Kaplan.\n\nKaplan, however, said Trump's behavior only validated the central thesis of her case that Trump is \"a bully who can't follow the rules.\"\n\n\"I definitely thought we got a few more million dollars immediately,\" Kaplan said about Trump walking out of court during her closing statement. \"I was like, well, that's worth about $10 million.\"\n\nA few hours after Trump stormed out of court, the jury delivered their unanimous verdict and $83.3 million award. As the jury left the courtroom, Carroll and her lawyers held hands, exchanging smiles with some of the jurors.\n\n\"It made me burst into tears because they met my eyes for the first time,\" Carroll said about seeing the jurors.\n\nKaplan added that she is confident they will be able to collect the $83.3 million, explaining that Trump could either pay a bond or deposit the money in full until he appeals.\n\n\"I'm pretty confident one way or the other. We might not get it right away. But one way or the other, he owns a lot of real estate. It can be sold. We will collect the judgment,\" Kaplan said.\n\nWhile Trump has not mentioned Carroll by name in the days since the verdict, Carroll said that she is not confident the former president will refrain from defaming her, and her lawyer said \"all options are on the table\" if Trump decides to defame her client again.\n\n\"If we have to bring another case, we'll bring another case. It's just going to be more money,\" Kaplan said.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Jean Carroll in the mid-1990s and awarded her $5 million in damages.\n\nAfter the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit determined last month that Trump failed to prove he deserved a new trial, lawyers for Trump on Tuesday requested an en banc hearing, in which the full court would hear the case rather than a select panel.\n\nA New York jury in 2023 awarding Carroll $5 million in damages after it found Trump liable for sexually abusing her in the dressing room of a Bergdorf Goodman department store in Manhattan in the mid-1990s, and for defaming her in 2022 when he denied the allegations.\n\nLast year, another jury ordered Trump to pay an additional $83 million in damages for his defamatory statements about Carroll.\n\nTrump argued the trial court in 2023 erred when it allowed two women to testify about Trump allegedly assaulting them, as well as permitting Carroll's lawyers to show the jury part of the now-infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape in which Trump boasted about grabbing women.\n\n\"To have any chance of persuading a jury, Carroll's implausible, unsubstantiated allegations had to be -- and repeatedly were -- propped up by the erroneous admission of highly inflammatory propensity evidence,\" wrote Trump's lawyers Todd Blanche, Emil Bove, and D.

Jean Carroll, a lawyer for Carroll told a federal appeals court in a filing Monday.\n\nAfter being awarded an $83.3 million defamation judgment from a jury last year, Carroll on Monday urged the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to uphold the judgment against Trump, after Trump asked the court to toss out the verdict because he had immunity as president.\n\n\"Dissatisfied with the outcome of the judicial process, Trump now asks this Court to set aside that jury verdict on the theory that he was actually immune from judicial review all along,\" Carroll's attorney Roberta Kaplan wrote in the filing.\n\nIn 2023, a jury held Trump liable for sexually abusing Carroll in a dressing room of a Manhattan department store in the 1990s, awarding Carroll $5 million in damages . A year later, a different jury in a separate trial ordered Trump to pay Carroll $83 million in damages for defaming her in a 2022 social media post in which he called her allegations \"a Hoax and a lie\" and said \"This woman is not my type!\"\n\nA federal appeals court upheld the $5 million judgment in December, and Trump's appeal of the $83 million judgement is ongoing.\n\nIn September, Trump attorney D. John Sauer -- who Trump nominated in November to serve as the new solicitor general -- told a federal appeals court that the $83 million judgment should be thrown out based on a flawed jury instruction, a series of \"highly prejudicial errors\" during the trial, and because presidential immunity protects Trump from liability for public statements made as president.\n\n\"Presidential immunity forecloses any liability here and requires the complete dismissal of all claims,\" Sauer wrote.\n\nIn her reply brief filed Monday, Kaplan pushed back against Trump's assertion of immunity, arguing that statements Trump made about Carroll as president would clearly fall outside of his official responsibilities.\n\n\"If there were ever a case where immunity does not shield a President's speech, this one is it,\" Kaplan wrote. \"Donald Trump was not speaking here about a governmental policy or a function of his responsibilities as President. He was defaming Carroll because of her revelation that many years before he assumed office, he sexually assaulted her.\"\n\nCarroll's attorney argued that the $83 million judgement was justified to deter Trump from further defamatory statements, a risk that Kaplan said the jury saw firsthand. Trump attended most days of the 2024 trial, criticizing Carroll as a liar from his seat in the courtroom and sparring with the judge who oversaw the case.\n\n\"Throughout the trial, the jury had a front-row seat to Trump's relentless campaign of malice, including his repeated defamation of Carroll at press conferences he held and in statements he posted on social media while the trial was ongoing,\" Kaplan wrote.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Jean Carroll, who successfully sued Donald Trump for defamation, objected Thursday to the former president's attempt to pause enforcement of the $83.3 million judgment the jury ordered him to pay.\n\nTrump had asked the court to stay enforcement of the monetary award while he appeals without requiring him to put cash in escrow or post bond.\n\nIf granted, that would leave Carroll with no assurance she would ever collect the money Trump now owes her, her attorneys said.\n\n\"The reasoning Trump offers in seeking this extraordinary relief boils down to nothing more than 'trust me,'\" Carroll's attorneys wrote in a filing Thursday.\n\n\"He doesn't offer any information about his finances or the nature and location of his assets,\" they said. \"He doesn't specify what percentage of his assets are liquid or explain how Carroll might go about collecting.\"\n\nCarroll's attorneys also noted that Trump failed to acknowledge the risks to his finances from the $454 million civil fraud judgment obtained by the New York attorney general.\n\nA lawyer for the former president had requested that Judge Lewis Kaplan temporarily delay the judgment in the defamation case or permit Trump to post a bond for \"an appropriate fraction\" of the total damages. A New York appellate court on Wednesday rejected Trump's attempt to do the same kind of thing in the civil fraud case , denying Trump's attempt to freeze the judgment .\n\nThe ruling in the civil fraud case means, for now, that the former president is required to post a bond for hundreds of millions of dollars in the coming weeks. Defense attorneys had said Trump was prepared to post a $100 million bond, arguing he had no way to secure a higher amount without selling off some of his real estate.\n\nEarlier this month, Kaplan declined to grant a stay of Trump's $83.3 million judgment in his defamation case and requested a written response from Carroll's lawyers.\n\n\"The Court declines to grant any stay, much less an unsecured stay, without first having afforded plaintiff a meaningful opportunity to be heard,\" Kaplan wrote in an order, setting a Thursday deadline for Carroll's response and a March 2 deadline for Trump's reply.\n\nCarroll has vowed to use the judgment money on \"something Donald Trump hates.\"\n\n\"If it'll cause him pain for me to give money to certain things, that's my intent,\" Carroll told George Stephanopoulos on \"Good Morning America\" in January, suggesting she would create a \"fund for the women who have been sexually assaulted by Donald Trump.\"\n\nA jury had awarded Carroll over $83 million in damages to compensate her for two defamatory statements made by the former president in 2019 after she alleged Trump sexually assaulted her in 1996.

Jean Carroll case\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  December 30, 2024 / 9:37 PM EST / CBS News\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump is not entitled to a new trial in the case in which a jury found him liable for sexual abuse and defamation of the writer E. Jean Carroll, a federal appeals court ruled Monday.\n\nThe court roundly rejected claims by Trump and his lawyers that the judge who presided over the trial made a series of decisions that harmed Trump's standing with the jury.\n\nTrump asked for a new trial after a jury unanimously concluded in May 2023 that a preponderance of evidence supported Carroll's claim that Trump sexually abused her during a mid-1990s encounter in a New York City department store. Monday's 77-page decision rejected complaints made repeatedly by Trump before, during and after the nine-day trial.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, based in New York, found that District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan did not err in allowing the testimonies of two women who made claims on the stand of alleged encounters with Trump that bore similarities to Carroll's.\n\n\"With his shoulder and the whole weight of his body against her, Mr. Trump held her against the wall, kissed her, pulled down her tights, and stuck his fingers into her vagina - until Ms. Carroll managed to get a knee up and push him back off of her,\" the appeals court wrote, summarizing evidence and testimony of Carroll's claim.\n\nCarroll said she and Trump bumped into each other by chance while shopping at Bergdorf Goodman. What started as a pleasant walk through the store - her helping him choose a present for another woman, as they engaged in jocular banter - turned violent in a changing room, she alleged.\n\nTrump has vehemently denied Carroll's allegations, and vowed to appeal the case as far as the Supreme Court. He has also appealed a January 2024 trial ruling that found him liable for more defamation against Carroll. That appeal is still pending. The juries in the two cases combined awarded Carroll more than $88 million .\n\nAttorneys for Trump did not immediately reply to a request for comment. A spokesman for Trump, Steven Cheung, said he plans to appeal, and said Americans who voted for Trump demand \"a swift dismissal of all the Witch Hunts.\"\n\nCarroll's attorney, Roberta Kaplan, thanked the appeals court for \"its careful consideration of the parties' arguments,\" in a statement to CBS News.\n\n\"Both E. Jean Carroll and I are gratified by today's decision,\" said Roberta Kaplan, who is not related to the judge.\n\nAmong Trump's complaints about the trial was that the jurors were shown an outtake from \" Access Hollywood ,\" in which Trump could be heard describing grabbing women's genitals. The clip was widely shared during the 2016 presidential race. The court found that Lewis Kaplan did not err in allowing that video to be shown.\n\nCarroll's federal civil lawsuit made claims of rape, sexual abuse and defamation as defined by New York's penal code. The jury found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation, but rejected the rape claim, which under New York's statute requires proof of forceful penetration involving the attacker's genitals.\n\nThe judge later wrote that New York's penal code is out of touch with federal standards and a \"modern\" understanding of what rape is. In post-trial rulings he wrote that Carroll's assertion that Trump raped her was \"substantially true.\"\n\n\"The definition of rape in the New York Penal Law is far narrower than the meaning of 'rape' in common modern parlance, its definition in some dictionaries, in some federal and state criminal statutes, and elsewhere,\" Lewis Kaplan wrote in July 2023\n\nThe jury \"implicitly found Mr. Trump did in fact digitally rape Ms. Carroll,\" Lewis Kaplan wrote.\n\nGraham Kates is an investigative reporter covering criminal justice, privacy issues and information security for CBS News Digital.

      "text": "Trump posts $91 million bond to appeal E. Jean Carroll defamation verdict\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  March 8, 2024 / 4:10 PM EST / CBS News\n\nFormer President Donald Trump deposited a bond of more than $91 million on Friday to appeal the $83 million judgment against him in the case brought by E. Jean Carroll , a writer he defamed after she accused him of sexual abuse, according to a court filing.\n\nTrump's attorneys notified the federal court in Manhattan that he had posted a bond of $91,630,000, coinciding with a notice that he had appealed the ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit. The bond payment is equal to 110% of the judgment against him, representing the amount he was required to provide to stay enforcement of the judgment while he appeals.\n\nThe Jan. 26 decision was the second time in less than a year that a jury had ruled in favor of Carroll, who accused Trump of attacking her in a New York department store in the 1990s. In May 2023, a different federal jury awarded Carroll an additional $5 million in damages, finding Trump liable for sexual abuse and a separate defamation claim.\n\nJurors in both cases unanimously reached their verdicts within hours.\n\nThe verdict in Carroll's second trial came just weeks before a New York judge ordered Trump to pay more than $450 million for fraud . The combined decisions plunged the Republican candidate for president into severe financial turmoil.\n\nRoberta Kaplan, an attorney for Carroll, declined to comment on Trump's appeal.\n\nThe move came one day after U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan - who is overseeing the case, and is not related to Carroll's attorney - declined to issue a temporary stay that would have paused the judgment without requiring Trump to post the bond. A spokesperson for Trump's campaign criticized that decision in a statement to CBS News on Friday, calling it \"a continuation of a totally lawless witch hunt.\"\n\n\"President Trump filed a timely motion to stay the ridiculous judgment, and many courts, including the Second Circuit, recognize the importance of temporary administrative stays while such motions are considered,\" spokesperson Steven Cheung said. \"We look forward to continuing to litigate the case and to complete vindication of the truth.\"\n\nTrump attended nearly all of the January trial, and briefly testified in his own defense. He left the courthouse half an hour before the jury awarded Carroll $18.3 million in compensatory damages, and $65 million in punitive damages.\n\nRepeatedly referencing the May 2023 verdict, which had failed to prevent Trump from repeating statements similar to those deemed defamatory, Carroll's attorneys asked the jury throughout the trial to fine Trump enough to \"make him stop.\"\n\nThe effort appears to have worked so far.\n\nTrump, who had frequently called Carroll a \"liar\" and the cases against him a \"hoax,\" has not repeated any of the claims that led to his dual defamation defeats.\n\nCarroll, a well-known advice columnist, wrote in a 2019 book that Trump sexually assaulted her during a chance encounter in New York's high-end Bergdorf Goodman department store in 1995 or 1996. Trump, who was president at the time, immediately denied the allegations, calling Carroll a \"whack job\" and claiming he had never met her. He would go on to repeat similar denials in public appearances, social media posts and even in court, a pattern cited by Carroll's attorneys during the trial.\n\nCarroll's legal team highlighted a long series of posts, text messages and emails threatening violence and rape against Carroll after Trump's denials. They said she was inundated with hateful messages that increased whenever Trump launched public attacks, and receded during interim periods.\n\nTrump's attorney, Alina Habba, focused on what she called a \"five-hour gap\" in 2019 between when Carroll's allegations first surfaced and Trump's first defamatory statement. Habba said Carroll hadn't proved \"causation\" between Trump's comment and the ensuing harassment Carroll received.\n\nHabba repeated that argument in a recent motion asking the judge in the case to disregard the jury's verdict, saying the findings were \"based on 'confusion, speculation or prejudice' as opposed to the 'evidence presented at trial.'\"\n\nHabba and the judge clashed frequently during the trial, frequently engaging in heated disagreements over courtroom procedures and rulings. Habba said that dynamic was unfair to her client, and reiterated that criticism in a statement Friday.\n\n\"Due to the numerous prejudicial errors made at the lower level, we are highly confident that the Second Circuit will overturn this egregious judgment,\" Habba said.\n\nGraham Kates is an investigative reporter covering criminal justice, privacy issues and information security for CBS News Digital.

      "text": "Federal judge upholds verdict in E. Jean Carroll case and denies Trump's motion for a new trial\n\nFollow:\n\nA federal judge on Thursday upheld the verdict and award in E. Jean Carroll's defamation case against former President Donald Trump and denied Trump's motion for a new trial.\n\nJudge Lewis Kaplan, in a written opinion, said Trump's legal arguments are without merit. The judge also found that the punitive damages the jury awarded to Carroll \"passes constitutional muster.\"\n\nCarroll's attorney Roberta Kaplan said in a statement that her legal team is \"pleased with though not surprised by the Court's decision.\"\n\n\"As the Court explained, it was entirely reasonable for the jury to award E. Jean Carroll $83 million in damages given Donald Trump's continued defamation of Ms. Carroll during the trial itself, as well as his conduct in the courtroom where his 'hatred and disdain (were) on full display,'\" Kaplan said.\n\nCarroll, a former magazine columnist, alleged Trump raped her in a Bergdorf Goodman department store in the mid-1990s and then defamed her when he denied her claim. In a separate case, a jury last year found Trump liable for the sexual assault.\n\nThe second case stems from remarks Trump had made denying Carroll's allegations in 2019. He was found liable for defamation last year, and a jury earlier this year ordered him to pay $83.3 million in punitive and compensatory damages.\n\nTrump's legal team had argued that the damages awarded to Carroll in the defamation case were excessive. Kaplan dismissed that argument in his opinion released Thursday.\n\n\"Mr. Trump's malicious and unceasing attacks on Ms. Carroll were disseminated to more than 100 million people,\" Kaplan wrote. \"They included public threats and personal attacks, and they endangered Ms. Carroll's health and safety.\"\n\n\"The jury,\" Kaplan added, \"was entitled to conclude that Mr. Trump derailed the career, reputation, and emotional well-being of one of America's most successful and prominent advice columnists and authors.\"\n\nTrump has maintained that he did not sexually assault Carroll, and in 2019, said that Carroll was not his \"type.\" Those denials formed the basis of the defamation lawsuit.\n\nHe sat in court for portions of the defamation trial, earning rebukes from the judge after he was heard making comments during Carroll's testimony. As Carroll's lawyers delivered their closing arguments, Trump abruptly and dramatically stood up and left the courtroom.\n\nKaplan referenced that episode in his opinion: \"Mere minutes after (Carroll's) counsel began her closing argument, Mr. Trump conspicuously stood and walked out of the courtroom for no apparent reason save to evidence his disapproval.\"\n\nAside from the eye-popping monetary amount, the judgment brought another point into stark clarity: A jury of regular citizens - not the politicians or their appointees that Trump constantly claims mistreat him - held him accountable.\n\nThe judgment comes as Trump sits in another courtroom - this time, a criminal one - awaiting another jury of regular New Yorkers to decide his fate on charges that he falsified business records to cover up an affair ahead of the 2016 election.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

Jean Carroll, the former magazine columnist to whom a jury awarded $83.3 million in damages last week as part of a defamation trial against Donald Trump, said on CNN Monday that the court proceedings were little more than a \"campaign stop\" for the former president.\n\n\"The courtroom was not a courtroom to him, it was a campaign stop. That was clear,\" Carroll said on \"CNN This Morning.\"\n\n\"He's using me to win voters. Sexual assault. A man found liable for sexual assault is using the woman he sexually assaulted to get votes.\"\n\nCarroll has alleged Trump raped her in a department store in the mid-1990s and then defamed her when he denied her claim.

He was zero,\" Carroll told CNN's Poppy Harlow and Phil Mattingly.\n\n\"He's an emperor without clothes. It's like looking at nothing,\" continued Carroll, who said she made eye contact with Trump \"many times.\"\n\nRegarding the enormous sum of money awarded to her, Carroll said, \"We're inspired to not waste a penny of this, and we have some good ideas that we're working on.\"\n\n\"One of the things we could do - seeing as how he's very instrumental in taking away women's rights over their bodies across the United States - maybe we could think about how we can restore women their rights,\" she added.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social Friday afternoon, Trump called the verdict \"absolutely ridiculous\" and vowed to appeal.\n\nFriday's verdict comes ahead of a judge's expected decision soon in Trump's civil fraud trial that could threaten the former president's business empire, along with the four criminal indictments that are awaiting trial and a US Supreme Court hearing on whether the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination can appear on the ballot.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

Scroll through the posts below to see how the day played out.\n\nThere will be no court Tuesday in E. Jean Carroll's civil defamation trial against Donald Trump, according to court official Joseph Pecorino.\n\nCourt is adjourned until Wednesday at 9:30 a.m. ET.\n\nThe trial was adjourned Monday morning after Judge Lewis Kaplan sent home a sick juror.\n\nIf you're just joining us, court has been cancelled today in the civil defamation trial involving E. Jean Carroll and Donald Trump after the judge overseeing the case sent home a sick juror.\n\nBoth E. Jean Carroll and Donald Trump were present in court, with Trump hoping to testify.\n\nHere's a brief timeline of how the morning went:\n\nJudge Lewis Kaplan announced in court Monday that he will reject former President Donald Trump's latest motion for a mistrial .\n\nTrump's attorney Alina Habba asked for a mistrial last week in the middle of a cross-examination of E. Jean Carroll when Carroll testified that she had deleted some emails containing threats to her safety. It was promptly rejected by the judge.\n\nIn a letter to Kaplan on Friday, Habba reiterated the request and said that without the records, there is no way to prove when the threats occurred.\n\nTrump has argued that Carroll immediately began receiving negative messages after an excerpt of Carroll's book containing the assault allegations was published on New York magazine's website - hours before Trump issued his first statement. His attorneys argued Trump shouldn't be held responsible for what other people did.\n\nKaplan on Monday denied the request and said he would put a written ruling on the docket.\n\nTrump attorney Alina Habba told the judge that the former president plans to testify in the trial, but he cannot be in court on Tuesday because of the New Hampshire primary.\n\nShe asked that he testify Wednesday.\n\n\"So tomorrow is the New Hampshire primary and he needs to be in New Hampshire,\" Habba said. \"He was planning to testify - clearly, he flew in last night to be here. I would just need his testimony to be Wednesday in light of the news about the juror today.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to decide right now,\" Judge Lewis Kaplan responded.\n\nCourt has been cancelled today in the civil defamation trial involving E. Jean Carroll and Donald Trump after the judge overseeing the case sent home a sick juror.\n\nBoth Trump and Carroll were in the courtroom when the adjournment was announced by Judge Lewis Kaplan. There are nine jurors in the trial - seven men, two women - but no alternates.\n\nKaplan also confirmed that Alina Habba and Michael Madaio tested negative for Covid-19 in court this morning. They took Covid tests because Habba said she had dinner with her parents three days ago and now they have Covid. Habba said she had a fever and isn't feeling well, though she has not tested positive.\n\nHabba did not appear to be wearing a mask. Trump was sitting next to her in the courtroom.\n\nJudge Kaplan offered to proceed with eight jurors which Carroll's team said would be fine, but Habba asked for an adjournment.\n\nKaplan brought in the eight jurors now to instruct them and court is dismissed for the day.\n\nIt was not just Donald Trump - his lawyers also got into several disputes with Judge Lewis Kaplan, including when they asked Kaplan to recuse himself after the exchange about possibly removing the former president from the courtroom.\n\nTrump attorney Michael Madaio cited a \"general hostility\" toward Trump and his lawyers.\n\n\"Denied,\" Kaplan said in response.\n\nOn Wednesday, Kaplan told Alina Habba to sit down after she tried yet again to get Kaplan to postpone the trial on Thursday so Trump could attend his mother-in-law's funeral.\n\n\"I will hear no further argument on it. None. Do you understand that word? None. Please sit down,\" Kaplan said.\n\n\"I don't like to be spoken to that way,\" Habba responded.\n\nWhen Habba began her cross-examination of Carroll, the judge quickly interjected, admonishing the lawyer for raising an excerpt of Carroll's 2022 deposition when he did not have a copy or know what lines Habba wanted to read from.\n\n\"Now look, Ms. Habba,\" Kaplan said as Habba began to read from the transcript. \"We're going to do it my way in this courtroom, and that's all there is to it.\"\n\nAfter Habba began reading from harassing messages Carroll received in 2019, before the messages had been entered into evidence, Kaplan called for a trial recess. \"You should refresh your memory about how it is you get a document into evidence,\" Kaplan said to her after the jury had left the courtroom.\n\nRemember: Kaplan showed little patience for procedural missteps on either side, telling Carroll's attorney at one point they could not see exhibits ahead of time to scan for potential redactions. \"When the document is authenticated and offered that's when you say objection and that's when we deal with it,\" Kaplan said.\n\nDonald Trump's motorcade has now arrived at the Manhattan federal court where the civil defamation trial to determine how much in damages, if any, he owes former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll, is expected to get underway at 9:30 a.m. ET.\n\nThe former president has said publicly he wants to take the stand in this case, but it is not clear if he will testify.\n\nE. Jean Carroll has arrived to a Manhattan federal courthouse where her attorneys will continue to present their case in a civil trial to determine what damages, if any, former President Donald Trump owes her for his 2019 defamatory statements about her sex assault allegations.\n\nA small crowd of supporters shouted in part \"we've got your back E. Jean\" as she entered.\n\nCarroll turned at one point to wave and acknowledge them.\n\nShe arrived alongside her attorney Roberta Kaplan.\n\nYou're going to see a lot of legal terms on our page today, so here's a quick explainer of the key terms:\n\nFormer magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll is seeking over $10 million in damages from Donald Trump over statements he made when he was president in 2019.\n\nBut, to be successful she has to prove that she is entitled to damages by a preponderance of the evidence , a standard used in civil cases that's lower than what's required in criminal trials.\n\nThe judge presiding over the case, Lewis Kaplan, explained what preponderance of the evidence meant to the jury after it was sworn in last week.\n\n\"What a preponderance of the evidence means is that the plaintiff has to produce evidence which, considered in light of all of the facts, leads you to believe that what the plaintiff claims is more likely correct or true than not,\" Kaplan said. \"To put it differently, if you were to put the plaintiff's and the defendant's evidence on opposite sides of metaphorical scales, the plaintiff has the burden to make the scales tip, even if only slightly, in the plaintiff's favor,\" the judge continued.\n\nFor Carroll, that means she has to convince the jury that Trump's statements after she went public with her allegations that he sexually assaulted her shattered her reputation and led to the onslaught of threatening messages.\n\nTrump is expected to be in court when the trial resumes Monday.\n\nDonald Trump's motorcade has departed Trump Tower and is now en route to Manhattan federal court where he will voluntarily attend a civil trial to decide how much money in damages, if any, the former president must pay E. Jean Carroll for his 2019 defamatory statements about her sexual assault allegations.\n\nHe is expected back in New Hampshire this evening for a campaign rally on the eve of the primary.\n\nThis will be Trump's third to the courtroom visit during this trial. E Jean. Carroll's team is still presenting their case.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump renewed his motion for a mistrial of the defamation case brought by former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll after she acknowledged deleting some emails.\n\nTrump's attorney Alina Habba asked for a mistrial last week in the middle of a cross-examination of Carroll when Carroll testified that she had deleted some emails containing threats to her safety. It was promptly rejected by the judge.\n\nIn a letter to Judge Lewis Kaplan on Friday, Habba reiterated the request and said without the records there is no way to prove when the threats occurred. Trump has argued that Carroll immediately began receiving negative messages after an excerpt of Carroll's book containing the assault allegations was published on New York magazine's website - hours before Trump issued his first statement. His attorneys argued Trump shouldn't be held responsible for what other people did.\n\nHabba said if the judge does not grant her request for a mistrial, he should not allow Carroll to seek damages based on death threats.\n\n\"Plaintiff's entire claim for emotional harm is undermined because it would show that Plaintiff was receiving death threats before President Trump ever spoke about her,\" Habba wrote.\n\nHabba is also requesting the judge instruct the jury that since Carroll deleted emails they should \"presume that the electronic mail messages were unfavorable\" and therefore not supportive to Carroll's claims.\n\nDonald Trump clashed in court last week with yet another judge overseeing one of his trials, after the judge in his civil defamation case threatened to remove the former president for making comments that could be overheard by the jury while his accuser was testifying.\n\nE. Jean Carroll's attorney Shawn Crowley complained about Trump's audible commentary, and Judge Lewis Kaplan he told Trump to \"take special care\" to keep his voice down while speaking to his attorneys so he could not be heard by the jury.\n\nCrowley said again Trump could still be heard - saying things like, \"It is a witch hunt\" and \"it really is a con job.\"\n\nKaplan responded that Trump \"has the right to be present here\" but said \"that right can be forfeited and it can be forfeited if he is disruptive,\" noting he has the right to throw him out if that happens. Trump threw his hands up in response, and Kaplan said, \"I understand you're probably eager for me to do that.\"\n\nReporters in the courtroom heard Trump say, \"I would love it.\"\n\nWhy does it matter: The exchange with Kaplan was merely the latest in a string of Trump's in-court fights during two civil trials in New York over the past several months, episodes that offer a preview of what's to come if any of the former president's criminal trials are held this year as he runs for president.\n\nThe trial that will decide how much money in damages Donald Trump must pay E. Jean Carroll resumes later this morning.\n\nCarroll in her testimony last week recounted how Trump's 2019 statements about her led to threatening messages and upended her sense of safety.\n\nThe attacks started \"instantaneously,\" Carroll said as she described several safety precautions she's taken out of fear due to the threatening messages, including hiring security at both trials and keeping a gun at her bedside. \"I bought bullets for the gun I had inherited from my father,\" Carroll said.\n\nCarroll's voice broke as she described another violent message she received after the trial last year.\n\n\"When a woman sees the words, we can't help but think of the image. And so, he wants me to stick a gun in my mouth and pull the trigger,\" she said, reading the email. \"And I imagine that many of us now can picture that.\"\n\nShe said she was attacked on Twitter, Facebook, on new blogs and messages. \"As I said, it was a new world. I had left the world of facts, a lovely world, and I was living in a new universe,\" she said.\n\nDuring cross-examination, Carroll testified there were about five hours between when her 2019 story published and when Trump made a statement denying the allegations, in response to questioning from Trump's attorney Alina Habba. Carroll confirmed she received harassing social media messages before Trump made any statements.\n\nHabba also pressed Carroll about deleting or removing the threatening messages when she received them, making a motion for a mistrial because of the deleted messages, which was promptly denied by Kaplan. Habba argued in her opening statement last week that Carroll's story fueled the harassment, not Trump's denials.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

      "text": "Trump is liable in the second E. Jean Carroll defamation case, judge rules; January trial will determine damages\n\nA federal judge ruled that the jury hearing E. Jean Carroll's defamation lawsuit will only need to decide how much money Donald Trump will have to pay her, after the judge found the former president was liable for making defamatory statements.\n\nThe finding is a significant blow to Trump, who is facing numerous criminal indictments and civil lawsuits - many of them coming to a head as he embarks on a presidential campaign.\n\nJudge Lewis Kaplan said that a federal jury's verdict earlier this year against Trump will carry over to the defamation case set to go to trial in January involving statements Trump made in 2019 about Carroll's sexual assault allegations.\n\nCarroll, a former magazine columnist, alleged Trump raped her in a Bergdorf Goodman department store in the mid-1990s and then defamed her when he denied her claim.\n\nIn May after a two-week trial, a jury found Trump sexually abused Carroll and defamed her when he said in 2022 that he didn't rape her, didn't know her, and that she wasn't his \"type.\"\n\nIn that case, the jury awarded Carroll $5 million in damages.\n\n\"The truth or falsity of Mr Trump's 2019 statements therefore depends - like the truth or falsity of his 2022 statement - on whether Ms Carroll lied about Mr Trump sexually assaulting her,\" the judge ruled Wednesday. \"The jury's finding that she did not therefore is binding in this case and precludes Mr Trump from contesting the falsity of his 2019 statements.\"\n\nKaplan ruled the trial set for January 15 will be limited to damages.\n\nAlthough her initial lawsuit was filed in 2019, the judge previously allowed Carroll to include comments Trump made at a CNN town hall earlier this year.\n\nOn Wednesday, Kaplan also rejected Trump's argument that any future damages be capped, meaning the previous award shouldn't be a factor for the jury. Carroll is seeking more than $10 million in damages.\n\nTrump has denied any wrongdoing. He has appealed the jury's verdict and all rulings against him.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

      "text": "E. Jean Carroll just won a huge victory in her sexual abuse and defamation case against Trump. She still might not get paid anytime soon.\n\nA federal appeals court on Monday upheld a verdict finding Donald Trump liable for sexually abusing and defaming writer E. Jean Carroll , starting a 30-day clock for her to receive the $5 million jury award, plus interest.\n\nIn an exhaustive, 77-page opinion, the US Second Circuit Court of Appeals rejected all of the legal arguments brought by Trump in seeking to overturn the May 2023 trial verdict.\n\nBut Carroll, now 81 years old, shouldn't hold her breath. A spokesperson for Trump told Business Insider the president-elect plans to keep appealing the verdict.\n\nThe appeal could keep the cash frozen well into next year, at least, legal experts told BI.\n\nIn the year and a half since the jury verdict, the $5 million Trump owes Carroll - plus $500,000 to cover interest - has been sitting in an interest-bearing bank account controlled by the federal trial court.\n\nIf Trump does not file a further appeal in the next 30 days, the court will automatically transfer that $5.5 million and any further interest directly to Carroll and her attorneys, said Nick Newton, a former president of the National Association of Surety Bond Producers.\n\n\"Both E. Jean Carroll and I are gratified by today's decision,\" Carroll's attorney Roberta Kaplan told Business Insider in a statement. \"We thank the Second Circuit for its careful consideration of the parties' arguments.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Trump called Carroll's claims a \"hoax\" and said he would continue to appeal.\n\n\"The American People have re-elected President Trump with an overwhelming mandate, and they demand an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and a swift dismissal of all of the Witch Hunts, including the Democrat-funded Carroll Hoax, which will continue to be appealed,\" Steven Cheung told BI in an email. \"We look forward to uniting our country in the new administration as President Trump makes America great again.\"\n\nTrump's options for further appeals are two-fold, according to Michel Paradis, who teaches constitutional law at Columbia Law School. The funds would remain frozen until the appeals are exhausted, meaning that Carroll would need to wait longer before getting any of the jury's awards.\n\nThe president-elect can first seek an en banc review, meaning a review of Monday's three-judge decision by all 13 active judges on the Second Circuit, plus Senior Judge Denny Chin, Paradis said.\n\nAfter that option, Trump could take his appeal to the US Supreme Court.\n\nWinning - or even being considered - for en banc is a high bar, Paradis said. Trump would have to explain to the full Second Circuit why the issues are so important, and the three-judge panel's decision is so profoundly wrong that it needs to be overturned.\n\n\"In a case like this, it could take a few months\" for the full panel to consider Trump's petition and any response they allow from Carroll's side, and then vote on whether to hear the case, he said.\n\n\"In this appeal, there were only basic legal questions in dispute, meaning how the law was applied, and the three-judge panel's review was limited to looking for an abuse of discretion,\" Paridis said.\n\nTrump will seek review from the US Supreme Court next, Paradis predicted. The president-elect selected three of the nine justices in his first term. He could place more justices on the bench by the time oral arguments would take place.\n\nThe president-elect would first have to ask the high court to hear his appeal, and that process could keep the Carroll judgment frozen well into next year, he said.\n\n\"SCOTUS would likely not decide to hear the case until the end of next September at the earliest,\" he said.\n\nIt's not clear who will be on Trump's legal team if he continues to appeal the case.\n\nJohn Sauer, who presented the oral argument before the Second Circuit, was designated by Trump to serve as the Justice Department Solicitor General in his next presidential term. Other attorneys who worked on the case, including Todd Blanche, Emil Bove, and Alina Habba, are set to serve other posts in the Justice Department or the White House.\n\nMonday's decision is for one of two separate civil lawsuits E. Jean Carroll brought against Trump.\n\nThe second trial took place in January 2024, and concerned additional defamation damages over Trump disparaging Carroll and calling her a liar.\n\nThe jury in that case awarded Carroll $83.3 million . Trump is appealing that case, too, with a process that is running on a separate track.\n\nMonday's appellate court decision largely focused on whether it was appropriate for US District Judge Lewis Kaplan, the trial judge, to allow certain types of evidence to be seen by the jurors who held Trump liable for sexually abusing Carroll.\n\nTrump's lawyers argued Kaplan should not have shown jurors the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, where Trump bragged about grabbing women by the genitals.\n\n\"The jury could have reasonably concluded from those statements that, in the past, Mr. Trump had kissed women without their consent and then proceeded to touch their genitalia,\" they wrote.\n\nTrump's attorneys had also argued it was inappropriate to allow testimony from Natasha Stoynoff and Jessica Leeds, two other women who had accused Trump of sexual misconduct. The Second Circuit judges agreed with Kaplan, ruling that their stories helped establish a pattern of conduct from Trump.\n\n\"The jury could reasonably infer from Ms. Stoynoff's testimony and the Access Hollywood tape that Mr. Trump engaged in similar conduct with other women - a pattern of abrupt, nonconsensual, and physical advances on women he barely knew,\" the judges wrote.\n\nIf you are a survivor of sexual assault, you can call the National Sexual Assault Hotline (1-800-656-4673) or visit its website to receive confidential support.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Trump's sexual assault on E. Jean Carroll cost him just $2mil. His mouth put him on the hook for nearly $90mil more.\n\nA Manhattan federal jury found last year that Donald Trump had sexually abused writer E. Jean Carroll in a New York City department store dressing room in the 1990s.\n\nFor the sexual assault, the jury ordered Trump to cough up just over $2 million to the longtime advice columnist.\n\nBut it wasn't a physical attack that put the former president on the hook for the remaining $86.3 million in damages in both of Carroll's high-profile civil defamation trials - it was his mouth.\n\n\"I think they said 'enough, enough.' Enough saying horrible, slimy, terrible things about me,\" Carroll told \"CBS Mornings\" of the second Manhattan federal jury, which read its verdict into the record Friday.\n\nThat jury ordered Trump to pay Carroll the bulk of his total legal debt to her , $83.3 million , after he spent years rattling off defamatory remarks and attacks against her.\n\nThis most recent trial differed from last year's, at which Carroll sued Trump for both the sexual abuse and defamation. Last year's jury found Trump liable for not only sexually assaulting her, but for defaming her by denying it in an October 2022 Truth Social post. He called Carroll's allegations a \"hoax,\" a \"lie\" and ranted that she wasn't his \"type.\"\n\nThe jury awarded Carroll $5 million in total damages in that trial. The largest portion of the awarded damages in that case was the $2 million for sexually abusing her in 1996, as well as another $20,000 in punitive damages.\n\nFor defamation, that jury also awarded Carroll $1 million in damages, $1.7 million to help repair the reputational harm caused by Trump, and $280,000 in punitive damages.\n\nCompensatory damages are an amount that the jury finds equivalent to what the plaintiff suffered. Punitive damages are awarded to punish the defendant for behavior the jury found was negligent or intentional.\n\nThis recent trial, which wrapped up Friday, centered on defamation claims Carroll brought against Trump involving two statements he made in 2019, while he was president, disparaging Carroll by calling her a liar and insulting her appearance.\n\n\"I'll say it with great respect: Number one, she's not my type. Number two, it never happened. It never happened, OK?\" Trump told The Hill, denying Carroll's claims.\n\nSince Trump was already found liable for sexually abusing and defaming Carroll, jurors in the most recent trial only needed to determine any additional defamation damages .\n\nThe jury in that case returned the stunning verdict last week after less than three hours of deliberation, awarding Carroll a whopping $65 million in punitive damages and $18.3 million in compensatory damages.\n\nTrump's refusal to cease his attacks on Carroll in the wake of the first jury's verdict is likely why a new jury came back with stiffer penalties, defamation experts told Business Insider.\n\nRepresentatives for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Business Insider on Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe compensatory damages concerned Trump's false 2019 statements. Chris Mattei, a defamation attorney best known for winning a $1.5 billion jury verdict against conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, told Business Insider that jurors may have believed those statements caused more damage because Trump made them from the White House, where they were broadcast around the world.\n\n\"That afforded Donald Trump a different kind of platform from which he could direct his followers to harass and further defame Ms. Carroll,\" Mattei said.\n\nThe punitive damages - which comprised the lion's share of the jury award - allowed jurors to take into account subsequent remarks by Trump, who continued calling Carroll a liar even throughout the trial. That became a substantial focus of the January 2024 trial, where jurors saw numerous statements from Trump attacking Carroll, including a clip from a press conference held during the trial itself, where he called Carroll a liar.\n\nTrump didn't attend a single day of the first trial. But in the second one, held in the same lower Manhattan federal courtroom, he was attentive and was in constant communication with his legal team (not always in a good way - Carroll's lawyers complained to the judge that the jury could hear his loud mutterings ).\n\nHe testified on the stand, if only briefly . At times Trump acted out in court, and even as he and Carroll faced off in the courtroom, his Truth Social account blasted out more posts attacking her .\n\nDefamation experts told Business Insider that the jurors in the latest trial were clearly sending a message by awarding such an eye-popping amount to Carroll. They had eyes on Trump this time, and they clearly didn't like what they saw.\n\n\"Donald Trump did not attend the first trial, as he did here, and did certain things that the jury was able to observe,\" Mattei said. \"And that may have motivated them in a way that the first jury wasn't.\"\n\nCarroll \"did everything she was supposed to do in going through the course in the first case and getting her award,\" according to J. Erik Connolly, a defamation attorney at Benesch Law.\n\n\"And that should have brought her peace of mind, and it didn't, and this is perhaps the only way the jury says, well, the normal course didn't bring her the peace of mind and the deterrence that she was entitled to as a victim,\" Connolly said. \"This, second time now, maybe this will.\"\n\nCarroll's lawyers argued that Trump showed flagrant disrespect for the rule of law. First by ignoring the earlier verdict and continuing to defame Carroll - even bragging on CNN that his poll numbers went up. And, second, by disrespecting courtroom procedures while attending the second trial.\n\n\"At that point, you are compounding the wrongdoing or the misconduct that the jury would want to deter,\" Connolly said.\n\nOnly a massive punitive damages verdict, Carroll's lawyers argued, would get Trump to actually stop.\n\n\"While Donald Trump may not care about the law, while he certainly doesn't care about the truth, he does care about money,\" Carroll's attorney Roberta Kaplan told jurors in her closing argument. \"As a result, your decision to award a large amount of punitive damages may be the only hope that E. Jean Carroll has to ever be free from Donald Trump's relentless attacks ever again.\"\n\nThat strategy appeared to work. While Trump vowed to appeal the $83.3 million jury decision , as he did with the first verdict, and has complained that the trial was unfair, he hasn't publicly called Carroll a liar since last week's verdict.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Trump's lawyers say an accuser's sexual-assault testimony should have been tossed because the incident was aboard an airplane\n\nDonald Trump actually showed up this time.\n\nThe 2024 Republican presidential nominee appeared in a Manhattan federal appeals court on Friday to watch the oral arguments in the appeal of a jury verdict finding him liable for sexual abusing and defaming the writer E. Jean Carroll.\n\nMuch of the arguments - on the 17th floor of a Manhattan federal courthouse - focused on whether sexual-assault testimony from one witness in the trial should have been tossed because she alleges the assault took place on an airplane.\n\nJohn Sauer, Trump's lawyer in the Friday arguments, said the jury should have never heard evidence from Jessica Leeds, who testified that Trump groped her on a plane in the 1970s .\n\nLeeds testified that when Trump ran into her a couple of years later, he recalled her as \"that cunt from the airplane.\"\n\nLeeds' allegations weren't part of Carroll's accusations, but the trial judge allowed her testimony because they demonstrated what Carroll's lawyers argued was a pattern of behavior by Trump.\n\nBut Sauer said the testimony should have been \"inadmissible\" because the alleged events were under \"territorial or maritime jurisdiction\" and different rules of evidence applied.\n\nThe three judges on the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals panel hearing the case seemed largely skeptical of the arguments.\n\nUS Circuit Judge Denny Chin appeared doubtful it would make sense to \"order a new trial\" based on the arguments.\n\n\"It's very hard to overturn a jury verdict for evidentiary grounds,\" he said.\n\nCarroll's lawyer Roberta Kaplan said there was no \"special aircraft jurisdiction\" that would have led to the exclusion of Leeds' testimony.\n\n\"It was a crime to grope someone on a plane,\" she said. \"It is a crime to grope someone on a plane.\"\n\nTrump - who did not testify or even show up to the trial for the case - said in a press conference at Trump Tower later Friday morning that if he were to have groped a woman on a plane, Leeds \"would not have been the chosen one.\"\n\n\"It couldn't have happened, it didn't happen, and she would not have been the chosen one,\" he said. \"She would not have been the chosen one,\" he repeated.\n\n\"I assume she'll sue me now for defamation,\" he added, after continuing to deny that he sexually assaulted Leeds.\n\nTrump skipped the trial for the case , which took place in the spring of 2023. The jury found him liable for sexually abusing and defaming Carroll and ordered him to pay $5 million in damages.\n\nAfter suffering the court loss, Trump did attend nearly all of a second trial, in January, which focused on additional defamation damages .\n\nHis lead attorney in the January trial, Alina Habba, frequently sparred with the case's judge . Trump himself walked out of the courtroom in the middle of closing arguments from Kaplan.\n\nThe jury in the second trial ordered the former president to pay Carroll another $83 million in damages for repeatedly calling her a liar and disparaging her appearance while denying the sexual assault.\n\nCarroll attended each day of both trials, as well as Friday's arguments. Kaplan declined to comment after the hearing.\n\nThe appeal's oral arguments were held in a courthouse across the street from where the two Carroll v. Trump trials took place.\n\nTrump brought much of his expansive legal team with him on Friday. In addition to Sauer, who made the oral arguments, he had the attorneys Todd Blanche, Emil Bove, and Habba in tow. Two advisors, Boris Epshteyn and Joshua Katz, hung back at the same large table in the courtroom well.\n\nIn court, he didn't speak out of turn. He surveyed the journalists and members of the public when he entered the courtroom at 9:55 a.m., wearing a familiar scowl. Trump was stone-faced in his seat throughout the 23 minutes of argument, even when Carroll's lawyer recounted vivid details of the sexual-abuse testimony.\n\nCarroll brought her sexual-abuse lawsuit against Trump using the Adult Survivors Act, a New York law passed in the wake of the #MeToo movement that opened a window allowing for civil sexual-misconduct claims that would otherwise be barred by the statute of limitations.\n\nCarroll alleged that in the mid-1990s Trump cornered her in a dressing room at Bergdorf Goodman in Manhattan, a short walk from Trump Tower. In harrowing testimony for both trials, she described how his \"curved finger\" penetrated her without her consent. Two of Carroll's friends testified that she told them about the incident shortly after it took place.\n\nTrump's lawyers have argued that the verdict in the first trial should be tossed. In an appeal brief, Blanche and Bove - who also represent Trump in a slew of other cases - borrowed arguments from Harvey Weinstein's successful appeal in his New York criminal case , namely that accusers who weren't part of the case shouldn't have been allowed to testify.\n\nSauer argued that Trump's case was \"a textbook example\" of a case wrongly propped up by propensity evidence rather than Trump's actual conduct.\n\n\"It's a quintessential he-said-she-said case,\" he said.\n\nThe judges didn't appear to be convinced. US Circuit Judge Susan Carney mused about whether the verdict could stand when considering the \"outcry witnesses\" to whom Carroll disclosed her story.\n\nLegal experts - including Weinstein's own lawyers - previously told BI that the argument had a slim chance of success. Federal courtroom rules are more lenient when it comes to the testimony of \"propensity witnesses\" who help establish a pattern of behavior, particularly when it comes to civil cases.\n\n\"In these civil cases, you can certainly show a pattern, and that's basically what's happening, especially when you have a perpetrator with multiple alleged victims,\" Marci Hamilton, a University of Pennsylvania professor who helped write the Adult Survivors Act, told BI before Friday's arguments.\n\nOn Friday, Kaplan emphasized that the ordinary rules were followed during the trial.\n\n\"Despite the prominence of this case and the personalities involved, this is really about a routine application of federal rules of evidence,\" she said.\n\nShe also jabbed at Habba's earlier claims that she might have some kind of conflict of interest with the trial judge, US District Judge Lewis Kaplan.\n\n\"Just for the record, we are not related, and he is not my mentor,\" she said.\n\nTrump is racing to clear away many of his legal problems ahead of the November presidential election, where he's facing off against Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee.\n\nEarlier this year, Sauer won a resounding victory before the US Supreme Court in one of Trump's criminal cases. The court recognized far-reaching presidential immunity that delivered a significant setback to the Washington, DC-based criminal case against Trump over his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n\nTrump didn't show up to those oral arguments either, in part because he was in another Manhattan courtroom during a trial for a different criminal case; in that case, a jury found him guilty of falsifying business documents as part of a different election-interference scheme in 2016.\n\nBlanche and Bove, who also represent him in the Manhattan criminal case, have cited the US Supreme Court ruling to fight the verdict in that case as well. New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan, who presided over the trial, is expected to decide on Friday whether he will once again delay Trump's sentencing, which is scheduled for September 18.\n\nPresidential immunity played a role in earlier court fights in the Carroll case. A 2nd Circuit panel previously ruled that Trump waived any presidential-immunity protections and could not argue that they applied as he disparaged Carroll from the White House.\n\nIn an interview with BI after the verdict in her first trial last year, Carroll said she'd heard from hundreds of people that her court verdict gave them hope that they could hold their own abusers accountable.\n\n\"They think, 'Well, if the former president of the United States can be held liable for sexual abuse, well then maybe my stepfather, maybe my old boss, maybe my ex-boyfriend, maybe that man who lived down the street - maybe I can hold them accountable for ruining my life,'\" Carroll told BI.\n\nJump to"

Jean Carroll wants to spend her newfound riches in a meaningful way after a federal jury awarded her $83.3 million in her defamation trial against former President Donald Trump last week.\n\nThe columnist told media outlets she doesn't want to \"waste\" the $18.8 million in compensatory damages and $65 million in punitive damages a jury awarded her on Friday.\n\nA separate jury in 2023 determined Trump was liable for sexually abusing Carroll in a department store in the mid-1990s and defaming her, awarding her $5 million in damages.\n\n\"I'd like to give the money to something Donald Trump hates,\" Carroll told ABC News on Monday. \"If it will cause him pain for me to give money to certain things, that's my intent.\"\n\nIn her comments to ABC on Monday, Carroll raised the possibility of donating some of Trump's incoming millions to women who have alleged they were sexually assaulted by the former president.\n\nAt least twenty-six women have accused Trump of varying degrees of sexual misconduct since the 1970s, with allegations ranging from unwanted touching to rape.\n\nTrump has issued several blanket denials in response to the flood of allegations, characterizing the women's stories as \"FAKE NEWS,\" \"totally phony,\" and \"100% false.\"\n\n\"Perhaps a fund for the women who Donald Trump has sexually assaulted,\" Carroll told ABC News of her potential future donations.\n\nTrump has vowed to appeal the jury's decision, and according to The New York Times , Carroll likely won't see any money until after he's appealed the decision.\n\nBut a former judge told Business Insider that the decision was unlikely to be overturned .\n\nHere are five additional options to which Carroll could donate.\n\nIt's no secret that the journalism industry is struggling. Layoffs across a swath of news outlets (including Business Insider) have been ongoing for months.\n\nIt's also no secret that Trump has a distaste for journalists . His scorn for news outlets, from ABC News to The Washington Post, has been lengthy and well-documented, as well as his penchant for lambasting individual reporters by name on social media and in the wild.\n\n\"Journalists are terrible people,\" Trump said at a rally in 2015.\n\nCarroll, a journalist herself, could choose to dedicate some of her incoming funds toward supporting the fourth estate in a move that would support democracy.\n\nIf Carroll has hopes of spreading her wealth beyond the borders of America, perhaps she can make a sizable donation to one of the \" shithole\" countries Trump has railed against .\n\nThe then-president landed himself in hot water in 2018 after referring to Haiti and African nations as \"shithole\" countries during an immigration meeting, asking why the US couldn't get more immigrants from Norway.\n\nThe list of foreign nations against which Trump has railed is too long to count. The former president has slammed everywhere, from Mexico (he called for a \"boycott\" of the country in 2015) to Canada (Trump accused the longtime US ally of taking advantage of America's generosity).\n\nCarroll could take a global approach to sharing her wealth, but if she prefers to keep the money close to home, she could opt to donate the funds to one of the US states against which Trump has criticized over the years: California (\"well known for its poor management & high taxes\"); New Jersey (\" deeply troubled \"); or New York (and its \" PRESIDENTIAL HARASSERS \").\n\nIf Carroll is looking to skip the bureaucratic headache of donating millions of dollars to a foreign nation but still wants to bother Trump , she could share her wealth with the thousands of immigrants and migrants who arrive in the US each day and the organizations that support them.\n\nDuring his time in office and after, Trump saved many of his harshest digs for immigrants and migrants, especially those coming from Latin America. The former president said undocumented migrants are \"some of the worst criminals on earth\" and called would-be immigrants near the border \"stone-cold criminals.\"\n\n\"They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people,\" Trump infamously railed off during his 2015 campaign launch.\n\nCarroll could choose to circulate the money in the realm of politics. She wouldn't even need to pick a side of the aisle, as both Republicans and Democrats are among Trump's many foes.\n\nTrump's distaste for the opposing party and its politicians is, in many ways, par for the course in modern-day Washington. The former president has castigated Democrats as \"the do-nothing party\" and a \"sad joke\" who put \"our country at risk.\"\n\nBut Trump has also normalized disdain for members of his own party by reviving the RINO nickname - Republican in Name Only - and throwing it at anyone who has refused to fall in line.\n\nTrump likes his war heroes uncaptured .\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Trump will mimic Harvey Weinstein's successful appeal to fight his own sexual-assault verdict Friday. It won't be as easy.\n\nDonald Trump is dispatching a lawyer to yet another courtroom Friday, when the former president will try to overturn the Manhattan civil case in which the judge said Trump raped the writer E. Jean Carroll.\n\nThe oral arguments will have a distinct, Harvey Weinstein-esque ring to them, judging from the court filings.\n\nAs the presidential election nears, Trump's legal team has been rushing to erase the Republican nominee's rap sheet and tidy up his lawsuit losses.\n\nOn Friday, the lawyer D. John Sauer is scheduled to be in a federal appellate courtroom in Manhattan, where he'll fight the 2023 jury verdict that found the former president liable for defaming and sexually abusing Carroll . The judge who oversaw the trial later said: \" Trump 'raped' her as many people commonly understand the word 'rape.'\"\n\nBefore a three-judge panel for the Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit, Sauer is set to argue that the jury in Carroll's trial should never have heard evidence for other sexual-assault allegations.\n\nThat evidence included the \"Access Hollywood\" \"grab 'em\" tape and testimony by two women who told the jury Trump sexually attacked them, one saying she was assaulted on a plane in the mid-'70s and the other saying she was attacked at Mar-a-Lago in 2005.\n\nIt's a strategy that worked on appeal for Weinstein.\n\nIn April, New York state's top court overturned Weinstein's 2020 Manhattan sex-crimes conviction in a 4-3 decision that found the trial judge improperly allowed testimony by three accusers who were not part of the indictment. (Weinstein remains jailed in New York pending a retrial; he is separately serving a 16-year sentence from a rape conviction in Los Angeles, which he is also appealing.)\n\nBut the lawyers who won Weinstein's appeal told Business Insider that what worked for their client probably wouldn't work for Trump.\n\nThat's because Weinstein's jury sat in a New York state criminal courtroom, where long-standing rules of evidence strictly limit so-called prior-bad-act evidence, the disgraced Hollywood mogul's lawyers noted.\n\nFederal court is a very different place, they said - where Trump will likely find the rules of evidence insurmountably stacked against him.\n\n\"It's not apples and apples,\" said Barry Kamins, a Weinstein appellate attorney and former Brooklyn-based state Supreme Court justice.\n\nFederal trial rules allow evidence for other sexual-assault allegations to be heard at civil sexual-assault trials and have since the mid-'90s, Kamins, now at Aidala, Bertuna & Kamins , said.\n\n\"It's funny, but Trump would have been much better off in state court than in federal court, which may be why they brought the case there,\" Kamins said of Carroll's lawyers.\n\nThe architect of the law Carroll used to bring a lawsuit against Trump agreed.\n\nMarci Hamilton, who runs the sexual-abuse-victim advocacy group Child USA and helped write the New York law, said civil cases allow presenting witnesses to \"show a pattern.\"\n\n\"That's basically what's happening - especially when you have a perpetrator with multiple alleged victims,\" she said. \"That pattern makes a big difference in explaining to the jury exactly who this person was that was doing this and how they operated.\"\n\nThe appeal is over the first of Carroll's two trials against Trump, in a case she brought under New York's Adult Survivors Act .\n\nThe law - passed in the wake of reports about Weinstein's sexual predation and the #MeToo movement - opened a one-year window where accusers could bring sexual-misconduct lawsuits that would otherwise be banned by the statute of limitations.\n\nCarroll accused Trump of sexually abusing her in the mid-'90s in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room. The trial included searing testimony from Carroll herself , as well as from two of her friends who testified that she contemporaneously told them Trump sexually assaulted her.\n\nUS District Judge Lewis Kaplan also permitted testimony from Jessica Leeds and Natasha Stoynoff, whose claims were not part of the lawsuit.\n\nLeeds described being forcibly groped on a plane 20 years before Carroll and Trump's dressing-room encounter. Stoynoff, a journalist, described a similar attack during an interview at Mar-a-Lago. That attack happened in 2005, she testified, 20 years after the Carroll attack and about the time Trump bragged about grabbing women by the genitals on the \"Access Hollywood\" tape.\n\nSimilar testimony doomed the Weinstein case.\n\nNew York state's top court ruled the prosecution's prior-bad-act witnesses - the trio who testified Weinstein sexually assaulted them but whose claims weren't part of the criminal indictment - should never have taken the stand.\n\nIn Trump's appeal brief, his lawyers argue testimony from Leeds and Stoynoff and the \"Access Hollywood\" tape should have never been allowed in the trial, and they cite a federal rule that is similar to the state-level one that foiled the Weinstein prosecution.\n\nThe jury, Trump's lawyers argue in the brief, particularly should have never heard highly prejudicial testimony from Leeds recalling that Trump told her, \"You're that cunt from the airplane,\" or Stoynoff saying Trump insisted, \"We're going to have an affair.\"\n\nDiane Kiesel, a New York Law School professor and former state trial judge, told BI she believed the evidence met the criteria for being included in the trial. The \"Access Hollywood\" tape and testimony from Leeds and Stoynoff helped demonstrate Trump's \"motive, intent, and opportunity\" in his encounter with Carroll, as allowed under federal evidence rules, she said.\n\n\"The fact that you've got E. Jean Carroll saying, 'He did this to me in Bergdorf's.' And he says, 'You can do it at any time to women; they let you do it,'\" she said. \"And then two other women climb out of the woodwork from 50 years ago and said he did the exact same thing - to me, I think it goes straight to motive, intent.\"\n\nKaplan, the judge, wrote in his ruling that the evidence was allowed in the trial under different federal rules of procedure as well. Those include rules that allow for testimony about \"similar acts\" in sexual-assault cases.\n\n\"As their testimony shows, Trump engaged in a pattern of abruptly lunging at a woman in a semi-public place, pressing his body against her, kissing her, and sexually touching her without consent, and later categorically denying the allegations and declaring that the accuser was too unattractive for him to have assaulted her,\" Carroll's lawyers wrote in a brief.\n\nFriday's courtroom battle will feature Carroll's lawyer Roberta Kaplan , who oversaw the two verdicts in favor of Carroll. In the May 2023 verdict, the jury found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation and awarded Carroll $5 million in damages. In the second trial, earlier this year , a separate jury said Trump owed Carroll an additional $83 million in defamation damages.\n\nKaplan (who is not related to the trial judge) will face off against Sauer, who recently won a resounding victory for Trump before the US Supreme Court, which recognized sweeping presidential immunity in the criminal election-interference case against him.\n\nTrump's best chance in Friday's appeal may be to continue to argue that the two other accusers who testified, Leeds and Stoynoff, described assaults that were far too distant in time from Carroll's to have been relevant, Arthur Aidala, a Weinstein attorney, said.\n\nWhile federal rules of evidence for civil sexual-assault trials are far more expansive, a judge still can't go too far, he said.\n\n\"It has to be reasonable, and the appellate court can take into consideration the distance in time between the accounts of the plaintiff and these 'propensity' witnesses,\" he said.\n\nCrucially, the jury in Carroll's case didn't need to reach the conclusion that Trump sexually abused Carroll \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" - the standard in criminal trials.\n\nInstead, it needed to find it was \"more probable than not\" that Trump sexually assaulted Carroll, a standard far more common in civil cases.\n\nEven if the appeals court finds that some of the trial testimony shouldn't have reached the jury's ear, the standard gives some room to allow the verdict to be upheld anyway, according to Hamilton, the architect of the Adult Survivors Act.\n\n\"It's not unusual that in a civil case, you'll have the defendants try arguments from the criminal law to try to strengthen their arguments,\" she said. \"But in the end, it's just apples to oranges. They're not the same thing.\"\n\nCorrection: September 5, 2024 - An earlier version of this story misstated the timeline of two accusations against Trump. He is accused of sexually assaulting Leeds 20 years before Carroll says she was assaulted by Trump, not 20 years before he was found liable for sexually abusing Carroll.\n\nJump to"

Jean Carroll's defamation lawsuit against Donald Trump began this week, the former president has already made a habit of talking about the case outside the courtroom - in a post-hearing press conference, at a campaign rally, and on Truth Social.\n\nHe's repeated the claim that he never knew Carroll; that her allegations of sexual assault , which a previous jury found him liable for, were \"fabricated,\" and accused her of deleting relevant evidence.\n\nOn Saturday, Carroll's attorney responded: She'll be using his words as evidence.\n\nIn court filings viewed by Business Insider, Carroll's lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, notified US District Judge Lewis Kaplan that she intends to submit several pieces of evidence on Monday for the ongoing defamation trial. Carroll's lawsuit centers entirely on the allegation that Trump defamed her by saying she lied about him raping her in a Manhattan department store in the mid-1990s.\n\nA spokesperson for Roberta Kaplan declined to provide comment.\n\nOne of the exhibits points to a post-hearing press conference Trump had after a testy first day in court on Wednesday.\n\n\"I have no idea who she is,\" Trump said, adding that the case was \"a rigged deal. It's a made-up, fabricated story.\"\n\nDuring the conference, he also accused Carroll of deleting \"massive amounts of evidence.\" Trump's lawyer, Alina Habba, asked for a mistrial on Friday, arguing that Carroll got rid of evidence by deleting emails that contained death threats against the former Elle columnist.\n\nThe exhibits also include a Truth Social post that Trump put up on the day Kaplan filed her letter of intent to submit more evidence.\n\n\"Until the filing of this ridiculous lawsuit against me, I knew nothing about this woman, never heard of her, never touched her, had nothing to do with her,\" a Saturday post from Trump's Truth Social account said.\n\nEven before his day in court, Trump continued to attack Carroll on social media, calling the writer's allegations a \"fake story\" and a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nA jury in May previously found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation. The case, however, was regarding one of two lawsuits Carroll filed against Trump in 2022 under New York's Adult Survivors Act , which provided sexual misconduct accusers one year to file a civil lawsuit even if the statute of limitations has expired.\n\nThe current trial is for Carroll's first lawsuit filed in 2019 and will only cover what damages Trump must pay .\n\nA spokesperson for Trump did not return a request for comment.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Donald Trump posts $92 million bond just 3 days before he'd be forced to fork the actual cash over to E. Jean Carroll\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has posted a bond that will stop E. Jean Carroll from being able to collect $83.3 million from a defamation judgment against him.\n\nThe bond - totaling $91.63 million to reflect mandatory interest and fees - allows Trump a measure of relief as he appeals the case and continues to pursue the presidency. Without it, Carroll's lawyers could have moved to enforce the judgment and go after Trump's assets following the deadline on Monday next week.\n\nThe bond agreement effectively means that Trump offered some form of collateral to the Federal Insurance Co. - commonly known as Chubb - to guarantee the cash would be there if he lost his appeals and the judgment was enforced.\n\nTrump agreed to the terms of the bond with the Federal Insurance Co. on Tuesday, according to documents filed in court Friday.\n\nDetails of the deal were not made public in court documents. Chubb has previously declined to speak with Business Insider about underwriting Trump's appeal bond.\n\nChubb likely charged Trump another $250,000 or more - as much as $1 million - as a premium on the bond, Neil Pedersen, the owner of the Manhattan surety-bond agency Pedersen & Sons, said.\n\nTrump would have shopped around for the lowest premium, and there may have been more than one carrier competing for his business, Pedersen said. Still, because of the size of the bond, and the high publicity surrounding it, \"I don't think there were a lot of companies competing to do this,\" Pedersen said.\n\nWith a bond now in place, US District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who oversaw Carroll's defamation trial against Trump, can pause Carroll's ability to collect the judgment .\n\nBut Trump can't touch the money either - it will remain on ice, likely collecting interest in a dedicated, interest-bearing bank account - until the appeals are exhausted.\n\nTrump's lawyers are appealing the defamation verdict and have argued in a court filing that Kaplan erred by not allowing Trump to talk more on the witness stand. They're also arguing that the damages are too high.\n\n\"Due to the numerous prejudicial errors made at the lower level, we are highly confident that the Second Circuit will overturn this egregious judgment,\" Trump attorney Alina Habba said after the bond was posted.\n\nA Manhattan federal-court jury found Trump liable in January for the $83.3 million in defamation damages for his relentless attacks on Carroll, whom he called a liar after she accused him of sexually assaulting her in the mid-1990s.\n\nMandatory costs and interest raise the bond by a standardized 111% above the original judgment in federal cases, Pedersen said.\n\n\"It's an unwritten rule among the court clerks, but that's what has become standard for appeal bonds in federal cases,\" he said.\n\nA different jury in May found Trump liable for the sexual assault and for other defamation claims. Trump has already put the $5 million in damages he owes in that case into a court-controlled account as he pursues appeals.\n\nTrump's bigger problem is the judgment he owes in the New York attorney general's civil fraud lawsuit against him and his company.\n\nHe has until March 25 to obtain a bond for the $454 million verdict he owes in that case - an amount that grows with interest each day and exceeds most estimates of his cash holdings.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "E. Jean Carroll needs up to $12.1 million to fix her reputation for Trump's defamation, expert testifies at trial\n\nIf E. Jean Carroll wants to clean up the mess Donald Trump has made of her reputation, it would require a bill of up to $12.1 million, an expert testified at their defamation trial Thursday.\n\nThe trial is being held in a downtown Manhattan federal courtroom over two statements Trump made in 2019 defaming Carroll when he called her a liar for alleging he raped her in the mid-1990s.\n\nTo calculate how much the jury ought to award Carroll in compensation, Carroll's legal team hired Ashlee Humphries , a professor of consumer sentiment at Northwestern University, to calculate how many people saw those statements.\n\nAdding up the viewership of tweets, articles, TV broadcasts, and other media, she said those two denials from Trump reached up to 104.1 million people.\n\nHumphries \"considered it an undercount,\" she said, because her examination didn't capture media organizations that paraphrased Trump's denial of the rape and disparagement of Carroll as a liar.\n\nHumphries then estimated the cost of a reputation repair campaign, which would essentially amount to an advertising campaign across different media platforms that would try to persuade them to believe Carroll.\n\nBecause of the political valence around Trump's denials, it would be hard to change people's minds, Humphries said. She suggested Carroll could place messages with influencers trusted among Trump's audience, like Joe Rogan and Candace Owens, and pay for advertisements to appear multiple times.\n\n\"The attitudes at issue here are strongly held,\" Humphries said.\n\n30% of the readership in particular Elle, where Carroll was a longtime advice columnist, is politically conservative, Humphries testified.\n\nIt also didn't help that Trump has continued to disparage Carroll in the years since his first statements, including at a press conference in New York Wednesday night, after the trial day.\n\n\"In general, repeated claims only strengthen people's attitudes when they come from a trusted source,\" Humphries said.\n\n$12.1 million in compensatory damages for Carroll to fix her reputation, however, is only the tip of the iceberg.\n\nIn an opening statement this week, Carroll's legal team asked the jury to impose massive punitive damages on top of the compensation.\n\nTrump already lost a trial last year, when a jury sitting in the same courtroom concluded that Trump sexually abused Carroll and defamed her by lying about it. The jury in that case awarded Carroll $5 million in combined compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nSince losing that case, Trump has only ramped up the attacks on Carroll, insulting her appearance and claiming he is the victim of a conspiracy. Her attorneys have asked for punitive damages to \"make him stop\" defaming her . Punitive damages could also send a message to other wealthy people that they cannot get away with lying about sexual abuse victims.\n\nCarroll, finishing her testimony in the trial Thursday, said her reputation has been marred by Trump's attacks. She was once known as a truth-telling advice columnist and journalist who taught women how to live their lives. Now, she said, Trump tarnished her as a liar.\n\n\"I'm more well known,\" Carroll said, responding to Trump's lawyer Alina Habba asking her whether she gained fame for accusing Trump of rape. \"And I'm hated by a lot more people.\"\n\nJump to"

He and another woman were the only two of the roughly six dozen prospects in the New York courtroom who raised their hands.\n\nJuror 68 was also the only person among prospective jurors who said he had attended a Trump rally.\n\nHe was quickly booted, however, after the judge asked whether anyone in the jury box felt Trump was being unfairly treated by the US court system.\n\nJuror 68 wasn't sitting in the jury box. But he was so enthusiastic about voicing his opinion on the matter that he stood up while seated in the audience.\n\nKaplan dismissed him shortly after, meaning the former president likely lost one of his best jurors in the second Carroll defamation trial.

      "text": "Trump declares he's interviewing law firms for his E. Jean Carroll appeal, and it's giving 'Apprentice' vibes\n\nDonald Trump appears to be treating his planned appeal in the second E. Jean Carroll defamation case like his former reality TV show, \"The Apprentice.\"\n\nThe former president announced late Tuesday in a game show-like fashion on his social-media platform, Truth Social: \"I am in the process, along with my team, of interviewing various law firms to represent me\" in his appeal of the recent jury verdict that ordered him to pay a whopping $83.3 million to Carroll for defaming her.\n\nIn his post, Trump called the case \"one of the most ridiculous and unfair Witch Hunts our Country has ever seen\" as he again bashed US District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who presided over the Manhattan trial, calling him \"Trump hating\" and a \"bully.\"\n\nTrump, the frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, promised that he would soon decide which law firm would represent him for his appeal in the case.\n\n\"This entire HOAX is a disgrace to our American System of Justice. Any lawyer who takes a TRUMP CASE is either 'CRAZY,' or a TRUE AMERICAN PATRIOT. I will make my decision soon!\" Trump said in the post.\n\nAttorney Alina Habba was the lead attorney representing Trump in Carroll's second defamation trial against the former president, along with her law partner Michael Madaio at Habba Madaio & Associates, this month.\n\nJoe Tacopina , a more experienced defense attorney, worked alongside Habba and Madaio as he led Trump's defense in a separate trial from Carroll last year, which ended in a $5 million jury verdict that found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation . Tacopina withdrew from Trump's legal team shortly before the second trial began.\n\nThat left Habba in charge of defending Trump for his second trial, which resulted in a considerably higher jury verdict. While Kaplan appeared to respect Tacopina even as he frequently ruled against Trump - once even calling him, on the record, \"a heck of a good lawyer\" - Habba repeatedly frustrated Kaplan during the later trial. The judge rebuked her at least 14 times in a single day over basic law and courtroom procedures.\n\nEven though Trump is shopping around for new attorneys to represent him in his appeal of the massive verdict, Habba is still \"very much representing President Trump,\" a spokesperson for Habba told Business Insider on Wednesday.\n\n\"Bringing in an appellate specialist is common practice in litigation and comparing a trial lawyer and an appellate lawyer is similar to comparing a brain surgeon and a heart surgeon,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nLegal experts agreed, telling Business Insider that it's common for people to use different lawyers on appeal.\n\n\"It's totally normal, indeed expected, that a client who needs to appeal on the losing end of things, would want a fresh set of eyes to reevaluate any issues on appeal,\" Mark Bederow, a criminal defense lawyer and former Manhattan prosecutor, said.\n\nBut Trump has used Habba's law firm in earlier appeals related to the case.\n\nCarroll's defamation lawsuit was first filed in 2019, after Trump called her a liar when she accused him of sexual abuse, and bounced around appeals courts in New York and Washington, DC, for years as lawyers and judges vexed over questions of whether Trump could be held liable in a civil lawsuit for statements he made while serving as president.\n\nIn a high-stakes appellate court hearing in October, which Business Insider attended, Madaio argued before a three-judge panel that Trump should have immunity in the lawsuit.\n\nJudge Kaplan had previously ruled that Trump waived immunity because he failed to raise it as a defense for three years, and because his denials of Carroll's accusations about a sexual assault that happened in the 1990s weren't related to his role as president anyway.\n\nHabba did not personally attend the appellate hearing. Carroll, who did attend, was represented in the proceedings by Joshua Matz, a former Supreme Court clerk who works at Kaplan Hecker & Fink LLP, the same law firm that represented her in both trials.\n\nThe appellate court ultimately upheld Kaplan's ruling and allowed the lawsuit to proceed.\n\nNeama Rahmani, an attorney and former federal prosecutor, explained that appellate lawyers \"have a different skill set\" like \"looking for legal errors rather than arguing to a jury.\"\n\nTrump, Rahmani said, \"probably realizes that he lost the second Carroll trial so badly in part due to Alina Habba's limited trial experience and that he needs experienced appellate counsel.\"\n\n\"The question is,\" he said, \"are any of them willing to take on an appeal they will likely lose?\"\n\nThe first of Carroll's trials against Trump was for a lawsuit that had been filed in 2022 and moved more quickly because it was over statements made after he had left the presidency. Judge Kaplan said that the second trial could not re-litigate elements already decided in the first trial, frustrating Trump and his lawyers who sought to discredit Carroll in front of a second jury. The judge, conscious of Trump's intent to appeal the second trial results, told as much to Trump in the courtroom before he testified.\n\n\"It is a very well-established legal principle in this country that prevents do-overs by disappointed litigants,\" the judge said.\n\nMeanwhile, Bederow called it \"almost unfathomable\" that any attorney would willingly represent Trump \"knowing that he is an uncontrollable client.\"\n\n\"He's going to do whatever he wants,\" Bederow said of Trump. \"He's going to make a spectacle. He's going to storm out of the courtroom in the middle of proceedings , which is just bonkers.\"\n\n\"And the reality is everyone, especially lawyers, who touches his legal proceedings,\" he said, \"tends to end up diminished in some capacity - humiliated, indicted , potentially imprisoned, ridiculed.\"\n\nJump to"

Jean Carroll's $5 million civil judgment against President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nA jury awarded Carroll the sum last year after it found Trump liable for sexual abusing her in the 1990s and then defaming her after she went public with her allegations.\n\nTrump has denied the allegations and appealed the verdict, charging it was \"grossly excessive\" and saying it should be tossed out because of what he claimed were unfair rulings by the judge who presided over the nine-day trial.\n\nA panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed.\n\n\"We conclude that Mr. Trump has not demonstrated that the district court erred in any of the challenged rulings. Further, he has not carried his burden to show that any claimed error or combination of claimed errors affected his substantial rights as required to warrant a new trial,\" the judges' ruling said .\n\nSteven Cheung, a spokesperson for Trump, said in response to the ruling: \"The American People have re-elected President Trump with an overwhelming mandate, and they demand an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and a swift dismissal of all of the Witch Hunts, including the Democrat-funded Carroll Hoax, which will continue to be appealed.\"\n\nCarroll attorney Roberta Kaplan said in a statement that she and her client \"are gratified by today's decision. We thank the Second Circuit for its careful consideration of the parties' arguments.\"\n\nCarroll later posted a link to a news story about the ruling on Facebook, adding, \"Thank you, Robbie Kaplan!\"\n\nCarroll's suit alleged that Trump sexually assaulted her in the dressing room of a Manhattan department store in 1996 and that he defamed her by calling her claim a \"hoax\" and a \"con job\" after he left office in 2021.\n\nTrump did not testify or put on a defense case. His appeal focused on what he said were critical errors by U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, including allowing testimony from two other women who claimed they had been sexually accosted by Trump.\n\nJessica Leeds alleged that Trump started to grope her out of the blue while they were sitting next to each other on a flight to New York in the late 1970s, while Natasha Stoynoff testified that Trump pushed her against a wall and started kissing her in 2005, when she was at his Mar-a-Lago resort to interview him and Melania Trump for a story about their first wedding anniversary. Trump has denied their allegations.\n\nHis attorneys also cited Kaplan's decision to allow the jury to hear the so-called \"A ccess Hollywood \" tape as another error. The 2005 recording caught Trump on a hot mic bragging that he can grope women without their consent because \"when you're a star, they let you do it.\"\n\nThe appeals court found Judge Kaplan had not \"abused his discretion\" by letting that evidence into the case. The \"evidence of other conduct was relevant to show a pattern tending to directly corroborate witness testimony and to confirm that the alleged sexual assault actually occurred,\" the ruling said.\n\nTrump is also appealing Carroll's $83 million defamation judgment against him in a separate but related case centering on defamatory comments he made about her while he was president and then after the $5 million verdict.\n\nThat case was actually the first suit she filed against Trump, but it was stalled while Trump argued that his comments were protected by presidential immunity, a claim the judge rejected.\n\nTrum p is a p p ealing that verdict to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, as well.\n\nDareh Gregorian is a politics reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Jean Carroll had levied \"false accusations\" against him, even as similar remarks have resulted in large court judgments against him.\n\nSpeaking at a Georgia campaign rally that represented Trump's pivot toward the general election as he seeks to prevent a second loss to Democratic President Joe Biden, Trump reiterated a number of grievances, Carroll's civil court victories among them.\n\n\"I just posted a $91 million bond, $91 million on a fake story, totally made-up story,\" he said, referencing the bond he posted this week as he appeals a defamation verdict against him.\n\n\"Ninety-one million based on false accusations made about me by a woman that I knew nothing about, didn't know, never heard of, I know nothing about her,\" he continued.\n\n\"She wrote a book, she said things,\" Trump told the raucous crowd in Rome, about 70 miles northeast of Atlanta. \"And when I denied it, I said, 'It's so crazy. It's false.' I get sued for defamation. That's where it starts.\"\n\nAt issue for Trump has been Carroll's allegation that he raped her during an encounter in the dressing room of a New York department store in the 1990s and then defamed her by calling her account a \"hoax\" and a \"con job.\"\n\nIn May, a jury did not find Trump liable for the alleged rape but awarded Carroll $5 million after finding the former president liable for sexually abusing and defaming her.\n\nA separate case focused on similar comments Trump made about Carroll while in office and concluded he defamed her when casting doubt on her story. U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan said that case would be about determining damages - later adjudged to be $83.3 million - as the abuse was factual.\n\nTrump is appealing both cases.\n\nThe judgments did not appear to dissuade him from returning to his denials of her account. On Saturday, Trump said that Carroll \"is not a believable person\" and that Kaplan - whom he called \"a terrible person, a terrible judge\" and \"highly corrupt\" - knows as much.\n\nTrump blamed \"Democratic operatives\" for his defamation woes, and called the city where he and his father bought, sold, traded and developed real estate projects for the better part of a century a crooked metropolis.\n\n\"New York is a very corrupt place,\" Trump said.\n\nIt did not appear Carroll had responded to Trump's latest denials of her story as of early Sunday.\n\nJake Traylor is a 2024 NBC News campaign embed.\n\nDennis Romero is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital.\n\nLindsey Pipia is an Associate Producer for the 2024 Political Desk.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Jean Carroll case\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nAttorneys for former President Donald Trump filed official notice Friday they're appealing the $83 million defamation verdict awarded to writer E. Jean Carroll - and that they've posted the $91 million bond needed to keep her from collecting while the appeal plays out.\n\nThe lawyers asked the judge in a court filing for an order approving the $91,630,000 bond and staying execution of Carroll's judgment.\n\nThe terms of the bond - and how much money or collateral Trump put down - are unclear. The source of the bond is the Federal Insurance Company, a corporation authorized to transact business in New York. It is based in Chesapeake, Virginia and New Jersey and the company appears to be a subsidiary of Chubb Insurance Company. The document is signed by the former president.\n\nThe judge ordered Carroll's attorneys to respond to Trump's request by Monday morning. He said he could hold a hearing that afternoon if they have any opposition to it.\n\nThe filing came as a surprise because Trump's lawyers have repeatedly asked the judge for more time to post the bond and to reduce the amount. The bond was needed to prevent Carroll from moving to collect on the judgment during the pendency of the appeal, which could take months or even years. It's greater than the amount of the actual verdict to account for New York's 9% annual interest rate.\n\nThe automatic stay of the judgment was set to expire Monday, at which point Carroll's attorneys could have moved to start collecting the money she was awarded for Trump's having defamed her when he was president and then after she received a separate $5 million judgment against him last year. He's appealing that verdict also, and had $5.5 million in cash put up as security for that judgment.\n\nCarroll called the development \"stupendous\" in a Substack post. She wrote that while her attorney Roberta Kaplan \"is strong enough to yank a golden toilet out of the floor at Trump Tower and toss it through the window, this bond saves Robbie the trouble of showing up with US Marshals on Monday to do so.\"\n\nCourt documents show Trump signed the new bond agreement on Tuesday, and the attorney for FIC signed it on Wednesday - the same day that Trump's lawyers filed a letter asking the judge to stay the judgment for three days after he rules on their previous request for a stay, which he has yet to do.\n\nU.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan rejected that request in an order Thursday and chided Trump for trying to rush his ruling. \"Mr. Trump's current situation is a result of his own dilatory actions. He has had since January 26 to organize his finances with the knowledge that he might need to bond this judgment, yet he waited until 25 days after the jury verdict\" and shortly before the expiration of the automatic stay to seek relief, the judge wrote.\n\nTrump is facing a similar - and larger - issue in New York state court, where he was hit last month with a $464 million civil fraud judgment .\n\nTrump's attorneys have asked an appeals court to reduce the size of the bond he has to post in that case, a request that was rejected by the judge who heard the case. \"To account for post-judgment interest and appeal cost, a surety will often set the bond amount at 120% of the judgment or more,\" Trump attorney Clifford Robert wrote in a filing to the appeals court. That would total well over $500 million.\n\nA single judge from the state Appellate Division last month denied Trump's request to reduce the size of the bond to $100 million , but set an expedited briefing schedule for Trump's stay motion. That leaves open the possibility that a full panel of judges could act before Trump has to file the bond.\n\nThe current deadline for him to file is March 25 - the same day jury selection is set to begin in Trump's criminal trial in New York state court. He's charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records relating to hush money payments that were paid to a porn star in the closing days of the 2016 election. Trump has pleaded not guilty.\n\nCORRECTION (March 8, 2024, 7:35 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article mischaracterized a transaction stemming from the appeal of last year's $5 million judgment against Trump. He had $5.5 million in cash put up as security; he did not post a bond.\n\nAdam Reiss is a reporter and producer for NBC and MSNBC.\n\nLisa Rubin is an MSNBC legal correspondent and a former litigator.\n\nDareh Gregorian is a politics reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Jean Carroll in February after she said during testimony in her defamation lawsuit against former President Donald Trump that she had an unlicensed firearm at home, according to a police report obtained by NBC News.\n\nThe chief of police in Warwick, New York, visited Carroll at her home on Feb. 15 \"to discuss some open issues,\" the report states, including Carroll's disclosure of the handgun while she was on the witness stand Jan. 17.\n\nDuring the second day of the civil trial, Carroll had told the federal court in lower Manhattan that she kept a \"high standard revolver, nine chambers\" at home with ammunition. \"By my bed,\" she said.\n\n\"I still do not have a license,\" Carroll added.\n\nJohn Rader, the reporting officer, said in his report that he \"offered to secure the weapon at the police station's property for safekeeping.\"\n\nCarroll and a member of her security team surrendered the gun a day after Rader visited, and the firearm was being held until Carroll receives a New York pistol license, the report said.\n\nCarroll and an attorney of hers did not immediately respond to requests for comment Friday evening, nor did Rader.\n\nUnder New York state law, a person can be found guilty of criminal possession if they possess a firearm, such as a pistol, that has not been registered. The felony carries a maximum sentence of four years.\n\nIt was unclear why police waited almost a month to inquire in person about the unregistered gun Carroll said she had at her house or whether police are still in possession of it.\n\nCarroll's gun became a contentious topic under cross-examination in the January hearing, as Trump attorney Alina Habba pressed Carroll on her gun ownership and whether she knew she needed a license for it.\n\nThe judge presiding over the case, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, appeared outwardly frustrated over the line of questioning by Habba.\n\n\"Don't even start,\" told her when she began asking Carroll about the firearm.\n\nThe jury ordered Trump to pay Carroll $83.3 million in damages for repeatedly defaming her. The award included $11 million for damage to Carroll's reputation, $7.3 million for emotional harm and other damages, and $65 million in punitive damages.\n\nKaplan later rejected arguments by Trump's attorneys that the case should be thrown out because Carroll deleted threatening messages, including death threats. The judge said that while Carroll admitted she deleted some of the purported death threats, the details of the deletions remain unclear.\n\nTrump had already been found liable for defaming Carroll while he was in the White House, with the jury tasked only with determining how much she should receive in damages.\n\nTrump has denied the rape and defamation claims against him, and posted a $91.6 million bond to secure the judgment while he appeals the verdict.\n\nKatherine Doyle is a White House reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Jean Carroll leaves a New York court on Friday after a jury order former President Donald Trump $83.3 million for defaming her.\n\nA New York jury on Friday ordered former President Donald Trump to pay a total of $83.3 million to E. Jean Carroll for ruining her credibility as an advice columnist when he called her a liar after she accused him of sexual assault.\n\nThe jury awarded Carroll $65 million in punitive damages, $11 million for the damage to her reputation and another $7.3 million. Trump is almost certain to appeal the verdict.\n\nDespite the size of the penalty, the verdict was not unexpected. Judge Lewis Kaplan ruled even before the trial that Trump had in fact defamed Carroll. The jury only had to decide how much Trump owed her - not if he was liable. This is the second time Trump has been ordered pay Carroll; last year he was mandated by a jury to pay $5 million for a separate instance of defamation.\n\nIn response, the Trump 2024 campaign issued a statement arguing, without offering evidence, that the trial is a \"political weapon.\"\n\n\"Absolutely ridiculous!\" said the statement. \"I fully disagree with both verdicts, and will be appealing this whole Biden Directed Witch Hunt focused on me and the Republican Party.\"\n\nThe jury's decision comes just days after Trump won the New Hampshire primary and became the GOP front-runner. The case is one of several involving Trump, who is also awaiting a verdict in a civil trial that could result in him paying at least $250 million to New York state for his business practices, which have been deemed by a judge to be fraudulent.\n\nHe could also be prohibited from doing business in the state where he made his name as a real estate mogul. In all, Trump faces 91 charges in federal and state trials, ranging from the ones in New York to those at the federal level related to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.\n\nIn 2019, Carroll, an advice columnist and freelance writer, accused Trump of sexually assaulting her in the '90s. The accusation, which was detailed in her book, was first previewed in a New York magazine article. After the article's publication, Trump issued two statements in response to reporters, including one in which he outright denied her claim and said she was \"not my type.\"\n\nCarroll then sued Trump for defamation, arguing that his comments ruined her reputation as a trusted source in the media, and resulted in a slew of insults and threatening messages, emails and comments to her social media accounts.\n\nAt the time, Trump's Attorney General Bill Barr blocked the lawsuit, arguing Trump had made the comments in his official capacity as president. This caused the lawsuit to be stuck in court for several years.\n\nIn 2023, Biden's Justice Department reversed course and allowed the first lawsuit on defamation to move forward. In part because of the 2023 decision that had found Trump liable for assault, Judge Kaplan ruled that Trump had defame Carroll in 2019 and that the former president was  also liable.\n\nCarroll herself was the first witness to take the stand - putting her face to face with Trump, who attended the first few days of the trial.\n\nCarroll testified that she felt as if Trump calling her a liar \"ended the world I had been living in.\"\n\nWhile she used to receive hundreds of emails asking for advice to her column email, she said, she now received fewer than 10 a month. Instead, she said, she received threats and insults. Carroll's lawyer showed the jury several social media posts, messages and emails sent to Carroll in the following days after Trump's statements.\n\n\"I sued to get my reputation back,\" Carroll said.\n\nBut Trump's lawyer, Alina Habba, argued damages ought not be traced back to Trump himself. Habba also showed the jury several social media posts, but these were posted in the five-hour \"gap\" between Carroll's allegations being published and Trump making the comments he is being sued over.\n\nHabba also focused on the praise and support Carroll received for her allegation and questioned the writer's motive for suing and for deleting threats sent to her email.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump leaves Trump Tower for Manhattan federal court for the second defamation trial against him on Jan. 22.

But it was short-lived - only a few minutes.\n\nIn testimony he said he \"100%\" stood by his previous deposition. Asked by his lawyer if he ever instructed anyone to hurt Carroll, Trump said that he didn't, and just wanted to defend himself, his family and his presidency.\n\nBeyond his testimony, Trump was present for several days of the trial and was vocal about the case outside the courtroom.\n\nDuring the first day of testimony, he was reprimanded by Judge Kaplan for making comments during Carroll's time on the stand. Carroll's lawyers twice flagged that they could hear him and the jury might be able to as well. Kaplan warned Trump that his right to be present could be taken away.\n\nTrump also spoke out during campaign rallies in Iowa and New Hampshire, and to reporters in New York, about his belief this trial is election interference - often reiterating claims similar to those he was being sued over.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Jean Carroll.\n\nAfter a nine-day civil trial in 2023, a jury determined that the plaintiff, E. Jean Carroll, was sexually abused by Donald Trump at a Manhattan department store in 1996. The jury also found that Trump defamed her in statements made in 2022.\n\nThe jury awarded her a total of $5 million in compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nTrump appealed. He contended the trial court judge erred in several rulings - including decisions to allow the testimony of two women who alleged that Trump sexually assaulted them in the past. He also said the judge should not have allowed the jury to hear the 2005 Access Hollywood recording where Trump described how he kissed and grabbed women without first obtaining their consent.\n\nIn a 77-page ruling , a three-judge panel said the President-elect did not demonstrate that the district court erred in any of the challenged rulings. In addition, the appeals court said none of Trump's claims affected his \"substantial rights\" and it did not warrant a new trial.\n\n\"Both E. Jean Carroll and I are gratified by today's decision. We thank the Second Circuit for its careful consideration of the parties' arguments,\" said Roberta Kaplan, attorney for E. Jean Carroll.\n\nIn a statement, Trump spokesman Steven Cheung derided the federal appeals court decision. \"The American People have re-elected President Trump with an overwhelming mandate, and they demand an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and a swift dismissal of all of the Witch Hunts, including the Democrat-funded Carroll Hoax, which will continue to be appealed.\"\n\nIn 2024, a different New York jury in state court ordered Trump to pay Carroll $83 million.

This is her second lawsuit against him.\n\nU.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan has already ruled Trump is liable for defamation but a jury must decide how much he owes her.\n\nTrump's appearance in the New York courtroom comes just days after he won the New Hampshire primary and became the prohibitive GOP front-runner. The case is one of several involving Trump, who is also awaiting a verdict in a civil trial that could result in him paying at least $250 million to New York state for his business practices, which have been deemed by a judge to be fraudulent. He could also be prohibited from doing business in the state where he made his name as a real estate mogul. In all, Trump faces 91 charges in federal and state trials, ranging from the ones in New York to those at the federal level related to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.\n\nClosing arguments in the Carroll case are set for Friday.\n\nIn 2019, Carroll, an advice columnist and freelance writer, accused Trump of sexually assaulting her in the 1990s. The accusation, which was detailed in her book, was first previewed in a New York magazine article. After the article published, Trump issued two statements in response to reporters, including one in which he outright denied her claim and said she was \"not my type.\"\n\nCarroll then sued Trump for defamation, arguing that his comments ruined her reputation as a trusted source in the media and resulted in a slew of insults and threatening messages, emails and comments to her social media accounts.\n\nAt the time, then-Trump-appointed Attorney General Bill Barr blocked the lawsuit, arguing that Trump's comments were made in his official capacity as president. This caused the lawsuit to be stuck in court for several years.\n\nIn 2022, Carroll sued Trump again, this time for sexual assault and for another instance of defamation. This went to trial in 2023 - after Trump left the White House - where a jury found Trump liable for both assault and defamation ; Trump was ordered to pay Carroll $5 million.\n\nAlso in 2023, Biden's Justice Department reversed course and allowed the first lawsuit on defamation to move forward. In part because of the 2023 decision that had found Trump liable for assault, Judge Kaplan ruled that defamation also happened in 2019 and that Trump is also liable.\n\nDue to that ruling, the only thing this jury has to decide is how much money Trump owes Carroll, which could be higher than before.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Jean Carroll.\n\nCarroll previously brought a civil lawsuit against Trump, alleging he raped her in a Manhattan department store and then defamed her when he denied her story. Last spring, a jury found Trump had sexually abused Carroll and then defamed her, awarding her $5 million in damages\n\nBut this trial, which is expected to wrap up this month, is for a separate incident of defamation - specifically when as president, Trump said Carroll \"is not my type.\"\n\nCarroll had filed this defamation lawsuit four years ago, but was blocked by Trump's Attorney General Bill Barr who argued Trump spoke within the bounds of his office as president. But last summer, the Biden administration's Justice Department reversed its decision that Trump had immunity, allowing the trial to proceed.\n\n\"I have no idea who this woman is. I have absolutely no idea. The whole thing is ridiculous,\" he told reporters last week. \"I'm going to go to it and I'm going to explain I don't know who the hell she is.\"\n\nThe former president, fresh off a resounding win in the Iowa caucuses, is not required to attend the trial. Trump's lawyer Alina Habba requested the trial be moved and notified the judge that Trump would be unable to attend the trial on Wednesday and Thursday this week because he will instead attend the Florida funeral of his m other-in-law who passed away last week .\n\nTrump is also slated for several campaign events in New Hampshire this week, including one Wednesday night.\n\nNew York district Judge Lewis Kaplan denied the request but will allow the trial, which is only expected to last a few days, to slip into next Monday if Trump's testimony is left.\n\nLast week, Kaplan said \"the fact that Mr. Trump sexually abused - indeed, raped - Ms. Carroll has been conclusively established,\" thereby blocking Trump's lawyers from arguing this week that he did not rape Carroll . Ahead of the start of the trial, Kaplan underscored that this trial is limited to the issue of damages sustained as a result of Trump's statements made in June 2019 .\n\n\"Those statements already have been determined to have been false, defamatory, and made with constitutional actual malice,\" Kaplan wrote .\n\nLeft to be decided in this trial is how much money Trump must pay Carroll. The penalty is expected to be higher than the first one.\n\nThe trial in Manhattan will take place a day after the Iowa caucuses and as voters in New Hampshire are preparing to cast their ballots in next week's Republican primary. In a press conference last week, Trump doubled down that he believed, without evidence, that this trial is politically motivated.\n\nIn a letter to Judge Kaplan sent last week, Carroll's lawyers urged the court to take preventative measures to \"ensure that Mr. Trump does not present inadmissible, prejudicial, or otherwise improper information to the jury\" should he seek to testify.\n\n\"The Court will take such measures as it finds appropriate to avoid circumvention of its rulings and of the law,\" Kaplan wrote over the weekend .\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Santiago/Getty Images hide caption\n\nTrump held a press conference after leaving the second day of his defamation trial involving a case brought by E. Jean Carroll.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump spent his week whiplashing between courtrooms and political rallies.\n\nFresh off a primary win in Iowa and just before voters in New Hampshire head to the polls Tuesday, the front-runner for the GOP nomination attended his defamation trial in New York. Writer E. Jean Carroll sued Trump in 2019, accusing him of ruining her reputation when he called her a liar and denied her accusations of sexual assault. Now a jury will decide how much money, if any, Trump owes Carroll in damages.\n\n\"I'm here because Donald Trump assaulted me and when I wrote about it, he lied,\" Carroll said earlier this week when testifying.\n\nTrump has been quick to defend himself, speaking at a rally last week in Iowa ahead of the trial, and on Thursday night before heading to New Hampshire, about the case.\n\n\"That's a nasty man, a nasty guy. He's a Trump-hating guy and it's obvious to everyone in the courtroom. It's a disgrace,\" Trump said of Judge Lewis Kaplan, who is presiding over the trial. And he added of Carroll: \"This is a person who, until this happened, I had no idea who she was and nor could I care less. It's a rigged deal and a made-up fabricated story.\"\n\nThe trial this week kicked off with the selection of nine anonymous jurors and it is expected to wrap up next week.\n\nIt is one of several cases involving Trump, who is also awaiting a verdict in a civil trial that could result in him paying at least $250 million to New York state for his business practices, which have been deemed by a judge to be fraudulent. He could also be prohibited from doing business in the state where he made his name as a real estate mogul.

Jean Carroll (center) and her attorney Roberta Kaplan leave Manhattan Federal Court on Thursday in New York City.\n\nCarroll herself was the first witness to take the stand - putting her face to face with Trump, who attended the first two days of the trial.\n\nCarroll testified that she felt as if Trump calling her a liar \"ended the world I had been living in.\"\n\nWhile she used to receive hundreds of requests to her column email asking for advice, now she received fewer than 10 a month , she said. Instead, she said, she received threats and insults. Carroll's lawyer showed the jury several social media posts, messages and emails sent to Carroll in the days after Trump's statements.\n\n\"I sued to get my reputation back,\" Carroll said.\n\nBut Trump's lawyer, Alina Habba, argued that damages ought not be traced back to Trump himself. Habba also showed the jury several social media posts, but these were posted in the five-hour \"gap\" between Carroll's allegations being published and Trump making the comments he is being sued over.\n\nHabba also focused on the praise and support Carroll received for her allegation and questioned the writer's motive for suing and for deleting threats sent to her email.\n\nThe jury also heard from Ashlee Humphries, a professor at Northwestern, who was hired by Carroll's legal team to calculate damages.\n\nHumphries testified that she believed there was \"severe\" damage to Carroll's reputation as a journalist - a conclusion she came to after analyzing the reach of social media posts, news articles and TV broadcasts that included Trump's statements.\n\nBut Trump's lawyers looked to limit the association to damages by arguing that comments and public opinion cannot be exclusively attributed to Trump's two statements.\n\nThe trial will resume Monday with continued testimony from the plaintiff's team. The jurors will likely hear from an editor at Elle , the magazine where Carroll once worked.\n\nThe defense will then bring up their witnesses, which may include Trump. Speaking on Thursday, the former president said he wanted to attend every day of the trial. He missed Thursday to attend his mother-in-law's funeral in Florida.\n\nPosting to social media, Trump also indicated he will be spending much of his time campaigning in New Hampshire next week.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Matt Rourke/AP hide caption\n\nRepublican former President Donald Trump speaks at a primary election night party in January in Nashua, N.H.\n\nNEW YORK - Former President Donald Trump has secured a bond sufficient to support an $83.3 million jury award granted to writer E. Jean Carroll during a January defamation trial stemming from rape claims she made against Trump, his lawyer said Friday as she notified the federal judge who oversaw the trial that an appeal was underway.\n\nAttorney Alina Habba filed papers with the New York judge to show that Trump had secured a $91.6 million bond from the Federal Insurance Co. She simultaneously filed a notice of appeal to show Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential front-runner, is appealing the verdict to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe filings came a day after Judge Lewis A. Kaplan refused to delay a Monday deadline for posting a bond to ensure that the 80-year-old Carroll can collect the $83.3 million if it remains intact following appeals.\n\nThe posting of the bond was a necessary step to delay payment of the award until the 2nd Circuit can rule.\n\nTrump is facing financial pressure to set aside money to cover both the judgment in the Carroll case and an even bigger one in a lawsuit in which he was found liable for lying about his wealth in financial statements given to banks.\n\nA New York judge recently refused to halt collection of a $454 million civil fraud penalty while Trump appeals. He now has until March 25 to either pay up or buy a bond covering the full amount. In the meantime, interest on the judgment continues to mount, adding roughly $112,000 each day.\n\nTrump's lawyers have asked for that judgment to be stayed on appeal, warning he might need to sell some properties to cover the penalty.\n\nOn Thursday, Kaplan wrote that any financial harm to Trump results from his slow response to the late-January verdict in the defamation case over statements he made about Carroll while he was president in 2019 after she claimed in a memoir that he raped her in spring 1996 in a midtown Manhattan luxury department store dressing room.\n\nTrump vehemently denied the claims, saying that he didn't know her and that the encounter at a Bergdorf Goodman store across the street from Trump Tower never took place.\n\nA jury last May awarded Carroll $5 million after concluding that Trump sexually abused Carroll in the 1996 encounter, though it rejected Carroll's rape claims, as rape was defined by New York state law. A portion of the award also stemmed from the jury's finding that Trump defamed Carroll with statements he made in October 2022.\n\nThe January trial pertained solely to statements Trump made in 2019 while he was president. Kaplan instructed the jury that it must accept the findings of the jury last May and was only deciding how much, if anything, Trump owed Carroll for his 2019 statements.\n\nTrump did not attend the May trial, but he testified briefly and regularly sat with defense lawyers at the January trial, though his behavior, including disparaging comments that a lawyer for Carroll said were loud enough for jurors to hear, prompted Kaplan to threaten to banish him from the courtroom.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "E. Jean Carroll testifies against Trump once more\n\nBy\n\nMary Louise Kelly\n\n,\n\nTyler Bartlam\n\nThe writer E. Jean Carroll testified today in her defamation case against former President Trump, saying that his remarks about her \"shattered\" her reputation.\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Former President Donald Trump went face-to-face with his accuser, E. Jean Carroll, in a New York courtroom today. Carroll is seeking damages against Trump for defamation stemming from when she went public with her account of a sexual attack in the mid-1990s. Today, she testified about the fallout from Trump's repeated false assertion that she made up her story. NPR's Andrea Bernstein was there. She's on the line now from outside the courthouse. Hey there. ANDREA BERNSTEIN, BYLINE: Hey, Mary Louise. KELLY: OK, so we got to hear from Carroll on the stand today. What did she say? BERNSTEIN: It was an extraordinary scene. Many women have accused Trump of sexual assault and then lying about them when they speak up. But here was a woman who Trump has verbally attacked, sitting just 30 feet away from him, detailing what he had said in the White House, at campaign rallies, on social media and on TV, and then describing how she received what she called a flood of slime from his supporters. And he sat there as Carroll's lawyers displayed both his statements and the attacks on her by his supporters. KELLY: And what exactly was her testimony? BERNSTEIN: So this case is not about the sexual attack in a New York - a department store in the 1990s. Trump's liability for that was established in an earlier trial last May. This case is about defamation, beginning just hours after Carroll published an excerpt from an upcoming book in June of 2019. Carroll said she expected Trump to say the sex was consensual, not that it never happened, that he didn't know her, that she was a liar, and that, quote, \"people have to be careful because they are playing with very dangerous territory,\" which is what he did say while president. She described how, just hours after he made his first remarks, she was alone in a hotel room in Manhattan and began to receive insults and threats that tracked Trump's language. It was a, quote, \"new world\" for her after that, she said. KELLY: And Andrea, the damages that she's seeking - what specifically is she saying she should be paid damages for? BERNSTEIN: Carroll said she lost her column, and freelance offers dried up after Trump's attacks, that her credibility as a journalist and advice columnist had been irreparably harmed, that after receiving a barrage of threats calling her ugly and a hag, there were days she couldn't get out of bed. Many days, she feared for her life. After Carroll described the initial threats after Trump's remarks in 2019, her lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, asked when the threats stopped, and Carroll said, they've never stopped. Each Trump - time Trump made a statement, she said, she's received threats, many of which I can't say on the radio. She was called an ugly hag and told she deserved to be raped and murdered. She testified Trump has attacked her as recently as this past weekend. Trump said it was, quote, \"a totally fabricated story.\" Even yesterday, Trump called Carroll a liar in a social media post. Even today, in the courtroom, he attacked her credibility. KELLY: What exactly happened in the courtroom, then? BERNSTEIN: So at one point, the plaintiff played a video clip of Trump speaking on CNN last May. That was in that town hall right after the verdict in the first trial. Trump said in the video, quote, \"I swear on my children - and I never say that - it never happened. This woman is a whack job.\" And while they were playing the video, I could hear Trump, who was maybe 10 feet away from me and also about that far from the jury, saying, that's true. KELLY: Andrea, what did the judge have to say about that? BERNSTEIN: There were several objections by Carroll's lawyers to Trump's running audible commentary on her testimony. Just before lunch, attorney Shawn Crowley said she could hear Trump saying, it is a witch hunt. It really is a con job. It's true. The judge, Lewis Kaplan, turned to Trump's lawyer and said, Mr. Trump has a right to be here. That right can be forfeited if he is disruptive. Then the judge spoke directly to Trump and said, I don't want to have to consider excusing you from the trial. At which point, Trump said, I would love that - twice. The judge said to Trump, I know you would. You just can't help yourself. Trump said, you can't either. And then it was lunch. KELLY: It sounds like just another wild day in the courtroom. How are Trump's lawyers handling all this? BERNSTEIN: In cross-examination, Trump attorney Alina Habba suggested Carroll was getting as many accolades as she was negative responses, that she enjoyed the publicity her book got her. Their goal is to mitigate damages. KELLY: And, just quickly, what's next? BERNSTEIN: Just after court, Carroll said, Trump once again said that the story was made up - that Carroll's story was made up. He won't be in court tomorrow but will be back Monday, most likely, and there will be cross-examination of Carroll and other witnesses tomorrow.

Carroll is seeking damages against Trump for defamation stemming from when she went public with her account of a sexual attack in the mid-1990s. Today, she testified about the fallout from Trump's repeated false assertion that she made up her story. NPR's Andrea Bernstein was there. She's on the line now from outside the courthouse. Hey there. ANDREA BERNSTEIN, BYLINE: Hey, Mary Louise. KELLY: OK, so we got to hear from Carroll on the stand today. What did she say? BERNSTEIN: It was an extraordinary scene. Many women have accused Trump of sexual assault and then lying about them when they speak up. But here was a woman who Trump has verbally attacked, sitting just 30 feet away from him, detailing what he had said in the White House, at campaign rallies, on social media and on TV, and then describing how she received what she called a flood of slime from his supporters. And he sat there as Carroll's lawyers displayed both his statements and the attacks on her by his supporters. KELLY: And what exactly was her testimony? BERNSTEIN: So this case is not about the sexual attack in a New York - a department store in the 1990s. Trump's liability for that was established in an earlier trial last May. This case is about defamation, beginning just hours after Carroll published an excerpt from an upcoming book in June of 2019. Carroll said she expected Trump to say the sex was consensual, not that it never happened, that he didn't know her, that she was a liar, and that, quote, \"people have to be careful because they are playing with very dangerous territory,\" which is what he did say while president. She described how, just hours after he made his first remarks, she was alone in a hotel room in Manhattan and began to receive insults and threats that tracked Trump's language. It was a, quote, \"new world\" for her after that, she said. KELLY: And Andrea, the damages that she's seeking - what specifically is she saying she should be paid damages for? BERNSTEIN: Carroll said she lost her column, and freelance offers dried up after Trump's attacks, that her credibility as a journalist and advice columnist had been irreparably harmed, that after receiving a barrage of threats calling her ugly and a hag, there were days she couldn't get out of bed. Many days, she feared for her life. After Carroll described the initial threats after Trump's remarks in 2019, her lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, asked when the threats stopped, and Carroll said, they've never stopped. Each Trump - time Trump made a statement, she said, she's received threats, many of which I can't say on the radio. She was called an ugly hag and told she deserved to be raped and murdered. She testified Trump has attacked her as recently as this past weekend. Trump said it was, quote, \"a totally fabricated story.\" Even yesterday, Trump called Carroll a liar in a social media post. Even today, in the courtroom, he attacked her credibility. KELLY: What exactly happened in the courtroom, then? BERNSTEIN: So at one point, the plaintiff played a video clip of Trump speaking on CNN last May. That was in that town hall right after the verdict in the first trial. Trump said in the video, quote, \"I swear on my children - and I never say that - it never happened. This woman is a whack job.\" And while they were playing the video, I could hear Trump, who was maybe 10 feet away from me and also about that far from the jury, saying, that's true. KELLY: Andrea, what did the judge have to say about that? BERNSTEIN: There were several objections by Carroll's lawyers to Trump's running audible commentary on her testimony. Just before lunch, attorney Shawn Crowley said she could hear Trump saying, it is a witch hunt. It really is a con job. It's true. The judge, Lewis Kaplan, turned to Trump's lawyer and said, Mr. Trump has a right to be here. That right can be forfeited if he is disruptive. Then the judge spoke directly to Trump and said, I don't want to have to consider excusing you from the trial. At which point, Trump said, I would love that - twice. The judge said to Trump, I know you would. You just can't help yourself. Trump said, you can't either. And then it was lunch. KELLY: It sounds like just another wild day in the courtroom. How are Trump's lawyers handling all this? BERNSTEIN: In cross-examination, Trump attorney Alina Habba suggested Carroll was getting as many accolades as she was negative responses, that she enjoyed the publicity her book got her. Their goal is to mitigate damages. KELLY: And, just quickly, what's next? BERNSTEIN: Just after court, Carroll said, Trump once again said that the story was made up - that Carroll's story was made up. He won't be in court tomorrow but will be back Monday, most likely, and there will be cross-examination of Carroll and other witnesses tomorrow.

Then the judge spoke directly to Trump and said, I don't want to have to consider excusing you from the trial. At which point, Trump said, I would love that - twice. The judge said to Trump, I know you would. You just can't help yourself. Trump said, you can't either. And then it was lunch. KELLY: It sounds like just another wild day in the courtroom. How are Trump's lawyers handling all this? BERNSTEIN: In cross-examination, Trump attorney Alina Habba suggested Carroll was getting as many accolades as she was negative responses, that she enjoyed the publicity her book got her. Their goal is to mitigate damages. KELLY: And, just quickly, what's next? BERNSTEIN: Just after court, Carroll said, Trump once again said that the story was made up - that Carroll's story was made up. He won't be in court tomorrow but will be back Monday, most likely, and there will be cross-examination of Carroll and other witnesses tomorrow.

BERNSTEIN: So this case is not about the sexual attack in a New York - a department store in the 1990s. Trump's liability for that was established in an earlier trial last May. This case is about defamation, beginning just hours after Carroll published an excerpt from an upcoming book in June of 2019. Carroll said she expected Trump to say the sex was consensual, not that it never happened, that he didn't know her, that she was a liar, and that, quote, \"people have to be careful because they are playing with very dangerous territory,\" which is what he did say while president. She described how, just hours after he made his first remarks, she was alone in a hotel room in Manhattan and began to receive insults and threats that tracked Trump's language. It was a, quote, \"new world\" for her after that, she said. KELLY: And Andrea, the damages that she's seeking - what specifically is she saying she should be paid damages for? BERNSTEIN: Carroll said she lost her column, and freelance offers dried up after Trump's attacks, that her credibility as a journalist and advice columnist had been irreparably harmed, that after receiving a barrage of threats calling her ugly and a hag, there were days she couldn't get out of bed. Many days, she feared for her life. After Carroll described the initial threats after Trump's remarks in 2019, her lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, asked when the threats stopped, and Carroll said, they've never stopped. Each Trump - time Trump made a statement, she said, she's received threats, many of which I can't say on the radio. She was called an ugly hag and told she deserved to be raped and murdered. She testified Trump has attacked her as recently as this past weekend. Trump said it was, quote, \"a totally fabricated story.\" Even yesterday, Trump called Carroll a liar in a social media post. Even today, in the courtroom, he attacked her credibility. KELLY: What exactly happened in the courtroom, then? BERNSTEIN: So at one point, the plaintiff played a video clip of Trump speaking on CNN last May. That was in that town hall right after the verdict in the first trial. Trump said in the video, quote, \"I swear on my children - and I never say that - it never happened. This woman is a whack job.\" And while they were playing the video, I could hear Trump, who was maybe 10 feet away from me and also about that far from the jury, saying, that's true. KELLY: Andrea, what did the judge have to say about that? BERNSTEIN: There were several objections by Carroll's lawyers to Trump's running audible commentary on her testimony. Just before lunch, attorney Shawn Crowley said she could hear Trump saying, it is a witch hunt. It really is a con job. It's true. The judge, Lewis Kaplan, turned to Trump's lawyer and said, Mr. Trump has a right to be here. That right can be forfeited if he is disruptive.

Transcript text may be revised to correct errors or match updates to audio. Audio on npr.org may be edited after its original broadcast or publication. The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nKELLY: And Andrea, the damages that she's seeking - what specifically is she saying she should be paid damages for? BERNSTEIN: Carroll said she lost her column, and freelance offers dried up after Trump's attacks, that her credibility as a journalist and advice columnist had been irreparably harmed, that after receiving a barrage of threats calling her ugly and a hag, there were days she couldn't get out of bed. Many days, she feared for her life. After Carroll described the initial threats after Trump's remarks in 2019, her lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, asked when the threats stopped, and Carroll said, they've never stopped. Each Trump - time Trump made a statement, she said, she's received threats, many of which I can't say on the radio. She was called an ugly hag and told she deserved to be raped and murdered. She testified Trump has attacked her as recently as this past weekend. Trump said it was, quote, \"a totally fabricated story.\" Even yesterday, Trump called Carroll a liar in a social media post. Even today, in the courtroom, he attacked her credibility. KELLY: What exactly happened in the courtroom, then? BERNSTEIN: So at one point, the plaintiff played a video clip of Trump speaking on CNN last May. That was in that town hall right after the verdict in the first trial. Trump said in the video, quote, \"I swear on my children - and I never say that - it never happened. This woman is a whack job.\" And while they were playing the video, I could hear Trump, who was maybe 10 feet away from me and also about that far from the jury, saying, that's true. KELLY: Andrea, what did the judge have to say about that? BERNSTEIN: There were several objections by Carroll's lawyers to Trump's running audible commentary on her testimony. Just before lunch, attorney Shawn Crowley said she could hear Trump saying, it is a witch hunt. It really is a con job. It's true. The judge, Lewis Kaplan, turned to Trump's lawyer and said, Mr. Trump has a right to be here. That right can be forfeited if he is disruptive. Then the judge spoke directly to Trump and said, I don't want to have to consider excusing you from the trial. At which point, Trump said, I would love that - twice. The judge said to Trump, I know you would. You just can't help yourself. Trump said, you can't either. And then it was lunch. KELLY: It sounds like just another wild day in the courtroom. How are Trump's lawyers handling all this? BERNSTEIN: In cross-examination, Trump attorney Alina Habba suggested Carroll was getting as many accolades as she was negative responses, that she enjoyed the publicity her book got her. Their goal is to mitigate damages. KELLY: And, just quickly, what's next? BERNSTEIN: Just after court, Carroll said, Trump once again said that the story was made up - that Carroll's story was made up. He won't be in court tomorrow but will be back Monday, most likely, and there will be cross-examination of Carroll and other witnesses tomorrow.

BERNSTEIN: In cross-examination, Trump attorney Alina Habba suggested Carroll was getting as many accolades as she was negative responses, that she enjoyed the publicity her book got her. Their goal is to mitigate damages. KELLY: And, just quickly, what's next? BERNSTEIN: Just after court, Carroll said, Trump once again said that the story was made up - that Carroll's story was made up. He won't be in court tomorrow but will be back Monday, most likely, and there will be cross-examination of Carroll and other witnesses tomorrow.

BERNSTEIN: There were several objections by Carroll's lawyers to Trump's running audible commentary on her testimony. Just before lunch, attorney Shawn Crowley said she could hear Trump saying, it is a witch hunt. It really is a con job. It's true.

Jean Carroll\n\nBy\n\nAndrea Bernstein\n\nFormer President Trump, in brief testimony in the defamation trial brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll, insisted that he stood by his previous recorded statement and didn't intend to harm Carroll.\n\nJUANA SUMMERS, HOST: Donald Trump testified for just minutes today in his own defense in the defamation lawsuit brought by writer E. Jean Carroll. Carroll sued Trump after he called her a liar when she went public with her account of sexual assault. And as a warning, we will mention explicit details in this conversation. Carroll is now seeking damages for the loss to her reputation, and she's looking to punish Trump for his verbal attacks. NPR's Andrea Bernstein was in court today. Hi there. ANDREA BERNSTEIN, BYLINE: Hey, Juana. SUMMERS: Andrea, describe the scene, if you can. BERNSTEIN: There had been a full morning of testimony. I'll get to that in a minute. And then promptly after lunch, out of the presence of the jury, Judge Lewis Kaplan told the former president he was not allowed to relitigate the findings of the jury in Carroll's first trial last spring. Trump chose not to testify in his own defense in that trial, so he will not have a chance to deny the assault allegations to a jury, which, based on his outbursts inside the courtroom, he seemed to want to do. This is pretty graphic, but as the judge put it, it is established that, quote, \"Mr. Trump in fact sexually abused Ms. Carroll by forcibly inserting his fingers into her vagina.\" When Kaplan said this, Trump said, ugh - loudly. But Kaplan was being very clear - he did it, and that's the law. Then there was a back-and-forth with Trump's attorney, Alina Habba, where Judge Kaplan wanted to know exactly what Trump was going to say. And while she was speaking, Trump said from the defense table, I never met the woman. I don't know who the woman is. SUMMERS: Did the judge succeed in keeping Trump from speaking out of order in front of the jury? BERNSTEIN: Basically, yes. At about 2:15 p.m., Trump walked heavily from the defense table to the witness stand, put up his right hand, and swore to tell the truth. The first question was about recorded pretrial testimony Trump had given in Carroll's first case that had been played earlier in the day, in which he was questioned, among other things, about saying Carroll was, quote, \"not his type\" from the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office. Did Trump stand by this deposition? - he was asked. One hundred percent was the answer. Did you deny the allegations because Ms. Carroll made an accusation? Yes, I did. Did he instruct anyone to harm Ms. Carroll? He answered, I just wanted to defend myself, my family and the presidency - though the jury was instructed to disregard everything after defend myself. After a few questions from the plaintiffs, Trump left the stand. The defense rested. The plaintiffs offered no rebuttal, and the jury was told there will be closing arguments and instructions tomorrow. They'll get the case by lunchtime. Then, Trump left the courtroom with his large entourage, saying, as he walked down the courtroom aisle, this is not America, which he repeated three times. SUMMERS: OK. And Andrea, what else happened today? BERNSTEIN: The plaintiffs called E. Jean Carroll's former editor at Elle, who described her as, quote, \"a truth-teller and one of the most popular writers.\" The defense then called Carol Martin, a former news anchor in New York City in the 1990s and a friend of Carroll's. She'd written a text message to a third party, saying that Carroll was, quote - was acting like, quote, \"Santa at a Christmas parade\" - that is, enjoying the attention. Martin acknowledged those words but said she regretted writing them and other texts like that - that they didn't reflect her feelings. SUMMERS: All right. Last thing here - any bets on when the jury might decide? BERNSTEIN: So I have given up making predictions in this case, but I will say all the jury has to decide is how much Carroll should be paid. The plaintiffs have so far asked for not less than $10 million. SUMMERS: NPR's Andrea Bernstein. Andrea, thank you. BERNSTEIN: Thank you. Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The first question was about recorded pretrial testimony Trump had given in Carroll's first case that had been played earlier in the day, in which he was questioned, among other things, about saying Carroll was, quote, \"not his type\" from the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office. Did Trump stand by this deposition? - he was asked. One hundred percent was the answer. Did you deny the allegations because Ms. Carroll made an accusation? Yes, I did. Did he instruct anyone to harm Ms. Carroll? He answered, I just wanted to defend myself, my family and the presidency - though the jury was instructed to disregard everything after defend myself. After a few questions from the plaintiffs, Trump left the stand. The defense rested. The plaintiffs offered no rebuttal, and the jury was told there will be closing arguments and instructions tomorrow. They'll get the case by lunchtime. Then, Trump left the courtroom with his large entourage, saying, as he walked down the courtroom aisle, this is not America, which he repeated three times. SUMMERS: OK. And Andrea, what else happened today? BERNSTEIN: The plaintiffs called E. Jean Carroll's former editor at Elle, who described her as, quote, \"a truth-teller and one of the most popular writers.\" The defense then called Carol Martin, a former news anchor in New York City in the 1990s and a friend of Carroll's. She'd written a text message to a third party, saying that Carroll was, quote - was acting like, quote, \"Santa at a Christmas parade\" - that is, enjoying the attention. Martin acknowledged those words but said she regretted writing them and other texts like that - that they didn't reflect her feelings. SUMMERS: All right. Last thing here - any bets on when the jury might decide? BERNSTEIN: So I have given up making predictions in this case, but I will say all the jury has to decide is how much Carroll should be paid. The plaintiffs have so far asked for not less than $10 million. SUMMERS: NPR's Andrea Bernstein. Andrea, thank you. BERNSTEIN: Thank you. Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

BERNSTEIN: There had been a full morning of testimony. I'll get to that in a minute. And then promptly after lunch, out of the presence of the jury, Judge Lewis Kaplan told the former president he was not allowed to relitigate the findings of the jury in Carroll's first trial last spring. Trump chose not to testify in his own defense in that trial, so he will not have a chance to deny the assault allegations to a jury, which, based on his outbursts inside the courtroom, he seemed to want to do. This is pretty graphic, but as the judge put it, it is established that, quote, \"Mr. Trump in fact sexually abused Ms. Carroll by forcibly inserting his fingers into her vagina.\" When Kaplan said this, Trump said, ugh - loudly. But Kaplan was being very clear - he did it, and that's the law. Then there was a back-and-forth with Trump's attorney, Alina Habba, where Judge Kaplan wanted to know exactly what Trump was going to say. And while she was speaking, Trump said from the defense table, I never met the woman. I don't know who the woman is.

At about 2:15 p.m., Trump walked heavily from the defense table to the witness stand, put up his right hand, and swore to tell the truth. The first question was about recorded pretrial testimony Trump had given in Carroll's first case that had been played earlier in the day, in which he was questioned, among other things, about saying Carroll was, quote, \"not his type\" from the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office. Did Trump stand by this deposition? - he was asked. One hundred percent was the answer. Did you deny the allegations because Ms. Carroll made an accusation? Yes, I did. Did he instruct anyone to harm Ms. Carroll? He answered, I just wanted to defend myself, my family and the presidency - though the jury was instructed to disregard everything after defend myself. After a few questions from the plaintiffs, Trump left the stand. The defense rested. The plaintiffs offered no rebuttal, and the jury was told there will be closing arguments and instructions tomorrow. They'll get the case by lunchtime. Then, Trump left the courtroom with his large entourage, saying, as he walked down the courtroom aisle, this is not America, which he repeated three times. SUMMERS: OK. And Andrea, what else happened today? BERNSTEIN: The plaintiffs called E. Jean Carroll's former editor at Elle, who described her as, quote, \"a truth-teller and one of the most popular writers.\" The defense then called Carol Martin, a former news anchor in New York City in the 1990s and a friend of Carroll's. She'd written a text message to a third party, saying that Carroll was, quote - was acting like, quote, \"Santa at a Christmas parade\" - that is, enjoying the attention. Martin acknowledged those words but said she regretted writing them and other texts like that - that they didn't reflect her feelings. SUMMERS: All right. Last thing here - any bets on when the jury might decide? BERNSTEIN: So I have given up making predictions in this case, but I will say all the jury has to decide is how much Carroll should be paid. The plaintiffs have so far asked for not less than $10 million. SUMMERS: NPR's Andrea Bernstein. Andrea, thank you. BERNSTEIN: Thank you. Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Jean Carroll $83.3 million for defaming her.\n\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST: The jury's in. Its decision is expensive for Donald Trump. E. Jean Carroll had sued the former president for calling her a liar after she said he had sexually assaulted her. Last September, the judge in the case found Trump liable for defaming the columnist. He left the jury to determine how much he should have to pay in damages, if any. They came back with $83.3 million. NPR's Ximena Bustillo has been following the trial. Ximena, thanks so much for being with us. XIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: Yeah, thanks for having me. SIMON: Help us understand what factors the jury had to consider. BUSTILLO: The judge instructed the jury to remember that it did establish last May that Trump sexually assaulted Carroll and that he knew his statements calling her a liar when she went public were defamatory. And so they had three questions to kind of consider. One, did Carroll suffer, quote, \"more than normal damages\" as a result of statements Trump made in 2019? And if so, how much should she receive in compensatory damages? The answer from the jury was yes, and they awarded her $18.3 million. Questions two and three to the jury were whether Trump acted, quote, \"maliciously, out of hatred, ill-will or spite\" or, what they said, in \"willful disregard of Ms. Carroll's rights\" when he made those statements in June 21 and 22, specifically, of 2019, while he was at the White House. And if so, how much should she be paid in punitive damages? The jury, once again, said yes in answer to all the above. And the answer on the money was $65 million. They only really deliberated for a few hours. SIMON: Ximena, you were in the courthouse for part of the trial. What was that like? BUSTILLO: Well, we heard from a lot of witnesses, including both Carroll and Trump themselves - Trump, who spoke very briefly. Carroll's testimony detailed, in large part, the immediate aftermath of Trump's comments from the White House. This is when Trump called Carroll's accusations lies and when she said that she is, quote, \"not his type.\" Now, Carroll testified that after those comments were made, her reputation as a trusted advice columnist and face in the media was affected. She received threats and harassing messages using similar language - that she's a liar out to get Trump and unattractive. Trump's lawyers, on the other hand, argued that Trump was not the cause of the hatred and blowback, and instead, Carroll also received a lot of support and fame because of his comments and because of what she came out with. Trump, in his own testimony, was brief and insisted that his previous recorded statement about the allegations were true and that he did not intend to harm her. When asked by Alina Habba, who is his lawyer, if he ever instructed anyone to hurt Carroll, Trump said, quote, \"I just wanted to defend myself, my family and, frankly, the presidency.\" SIMON: Donald Trump is facing a lot of legal challenges. What could come next in this case and the passel of others he has? BUSTILLO: Trump's lawyer, Habba, said that they would appeal the verdict, which was expected. Following the decision, the Trump 2024 campaign also issued a statement arguing without evidence that the trial is a political weapon against him, and he disagrees with the verdict. The case is one of several involving Trump, who is also awaiting a verdict in a civil trial that could result in him paying at least $250 million to New York state for business practices which have been deemed by a judge to be fraudulent. He could also be prohibited from doing business in the state where he built his business empire and brand. And that verdict could also come before the month's end. In all, Trump faces 91 charges in federal and state courts, ranging from ones in New York that we have just discussed to those at the federal level related to the January 6 Capitol riot. All of this, he's - still while he's running for president and is the leading Republican in the field. So interesting few months ahead for us.

This is when Trump called Carroll's accusations lies and when she said that she is, quote, \"not his type.\" Now, Carroll testified that after those comments were made, her reputation as a trusted advice columnist and face in the media was affected. She received threats and harassing messages using similar language - that she's a liar out to get Trump and unattractive. Trump's lawyers, on the other hand, argued that Trump was not the cause of the hatred and blowback, and instead, Carroll also received a lot of support and fame because of his comments and because of what she came out with. Trump, in his own testimony, was brief and insisted that his previous recorded statement about the allegations were true and that he did not intend to harm her. When asked by Alina Habba, who is his lawyer, if he ever instructed anyone to hurt Carroll, Trump said, quote, \"I just wanted to defend myself, my family and, frankly, the presidency.\" SIMON: Donald Trump is facing a lot of legal challenges. What could come next in this case and the passel of others he has? BUSTILLO: Trump's lawyer, Habba, said that they would appeal the verdict, which was expected. Following the decision, the Trump 2024 campaign also issued a statement arguing without evidence that the trial is a political weapon against him, and he disagrees with the verdict. The case is one of several involving Trump, who is also awaiting a verdict in a civil trial that could result in him paying at least $250 million to New York state for business practices which have been deemed by a judge to be fraudulent. He could also be prohibited from doing business in the state where he built his business empire and brand. And that verdict could also come before the month's end. In all, Trump faces 91 charges in federal and state courts, ranging from ones in New York that we have just discussed to those at the federal level related to the January 6 Capitol riot. All of this, he's - still while he's running for president and is the leading Republican in the field. So interesting few months ahead for us.

Jean Carroll had sued the former president for calling her a liar after she said he had sexually assaulted her. Last September, the judge in the case found Trump liable for defaming the columnist. He left the jury to determine how much he should have to pay in damages, if any. They came back with $83.3 million. NPR's Ximena Bustillo has been following the trial. Ximena, thanks so much for being with us. XIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: Yeah, thanks for having me. SIMON: Help us understand what factors the jury had to consider. BUSTILLO: The judge instructed the jury to remember that it did establish last May that Trump sexually assaulted Carroll and that he knew his statements calling her a liar when she went public were defamatory. And so they had three questions to kind of consider. One, did Carroll suffer, quote, \"more than normal damages\" as a result of statements Trump made in 2019? And if so, how much should she receive in compensatory damages? The answer from the jury was yes, and they awarded her $18.3 million. Questions two and three to the jury were whether Trump acted, quote, \"maliciously, out of hatred, ill-will or spite\" or, what they said, in \"willful disregard of Ms. Carroll's rights\" when he made those statements in June 21 and 22, specifically, of 2019, while he was at the White House. And if so, how much should she be paid in punitive damages? The jury, once again, said yes in answer to all the above. And the answer on the money was $65 million. They only really deliberated for a few hours. SIMON: Ximena, you were in the courthouse for part of the trial. What was that like? BUSTILLO: Well, we heard from a lot of witnesses, including both Carroll and Trump themselves - Trump, who spoke very briefly.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nQuestions two and three to the jury were whether Trump acted, quote, \"maliciously, out of hatred, ill-will or spite\" or, what they said, in \"willful disregard of Ms. Carroll's rights\" when he made those statements in June 21 and 22, specifically, of 2019, while he was at the White House. And if so, how much should she be paid in punitive damages? The jury, once again, said yes in answer to all the above. And the answer on the money was $65 million. They only really deliberated for a few hours. SIMON: Ximena, you were in the courthouse for part of the trial. What was that like? BUSTILLO: Well, we heard from a lot of witnesses, including both Carroll and Trump themselves - Trump, who spoke very briefly. Carroll's testimony detailed, in large part, the immediate aftermath of Trump's comments from the White House. This is when Trump called Carroll's accusations lies and when she said that she is, quote, \"not his type.\" Now, Carroll testified that after those comments were made, her reputation as a trusted advice columnist and face in the media was affected. She received threats and harassing messages using similar language - that she's a liar out to get Trump and unattractive. Trump's lawyers, on the other hand, argued that Trump was not the cause of the hatred and blowback, and instead, Carroll also received a lot of support and fame because of his comments and because of what she came out with. Trump, in his own testimony, was brief and insisted that his previous recorded statement about the allegations were true and that he did not intend to harm her. When asked by Alina Habba, who is his lawyer, if he ever instructed anyone to hurt Carroll, Trump said, quote, \"I just wanted to defend myself, my family and, frankly, the presidency.\" SIMON: Donald Trump is facing a lot of legal challenges. What could come next in this case and the passel of others he has? BUSTILLO: Trump's lawyer, Habba, said that they would appeal the verdict, which was expected. Following the decision, the Trump 2024 campaign also issued a statement arguing without evidence that the trial is a political weapon against him, and he disagrees with the verdict. The case is one of several involving Trump, who is also awaiting a verdict in a civil trial that could result in him paying at least $250 million to New York state for business practices which have been deemed by a judge to be fraudulent. He could also be prohibited from doing business in the state where he built his business empire and brand. And that verdict could also come before the month's end. In all, Trump faces 91 charges in federal and state courts, ranging from ones in New York that we have just discussed to those at the federal level related to the January 6 Capitol riot. All of this, he's - still while he's running for president and is the leading Republican in the field. So interesting few months ahead for us.

      "text": "The second Trump and E. Jean Carroll defamation trial commences\n\nBy\n\nAndrea Bernstein\n\n,\n\nJuana Summers\n\n,\n\nMegan Lim\n\n,\n\nJustine Kenin\n\nAnother New York trial against former President Donald Trump is expected to begin today: the second defamation case brought by writer E. Jean Carroll.\n\nJUANA SUMMERS, HOST: Last night, former President Donald Trump won the Iowa caucus, and today he sat in a Manhattan courtroom as a judge told potential jurors in a defamation case that Trump had already been found last summer to have sexually abused the writer E. Jean Carroll in the 1990s. This defamation trial could last three to five days, and Trump could end up paying Carroll more than the $5 million that he was ordered to pay her last May. NPR's Andrea Bernstein was in court today. She joins us now from a coffee shop outside the courthouse. Hey there. ANDREA BERNSTEIN, BYLINE: Hey, Juana. SUMMERS: So, Andrea, tell us what it was like in court today. What did you see and hear? BERNSTEIN: So this is now the third trial I've been to where Trump or his company has been a defendant, but the first time that the president will be judged by a jury of his peers. So there was a real drama in the jury selection. There were the usual questions. Do you personally know the defendant, Donald Trump, or the plaintiff, E. Jean Carroll? But also the jurors were asked, have you been to a Trump rally? One person said yes. Do you believe that the 2020 election was stolen? A couple of prospective jurors raised their hands. Have you ever worked for the campaign of Obama, Clinton or Joe Biden? One of the prospective jurors said she'd made phone calls for Joe Biden in 2020. None of those people were selected. But President Trump - former President Trump was in the courtroom and was really craning his neck and really scrutinizing the prospective jurors who were answering the questions. SUMMERS: And as we mentioned, Trump was previously ordered to pay Carroll $5 million. So this defamation case, what's at stake here? BERNSTEIN: So this is the second of two trials. The first trial, where Trump was found liable, was over a statement that he made in 2022, where he called Carroll a liar. That case was also about the existence of the assault under a New York law that lasted for the year 2022, the Adult Survivors Act. This case is for an earlier incident in 2019 while Trump was president. For complex legal reasons, this one is just coming to trial. But, stay with me, because it was already established that Trump forced himself on E. Jean Carroll and that he lied about it, the only issue in this case is how much Trump will have to pay for calling her a liar, saying he didn't know her and saying, quote, \"she's not my type.\" SUMMERS: I understand that there were opening statements. What did the lawyers, both Carroll's and Trump's, have to say? BERNSTEIN: Plaintiff's attorney Shawn Crowley said, quote, of Donald Trump, \"he was the president. He used the world's biggest microphone to attack Ms. Carroll, to humiliate her, everything that she said was a lie.\" Crowley said Trump supporters sent E. Jean Carroll rape threats after he made his statements about her and death threats, and that Donald Trump had, quote, \"set them in motion.\" And Crowley said, quote, \"they should make Donald Trump to pay to make him stop,\" that, quote, \"his lies continue to this day - literally today.\" And indeed, while his case was going on, he posted 22 times on social media, again calling her a liar. Trump's lawyers, meanwhile, argue that Carroll got what she wanted - more fame. Quote, \"she wants a windfall because on social media, some people said some mean things about her.\" SUMMERS: And, Andrea, as we mentioned, this trial could last from three to five days. So pitch us forward. What happens tomorrow? BERNSTEIN: So tomorrow we will hear from E. Jean Carroll. She will talk about the effect, her lawyers say, of Trump's remarks on her career. The next witnesses that we'll hear from include her former editor-in-chief at Elle magazine, an expert witness on damages. And then it'll be the defense case - a friend of E. Jean Carroll's. And, most likely next Monday, former President Trump will testify in his own defense. SUMMERS: NPR's Andrea Bernstein. Thank you. BERNSTEIN: Thank you. Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Jean Carroll in the 1990s. This defamation trial could last three to five days, and Trump could end up paying Carroll more than the $5 million that he was ordered to pay her last May. NPR's Andrea Bernstein was in court today. She joins us now from a coffee shop outside the courthouse. Hey there. ANDREA BERNSTEIN, BYLINE: Hey, Juana. SUMMERS: So, Andrea, tell us what it was like in court today. What did you see and hear? BERNSTEIN: So this is now the third trial I've been to where Trump or his company has been a defendant, but the first time that the president will be judged by a jury of his peers. So there was a real drama in the jury selection. There were the usual questions. Do you personally know the defendant, Donald Trump, or the plaintiff, E. Jean Carroll? But also the jurors were asked, have you been to a Trump rally? One person said yes. Do you believe that the 2020 election was stolen? A couple of prospective jurors raised their hands. Have you ever worked for the campaign of Obama, Clinton or Joe Biden? One of the prospective jurors said she'd made phone calls for Joe Biden in 2020. None of those people were selected. But President Trump - former President Trump was in the courtroom and was really craning his neck and really scrutinizing the prospective jurors who were answering the questions. SUMMERS: And as we mentioned, Trump was previously ordered to pay Carroll $5 million. So this defamation case, what's at stake here? BERNSTEIN: So this is the second of two trials. The first trial, where Trump was found liable, was over a statement that he made in 2022, where he called Carroll a liar. That case was also about the existence of the assault under a New York law that lasted for the year 2022, the Adult Survivors Act. This case is for an earlier incident in 2019 while Trump was president. For complex legal reasons, this one is just coming to trial.

The next witnesses that we'll hear from include her former editor-in-chief at Elle magazine, an expert witness on damages. And then it'll be the defense case - a friend of E. Jean Carroll's. And, most likely next Monday, former President Trump will testify in his own defense. SUMMERS: NPR's Andrea Bernstein. Thank you. BERNSTEIN: Thank you. Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

So there was a real drama in the jury selection. There were the usual questions. Do you personally know the defendant, Donald Trump, or the plaintiff, E. Jean Carroll? But also the jurors were asked, have you been to a Trump rally? One person said yes. Do you believe that the 2020 election was stolen? A couple of prospective jurors raised their hands. Have you ever worked for the campaign of Obama, Clinton or Joe Biden? One of the prospective jurors said she'd made phone calls for Joe Biden in 2020. None of those people were selected. But President Trump - former President Trump was in the courtroom and was really craning his neck and really scrutinizing the prospective jurors who were answering the questions. SUMMERS: And as we mentioned, Trump was previously ordered to pay Carroll $5 million. So this defamation case, what's at stake here? BERNSTEIN: So this is the second of two trials. The first trial, where Trump was found liable, was over a statement that he made in 2022, where he called Carroll a liar. That case was also about the existence of the assault under a New York law that lasted for the year 2022, the Adult Survivors Act. This case is for an earlier incident in 2019 while Trump was president. For complex legal reasons, this one is just coming to trial. But, stay with me, because it was already established that Trump forced himself on E. Jean Carroll and that he lied about it, the only issue in this case is how much Trump will have to pay for calling her a liar, saying he didn't know her and saying, quote, \"she's not my type.\" SUMMERS: I understand that there were opening statements. What did the lawyers, both Carroll's and Trump's, have to say? BERNSTEIN: Plaintiff's attorney Shawn Crowley said, quote, of Donald Trump, \"he was the president. He used the world's biggest microphone to attack Ms. Carroll, to humiliate her, everything that she said was a lie.\" Crowley said Trump supporters sent E. Jean Carroll rape threats after he made his statements about her and death threats, and that Donald Trump had, quote, \"set them in motion.\" And Crowley said, quote, \"they should make Donald Trump to pay to make him stop,\" that, quote, \"his lies continue to this day - literally today.\" And indeed, while his case was going on, he posted 22 times on social media, again calling her a liar. Trump's lawyers, meanwhile, argue that Carroll got what she wanted - more fame. Quote, \"she wants a windfall because on social media, some people said some mean things about her.\" SUMMERS: And, Andrea, as we mentioned, this trial could last from three to five days. So pitch us forward. What happens tomorrow? BERNSTEIN: So tomorrow we will hear from E. Jean Carroll. She will talk about the effect, her lawyers say, of Trump's remarks on her career.

      "text": "What Donald Trump's Criminal Trial Reveals About a Potential Second Trump Administration\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nThere's a tape that both the defense and the prosecution played in summations in former President Donald Trump's criminal trial. In it, you can hear the chaos of Trump's office at Trump Tower in September of 2016: Trump seems to be having multiple conversations almost simultaneously. He talks to an unidentified person on the phone. He discusses polls with Michael Cohen, his executive vice-president at the time. Trump and Cohen talk about a diversity initiative and stopping the media from unsealing the records of Trump's first divorce. His executive assistant pops in with word of a call from a developer. Trump calls for a Coke.\n\nAnd then, very clearly, you can hear Cohen saying , \"I need to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend, David, you know, so that - I'm going to do that right away. I've actually come up and I've spoken ... I've spoken to Allen Weisselberg\" - then the Trump Organization's chief financial officer - \"about how to set the whole thing up.\"\n\nTrump interrupts and says, \"So, what do we got to pay for this, 150?\" Then he says, \"Cash?\"\n\n\"No, no, no, no no,\" Cohen says. \"I got it.\"\n\nOn the most literal level, the tape showed Trump discussing the logistics of paying off a woman who said she had an affair with him. This was key evidence for the jury's ultimate finding that he had intended to alter the outcome of the 2016 election by making unlawful hush money payments.\n\nWhen this tape was first made public, in 2018, it was hard to pin down exactly what it all meant. But as Trump's seven-week trial proceeded, the broader meaning of the tape emerged in sharp relief: Everything is connected in Trump world, ethical borders are easily crossed and Trump is on top of every detail.\n\nThe verdict in the criminal trial provided answers to a narrow series of questions, not least of which was whether a presidential candidate had used illicit means to prevent voters from learning about a payoff to conceal a sexual encounter. (Trump has vowed to appeal.) But the trial also unveiled a broad array of evidence that went far beyond the charges. It revealed a lot about how Trump went about running his company and the presidency - and provided hints of how that might play out in a second Trump administration.\n\nFor most of Trump's presidential term, I co-hosted the ProPublica/WNYC podcast \"Trump, Inc.,\" whose mission was to delve into the conflicts of interest between Trump's business and his presidency. Because there was so much that journalists didn't - and couldn't - understand about a privately held company that clung tightly to its secrets, \"Trump, Inc.\" billed itself as \"an open investigation.\" We were candid about what we did and did not know because we lived in a world of doubt.\n\n\"Trump, Inc.\" uncovered a lot, including unearthing Cohen's dubious connections in 2018 and outlining how his role as Trump's lawyer (then still intact) created a cloak of legal privilege that hid their interactions.\n\nBut we saw just tiny glimpses of the documents that have now been revealed in their entirety in the criminal trial; we had no access to the many Trump employees, current and former, who have now described, under oath, the inner workings of the Trump Organization.\n\nThat testimony confirmed what that tape seemed to show: that Trump pays close, close attention to all his business affairs, and always has. This, in turn, suggests that the mixing of Trump's presidency and business that \"Trump, Inc.\" and others documented occurred under that same watchful eye. And if voters elect Trump a second time - this time knowing that he was convicted of a crime, one where key acts were committed in the Oval Office, on top of his two impeachments - Trump can conclude that America's voters have blessed his way of doing business. There's every reason to believe his conflicts of interest will only be more open and more unapologetic.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump employees testified to his intense level of control in three trials against Trump or his company over the past two years. These were among five trials since 2022, each of which I covered in person, including the criminal trial of his company for tax fraud, two defamation suits brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll and the New York attorney general's civil fraud trial. Each trial ended badly for Trump or his company (and each is being appealed).\n\nDonald Trump's criminal trial in New York offered one sharp revelation after the next. The disclosures came not just from the talked-about witnesses, such as former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker, Stormy Daniels and Cohen himself, but also from Trump's former comptroller, his executive assistant and the aide who sat closest to the Oval Office. Some of these individuals, including a junior bookkeeper for the Trump Organization and the head of the company's accounts payable department, work in Trump Tower to this day.\n\nThe picture that emerges from their testimony is of a boss - \"The Boss\" is what they nearly uniformly call him - who manages the tiniest of details but leaves the faintest of traces of all that management. Up until the throes of the 2016 campaign, Trump had to approve every payment over $2,500, an extraordinarily tiny sum for a mogul with assets around the globe. (For the duration of the campaign, until he became president, that amount inched up, to $10,000.) Trump would reject checks he didn't want to pay and send them back to his underlings, with the word \"VOID\" scrawled on them in Sharpie.\n\nTrump watched every expense in this way, his comptroller Jeff McConney testified. Trump once told him, early in his time at the company, \"You're fired,\" because McConney hadn't made an effort to reduce Trump's bills before presenting Trump with payment documents. \"It was a teaching moment,\" McConney said on the stand. This close attention and tight-fistedness extended company wide: When it came to Trump University, Cohen testified, it was part of his job to offer a vendor 20% of what they were owed, or to pay them nothing at all.\n\nTrump brought this ethos to the White House, where, as his lawyers liked to point out, he was the \"leader of the free world.\" He took time to write \"PAY\" on a $6,974 invoice sent by Trump Organization executive assistant Rhona Graff for an annual membership and \"food minimum\" at the Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck, New York.\n\nTrump, of course, handed over control of the Trump Organization, including the oversight of its payments, to his older sons and Weisselberg at the outset of his administration. But he never gave up ownership of his company. He always made money from it, and does to this day.\n\nAnd Trump, while president, went to extraordinary lengths to keep control of his \"personal\" checking account. That account actually belonged to a Trump Organization business entity , which underscored the lack of separation between Trump and the company he had ostensibly separated himself from. Trump's personal checks were approved by Weisselberg; generated by Deborah Tarasoff, the head of Trump's accounts payable department; stapled to the approved invoice; and sent via FedEx by Trump's junior bookkeeper, Rebecca Manochio, to the Washington home of Trump's bodyguard-turned-White House aide, Keith Schiller, who would bring them over for Trump to sign. That's how the checks that Trump signed to Cohen made their way to the Oval Office.\n\n\"Checks came in a FedEx envelope\" that Schiller delivered, testified Madeleine Westerhout, Trump's director of Oval Office operations. \"I opened the envelope. And inside was a manila folder with a stack of checks. And I brought the manila folder in to the president for him to sign.\"\n\nMoney wasn't the only thing Trump paid close attention to. He wrote all of his social media posts, save for a few written by an aide, Dan Scavino. Sometimes, Trump would dictate tweets to Westerhout. She would type them up, print them out and show them to Trump so the president of the United States could take time to scrutinize, and adjust, the punctuation. \"He liked to use the Oxford comma,\" Westerhout testified.\n\nTrump did not send emails or text messages. This aversion has long been known, but the trial testimony laid out a whole series of ways in which Trump communicated without leaving precise documentation.\n\nHe was on the phone beginning at 6 in the morning and \"late into the night after I went to bed, so I always felt guilty about that,\" Westerhout testified. He'd often use Schiller's cellphone to make calls, and employees would use that number to reach Trump. There were no Trump memos, no notepads, no Post-it notes, just an occasional Sharpie scrawl. And largely, except for Cohen's, no testimony that what these employees did, they did \"at the direction of\" and \"for the benefit of\" Donald Trump. (This was an essential part of the judge's charge to the jury: that Trump \"personally, or by acting in concert with another person or persons, made or caused a false entry in the business records of an enterprise.\")\n\nThis is the backdrop for the conflicts \"Trump, Inc.\" and other news media covered while Trump was president. To recap some of them (at a moment when polls show many Americans have forgotten much of what transpired during his administration): Trump's hotel in Washington became a must stop-by for foreign officials , earning his company millions . He caused the U.S. Treasury to spend more than $1 million to house Secret Service agents in rooms with top-of-the-market rates at Mar-a-Lago and had the government pick up the tab for $1,005.60 in cocktails apparently enjoyed by administration officials and friends at his resort's bar.\n\nDuring Trump's presidency, the response to questions about all this went something like this: As a global businessman, he or his allies would say, how could he possibly pay attention to whether the presidential seal was used on his golf courses ? Or whether his son, Don Jr., was trading on the name \"Donald Trump\" to sell condos in India. Or whether businesspeople with foreign ties were trying to make a buck, or millions, from his presidency?\n\nIndeed, this was part of Trump's defense in the criminal trial, and in the civil fraud trial at which Trump was ordered to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to New York state for what a judge found was a yearslong practice of lying about the value of his assets. When he testified at that civil trial, Trump distanced himself from the fraud: \"All I did was authorize and tell people to give whatever is necessary for the accountants to do the statements,\" he said. And the false statements of financial condition? \"I would look at them, I would see them and maybe on some occasions, I would have some suggestions.\"\n\nAs is his right, Trump chose not to testify at his criminal trial, but his lawyer Todd Blanche argued on his behalf that Trump \"had nothing to do, had nothing to do with the invoice, with the check being generated, or with the entry on the ledger\" and that he was so busy being president he maybe didn't even look at the checks he signed. \"Sometimes he would sign checks even when he was meeting with people, while he was on the phone, and even without reviewing them,\" Blanche said during closing arguments.\n\nThe jury did not buy that defense.\n\nTrump is currently leading in the polls. It's entirely possible he will be elected president. Yet he's continuing to aggressively pursue business deals in countries that will have a long list of issues on which they will be seeking U.S. support.\n\nThe Trump Organization entered a full-on partnership with LIV Golf, an entity majority-owned by the government of Saudi Arabia, for tournaments at his golf courses. And last year, a New York Times reporter and photographer visited what the reporter called a \"multibillion-dollar project backed by Oman's oil-rich government that has an unusual partner: former President Donald J. Trump.\" The project was launched and is being built while Trump is the front-runner for a second presidency. But neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign tried to defend or separate the project from the candidate who, while not running the company, still makes money from it.\n\n\"It's like the Hamptons of the Middle East,\" Eric Trump, who now runs the Trump Organization, told the Times . The paper wrote: \"Oman, in fact, is nothing like the Hamptons. It is a Muslim nation and absolute monarchy, ruled by a sultan, who plays a sensitive role in the Middle East: Oman maintains close ties with Saudi Arabia and its allies, but also with Iran, with which it has considerable trade.\"\n\nIt isn't just the foreign deals. In April, right around the time Trump was about to be criminally tried in New York, he offered oil executives gathered at Mar-a-Lago \"a deal,\" the Washington Post reported . The publication summarized his message as: \"You all are wealthy enough that you should raise $1 billion to return me to the White House.\" In exchange, the Post said, Trump promised to reverse President Joe Biden's initiatives to slow climate change, vowing to roll back some of them \"on Day 1.\"\n\nAnd, as has been widely reported , with Truth Social going public, Trump has set up what Vox called \"a perfect avenue for potential corruption.\" As Vox noted, it's \"a way for Trump's supporters to personally offer him financial support at a time when he desperately needs it.\" By propping up the share price of the stock of the cash-hemorrhaging social media company, shareholders have potentially put billions of dollars in Donald Trump's pocket.\n\nIt's clear that Trump plays favorites and rewards loyalty; nearly eight years after he was inaugurated in 2017, it's hard to imagine that any savvy businessperson or foreign leader fails to recognize this.\n\nCertainly, those who were once in Trump's orbit, if only briefly, testified to the dark side of that equation. Both Cohen and Daniels described the torrent of retribution they've experienced. Trump is unapologetic about his quest for vengeance. As he put it in one social media post last summer, \"IF YOU GO AFTER ME I'M COMING AFTER YOU.\"\n\nMerely having been once employed by Trump seems to have taken a toll, on even relatively minor figures. In the civil fraud trial, Trump's former comptroller, McConney, started weeping when he was asked why he no longer worked at the Trump Organization. He said he could no longer \"deal with\" the legal scrutiny he'd suffered. In the criminal trial, both former communications director Hope Hicks and Westerhout burst into tears on the stand, reflecting on their work history with Trump. Both said they remained loyal, but both had been banished from Trump's graces.\n\nRead More\n\nAnd as for Weisselberg, he was not called to testify in this trial. His previous testimony in the trial of Trump's company resulted in felony convictions on 17 counts and a five-month jail sentence. He is now serving a second jail sentence, in Rikers Island, for committing perjury in Trump's civil fraud trial.\n\nIn the courthouse, Trump spent long stretches of time in an uncomfortable room with the shades always drawn, the fluorescent lighting unforgiving. He was required to listen to weeks of unflattering testimony, including, several times, to his own voice on that tape Cohen made of him, utterly cognizant of the tawdry deal he was striking. Saying, \"So, what do we got to pay for this, 150?\" After all the testimony in his criminal trial, this no longer seems like a random moment. It sounds like who Trump is: his attention to detail, his willingness to subvert the rules, the way he wields money to enhance his power, and vice versa, and is utterly unashamed.\n\nThe public knows all this now.

      "text": "Trump âpress conferenceâ turns into rant against E. Jean Carroll, other accusers\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nNEW YORK, N.Y. âÂ Donald Trump gathered reporters for a âpress conferenceâ that quickly became an extended diatribe against multiple women who have accused him of sexual misconduct. The event ended roughly 50 minutes after it began, with Trump taking no questions.\n\nâFrankly, I know youâre gonna say itâs a terrible thing to say, but it couldnât have happened,â Trump said after describing in detail an allegation from Jessica Leeds over unwanted groping on a flight, which was raised during his E. Jean Carroll trial. âIt didnât happen, and she would not have been the chosen one. She would not have been the chosen one.â\n\nThe Trump Tower event came after he appeared in court that morning to appeal a verdict in a civil trial that found him liable for defamation and sexual abuse against Carroll, who testified that Trump raped her in a dressing room in the 1990s. Trump was ordered to pay Carroll $5 million, and later another $83 million in a related defamation case.\n\nTrump discussed at length the particulars of the case, saying an old photo of him and Carroll together âcould have been AI-generated.â He went on to dispute Carrollâs claim that he preyed on her while at a department store, saying his appearance there would have made the New York Postâs gossip sheet âPage Sixâ if that were true. He asked attendees to view an episode of âLaw & Order: SVUâ that he claimed bore resemblance to her story.\n\nâNever met her, never touched her, never had anything to do with her,â Trump said.\n\nThe ongoing legal battle was clearly weighing on Trumpâs mind âÂ he lashed out at his own attorneys as they stood behind him, stone faced and occasionally glancing at each other, saying he was âdisappointed in my legal talent.â The former president also mocked his advisers, whose advice to avoid further denigrating Carroll he ignored.\n\nOne possible reason for that advice: As Carrollâs lawyer pointed out to the New York Timesâ Maggie Haberman on Friday, Trumpâs comments could spur future defamation lawsuits.\n\nIn this article:\n\nNeedless to say, itâs not typical for candidates to kick off the home stretch of an election by reminding voters about multiple allegations of sexual misconduct against them, including one that was litigated by a jury of their peers. I got messages from folks on both sides of the political aisle expressing confusion over what, exactly, the strategy behind the event was.\n\nBut this isnât even the first time itâs happened for Trump: He did the same thing at the peak of the Republican primaries en route to an easy victory.\n\nDemocrats were initially hesitant to highlight the Carroll legal cases, but theyâve come up in attacks more recently. Harris said in her convention speech last month that Trump was âfound liable for committing sexual abuse.â With a debate just four days away, Harris could have a chance to revisit the topic again in front of a mass audience, particularly given some of Trumpâs more inflammatory remarks today.\n\nAnd, shortly after his remarks wrapped up, news broke that sentencing for the former presidentâs New York hush money case would be delayed until after the election: A big win for Trump that could be overshadowed by his emphasis on todayâs appeals hearing.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

Jean Carroll $83.3 million for defamation\n\nInsights from The Washington Post, Semafor, and NPR\n\nSign up for Semafor Flagship: The daily global news briefing you can trust. Read it now .\n\nA jury on Friday ordered former President Donald Trump to pay writer E. Jean Carroll $83.3 million for defaming her while in office in 2019 after she accused him of raping her in the 1990s. The jury reached a verdict in just under three hours, awarding $18.3 million in compensatory damages and $65 million in punitive damages.\n\nThe second trial in a pair of civil cases Carroll brought against Trump, it focused solely on what the former Elle columnist was owed. A judge had already ruled as defamatory Trumpâs 2019 comments accusing her of lying and saying he couldnât have assaulted her because âsheâs not my typeâ. Carrollâs attorney had asked for $24 million in compensatory damages and âlots and lots of moneyâ in punitive.\n\nA federal jury last May found Trump liable for battery and defamation in the prior case, which centered on comments the former president made in 2022 calling Carrollâs claims that he sexually abused her a âcon jobâ and âhoax.â The jury ordered him to pay her $5 million in damages in that case.\n\nThe latest trial had its share of drama, with U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan threatening to kick Trump out of the courtroom after the former president repeatedly ignored warnings to stop muttering comments such as âcon jobâ and âwitch huntâ in earshot of the jury.\n\nâMr. Trump, I hope I donât have to consider excluding you from the trial. I understand you are very eager for me to do that,â the judge said.\n\nâI would love it,â Trump replied.\n\nâI know you would, because you just canât control yourself in this circumstance, apparently. You just canât,â Kaplan replied.\n\nâNeither can you,â Trump said.\n\nAfter briefly testifying on Thursday, the former president was heard saying âThis is not America. Not America. This is not America,â under his breath as he walked out of the courtroom.\n\nA legal expert told The New York Times that Trump probably assumed he would lose this case, so he set himself up to âclaim that this is a political hit job .â\n\nTrump appeared in court as jury selection began in the case, posting to Truth Social that he had to spend time in a courtroom instead of on the campaign trail because of âa Trump Hating, Radical Left Judge, on a case that is another politically biased WITCH HUNT.â Trump has repeatedly capitalized on his legal woes, after being criminally indicted four times since leaving office, with his best online fundraising days in the first half of last year coinciding with indictments and arraignments, NBC News reported.\n\nThis trial began the day after his sweeping victory in Iowa, underscoring âhow tangled his political and legal calendars are this year â, The Washington Post noted.\n\nKaplan ordered jurorsâ identities to be shielded in this case to prevent harassment, pointing to Trumpâs ârepeated public statementsâ concerning this case and others against him. Judges, law clerks, and other officials involved in Trumpâs cases have been the target of numerous threats .\n\nLegal analyst Lisa Rubin referred to Trumpâs legal strategy as âplaying victim while continuing to threaten and harass the real victim,â adding that Trump attended the trial âso prospective jurors can watch him shake his head no when Judge Kaplan notes Carroll has proven defamation and assault.â\n\nA flurry of high-profile defamation cases has hit the U.S. legal system in the past few years â due in part to Trumpâs advocacy for looser libel laws, The Wall Street Journal reported, as well as Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomasâs 2019 suggestion âthat the high court make it easier to sue news organizations.â\n\nFormer Trump campaign lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Fox News were ordered to pay massive sums for spreading false claims about the 2020 presidential election while conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was ordered to pay almost a billion dollars for claiming the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax.\n\nLegal experts told NPR that while itâs typically difficult to win a defamation suit, the surge of false narratives around the 2020 election brought â a wave of credible cases. â These could have lasting effects by shaping a body of case law that enforces consequences for lying about elections or harassing those who run them, one expert told the outlet.\n\nSign up for Semafor flagship\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives."

Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nA jury found former U.S. President Donald Trump liable in the lawsuit brought against him by writer E. Jean Carroll, who claimed Trump raped her in the mid-1990s.\n\nThe jury rejected the accusation that Trump raped Carroll, but determined that he sexually abused and defamed her. She was awarded $5 million in damages.\n\nThe nine-person jury began deliberations Tuesday after a two-week civil trial and returned with a verdict less than three hours later. Carroll was seeking an undisclosed sum in damages.\n\nIn this article:\n\nCarroll, 79, alleged that the former president raped her in a New York department store dressing room in 1995 or 1996, and later defamed her by denying it happened.\n\nIn finding Trump liable, the jury found that Carroll proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Trump sexually abused her, but not that he raped her. He is likely to appeal the verdict.\n\nIn an all-caps post on Truth Social on Tuesday, Trump said the verdict was a âdisgraceâ and âa continuation of the greatest witch hunt of all time!â\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a 2024 GOP presidential candidate, said the verdict is âanother example of the indefensible behavior of Donald Trump.â\n\nTrumpâs campaign, meanwhile, issued a lengthy statement saying the âbogus caseâ is a political effort targeting Trump since he is a frontrunner in the 2024 presidential race.\n\nA former Elle magazine columnist, Carroll sued Trump for rape and defamation after he denied her allegations on his Truth Social platform in October 2022, saying her case is a âcomplete con job.â She alleged the rape left her unable to enter relationships.\n\nLawyers for Carroll argued that the incident showed a pattern of behavior for the former president, entering the now-infamous Access Hollywood tape, where Trump is caught on a hot mic saying he can âdo anythingâ to women because he is famous, as evidence.\n\nA lawyer for Trump, Joe Tacopina, argued that Carrollâs claim is âan unbelievable work of fiction.â Trump, who told reporters in Ireland last week that he was considering cutting short a trip to his golf course in the country to return home and â confront â Carroll in court, did not testify in his own defense, and the defense did not call any other witnesses.\n\nCarroll filed the lawsuit under a new New York law that gave adult victims a one-time opportunity to file civil sexual abuse lawsuits, even if the statutes of limitations had run out.\n\nRepublican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel did not directly address the verdict when asked about it on Fox News, saying she didnât want to comment on it before Trump did.\n\nâI do think the American people, though, are going to be focused on whatâs happening at our southern border, whatâs happening with inflation, whatâs happening in their lives under the Biden administration,â McDaniel said.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Why team Biden is unlikely to use E. Jean Carroll against Donald Trump\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nE. Jean Carroll, who was awarded more than $83 million in damages on Friday over defamatory statements made by former President Donald Trump, says she wants to do âanythingâ she can to help Joe Biden defeat him. But it seems unlikely that Biden, who has remained quiet on the news, will take her up on the offer.\n\nFridayâs ruling came after a jury last year found Trump liable for sexually assaulting Carroll in a dressing room in 1996. That, combined with this latest news, even prompted Nikki Haley to note that she âtrust[s] the juryâ â a non-defense of Trump virtually unheard of by his Republican opponents this primary cycle. Itâs also brought about questions over when Biden and other Democrats might begin using the case as an attack against Trump, after failing to do so following the prior ruling.\n\nâIn 2016, we all heard a tape in which Trump bragged about doing EXACTLY what he was found liable of doing to E. Jean Carroll, and he was elected anyway,â David Axelrod, formerly Obamaâs senior advisor, texted Semafor. âIt is vile and disgusting. But people are concerned about their own lives, so while this is a piece of an argument it canât be the essence of it.â\n\nThat theory seems to be the most popular one among Democrats close to the White House and those who have run past campaigns against Trump: Voters know who Trump is, they argue, and team Biden is better off focusing on issues like abortion and the economy. To the extent they use topics like the Carroll ruling, it should be to argue generally that Trump isnât concerned about issues that interest voters, rather than a focused attack on his character.\n\nâIt will be carried by other messengers, and voters are going to be reminded of that,â said Josh Schwerin, who worked on Hillary Clintonâs presidential campaign. âBut the campaign likely wonât have to really do it â¦ Thereâs an imperative for the campaign to focus on delivering a message that otherwise wonât be heard. And so they need to be drawing the contrast with Trump on the two competing records on what Biden has done and will do to improve votersâ lives, and what Trump did that they didnât like previously â and will do if he gets another chance.â\n\nSchwerin argued that if Biden eventually mentions the Carroll case, it wonât âbe a bad thingâ for team Biden. Still, he said the campaign knows that tossing in even one line about Carroll in a speech largely focused, for example, on Trumpâs policy failings as president would result in media coverage that only focused on the one line.\n\nDemocratic strategist Tim Hogan, meanwhile, told Semafor that the Trump legal cases in general provide a âkey advantageâ for Biden whether or not Democrats comment on them â the âsplit screenâ between a candidate sitting in court versus one out on the campaign trail âoutlining an agenda.â The Carroll case, he said, simply adds to that general argument (recently floated by Haley as well as Democrats) that Trump is âa chaos agentâ and âlacks decency.â\n\nâHe will accumulate more baggage every time he walks though that courtroom,â said Hogan, who worked on Amy Klobucharâs 2020 presidential campaign and Clintonâs 2016 campaign. âHe is selling a message to the American people: âPlease bail me out.â Itâs not about you.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nThereâs another reason why the Carroll attack line is unlikely to become a focus of Bidenâs campaign: Republicans have already argued that Trumpâs many legal cases are politically motivated. While state and federal prosecutors are not involved in this particular case, Carrollâs latest comments about helping defeat Trump went viral in conservative circles, as did news that Democratic megadonor Reid Hoffman helped fund the lawsuit against Trump. Biden has generally been reluctant to discuss Trumpâs various legal issues, even as he increasingly singles him out by name .\n\nBiden has also been reluctant to get into back-and-forths with Trump that will inevitably get ugly. When Trump was under fire over the Access Hollywood tape and various accusations of sexual misconduct in 2016, he appeared with women who had accused former President Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct ahead of their debate . Biden said later that he advised Hillary Clinton against bringing up the tape at the time. âI think the biggest mistake that was made, and everyone underestimated it the last time about President Trump, the place heâs most comfortable is in the gutter arguing,â Biden said at a campaign event in 2019.\n\nIn Bidenâs case, Republicans would be likely to resurface Tara Readeâs sexual assault allegations against Biden, though her subsequent defection to Russia has made the already-fraught topic even harder to bring up.\n\nA few Democrats are hoping Biden does use Carroll to the fullest possible extent, arguing that the court cases are crucial to reminding American voters who Trump is after several years out of office.\n\nâI think Trump is a very different candidate in 2024 than he was in 2020. And I think itâs important for us to to be clear about that with the American people,â said Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg. âShould the Democrats be talking about this? We have an obligation to be talking about this. We have an obligation to be making sure the American people are aware of what theyâre signing up for if they vote for him. We have an obligation to talk about all of this. Itâs not whether we will â we have an obligation to do so.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Nikki Haley crosses the Rubicon\n\nHer defense of the jury in the E. Jean Carroll case goes to the core of Trumpâs candidacy.\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nNikki Haleyâs campaign against Donald Trump reached a new phase with five crucial words in her âMeet The Pressâ interview on Sunday: âI absolutely trust the jury.â\n\nHaleyâs active defense of the anonymous jurors that awarded E. Jean Carroll $83 million in damages after a previous jury found Trump was liable for sexual assault and defamation marked a point of no return. âI think that they made their decision based on the evidence,â she added, just to make her position crystal clear.\n\nIn this article:\n\nWhat stands out about Haleyâs remarks is not just that itâs a Republican taking on Trump over sexual misconduct, something thatâs almost unheard of since he survived the Access Hollywood tape in 2016. Itâs that a top rival is actually addressing the core argument of Trumpâs candidacy: That he is the target of a vast conspiracy that stole the last election and is targeting him now in order to steal the next one.\n\nThese twin premises, which Trump has spent years working to build up and maintain, have made it virtually impossible to attack him. âElectabilityâ is not an effective angle when losses are not considered legitimate. Attacks on Trumpâs personal character, ethics, and competence are not effective angles when some malicious outside force âÂ the âdeep state,â âpartisan prosecutors,â etc.âÂ is to blame for his problems. To the extent his nomination looks inevitable, this is the reason.\n\nTrump, who has actively leaned into his legal troubles on the campaign trail, knows that the only way to beat him is to undo this framework âÂ and he knows how scared Republicans are to try it, given the backlash they typically face. Last week, he directly challenged Haley to take her best shot by posing a simple question: Why wonât the same thing happen to you?\n\nâJust a little note to Nikki, sheâs not going to win,â Trump said after winning the New Hampshire primary. âBut if she did, she would be under investigation by those people in 15 minutes, and I could tell you five reasons why already. Not big reasons, little stuff that she doesnât want to talk about, that she will be under investigation within minutes, and so would Ron [DeSantis] have been, but he decided to get out.â\n\nBeneath the Trumpian innuendo, there was a substantive point. Haley has warned over and over that âchaos followsâ Trump. Even Ron DeSantis, in his spicier final days, complained the election was âgoing to be about January 6, legal issues, [and] criminal trialsâ if Trump were the nominee. But what neither of them did was articulate why âchaos followsâ Trump and why heâs constantly beset by indictments and lawsuits. DeSantis even preemptively excused him from any upcoming convictions, arguing the jurors would be from âleft-wingâ cities.\n\nThatâs changing now. Haleyâs remarks on Sunday fit into an emerging message that answers Trumpâs New Hampshire riddle more directly and is already forcing a more pointed response.\n\nFirst, sheâs saying more unambiguously that Trump is a loser, which is a relatively recent development. She launched her campaign around an aspiration to win the âpopular voteâ â a non-issue that sidestepped the topic of his state-based efforts to overturn the last election.\n\nâWith Donald Trump, Republicans have lost almost every competitive election,â she said in a Tuesday night speech in New Hampshire that enraged Trump. âWe lost the Senate, we lost the House, we lost the White House. We lost in 2018. We lost in 2020, and we lost in 2022.â\n\nHer attacks on his age, honesty, âunhingedâ rants, and mental fitness all relate to this as well, because they offer an actual theory of why he loses: Heâs a raging incompetent who upsets swing voters that Republicans need to win. The more she can bait him into making especially racist or nasty attacks, the easier it is to illustrate her point.\n\nThey also feed into the second, more potentially explosive, half of her argument that she brought up on Sunday: That Trump is primarily in legal trouble because of his own behavior âÂ and itâs not the partyâs job to bail him out as a result.\n\nâI do think that he surrounds himself in chaos, and we canât be a country in disarray, and have a world on fire and be in chaos,â she said on Sunday. âI do think that these court cases are distracting not just to the American people but to him himself, which is keeping him from talking about what really matters. Thatâs exactly why I donât think he should be president.â\n\nHaley is still a very long shot to win the nomination, and weâll see how far she actually goesÂ with all this â other candidates have dipped their toe into discussing the details of Trumpâs indictments and civil trials only to soon back away. Haley herself said she hasnât âpaid attentionâ to the details of his cases in her MTP interview on Sunday. But Trump is not wrong to want her gone fast: Her portrait of him as a lying has-been who reaps what he sows not only goes to the foundations of his political strength, itâs 100% usable by Democrats in the general election.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

Read it now .\n\nFormer President Donald Trump testified Thursday in a civil defamation trial brought by writer E. Jean Carroll, saying he never instructed anyone to hurt her in his statements.\n\nCarroll is seeking at least $10 million in damages over comments Trump made while in office, calling her a liar after she accused him of raping her in the 1990s, and saying he couldnât have assaulted her because âsheâs not my type.â A judge has already ruled the comments as defamatory and the latest trial is solely to establish damages .\n\nU.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who is presiding over the case, has struggled to keep Trump in line in the courtroom, with the former president  heard muttering âcon jobâ and âwitch huntâ last week as Carroll testified to the jury of the reputational damage she suffered at the hands of Trump and his followers.\n\nThe judge told Trumpâs lawyer Thursday he could only ask the former president two questions while he was on the stand: Whether Trump stood by what he said in his deposition, and whether he ever instructed anyone to hurt Carroll.\n\nIn a one-minute direct examination, Trump said he stood by his deposition and that he denied Carrollâs allegations in an effort to defend himself.\n\nAsked if he instructed anyone to hurt the writer in his statements, the former president replied, âNo, I just wanted to defend myself, my family, and frankly, the presidency.â Kaplan instructed the jury to disregard everything he said after âNo.â\n\nAs Trump left the courtroom, he muttered, âThis is not America. Not America. This is not America,â The Washington PostÂ reported .\n\nThe clipped exchange came after Carrollâs attorney last week complained that Trump was making comments that the jury could overhear during the trial. Kaplan told Trump his right to be in the courtroom could be forfeited if he continued to be disruptive.\n\nâMr. Trump, I hope I donât have to consider excluding you from the trial. I understand you are very eager for me to do that,â the judge said.\n\nâI would love it,â Trump responded.\n\nâI know you would, because you just canât control yourself in this circumstance, apparently. You just canât,â Kaplan replied.\n\nâNeither can you,â Trump said.\n\nThe second trial in a pair of civil cases Carroll brought against Trump, this one is focused solely on what the former Elle columnist is owed.\n\nA federal jury last May found Trump liable for battery and defamation in the prior case, which centered on comments the former president made in 2022 calling Carrollâs claims that he sexually abused her a âcon jobâ and âhoax.â The jury ordered him to pay her $5 million in damages.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor flagship"

Read it now .\n\nGlobal media reacted Wednesday to a jury finding former U.S. President Donald Trump liable for the sexual assault and defamation of writer E. Jean Carroll in the 1990s.\n\nThe New York jury ordered Trump to pay Carroll, a former Elle magazine columnist, $5 million in damages. Tuesdayâs verdict also marked the first time Trump â accused of sexual misconduct by more than two dozen women â was found legally responsible for a sexual assault.\n\nHereâs what the world is saying about the unprecedented case.\n\nThe juryâs finding âends the myth that Trump is untouchable,â U.S. correspondent Marc Pitzke wrote in German-language outlet Der Spiegel. Whether the decision to find Trump liable for sexual abuse will matter to voters is another question entirely, Pitzke said, and for now, the Republican remains the partyâs frontrunner 2024 presidential candidate. Trumpâs usual critics are still around, he added, but âeven the smallest shifts, the smallest percentages, could be decisive for the election.â\n\nIt may not be enough to cover the long list of allegations against him, but âfinally â finally â this oft-accused predator would be held accountable for at least some fraction of his misdeeds,â wrote The Guardianâs U.S. columnist Margaret Sullivan. While it might not be the end of the trauma Carroll is carrying, Sullivan said, it is at least âenough so that Trump can be portrayed as a sexual abuser.â\n\nThe jury reached a verdict in record time, El Paisâs U.S. correspondent Maria Antonia Sanchez-Vallejo reported. âOf all the accusations of sexual harassment and abuse that Trump has dodged in recent decades, this is the only one that has made it to trial,â she wrote, noting that Trump usually manages to emerge unscathed from the drama which follows him. âTypically, he makes it through almost victorious, from setbacks that would have left any adversary in the ditch,â Sanchez-Vallejo said. âBad news is, in Trumpâs case, the best weapon.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor media"

      "text": "While Trump veered off-course, his top campaign advisers delivered GOP a clear plan\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nAs Donald Trump held a meandering appearance criticizing the same legal team appealing the sexual assault judgment against him, his top campaign advisers were privately touting the strength of their preelection position to congressional Republicans.\n\nThe Trump campaign said it has trained more than 25,000 captains â volunteers who manage other organizers in specific areas of battleground states to help mobilize voters who donât typically turn out but are already leaning toward the former president. In a call with House Republicans and their top aides, Trump advisers also touted their progress cutting Democratsâ mail-in ballot advantage.\n\nâWe just need to stick to message and stay focused,â Tony Fabrizio, Trumpâs campaign pollster, said on the call, excerpts of which Semafor obtained from a source who tuned in.\n\nThose advisors delivered clear confidence about Trumpâs position in swing states, bashing surveys that they said had not fully reflected Republican voter enthusiasm. Trumpâs team acknowledged that Tuesdayâs first head-to-head debate with Vice President Kamala Harris would be âa big nightâ and sought to moderate expectations by questioning whether ABCâs moderators would hold âher feet to the fire.â\n\nThe organized presentation to GOP lawmakers stood in stark contrast to Trumpâs appearance in New York City , which was billed as a press conference but featured no questions. Trump said he was âdisappointedâ in the lawyers handling his appeal of a New York juryâs finding that he is liable for $5 million for sexual abuse of E. Jean Carroll, who testified that he raped her in a dressing room in the 1990s.\n\nTrump also continued to deny that he assaulted Carroll: âIt couldnât have happened, and she would not have been the chosen one,â he said.\n\nOther Trump aides who participated in the Friday call, which is expected to be the first in a series of briefings for the Hill GOP, included senior campaign advisers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, as well as Tim Murtaugh and James Blair.\n\nThe Harris campaign is riding high thanks to a sizable fundraising lead over Trump that it reported Friday morning, a sign of a momentum shift since President Joe Biden bowed out of the race. So itâs smart for Team Trump to project optimism in front of whatâs become a semi-unmotivated House GOP.\n\nThe push also appears designed to quell some of the concerns some Republican members and congressional aides expressed recently about the viability of Trumpâs ground game, especially in battleground states.\n\nâThere are Republicans in key swing states worried about the Trump ground operation,â as one senior Republican aide told Semafor. âStates like Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and other swing states need to see an operation that isnât just focused on rallies.â\n\nAnd the fact remains that â based purely on the favorable Senate map for Republicans this cycle â the GOP is in a far stronger position to reclaim a majority across the Capitol than it is to grow its currently thin majority in the House.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Conservatism, âChaos,â and E. Jean Carroll: The GOP field makes its closing pitch in Iowa\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nHarvardâs president had resigned, and Ron DeSantis knew just what to do next. At a Wednesday morning stop outside Des Moines, he spent 60 seconds describing how a president could pressure accrediting agencies , unelected and obscure, to make colleges unwind diversity and inclusion programs.\n\nâYou will not get accredited if youâre doing discriminatory policies,â DeSantis said in Waukee. âYou know, Trump was president for four years. Did he do anything to challenge the orthodoxies at these universities? Did he do anything to push back and reform? No.â\n\nIt was a new addition to DeSantisâs big theme, succeeding where Trump had failed. Finishing a border wall, smashing drug cartels, winning by a landslide â he had thought this through, and he would âget it done.â But before DeSantis left, one voter asked for clarification: What was he saying about âpredators?â\n\nâAccreditors, accreditors,â DeSantis said. âIdeological predators maybe, with the leftism â but, no. Accreditation.â\n\nIn the final days before the Jan. 15 caucuses, Donald Trumpâs competitors in Iowa have honed their closing messages. For DeSantis, itâs that Trump is promising conservative wins that he failed to deliver as president â and might not know how to implement now. For Nikki Haley, itâs that âchaos followsâ Trump, and she polls far better than him against Joe Biden. For Vivek Ramaswamy, itâs that the greatest president of his lifetime started an America First revolution that a newer, younger candidate can build on.\n\nDeSantis has looked to raise doubts about Trumpâs commitment to the conservative cause. He outright told a CNN town hall audience on Thursday that Trump was ânot pro-life,â arguing the former presidentâs criticism of Floridaâs strict six-week abortion ban showed a second Trump term would be less dependable on the issue than his first. Heâs hit out at Haley for taking money from Democrats, and for a joke she told in New Hampshire, where sheâs polling more competitively: âYou know Iowa starts it. You know that you correct it.â\n\nTrumpâs closer is more succinct: He is beset by lawsuits and enemies because heâs going to win . As his rivals barnstormed Iowa this week, the former president posted more than 40 Truth Social items denouncing the âfraudulentâ civil suit brought by E. Jean Carroll and making lurid personal attacks against her. A jury previously found Trump defamed Carroll and was liable for sexually abusing her ; the upcoming trial concerns how much he should pay in damages in a related case.\n\nDeSantis and Haley, battling for second place, have both tried daily to move on from Trumpâs personal problems. Theyâve consumed news cycles and attention that both would rather redirect to their agendas, and their narrow differences with the former president.\n\nIt has not been easy. At the CNN town hall on Thursday night, after Haley repeated a stock line about Trumpâs headline-grabbing scandals â âchaos follows himâ â moderator Erin Burnett whether he was causing the chaos, or was merely a âvictimâ of it. Itâs a question all the candidates have struggled with because of its broader implications: If Trump is the innocent target of a vast conspiracy to abuse the legal system in order to stop him â his version of events âÂ then itâs a lot harder to tell Republican voters they shouldnât rally behind him in response.\n\nâI mean, you see a lot of these cases they brought against him are political in nature,â said Haley. âAnd thereâs no basis on it, and then you see some that heâs gonna have to answer for.â\n\nShe moved on to the contrasts she wanted in her closing message, that Trump had added $8 trillion to the national debt and that he was too friendly with dictators.\n\nIn this article:\n\nDeSantisâs exchange in Waukee stood out to me because heâd been trying to do this sort of thing for nine months, contrasting his thought-out, detailed plans with Trumpâs failure to execute.\n\nThe Harvard imbroglio was a perfect hook for him. Not only had he gotten rid of lifetime tenure in Florida, and sued the Biden administration to weaken accrediting agencies â Chris Rufo, the conservative hero of the Harvard story, was one of the conservatives heâd put in charge of transforming Floridaâs New College.\n\nâTrump did fight, and I give him credit for that,â DeSantis said later in the event. âBut he didnât win enough.â\n\nThere are three basic critiques of Trump from each candidate here â that Trump failed to deliver (DeSantis), that Trump made a few gigantic errors (Haley), and that Trump created a blueprint for someone younger, with âfresh legs,â to execute (Ramaswamy.)\n\nNone of them talk about Trump as much as Chris Christie. He isnât seriously competing in Iowa; his New Hampshire town halls sometimes start with commentary on fresh Trump posts and gaffes, made while the former New Jersey governor was en route.\n\nFor everyone else, the Trump issue is something to bring up as a contrast, then move on from quickly. And in Iowa, Haley is the only candidate not running consistently to Trumpâs right, and the only one breaking with him on support for funding Ukraineâs defense against Russia. Her audiences sometimes gasp when she talks about Vladimir Putin raising the countryâs draft age to 65. DeSantis may be the first candidate to tell them about college accreditation and why conservatives should care about it; Haley is often the first to get into detail about the current phase of the war.\n\nTrump, returning this weekend to start closing out his Iowa campaign, doesnât need new hooks. His pitch is a combination of nostalgia for the four years before Joe Bidenâs presidency, condemnation of the negative stories that the media runs about him, and frequent invocation of his indictments and legal problems.\n\nâTheyâre willing to violate the US constitution at levels never seen before in order to win this election,â Trump said in a pre-Christmas trip to Waterloo, his last swing through Iowa. âTheyâre weaponizing law enforcement for high level election interference because weâre beating them so badly in the polls.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

One of the night's most significant honorees, E. Jean Carroll, was surprised that she was included on this year's list-but she shouldn't have been. Last year, Carroll made headlines when she was awarded $5 million after a Manhattan jury found Trump liable for defamation and sexual abuse in a lawsuit she filed against him for an alleged rape in the 1990s , giving hope to survivors everywhere for justice.\n\nWhile attending the TIME100 Gala in New York City on Thursday night, Carroll weighed in on Trump's current hush money criminal trial, which began in a downtown Manhattan court last week. Carroll was hopeful that Trump's trial would bring to light the truth about the former president's actions.\n\n\"I think that it's a New York jury, they're the smartest in the world, with all political backgrounds,\" she told TIME at the event. \"They will make the right decision.\"\n\nWith Trump emerging as the Republican candidate for the 2024 presidential election, Carroll also stressed the importance of voters considering which candidates would reflect their values, especially when it came to the future of reproductive rights.\n\n\"The main question we need to ask of our candidates is: do women have the rights over their own bodies?\"\n\nThe TIME100 Gala is TIME's annual celebration of the TIME100 list of the world's most influential people.

      "text": "E. Jean Carroll's Victory Shows the #MeToo Movement Is Far From Dead\n\nO n Tuesday, a New York jury found former President Donald Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation of the writer E. Jean Carroll , and awarded her $5 million. The case stems from an alleged rape in a Bergdorf Goodman's dressing room in the mid-1990s, when Carroll says Trump followed her in and forced himself on her. Years later, when she started speaking out about the alleged attack, Trump used his enormous platform to claim it was \"Hoax\" and a \"con job\" - accusations Carroll said in her lawsuit damaged her reputation and her emotional well-being.\n\nThere is much to celebrate about this verdict: The holding to account of a man who has spent much of his life skirting the law ; the utter failure of Trump's victim-blaming defense; a woman who presented substantial evidence being believed above a man who presented virtually none. But perhaps most heartening is what this verdict says about the continued power and relevance of the #MeToo movement, and how fundamentally it has changed American society.\n\nFor many women's rights advocates, the case between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp last year was top of mind during the Carroll-Trump trial. The Heard-Depp case also included allegations of assault and claims of defamation; when a jury largely found for Depp, it was a blow to feminist progress, and felt like part of a larger backlash against the gains of the #MeToo movement. Suddenly, the call to \"believe women\" was sounding awfully hollow - here was a woman who told her own story, and not only was she not believed, but she was legally punished for it. The Heard case felt like a warning to abuse survivors: You can speak out, but you may pay an exorbitant price.\n\nThe Carroll case says the opposite: That it's worth fighting back, even against a man who was once arguably the most powerful person in the world.\n\nThis may not be the end of this saga. Trump can appeal; he continues to assert his innocence. But the verdict against him, like the criminal conviction of Harvey Weinstein, signals that there are at least some limits to what rich and powerful men can get away with.\n\nWhen it comes to women, and many other aspects of his life, Trump's egotism is clear. He was famously caught on tape bragging about grabbing women's genitals, because when you're a \"star,\" women let you assault them. He said more or less the same during his deposition in this case - and added, both revoltingly and questionably, that stars have gotten away with this for the last million years, \"unfortunately or fortunately.\" This jury didn't seem to find the right to commit sexual abuse with impunity to be \"fortunate.\"\n\nIn fact, Trump and his legal team seemed so confident that Trump didn't bother to show up in court. It's not necessarily unusual that a defendant wouldn't testify, and it would not be surprising for Trump's lawyer to tell him not to - Trump is a loose cannon, and it's hard to see how his testimony would go well. And the burden was on Carroll's team to prove their claims.\n\nBut for a case this high-profile and high stakes, his team presented remarkably little evidence in his defense, besides smearing Carroll, asking why she didn't scream for help, and simply accusing her of lying. Carroll's team, by contrast, put forward as much evidence as might be reasonably possible in a case stemming from a decades-old event: Friends of Carroll's who testified to contemporaneous phone calls in which Carroll told them about the assault; other women who claimed Trump had similarly attacked them, establishing a pattern and an MO; and Trump's own words and character. The jury was tasked with weighing the evidence on both sides and deciding which was more convincing. It's easy to see how they decided that was Carroll.\n\nThis case was particularly notable because it involves a former President who is also a current presidential contender , and among the favorites to be the GOP nominee in 2024. A man whom a jury found to be liable for sexual abuse may again sit in the White House - that's a stunning thing.\n\nIt will be telling, and I suspect depressing, to see how many Republican politicians and conservative voters react. Typically, we would expect any challengers to a candidate found liable for sexual abuse and defamation to bring that fact up fairly aggressively. Whether Trump's opponents within the Republican Party will go that route, though, is an outstanding question - in recent years, the GOP has largely shied away from addressing what seems to be an endemic sexual assault and harassment problem in their candidate pool. And sexual harassment and assault accusations did not derail Trump in 2016. Perhaps eight years later, Republican voters will feel differently. But that seems far from guaranteed.\n\nWhat does seem clear, though, is that the #MeToo movement is far from dead, even if it is still far from achieving all of its goals (what social movement, after all, has been wholly triumphant in only a few years?). That's good news for feminists, and for the country. And the verdict should also be a warning to Republicans: Trump's misogyny, the #MeToo movement, and the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade have all proven to be galvanizing forces for female voters. Now, their party's leading horse has been found liable for sexual abuse by a jury of his peers, while he continues to face other legal threats . Trump is a liability. Women are outraged. #MeToo seems resurgent. Is this really who the GOP wants to gamble on?\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Trump Says He 'Never Met' Author Who Has Accused Him of Sexual Assault\n\nP resident Donald Trump said Friday that he \"never met\" a New York advice columnist and author who claims that he sexually assaulted her in the dressing room of a high-end New York department store in the 1990s.\n\nIn a statement, Trump said \"there is zero evidence\" to support longtime Elle columnist E. Jean Carroll's account of a chance meeting with Trump at Bergdorf Goodman that she says ended with assault.\n\nCarroll recounts the episode in an upcoming memoir, What Do We Need Men For? A Modest Proposal , an excerpt of which was published in New York magazine earlier in the day.\n\n\"I've never met this person in my life,\" Trump said in the statement. \"She is trying to sell a new book - that should indicate her motivation. It should be sold in the fiction section.\"\n\nThe article includes a photo of Trump and Carroll , along with their then-spouses at an NBC party around 1987.\n\nIn the book, Carroll says that she ran into Trump while shopping in the fall of 1995 or spring of 1996, and he asked her for advice on a gift \"for a girl,\" joking with her about a lacy bodysuit as she heads toward the dressing room.\n\n\"The moment the dressing-room door is closed, he lunges at me, pushes me against the wall, hitting my head quite badly, and puts his mouth against my lips,\" she writes.\n\nShe added that he then unzipped his pants, \"forcing his fingers around my private area\" and \"thrusts his penis halfway - or completely, I'm not certain - inside me.\"\n\nCarroll's allegations are the most serious yet against Trump of sexual misconduct. Eighteen other women have come forward to publicly describe incidents in which Trump kissed them without their consent, grabbed their breasts or put his hand up their skirts, at times with little warning and in public places.\n\nTrump called his accusers liars and threatened to sue them after the election. He did not, though he currently faces a defamation suit from one of the women, former \"Apprentice\" contestant Summer Zervos.\n\nIn the statement, Trump argued that false sexual assault allegations are \"an epidemic,\" an argument that he made during Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings, when he said that it was a \"a very scary time for young men in America.\"\n\n\"Shame on those who make up false stories of assault to try to get publicity for themselves, or sell a book, or carry out a political agenda,\" he said in the statement. \"It's just as bad for people to believe it, particularly when there is zero evidence. Worse still for a dying publication to try to prop itself up by peddling fake news - it's an epidemic.\"\n\nShortly before the election, the Washington Post obtained a tape of Trump with \"Access Hollywood\" host Billy Bush in which Trump said that his celebrity has given him an opening to assault women.\n\n\"I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything,\" Trump was recorded saying. \"Grab them by the p-y. You can do anything.\" During the second presidential debate on Oct. 10, 2016, Trump described his words on the tape as \"locker room talk,\" and apologized to his family and the American people. \"I'm not proud of it,\" he said.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Trump Found Liable for Sexual Abuse, Defamation in E. Jean Carroll's Civil Trial\n\nO n Tuesday, a Manhattan jury found former President Donald Trump liable for sexually abusing and defaming writer E. Jean Carroll. Carroll was awarded $5 million in damages after a two-week civil trial in which Carroll testified that Trump sexually assaulted her over 25 years ago in a New York Department store, and then defamed her after she spoke out about it in 2019.\n\nA prominent 79-year-old former columnist for Elle Magazine, Carroll is one of more than 20 women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct since the 1980s. Trump has denied all the allegations-including Carroll's-and this is the first time that one of the claims has been successfully tried before a jury.\n\nThe jury found that Carroll did not prove Trump raped her. Because the trial was part of a civil case rather than a criminal one, Trump will not face any conviction or prison time.\n\nThe highly-watched trial, which is the result of Carroll filing a lawsuit in 2022, began in late April, during which Carroll testified in great detail about the assault and underwent an aggressive cross examination in court.\n\nFollowing the jury's three-hour deliberation and unanimous verdict delivery Tuesday afternoon, Trump posted to his platform, Truth Social: \"I have absolutely no idea who this woman is. This verdict is a disgrace-a continuation of the greatest witch hunt of all time.\"\n\nHere's what to know about the case.\n\nCarroll alleged that Trump, 76, violently attacked and raped her in a changing room at Bergdorf Goodman in Manhattan in the mid-1990s. Trump denied the allegations and previously said he had never met Carroll.\n\nCarroll first disclosed the alleged assault in New York magazine in June 2019 while Trump was in office. Trump accused Carroll of lying to boost sales for her upcoming memoir, What Do We Need Men For? , where Carroll details the alleged assault. Carroll responded with a defamation suit against the former president in November 2019, claiming that Trump's accusation that she lied was damaging to her reputation and career.\n\n\"I am filing this on behalf of every woman who has ever been harassed, assaulted, silenced, or spoken up only to be shamed, fired, ridiculed and belittled,\" Carroll said in a statement upon filing the defamation suit in 2019. \"No person in this country should be above the law-including the president.\"\n\nCarroll has said that all the attention she received after speaking out and Trump's continued insults toward her cost her heaps of backlash on social media and her job at Elle magazine.\n\nThe suit was delayed in court for years, until Carroll filed a new suit in November 2022, renewing the defamation suit and including additional statements from Trump. She also added a battery claim after the Adult Survivors Act passed-a New York law that permits adult sexual violence survivors to sue for attacks that occurred decades ago, outside former statutes of limitations.\n\nTrump maintained his innocence and released a statement on Truth Social in October 2022 saying: \"Carroll is not telling the truth, is a woman who I had nothing to do with, didn't know, and would have no interest in knowing her if I ever had the chance.\" He added that Carroll is \"not his type.\"\n\nTwo weeks ago during opening statements, Carroll's attorney, Shawn Crowley, described Carroll and Trump's encounter at the department store, saying that while the two were in a dressing room, Trump pushed her up against a wall and sexually assaulted her. Carroll later took the stand with a detailed account of her alleged assault.\n\n\"I'm here because Donald Trump raped me and when I wrote about it, he said it didn't happen. He lied and shattered my reputation. I'm here to try to get my life back,\" Carroll said in court.\n\nTrump's lawyer, Joe Tacopina, questioned Carroll for hours, in an apparent attempt to raise doubt on Carroll's story. He asked Carroll detailed questions about why she didn't scream and how she claimed to try and fight Trump off. \"I'm telling you, he raped me, whether I screamed or not,\" Carroll said in court.\n\nThe presiding judge, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, rebuked Tacopina, at one point calling the lawyer's questions \"argumentative.\" The judge also warned that Trump had to cool his ongoing criticism of Carroll on social media that persisted this week. The former president waived his right to appear in court and chose not to testify in the case.\n\nIn court, Tacopina emphasized Carroll's uncertainty in the exact date of the alleged assault, arguing that it was impossible for Trump to explain his alibi without a specific time. Tacopina also suggested that Carroll had political motives to sue Trump, given her history voting for Democrats.\n\nThe nine jurors (six men and three women) presiding over the case were chosen out of 100, and were kept publicly anonymous throughout the trial.\n\n\"If jurors' identities were disclosed, there would be a strong likelihood of unwanted media attention to the jurors, influence attempts, and/or of harassment or worse of jurors by supporters of Mr. Trump,\" Kaplan wrote in a decision in March.\n\nIn the trial's first week, Trump continued to call the case a \"made up scam\" and \"witch hunt.\" Trump is also currently facing criminal charges in New York for allegedly paying hush money to a former porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 presidential election. Trump has also denied any wrongdoing in the case.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

Jean Carroll, suing the New York author for defamation weeks after a jury held him liable for sexually abusing her .\n\nThe former president on Tuesday night filed a counterclaim accusing Carroll of trashing his reputation by publicly accusing him of rape during a May 10 appearance on CNN, despite jurors concluding a day earlier that his actions during the alleged 1996 assault hadn't gone that far.\n\nTrump \"has been the subject of significant harm to his reputation, which, in turn, has yielded an inordinate amount of damages sustained as a result,\" according to the filing.\n\nA jury of six men and three women last month found that Trump, who is seeking to return to the White House in the 2024 presidential election, was liable for sexual abuse - and not liable for rape - before awarding Carroll $5 million in damages.\n\nTrump's court filing Tuesday is a counterclaim in a separate 2019 defamation lawsuit Carroll filed against him that is set to go to trial in January. While Carroll won the first trial, Trump has interpreted the verdict as a victory, of sorts, because of the finding on rape.\n\nCarroll's lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nA Trump lawyer had previously been denied court permission to file a counterclaim against Carroll in her defamation case because the request was made too late.\n\nBut Trump attorney Alina Habba argues that a new window for filing a counterclaim was opened earlier this month when Carroll was allowed to amend her defamation complaint after winning the battery trial.\n\nAmong other things, Carroll amended her complaint to change every \"rape\" reference to \"sexual abuse.\" Carroll also revised the complaint to add Trump's remarks about her at a CNN town hall, where he called her a liar after the trial and accused her fabricating the attack.\n\nWhen Carroll was asked on CNN a day after the verdict about the jury finding that Trump didn't rape her, she falsely claimed otherwise, according to the filing.\n\n\"Oh yes he did, oh yes he did,\" she said, according to the filing, which says that Carroll made the comments \"with an intent to significantly and spitefully harm and attack\" the former president.\n\n\"The interview was on television, social media and multiple internet websites, with the intention of broadcasting and circulating these defamatory statements among a significant portion of the public,\" Trump's lawyers said in the filing.\n\nCarroll went public with her claims in a 2019 magazine article, triggering a wave of sharply worded denials from Trump when he was in the White House, including an assertion by Trump that he couldn't have raped Carroll because she wasn't his \"type\" and that she falsely accused him to help Democrats. Those comments are the subject of Carroll's defamation suit that's heading to trial next year.\n\nThe case is Carroll v.

Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox.\n\nOver the years, more than two dozen women have accused ex-President Donald Trump of sexual misconduct -and the really bad ones, at that: rape , assault , groping , harassment , unwanted kissing , dressing-room invasion , and handsy tendencies for starters. But on Tuesday, for the first time, a jury sided with one of those alleged victims, setting the stage for a new battlefield as the former Commander in Chief seeks to return to power without protections from non-disclosure agreements.\n\nA federal civil jury found that Trump sexually abused E. Jean Carroll in the mid 1990s and later defamed her, an unprecedented rebuke of a White House frontrunner that, in a more logical world, would reset the 2024 campaign, disqualify the former reality-show star, and give President Joe Biden-the author of the Violence Against Women Act-a leg up in his reelection bid.\n\nAnd yet... Dammit; we're doing this again, aren't we?\n\nNone of this may matter. Americans have never looked to Trump as an exemplar when it comes to treatment of women. We are all well aware of the time he bragged to a distant Bush Dynasty cousin of having grabbed women by the genitals because, in his words, \"when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.\" Trump's second wife accused him of rape before recanting and declaring him her bestie. Teen beauty-pageant contestants and former aides alike have leveled accusations that the Manhattan billionaire crossed the lines.\n\nAll this has, time and again, has been largely met with a predictable , collective shrug of indifference . Within Trump's Republican base. Within his Democratic opposition. Within the middle-of-the-pack independents. No, really.\n\nDemocrats need to understand that there is little political advantage in the moral high ground here. Trump was found culpable. And yet Trump is going to filibuster his way through this like he has so many other bad news cycles. He is set to participate in a primetime town hall Wednesday night with his best frenemy CNN up in New Hampshire. While there's no doubt that anchor Kaitlan Collins-one of the deserving journalistic rockets of the Trump era-will push Trump on the jury's finding, it's equally as expectant that he will dismiss the judgment as rubbish.\n\nIf anything, the Carroll verdict may end up having a ricochet upside for Trump, whose supporters will claim victimhood, whose HQ can claim persecution, whose accusers can once again be used as fodder in the right-wing social ecosystem.\n\nMuch of how this is likely to play out is connected to what the public has grown to expect from our former President. No one has ever mistaken Trump as a gentleman. He famously judged women on their appearances . He has never apologized for objectifying women for their looks or sexual appeal. His defense against rape allegations from Carroll-and this is no joke , folks-was that she wasn't hot enough for him to want to force himself upon her. In Trump's world, anyone who isn't a 10 is not worth his interest, even in a department store dressing room.\n\nIn that disparagement, Carroll found a defamation victory -but not a federal finding that Trump actually raped her, just that he sexually assaulted her and then dissed her afterward. (In New York, these things matter.)\n\nRead more : E. Jean Carroll's Victory Shows the #MeToo Movement Is Far From Dead\n\nWhen Trump was running for the nomination back in 2016, Trump and I chatted about his approach to litigation. What was worth the fight and what was worth the detente? Wins were to be had, losses were to be avoided. Ethics or higher ground were totally extraneous. It seemed, transparently, as if he didn't fully understand that courts were more than a soundstage for publicity.\n\nThat's why the latest verdict feels like a modicum of justice for Trump's well-documented treatment of women, but won't have the sticking power in the public consciousness that the moment deserves. Dianne Feinstein is coming back to D.C., Tucker Carlson seems to be heading to Twitter, and Rep. George Santos was just indicted. The federal government may be weeks away from defaulting.\n\nTaken as a whole, we are left with this most basic of thesis statements: Nothing Matters; LOL.

Jean Carroll Sues President for Defamation Over Rape Denial, 'Conspiracy' Tweets\n\n(Bloomberg) - President Donald Trump was sued for defamation by a journalist who claims he raped her two decades ago in a dressing room at the Bergdorf Goodman department store in Manhattan.\n\nE. Jean Carroll, who went public with her allegations in June, filed the lawsuit Monday in New York state court in Manhattan, claiming Trump had damaged her reputation with a series of false tweets denying her story.\n\nWhen Carroll made the claim in an article she wrote for New York magazine, she was working on a book that included an account of the alleged encounter, which she says took place in a deserted dressing room in 1995 or 1996, after she bumped into Trump while shopping. Trump's tweets suggested Carroll made up the story to attract attention.\n\nTrump \"accused Carroll of lying about the rape in order to increase book sales, carry out a political agenda, advance a conspiracy with the Democratic Party, and make money,\" the complaint says.\n\nTrump's lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, didn't immediately return a call seeking comment on the lawsuit.\n\nIn June, Trump told reporters outside the White House that Carroll's claim was \"a totally false accusation\" and said he had \"absolutely no idea who she is.\" The president also said her book \"should be sold in the fiction section.\"\n\n\"I am filing this lawsuit for every woman who's been pinched, prodded, cornered, felt-up, pushed against a wall, grabbed, groped, assaulted, and has spoken up only to be shamed, demeaned, disgraced, passed over for promotion, fired, and forgotten,\" Carroll said in a statement. \"No person in this country should be above the law - including the President.\"\n\nIn her account, Carroll said that after she ran into Trump they headed to the lingerie section, and that Trump grabbed a bodysuit and said she should try it on. They went into a dressing room together, and once the door closed, she alleges that Trump pushed her against the wall.\n\n\"He lunges at me, pushes me against the wall, hitting my head quite badly, and puts his mouth against my lips,\" Carroll wrote. \"I am so shocked I shove him back and start laughing again. He seizes both my arms and pushes me up against the wall a second time, and, as I become aware of how large he is, he holds me against the wall with his shoulder and jams his hand under my coat dress and pulls down my tights.\"\n\nThe lawsuit seeks a court order forcing Trump to retract the statements, as well as unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nThe suit is similar to another defamation suit filed in the same court by former \"Apprentice\" contestant Summer Zervos, who claims Trump defamed her by denying her allegations of sexual assault.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

Jean,\" a TV show that aired from 1994-96 and served as a precursor to MSNBC's \"America's Talking.\"\n\nCarroll's writing, known both for her humor and empathy, has been featured in publications like Rolling Stone, Esquire and Playboy where she was the first woman to serve as its contributing editor.\n\n\"In the literary journalism world, she was a player, which is saying a lot,'' a former editor said of Carroll in 2019. \"There weren't a lot of women who were being hired by men's magazines. And she was.''\n\nDespite the glitz of New York City, Carroll's roots are planted firmly in the Midwest. She grew up in Fort Wayne as the oldest of four children. An IU graduate in the class of 1967, Carroll was named Miss Indiana University in 1963, as well as Miss Cheerleader U.S.A., which earned her a scholarship.\n\nCarroll, 80, claimed Trump, 77, sexually assaulted her in a New York City department store dressing room roughly 30 years ago, charges the former president has publicly denied.\n\nThe moment the dressing-room door closed, Carroll said Trump lunged at her, shoving her against a wall where he next pulled down her tights. Carroll gave a graphic account of the assault both in her book and in a later article.\n\nIn May, a jury in a civil case found Trump liable for sexually abusing Carroll, but not for rape. Trump was also found guilty of defaming Carroll in 2022 when he called her a \"con job.\" He was ordered to pay $5 million. He has not been prosecuted and found guilty in a criminal case.\n\nA civil defamation trial was set for January to determine how much money Trump should pay additionally after damaging Carroll's reputation.\n\nTrump has strongly denied Carroll's accusations, saying in 2019: \"I've never met this person in my life. She is trying to sell a new book - that should indicate her motivation. It should be sold in the fiction section.\"\n\nA photo of Trump and Carroll together was taken around 1987 - years before the alleged assault - along with Trump's ex-wife, Ivana Trump, and Carroll's then-husband.\n\nTrump called Carroll's allegations \"a disgrace\" and said \"people should pay dearly for such false accusations.\"\n\nTrump's tone hasn't shifted much. On Wednesday, a New York judge threatened to toss Trump out of the courtroom after the belligerent ex-President could be heard making disparaging comments about Carroll within earshot of the jury.\n\nCarroll has received numerous threats ever since she went public. One said the \"penalty for lying about rape should be execution by hanging or firing squad,\" while another said \"stick a gun in your mouth and pull the trigger and send yourself to HELL.\"\n\n\"I spent 50 years building a reputation,\" Carroll said. \"Now I'm known as a liar, a fraud, and a whack job.\"\n\nJohn Tufts covers trending news for the Indianapolis Star.

      "text": "Did Donald Trump rape E. Jean Carroll? Here's what a jury and judge said.\n\nNote: This story contains graphic descriptions of sexual abuse that may be offensive to some readers or painful to survivors of sexual assault.\n\nWhen E. Jean Carroll and Donald Trump went to trial last spring over her sexual assault allegations, a nine-person civil jury found that Trump sexually abused her but that she failed to prove he raped her .\n\nThe former president made hay of that distinction when he sued Carroll in June, alleging Carroll defamed him by saying she was raped in a media interview after the verdict.\n\nThe counterattack was quickly shot down.\n\nFederal Judge Lewis Kaplan ruled in August that the jury verdict showed Carroll's rape allegation was \"substantially true\" and dismissed the counterclaim.\n\nIn May, Carroll was awarded a combined $5 million for sexual abuse and for a 2022 denial by Trump that the jury concluded defamed Carroll. On Friday, a jury in a separate civil defamation case awarded Carroll $83.3 million for two lengthy denials Trump made in 2019, soon after Carroll went public with her story.\n\nTrump has always denied Carroll's allegations. He has already appealed the first verdict and has vowed to appeal the second.\n\nSo did a jury find Trump raped Carroll, or didn't it?\n\nThe answer has to do with what \"rape\" means.\n\nBecause the jurors rendered their May verdict in a civil case, they were asked only whether Carroll proved her allegation was probably true. In a criminal case, prosecutors would need to prove the allegation beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nCarroll testified that she struggled to get Trump off her as he shoved his mouth on hers, yanked her tights down, and penetrated her with his hand and then his penis. She described him curving his finger inside her, saying it was \"extremely painful\" and \"a horrible feeling.\"\n\nUnder New York criminal law, an assault constitutes \"rape\" only if it involves vaginal penetration by a penis. That was the definition the jury was instructed to use in the civil case.\n\nBy responding \"no\" to the question of whether Carroll proved Trump raped her, the jurors indicated they weren't convinced Trump penetrated Carroll with his penis, according to Kaplan, who first wrote about the issue in July when he denied Trump a new trial in the sexual abuse case.\n\nBut the jurors' conclusion that Trump sexually abused Carroll \"necessarily implies\" that they did, in fact, believe he penetrated her with his fingers, Kaplan said.\n\nHere was his reasoning:\n\nKaplan noted his instruction to the jury that, for Trump to have sexually abused Carroll, Trump needed to have touched her sexual or intimate parts. The only allegations from Carroll that could possibly fit that bill were forcible kissing, pulling down her tights, and vaginal penetration, he said.\n\nBut the jury couldn't find Trump sexually abused Carroll solely based on a nonconsensual kiss without ignoring testimony and accepting a version of events \"contradicted by the overwhelming weight of the evidence,\" Kaplan said. He noted the kiss was less significant in Carroll's testimony: She said she thought she had laughed after it to throw cold water on anything further, and she hadn't described any physical pain or lasting trauma from it.\n\nKaplan has also pointed to the size of the jury's sexual abuse award - more than $2 million - as bolstering his conclusion that the verdict was based on finding Trump forcibly penetrated Carroll with his hand.\n\nAnd that act, in common modern speech, is rape, Kaplan said.\n\nAs he later summed it up in August, when he dismissed Trump's countersuit: \"It accordingly is the 'truth,' as relevant here, that Mr. Trump digitally raped Ms. Carroll.\"\n\nThe jurors weren't required to explain why, under the definitions they were given, they concluded Trump sexually abused Carroll but were less convinced he raped her.\n\nHowever, in analyzing the jury's verdict, Kaplan said Carroll's testimony about penetration by fingers was more \"repeated and clear.\" She said she \"couldn't see anything that was happening,\" although she could feel it, describing the pain from his finger in particular. She testified that she wasn't sure if he got his penis fully or only partially inside her.\n\nKaplan also said a psychologist's testimony bolstered Carroll's allegation about digital penetration: the psychologist described Carroll \"squirming\" as she remembered Trump's fingers inside her.\n\nThe stories of other women also could have played a role.\n\nTwo women testified that they too had been assaulted by Trump . One described Trump groping her breasts and reaching up her skirt with what seemed like \"40 zillion hands\" on a plane flight. The other said he pushed her against a wall and forcibly kissed her while she was reporting for a magazine article about Trump's first wedding anniversary with his wife, Melania.\n\nThe jury also watched the tape of Trump's notorious \"Access Hollywood\" comments , in which he crudely describes moving on a woman \"very heavily\" and says that when you're a celebrity \"you can do anything,\" including grabbing women's private parts.\n\nIn those ways, the jury heard corroboration of Carroll's allegation when it came to Trump groping and assaulting women, but not when it came to rape with a penis.\n\nThe jurors also didn't need to find Trump liable for rape to award Carroll damages for sexual assault. The judge instructed them that the rape allegation was just one of three options that could trigger damages under Carroll's sexual battery lawsuit, along with sexual abuse and forcible touching.\n\nThat fact meant the jury's verdict on the rape question was \"unnecessary and immaterial,\" Kaplan said.\n\nIn any case, the jury's verdict was conclusive on the broader question of whether Trump raped Carroll in some way, consistent with Carroll's post-verdict statements about rape, according to Kaplan.\n\n\"As a result, Ms. Carroll's statements are 'substantially true,'\" he said.\n\nIf you are a survivor of sexual assault, RAINN offers support through the National Sexual Assault Hotline (800-656-HOPE & online.rainn.org )."

      "text": "'This case was not close': Why E. Jean Carroll says Trump sex abuse verdict should stand\n\nFormer President Donald Trump profoundly distorted what happened at his 2023 sexual abuse and defamation trial against E. Jean Carroll in his plea to get the jury's verdict tossed out, advice columnist E. Jean Carroll's legal team told an appeals court late-Wednesday.\n\nThe jury in the civil case found Trump liable for sexually abusing Carroll as well as defaming her in 2022, when he called her assault allegations a \"con job.\" They awarded Carroll $5 million .\n\nIn November, Trump's legal team attacked the trial judge's rulings on evidence and urged the New York-based federal appeals court to throw out the verdict. They said in a brief that Trump should have been able to tell the jury about \"politically motivated bias\" in the case, that two other women shouldn't have been able to testify that he also assaulted them, and the jury shouldn't have heard his infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape comments that he kisses women without their consent and that stars \"can do anything\" to women, including grabbing their genitals.\n\nIn a court filing responding to Trump's brief, Carroll's lawyers said \"[t]his case was not close\" and she \"presented overwhelming evidence\" to support her sexual abuse and defamation claims. Carroll herself testified for three days, and two of her friends also described hearing her story of Trump's assault soon after it happened.\n\n\"That transformed the case from 'he said / she said' into 'he said / they said,'\" according to the filing.\n\nThe $5 million Carroll victory in May of 2023 - sizable as it is - pales in comparison to Carroll's $83.3 million January victory in a defamation lawsuit tied to 2019 statements by Trump after Carroll first went public with her story, including that \"people should pay dearly for such false accusations.\" Trump has also filed an appeal in that case.\n\nIn Trump's brief asking the appeals court to toss out the $5 million verdict, the former president's lawyers said the two women who testified about their own experiences with Trump weren't sufficiently reliable to be allowed into the trial because they described brief events from long ago.\n\nOne of the women said she was seated next to Trump on a plane decades ago when he suddenly tried to kiss and grope her, including grabbing her breasts and reaching up her skirt in a \"tussling match,\" until she jolted out of the seat and stormed away. The other, who was interviewing Trump for a magazine article in the mid 2000s, described him pushing her against a wall and forcibly kissing her.\n\nTrump's lawyers told the appeals court that his 2016 presidential election victory \"apparently infuriated\" the two women, and Carroll contacted both of them while he was campaigning for the 2020 election. Those election-related events \"reduced the reliability\" of what the women had to say, he argued.\n\nCarroll's lawyers shot back Wednesday that the other women's testimony was relevant to her case because, if believed by the jury, it showed Trump had a propensity to sexually assault women \"in markedly similar ways across time.\"\n\nAt least 19 women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct , including 13 who have accused him of sexual assault or non-consensual physical contact. Trump has denied the allegations.\n\n\"As their testimony shows, Trump engaged in a pattern of abruptly lunging at a woman in a semi-public place, pressing his body against her, kissing her, and sexually touching her without consent, and later categorically denying the allegations and declaring that the accuser was too unattractive for him to have assaulted her,\" Carroll's team said.\n\nTrump's team also attacked the trial judge's decision to allow the jury to hear a portion of the infamous Access Hollywood tape in which Trump said he just starts kissing beautiful women.\n\n\"It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star they let you do it. You can do anything. ... Grab them by the p---y. You can do anything,\" Trump said on the recording.\n\nThe jury shouldn't have heard the tape because his statements \"involved abstract speculation\" about things a person \"can do,\" Trump's lawyers argued. \"There was no statement attributed to President Trump on the recording indicating that he 'had done' any of those things.\"\n\nThat's \"just a lawyerly way of dismissing the tape as 'locker-room talk,'\" Carroll's team shot back Wednesday, a possible reference to Trump's explanation during a 2016 presidential debate .\n\nTrump's statements on the tape don't reflect \"how people usually recount consensual sexual interactions,\" they added."

      "text": "Trump listens as E. Jean Carroll lawyer again accuses him of assault in $5 million appeal\n\nDonald Trump listened on Friday as three New York federal appeals judges asked lawyers for the former president and writer E. Jean Carroll if the jury that awarded Carroll $5 million for sexual abuse and defamation should have been allowed to hear about a separate assault allegation involving Trump .\n\nCarroll's lawyer said it fit a pattern in which he would pleasantly chat with a woman and then \"pounce,\" while Trump's attorney argued the testimony was improper.\n\nTrump, who is set to debate Vice President Kamala Harris in a pivotal match-up next Tuesday, continued to attack Carroll at a press conference after the arguments.\n\n\"She made up a story and fabricated 100%,\" he said. \"I would have had no interest in meeting her in any way, shape, or form.\"\n\nTrump is appealing a 2023 civil jury verdict that he sexually abused advice columnist Carroll decades ago in a department store, and then defamed her in 2022 by calling her allegations a \"con job.\" A jury in a separate case awarded Carroll another $83.3 million in January for defamatory denials by Trump in 2019. Trump is also appealing that verdict.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Trump claimed he had never met Carroll, adding that he didn't think a 1987 photo showing him talking with Carroll and her then-husband, John Johnson, counts.\n\nIn a 2022 deposition, Trump was shown the photo and mistook Carroll for his ex-wife, Marla Maples, despite having claimed Carroll wasn't his \"type.\"\n\nIn court the Trump team attacked trial Judge Lewis Kaplan's decision to allow two other women to testify that Trump had also assaulted them.\n\nOne of the women described Trump pushing her against a wall and forcibly kissing her during a mid-2000s magazine interview. The other said he suddenly began grabbing her breasts, trying to kiss her, and reaching up her skirt in a \"tussling match\" when they were seated next to each other on a plane in the late 1970s.\n\nCarroll's lawyers have defended the relevance of that testimony, saying it showed Trump \"engaged in a pattern of abruptly lunging at a woman in a semi-public place, pressing his body against her, kissing her, and sexually touching her without consent, and later categorically denying the allegations.\"\n\nThe arguments Friday in a Manhattan federal appeals court centered especially on the sexual assault story on the plane. John Sauer, a former solicitor general of Missouri, argued on behalf of Trump that there wasn't a law barring that kind of conduct on a plane at the time of the incident, and therefore it shouldn't have been presented to the jury to bolster Carroll's own story.\n\nJudge Susan L. Carney appeared to treat that argument with some skepticism. She suggested Congress passed statutes intended to allow evidence regarding serious conduct.\n\n\"I'm not sure how the jurisdictional element, the precise jurisdictional element, whether in an airplane, in the specific maritime jurisdiction, or what have what have you, impacts the conduct that Congress was willing to let juries consider in adjudicating these kinds of cases,\" Carney said.\n\nSauer responded that Congress' own statutory language only allowed for testimony about \"prohibited\" conduct, and that didn't include a sexual assault in airspace.\n\nRoberta Kaplan, who isn't related to Judge Lewis Kaplan, argued for Carroll that the plane allegation would have been a crime under a separate statute that covered assaults on planes. Carroll's lawyers have said the story, along with the magazine interview allegation, is similar to what Carroll said Trump did to her.\n\nJudge Denny Chin questioned whether, even if the alleged plane incident was a crime, it was sufficiently similar to Carroll's allegations to be relevant to her case. \"The fact pattern is different from the other incidents, which were in much more private places,\" he said.\n\nKaplan conceded that the woman didn't describe Trump leading her into a private part of the plane, but said the rest of the pattern \"is exactly the same.\"\n\n\"He had a pattern of having kind of pleasant chatting with a woman,\" Kaplan said. \"And then all of a sudden, out of nowhere, he would, for lack of better term, your honors, pounce.\"\n\nIn the appeal against the $5 million verdict, Trump's lawyers have said he should have been able to tell the jury that the case involved \"politically motivated bias.\" They also say the jury shouldn't have been allow to hear his infamous \"Access Hollywood\" statement that he kisses women without waiting for consent and that stars can grab women's genitals.\n\nJudge Myrna Pérez rounded out the panel of three judges who heard the arguments Friday."

      "text": "'You just can't control yourself': Judge threatens to kick Trump out of E. Jean Carroll defamation trial\n\nNEW YORK - A federal judge threatened to bounce former President Donald Trump from the courtroom Wednesday after a lawyer for E. Jean Carroll said he repeatedly made comments within earshot of the jury at his latest civil defamation trial.\n\n\"Mr. Trump, I hope I don't have to consider excluding you from the trial,\" Judge Lewis Kaplan told the 2024 Republican presidential frontrunner after Carroll's lawyer complained that the jury could hear him disparaging the former advice columnist's testimony. \"I understand you're probably eager for me to do that.\"\n\n\"I would love it,\" Trump growled from the defense table.\n\n\"You just can't control yourself in this circumstance, apparently,\" Judge Kaplan said.\n\nCarroll, 80, has claimed Trump, 77, sexually assaulted her in a department store dressing room almost 30 years ago. The trial in lower Manhattan will determine what, if any, damages Trump might owe Carroll after he publicly denied her allegations in 2019 when he was president.\n\nOn Wednesday, Carroll told the jury that Trump's attacks in June 2019, after she first went public with her allegations , led to an avalanche of abuse and threats. She said she physically ducked after reading the first emailed death threat. \"I thought I was gonna get shot,\" Carroll said.\n\nCarroll's lawyer Roberta Kaplan (no relation to the judge) led her through some of the threats she had received. One said the \"penalty for lying about rape should be execution by hanging or firing squad,\" while another said \"stick a gun in your mouth and pull the trigger and send yourself to HELL.\"\n\n\"I spent 50 years building a reputation,\" Carroll said. \"Now I'm known as a liar, a fraud, and a whack job.\"\n\nA lawyer for Carroll complained to the judge at a morning break from testimony and again during a lunch break that she could hear Trump making statements that shouldn't be heard by the jury. The attorney, Shawn Crowley, said she overheard Trump say \"It is a witch hunt\" and \"It really is a con job.\" Some of the jurors, Crowley added, were sitting closer to Trump than she was.\n\nCarroll's team began the morning by calling Carroll herself to the stand, as they make their case that Trump ruined her reputation and caused her to live in fear through his denials of sexually assaulting her.\n\nEven as Trump made a courtroom appearance during jury selection on Tuesday, he continued to attack Carroll on his Truth Social platform as a woman with a \"fake story\" who is \"seeking fame, fortune, and publicity.\" That behavior was still on display Wednesday, when Trump attended the full day's proceedings. He posted that Carroll's are accusations \"false\" and the case a \"HOAX.\"\n\nThe ongoing attacks could come back to haunt him. Crowley raised them during opening statements Tuesday, saying there were 22 just that day as of her team's last count and jurors should think about how much money it will take to make the \"self-proclaimed billionaire\" stop.\n\n\"It's time to show him no one is above the law,\" Crowley said.\n\nTrump's team, for their part, characterized Carroll as an attention-seeker who herself is to blame for the negative attention and threats she's received.\n\n\"She wants President Trump to pay for the risks she took,\" Trump lawyer Alina Habba told the jurors Tuesday. \"Her career has prospered and she has been thrust back into the limelight like she always wanted.\"\n\nThe case ties back to two lengthy denials Trump made while president in 2019 after Carroll came forward publicly with allegations that he raped her in a department store dressing room . Trump called her allegations \"a disgrace\" and said \"people should pay dearly for such false accusations.\"\n\nCrowley mirrored Trump's own language when she spoke to the jury on Tuesday, saying it is now his turn to \"pay dearly for what he's done.\"\n\nIn May, a jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing Carroll and for defaming her in a 2022 statement calling her a \"con job,\" though it didn't find him liable for rape. He was ordered to pay a combined $5 million.\n\nJudge Kaplan has ruled Trump isn't allowed to argue to the current jurors that he didn't assault Carroll in light of that May verdict. Instead, the trial is restricted to determining what if any damages he must pay for harm caused by the 2019 statements and to deter Trump from ongoing defamatory attacks against Carroll.\n\nTrump has stated he plans to attend the trial and \"explain I don't know who the hell she is.\" Kaplan denied Trump's request for a delay to the trial in light of funeral arrangements for Melania Trump's mother, but did say Trump could have until Monday to testify even if other aspects of the trial conclude this week.\n\nCarroll testified that she may have deleted threatening messages after the lawsuit began, saying she \"didn't know how to handle death threats\" and wanted them out of her mind. Habba pointed to it as grounds for a mistrial. \"The witness just admitted to deleting emails,\" Habba said.\n\nJudge Kaplan swiftly denied the request.\n\nIt was one of a series of tense exchanges between Habba and the judge. Habba opened the day by asking once again for scheduled proceedings on Thursday to be cancelled in light of funeral arrangements for Melania Trump's mother, even though Judge Kaplan has repeatedly denied that request in recent days.\n\nJudge Kaplan instructed Habba to \"please sit down\" and she retorted that she didn't like how he was speaking to her. \"I'm asking for an adjournment,\" she said. \"It's denied, sit down,\" he replied.\n\nJudge Kaplan also reproached Habba several times for attempting to introduce evidence improperly and trying to make statements about different laws in front of the jury, such as license requirements for the gun Carroll testified she inherited and keeps near her bed.\n\nIn cross-examination that is set to continue on Thursday, Habba asked Carroll about television appearances in which she discussed her allegations against Trump, as well as why Carroll didn't report death threats to the police.\n\n\"I'd be calling them constantly to come to my house,\" Carroll said.\n\nContributing: Associated Press"

      "text": "Trump loses appeal of sexual abuse and defamation judgment in E. Jean Carroll case\n\nA New York federal appeals court on Monday upheld a jury's verdict that President-elect Donald Trump sexually abused and defamed columnist E. Jean Carroll and owes her $5 million for doing so.\n\n\"We conclude that Mr. Trump has not demonstrated that the district court erred in any of the challenged rulings,\" the judges wrote. \"Further, he has not carried his burden to show that any claimed error or combination of claimed errors affected his substantial rights as required to warrant a new trial.\"\n\nRoberta Kaplan, a lawyer for Carroll, thanked the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals \"for its careful consideration\" of the arguments.\n\n\"Both E. Jean Carroll and I are gratified by today's decision,\" Kaplan said in a statement.\n\nSteven Cheung, a Trump spokesperson, said the American people have reelected Trump and demand a swift dismissal of litigation, including Carroll's lawsuit. Trump will continue to appeal the case, Cheung said.\n\nCarroll brought the lawsuit against the former president, claiming he assaulted her in a department store dressing room in the 1990s and then hurt her reputation by attacking her allegations as a \"con job\" in 2022. Trump has strongly denied her claims and disputed a Manhattan civil jury's unanimous verdict.\n\nIn his appeal , Trump's lawyers attacked trial Judge Lewis Kaplan's decision to allow two other women to testify that Trump assaulted them, too. Trump, who has maintained his innocence, argued he was entitled to a new trial.\n\nBut appeals court judges Denny Chin, Susan Carney and Myrna Perez disagreed. Chin and Carney were appointed by former President Barack Obama and Perez was appointed by President Joe Biden.\n\nThe appeals court ruled that such evidence is usually excluded but that acceptable purposes for allowing it included showing \"motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.\"\n\nWhen Congress adopted rules that Trump cited, the appeals court found that the rules allowed courts to admit evidence that a \"defendant has the motivation or disposition to commit sexual acts.\"\n\nOne of the two said Trump pushed her against a wall and forcibly kissed her as she was conducting a magazine interview in the mid-2000s. The other woman described him grabbing her breasts and trying to kiss her while reaching up her skirt on an airplane in the late 1970s. Trump denies those allegations as well.\n\nThe Trump team also argued the jury shouldn't have been allowed to hear Trump saying on an \"Access Hollywood\" recording that he kisses women without waiting for them to give consent and that stars can grab women's genitals.\n\n\"The jury could have reasonably concluded from those statements that, in the past, Mr. Trump had kissed women without their consent and then proceeded to touch their genitalia,\" the appeals court ruled.\n\nCarroll's lawyers argued that her sexual abuse case against Trump wasn't even close , in part because two friends of Carroll testified they heard her story of being assaulted by Trump soon after she says it happened. The lawyers also said the testimony from the other women who said they were assaulted by Trump demonstrated his propensity to assault women \"in markedly similar ways across time.\"\n\nThe $5 million verdict is only part of Trump's legal troubles with Carroll. A separate federal jury awarded Carroll another $83.3 million for statements Trump made in 2019, soon after Carroll went public with her allegations. At that time, Trump said \"people should pay dearly for such false accusations.\" Trump is still appealing that larger verdict .\n\nTrump has said Carroll's story is false and she isn't his \"type.\" Carroll's legal team has noted that during a 2022 deposition Trump confused Carroll in a photo from 1987 for his former wife, Marla Maples. Carroll testified at length in the sexual abuse case about her assault allegations and was cross-examined by Trump's legal team."

Jean Carroll took the stand Wednesday in her defamation lawsuit against former president President Donald Trump, she spoke of how he'd maligned her character.\n\n\"When I wrote about it, he said it didn't happen,'' said Carroll, who first revealed the alleged assault in a 2019 memoir. \"He lied and shattered my reputation, and I'm here to try and get my life back.\"\n\nCarroll who was cross-examined for hours by Trump's attorney Thursday, first sued Trump in 2019 and then filed another claim in November under a New York state law which gives abuse victims a year to sue even if the statute of limitation has ended for the alleged crime.\n\nTrump has repeatedly denied Carroll's rape allegation, and Carroll says Trump's statements that she was \"lying'' and engaged in a \"complete con job'' led to her being bombarded with a deluge of hateful messages .\n\nCarroll has been questioned and scrutinized for the story she told and the winding, sometimes colorful way she told it ever since she lodged her accusation. But the pioneering journalist has said that initially, she was surrounded by support.\n\n\"I've been in a cocoon of love and support,'' Carroll told USA TODAY in a phone interview in 2019 , saying then that people had been sending her positive messages, texts, and even approaching her on the street.\n\nIt was likely not the response some would have imagined. But Carroll has spent a lifetime defying expectations.\n\nA former beauty queen, she became a pioneer in the world of literary journalism. A daughter of the Midwest, she found renown in the elite media circles of New York. And in her 70s, Carroll remained a beacon to millions of readers seeking out her frank talk about sex, success and love.\n\nIn 2019, Lisa Chase remembered the first time she read a piece by Carroll.\n\n\"I thought she was hilarious,'' said Chase, who'd first edited Carroll three decades earlier when Chase was an editor with Outside magazine. \"When you hire E. Jean, you want a funny story with feeling and empathy.''\n\nBut though the two women became friends, Carroll's allegations of being sexually assaulted byTrump in a posh Manhattan department store nearly 30 years ago was one Carroll never shared.\n\n\"I was asking her for years to write a memoir,'' said Chase, who edited Carroll's advice column in Elle magazine from 2005 to 2017. \"I had no idea she had these stories. She kept them to herself.\"\n\nCarroll's book, \"What Do We Need Men For?'' detailed an allegation, first excerpted in New York magazine, that Trump assaulted her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in the mid-1990s. Two of Carroll's friends confirmed to the New York Times that she told them about the incident shortly after it allegedly occurred. Trump has continuously denied assaulting her.\n\n\"This is a fraudulent & false story,\" Trump has said on his Truth Social website.\n\nLong before this fraught moment in the media's glare, Carroll was a journalistic luminary, known for her Ask E. Jean advice column, and for being a presence amid the glitzy nightlife scene of 1980s and 90s New York.\n\n\"There's a circuit in New York,'' said Chase. \"You go out to events. You go to premieres.  ... You go to dinner parties. She was on TV. She was writing. She was beautiful and smart and funny. She was married to a person (John Johnson) who was a big on-air personality. She was in that world.''\n\nCarroll carved a niche in television, writing for \"Saturday Night Live\" in the 1980s and hosting her own \"Ask E. Jean'' show on MSNBC's predecessor, America's Talking, from 1994 to 1996.\n\nBut it was her writing, featured in publications like Rolling Stone and Playboy - where Carroll became the first woman to be named a contributing editor - that established Carroll as a trailblazer.\n\n\"That was the tabloid era,'' Roger Friedman, editor-in-chief of the entertainment news website Showbiz411, said in a 2019 interview.\n\nFriedman, who edited Fame magazine from 1987 to 1991 and later wrote New York magazine's Intelligencer column said : \"People were chasing scoops. You didn't have cell phones. You didn't have the internet. You had to get up, put your hat on and get the story. ... She was a person out talking to people.''\n\nCarroll became known for a style of writing and reporting dubbed gonzo journalism. A hallmark of writers like Hunter S. Thompson, whose biography Carroll wrote, and Tom Wolfe, it was a school of storytelling in which journalists often made themselves part of the tale, offering up humorous - sometimes outrageous - personal experiences.\n\n\"In the literary journalism world, she was a player, which is saying a lot,'' Chase said. \"There weren't a lot of women who were being hired by men's magazines. And she was.''\n\nCarroll also drew comparisons to famed filmmaker and writer Nora Ephron.\n\n\"Both are fiendish reporters who find their subject matter in left field,'' Kirkus Review wrote in a critique of \"Female Difficulties: Sorority Sisters, Rodeo Queens, Frigid Women, Smut Stars, And Other Modern Girls,\" a book Carroll penned in the 1980s. \"Carroll, though, is wilder than Ephron, content not just to set a scene but sometimes to steal one, too.\"\n\nCandace Bushnell, the writer whose \"Sex and The City'' column in the New York Observer inspired the iconic HBO show of the same name, was a fan.\n\n\"I've known E. Jean or known of her since at least the ' '80s,'' Bushnell said in an email sent to USA TODAY in 2019. \"She was the coolest woman journalist around - daring, had a ton of guts, and was as funny as the guys. She was a female gonzo journalist. In the mid-nineties I hung out with her quite a bit. ... There really wasn't and isn't anyone else like her.''\n\nChase said the last piece she asked Carroll to write was about an all-woman rafting trip. \"I think we called it women who run with no clothes on because at some point in the trip all the women took off their clothes and rafted naked down the river, which I'm sure was her idea. ... She's had an adventurous life.''\n\nElizabeth Jean \"Jeannie\" Carroll's journey started out much more conventionally.\n\nCarroll spent her childhood in Fort Wayne, Indiana, the oldest of four children in a family that included a younger brother and two sisters.\n\nIt was a Midwestern life, in mid-century America. But Carroll felt that she could be whatever, and whoever, she wanted to be. \"I was free,'' she told USA TODAY. \"I grew up in the '40s and '50s. I rode my bike all over town. I started to drive when I was 14. ... The world will knock you down, pay you less, tell you you're not as good. But when you're a kid, everything is possible.''\n\nCarroll's writing ambitions bloomed early . \"I was filling the U.S. mail with pitches to magazines ... at the age of 12,'' she remembers. \"So apparently I thought of myself as a writer. I mean, if I'm writing to the Sears and Roebuck catalog, pitching a story to them, I guess I wanted to be a writer.''\n\nA member of the class of 1967, Carroll was named Miss Indiana University, as well as Miss Cheerleader U.S.A., which earned her a scholarship.\n\nCarroll was also a member of the Pi Beta Phi sorority, but in an article in the October 1996 issue of Indianapolis Monthly, she says that the group \"kicked me out 20 years later for something I wrote for Playboy about sorority rush. I wasn't too kind.''\n\nThe first time Carroll touched down in New York was after college.\n\n\"I thought it was the most marvelous place in the world,'' she said. Her first job? \"Honda had their new motorcycle, and I sat on the Honda and greeted people at the World's Fair in the Japanese exhibit right across from the Japanese tea ceremony people. It was fabulous.''\n\nPeople from Indiana visiting the exhibition recognized her, asking if she was that cheerleader who'd been Miss Indiana University. \"I'd say, 'No, who are you talking about?' \"\n\nAfter that first brush with Manhattan, Carroll traveled to Africa, lived in Montana with her first husband, Steve Byers, and spent time in Chicago. But after she landed a piece in Esquire, Carroll's writing career began to take off.\n\nShe returned to New York to interview Fran Lebowitz for the cover of Outside magazine, and she stayed for good.\n\n\"I had jeans, cowgirl boots, a fringe jacket, a couple of shirts,'' she says. \"And that's it.\"\n\nIn her book, Carroll says that she had only met Trump once before the day she says she encountered him at Bergdorf Goodman. Trump, meanwhile, has said that he doesn't know her.\n\nHowever, there is a photograph showing that their paths did cross . Dated \"around 1987,'' it is a shot of Carroll; her then-husband, former New York City anchorman John Johnson; and Trump with his first wife, Ivana.\n\nAt the time the picture was taken, Times Square had not yet become the tourist mecca some later disparagingly likened to Disneyland. In those days, visitors to New York were still being warned not to ride the subway after dark.\n\n\"In the 80s, everyone worried about getting mugged,'' Friedman recalled. \"There was graffiti everywhere and your car was constantly broken into. ... Cars all had signs that said 'no radio inside.' \"\n\nBut New York was also the capital of media, finance and fashion, and for a glittering set, it was a glamorous, golden era. Studio 54, the legendary disco, shut its doors in 1980, but new night spots like Nell's rose up on the scene, and eateries like Michael's were among the cool corners where the chic and powerful gathered.\n\nOne of the most legendary was the bar and restaurant Elaine's, frequented by a local who's who of writers, actors and artists.\n\n\"I lived in Elaine's,'' Carroll said. \"I knew everybody there. I was sitting at the writer's table and that was heaven on Earth. ... You could go in at any time and there was always a table of writers, and you would just sit down. Sometimes detectives would join us. Sometimes prizefighters. But there was always a writers' table, and it was usually on a Thursday night.''\n\nEveryone who was anyone in the world of publishing would pass through, she says,  including Jackie Kennedy, who was an editor, Norman Mailer, and Gay Talese. \"Sometimes the evenings would be so hot with celebrities, it was unbelievable.''\n\nElaine's was also where she met Johnson, \"the big-time New York anchorman, and one of the prettiest and most accomplished men in Manhattan,'' she wrote in \"What Do We Need Men For?\" Johnson was sitting with TV journalist Geraldo Rivera, who, when the couple got married in the Hamptons, served as their best man.\n\nTrump was also a fixture on New York's nightlife scene. The 1980s was the decade when Trump Tower first opened its doors and Trump's memoir \"The Art of the Deal'' was published. Both helped turn him into a celebrity, propelling Trump's brash, boastful persona beyond the pages of the local tabloids to appearances on national shows like \"Late Night with David Letterman\" and \"60 Minutes.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Carroll's writing career continued to thrive. In 1993, her Ask E. Jean column debuted in Elle, and for nearly three decades, Carroll doled out tough love to its millions of readers, cushioning her guidance with humor, irreverence and references that included Saint Teresa and the artist Frida Kahlo.\n\nIn one column, dated Sept. 20, 2006, a woman wrote that she was \"married to the perfect man'' but was miserable because her wealthy husband was reluctant to even pay for her to get a facial.\n\nCarroll first gave the woman a recipe for homemade beauty treatment (\"Puree three tablespoons of honey, two tablespoons of milk and 10 strawberries ... Your skin will be instantly shimmerized.\"). She then told the advice seeker to get a job and to get out of the marriage.\n\n\"Now that you feel better, take a look around and ask yourself: Why am I letting this creep control my life?'' Carroll wrote. \"Hunny, he's well on his way to becoming an abuser. Get out while you can. ... Hire a good divorce attorney and leave.\"\n\n\"There was a lot of realism in her advice to women.\" said Chase, Carroll's editor at Elle. \"She thought about the way women really lived. ... She might say, 'Yes, you should leave him, but will you? Can you? And if you can't, here's what you can do to ... get to that point.' \"\n\nIn the course of their friendship, Chase said she, too, had received some straightforward advice from Carroll, who ran a dating service and had set her up on a couple of dates.\n\n\"She said to me ... 'It's impossible, you're never going to find anybody,'' said Chase, who was resuming dating after her husband, Peter Kaplan, the former editor of the New York Observer, died in 2013. \"I knew what she was saying. 'It's going to be very hard for you to find somebody who you love the way you loved him.' ...   It turns out she wasn't totally right because I did find someone I love. But it was a truthful moment, which I really appreciated.''\n\nStill, given the era in which Carroll grew up, Chase said that she was not surprised that a consummate giver of guidance would keep some of her own troubling experiences to herself.\n\n\"She's of a generation of women who were brought up not to do that,'' Chase said. \"She was beautiful and expected to do and be certain things and she wanted a bigger life. ...She's empathic. But she's also private about things.''\n\nCarroll's writing style and voice have informed her recounting of Trump's alleged sexual assault. And some have questioned the way she's described a traumatic event, as well as her refusal initially to call what she says happened rape.\n\n\"Every woman gets to choose her word,'' Carroll said in an interview on the New York Times' The Daily podcast after her allegation against Trump was first revealed . \"Every woman gets to choose how she describes it. ... I have not been raped. Something has not been done to me. I fought. That's the thing.''\n\nBut during her first day of testimony Wednesday, Carroll was clear.\n\n\"I'm here because Donald Trump raped me,\" she said.\n\nCarroll told USA TODAY that there was no mystery to how she came up with the nuggets she dispensed over decades to her readers.\n\n\"Giving advice is just following common sense,'' she said . \"Nothing special. That's it. I think that's why a lot of therapists write to me. ... They have studied for years and years and years, the psychology and the human being, but sometimes it's just a common-sense thing and the simplest advice will work.''\n\nWhen Carroll needs guidance, she said she turned to an unexpected source, reading passages written by classic writers like Henry David Thoreau and Marcus Aurelius.\n\nAurelius in particular has provided her the words she seems to have lived by.\n\n\"I learned that when you get up in the morning you have to believe that this could be the day you die and that grass will be very shortly growing on your grave, and so get on with it,\" she says. \"It's a real good way to get up. ... It really keeps you happy, oddly enough, because you've got nothing to lose.''\n\nContributing: Associated Press, Maria Puente, Nyssa Kruse, Indianapolis Star\n\nFollow Charisse Jones on Twitter @charissejones"

Jean Carroll to amend her defamation lawsuit against former President Donald Trump , a move that will allow her to seek additional damages.\n\nCarroll is asking the court for an award of at least $10 million.\n\nThe decision from U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in the Southern District of New York came on the same day Trump was arraigned and pleaded not guilty in Miami on charges related to his handling of classified documents.\n\nA day after a jury last month assessed Trump $5 million in damages for sexual abuse and defamation, Trump said during a CNN town hall that Carroll - a former magazine columnist - was a \"whack job\" who told a \"made-up story.\" Trump has appealed the verdict and the $5 million judgment against him .\n\nCarroll's attorneys said \"this conduct supports a very substantial punitive damages award in Carroll's favor both to punish Trump, to deter him from engaging in further defamation, and to deter others from doing the same.\"\n\nThe development was an incremental one: The court will still have to decide if Carroll is entitled to the additional damages. But it underscored the multiple legal problems that have ensnared Trump, who is seeking the GOP presidential nomination in 2024.\n\nContributing: David Jackson"

      "text": "E. Jean Carroll defamation case: Some Trump deposition excerpts ordered released as trial date set\n\nFormer President Donald Trump falsely suggested E. Jean Carroll, who is suing him for sexual assault and defamation , said in a TV interview that she found rape \"sexy.\"\n\nHe made the statement in excerpts of a deposition that a federal judge in New York City ordered made public last week.\n\nTrump also repeated past statements in which he denied assaulting or even knowing Carroll, called her a liar and added she was not his type, the excerpts show.\n\nCiting a 2019 interview of Carroll by CNN's Anderson Cooper, Trump said he believed his accuser said \"rape is sexy or something to that effect.\" Asked specifically if she said she \"loved being sexually assaulted by you,\" Trump replied, \"she said something to that effect.\"\n\nA transcript of the interview shows Carroll said: \"I think most people think of rape as being sexy. They think of the fantasies.\" Referring to the alleged assault, she said: \"It was against my will. And it hurt. And it was a fight.\"\n\nCarroll is a New York-based former magazine advice columnist and beauty queen. She is one of roughly 17 women who have alleged that Trump touched them inappropriately. He has denied the allegations, and said in the Oct. 19 deposition that he never touched a woman sexually without consent.\n\nBoth lawsuits filed by Carroll focus on what she alleges was a chance meeting and playful banter in the Bergdorf Goodman luxury department store roughly 27 years ago that suddenly \"took a dark turn.\"\n\nTrump, whom she said asked her to help him pick out a gift for a woman, went with her to the lingerie department and \"forced her up against a dressing room wall, pinned her in place with his shoulder, and raped her,\" the newest lawsuit alleges.\n\nCarroll filed a defamation case against Trump in 2019, alleging that he pursued a public campaign to discredit her by claiming she had concocted the alleged assault to help sell a book.\n\nIn November, she filed a second complaint, this time for sexual assault. Ordinarily, such a lawsuit would be blocked by the statute of limitations which bars certain types of cases after specified periods of time. However, a 2022 New York law gave adult victims of sexual assault who had not previously come forward a one-year window to file civil lawsuits against alleged attackers.\n\nManhattan U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan rejected Trump's effort to dismiss the defamation case and scheduled an April 10 trial date. However, the future of that lawsuit could be affected by an expected federal appeals court ruling on whether Trump's statements about Carroll were made as part of his official duties while president. If the appeals court rules in Trump's favor, the defamation case could be dismissed.\n\nKaplan on Friday rejected Trump's effort to dismiss the sexual assault case . He also rejected Trump's request to keep the deposition excerpts sealed. Kaplan's ruling authorized public access to excerpts of the depositions  of both Trump and Carroll in the defamation case.\n\nThe judge has not yet ruled on whether the cases should be consolidated or go to trial together.\n\nThe two cases are part of a much larger array of investigations and other legal issues hanging over Trump as he pursues another White House run in 2024."

      "text": "E. Jean Carroll just won a huge victory in her sexual abuse and defamation case against Trump. She still might not get paid anytime soon.\n\nManage your account\n\nAn appeals court upheld a jury verdict finding Donald Trump liable for sexually abusing E. Jean Carroll.\n\nHe owes her $5 million in damages for sexual abuse and defamation - but plans to keep appealing.\n\nTrump is also appealing a separate jury verdict for an additional $83.3 million in defamation damages.\n\nA federal appeals court on Monday upheld a verdict finding Donald Trump liable for sexually abusing and defaming writer E. Jean Carroll , starting a 30-day clock for her to receive the $5 million jury award, plus interest.\n\nIn an exhaustive, 77-page opinion, the US Second Circuit Court of Appeals rejected all of the legal arguments brought by Trump in seeking to overturn the May 2023 trial verdict.\n\nBut Carroll, now 81 years old, shouldn't hold her breath. A spokesperson for Trump told Business Insider the president-elect plans to keep appealing the verdict.\n\nThe appeal could keep the cash frozen well into next year, at least, legal experts told BI.\n\nIn the year and a half since the jury verdict, the $5 million Trump owes Carroll - plus $500,000 to cover interest - has been sitting in an interest-bearing bank account controlled by the federal trial court.\n\nIf Trump does not file a further appeal in the next 30 days, the court will automatically transfer that $5.5 million and any further interest directly to Carroll and her attorneys, said Nick Newton, a former president of the National Association of Surety Bond Producers.\n\n\"Both E. Jean Carroll and I are gratified by today's decision,\" Carroll's attorney Roberta Kaplan told Business Insider in a statement. \"We thank the Second Circuit for its careful consideration of the parties' arguments.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Trump called Carroll's claims a \"hoax\" and said he would continue to appeal.\n\n\"The American People have re-elected President Trump with an overwhelming mandate, and they demand an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and a swift dismissal of all of the Witch Hunts, including the Democrat-funded Carroll Hoax, which will continue to be appealed,\" Steven Cheung told BI in an email. \"We look forward to uniting our country in the new administration as President Trump makes America great again.\"\n\nTrump's options for further appeals are two-fold, according to Michel Paradis, who teaches constitutional law at Columbia Law School. The funds would remain frozen until the appeals are exhausted, meaning that Carroll would need to wait longer before getting any of the jury's awards.\n\nThe president-elect can first seek an en banc review, meaning a review of Monday's three-judge decision by all 13 active judges on the Second Circuit, plus Senior Judge Denny Chin, Paradis said.\n\nAfter that option, Trump could take his appeal to the US Supreme Court.\n\nWinning - or even being considered - for en banc is a high bar, Paradis said. Trump would have to explain to the full Second Circuit why the issues are so important, and the three-judge panel's decision is so profoundly wrong that it needs to be overturned.\n\n\"In a case like this, it could take a few months\" for the full panel to consider Trump's petition and any response they allow from Carroll's side, and then vote on whether to hear the case, he said.\n\n\"In this appeal, there were only basic legal questions in dispute, meaning how the law was applied, and the three-judge panel's review was limited to looking for an abuse of discretion,\" Paridis said.\n\nTrump will seek review from the US Supreme Court next, Paradis predicted. The president-elect selected three of the nine justices in his first term. He could place more justices on the bench by the time oral arguments would take place.\n\nThe president-elect would first have to ask the high court to hear his appeal, and that process could keep the Carroll judgment frozen well into next year, he said.\n\n\"SCOTUS would likely not decide to hear the case until the end of next September at the earliest,\" he said.\n\nIt's not clear who will be on Trump's legal team if he continues to appeal the case.\n\nJohn Sauer, who presented the oral argument before the Second Circuit, was designated by Trump to serve as the Justice Department Solicitor General in his next presidential term. Other attorneys who worked on the case, including Todd Blanche, Emil Bove, and Alina Habba, are set to serve other posts in the Justice Department or the White House.\n\nMonday's decision is for one of two separate civil lawsuits E. Jean Carroll brought against Trump.\n\nThe second trial took place in January 2024, and concerned additional defamation damages over Trump disparaging Carroll and calling her a liar.\n\nThe jury in that case awarded Carroll $83.3 million . Trump is appealing that case, too, with a process that is running on a separate track.\n\nMonday's appellate court decision largely focused on whether it was appropriate for US District Judge Lewis Kaplan, the trial judge, to allow certain types of evidence to be seen by the jurors who held Trump liable for sexually abusing Carroll.\n\nTrump's lawyers argued Kaplan should not have shown jurors the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, where Trump bragged about grabbing women by the genitals.\n\n\"The jury could have reasonably concluded from those statements that, in the past, Mr. Trump had kissed women without their consent and then proceeded to touch their genitalia,\" they wrote.\n\nTrump's attorneys had also argued it was inappropriate to allow testimony from Natasha Stoynoff and Jessica Leeds, two other women who had accused Trump of sexual misconduct. The Second Circuit judges agreed with Kaplan, ruling that their stories helped establish a pattern of conduct from Trump.\n\n\"The jury could reasonably infer from Ms. Stoynoff's testimony and the Access Hollywood tape that Mr. Trump engaged in similar conduct with other women - a pattern of abrupt, nonconsensual, and physical advances on women he barely knew,\" the judges wrote.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

      "text": "Trump loses appeal in E. Jean Carroll case. Here's who she is and her ties to Indiana\n\nManage your account\n\nEditor's note: This story was originally published in January. We are republishing it with the news that President-elect Donald Trump lost his appeal to a federal jury .\n\nBefore E. Jean Carroll's name became tied irrevocably to Donald Trump's , she was a trailblazer in New York City's elite literary circles. Before that, she was an advice columnist who appeared on TV.\n\nBut before all that, she was a Hoosier - a cheerleading beauty queen from Fort Wayne who graduated from Indiana University in the 1960s.\n\nCarroll grew up in \"middle America\" and felt she could get a job doing whatever she wanted, which, as it turned out, was to be a writer. Here's what you should know about her.\n\nElizabeth Jean Carroll is a lauded writer, journalist, author and advice columnist who was featured in Elle Magazine for nearly 30 years until 2020. She wrote for Saturday Night Live in the 1980s and hosted \"Ask E. Jean,\" a TV show that aired from 1994-96 and served as a precursor to MSNBC's \"America's Talking.\"\n\nCarroll's writing, known both for her humor and empathy, has been featured in publications like Rolling Stone, Esquire and Playboy where she was the first woman to serve as its contributing editor.\n\n\"In the literary journalism world, she was a player, which is saying a lot,'' a former editor said of Carroll in 2019. \"There weren't a lot of women who were being hired by men's magazines. And she was.''\n\nBeauty queen, journalist, pioneer: The many faces of E. Jean Carroll.\n\nDespite the glitz of New York City, Carroll's roots are planted firmly in the Midwest. She grew up in Fort Wayne as the oldest of four children. An IU graduate in the class of 1967, Carroll was named Miss Indiana University in 1963, as well as Miss Cheerleader U.S.A., which earned her a scholarship.\n\nCarroll, 80, claimed Trump, 77, sexually assaulted her in a New York City department store dressing room roughly 30 years ago, charges the former president has publicly denied.\n\nThe moment the dressing-room door closed, Carroll said Trump lunged at her, shoving her against a wall where he next pulled down her tights. Carroll gave a graphic account of the assault both in her book and in a later article.\n\nIn May, a jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing Carroll, but not for rape. Trump was also found guilty of defaming Carroll in 2022 when he called her a \"con job.\" He was ordered to pay $5 million.\n\nA civil defamation trial was set for January to determine how much money Trump should pay additionally after damaging Carroll's reputation.\n\nMore: Did Donald Trump rape E. Jean Carroll? Here's what a jury and judge said.\n\nTrump has strongly denied Carroll's accusations, saying in 2019: \"I've never met this person in my life. She is trying to sell a new book - that should indicate her motivation. It should be sold in the fiction section.\"\n\nA photo of Trump and Carroll together was taken around 1987 - years before the alleged assault - along with Trump's ex-wife, Ivana Trump, and Carroll's then-husband.\n\nTrump called Carroll's allegations \"a disgrace\" and said \"people should pay dearly for such false accusations.\"\n\nTrump's tone hasn't shifted much. On Wednesday, a New York judge threatened to toss Trump out of the courtroom after the belligerent ex-President could be heard making disparaging comments about Carroll within earshot of the jury.\n\nCarroll has received numerous threats ever since she went public. One said the \"penalty for lying about rape should be execution by hanging or firing squad,\" while another said \"stick a gun in your mouth and pull the trigger and send yourself to HELL.\"\n\n\"I spent 50 years building a reputation,\" Carroll said. \"Now I'm known as a liar, a fraud, and a whack job.\"\n\nOn Jan. 26, the former president was ordered by a federal civil jury to pay Carroll $83.3 million for defaming her in 2019, when he denied her allegations of sexual assault and said \"people should pay dearly for such false accusations.\"\n\nCarroll was awarded $18.3 million in compensatory damages and $65 million in punitive damages.\n\nJohn Tufts covers trending news for the Indianapolis Star.

Trump will continue to appeal the case, Cheung said.\n\nCarroll brought the lawsuit against the former president, claiming he assaulted her in a department store dressing room in the 1990s and then hurt her reputation by attacking her allegations as a \"con job\" in 2022. Trump has strongly denied her claims and disputed a Manhattan civil jury's unanimous verdict.\n\nMore: Did Donald Trump rape E. Jean Carroll? Here's what a jury and judge said.\n\nIn his appeal , Trump's lawyers attacked trial Judge Lewis Kaplan's decision to allow two other women to testify that Trump assaulted them, too. Trump, who has maintained his innocence, argued he was entitled to a new trial.\n\nBut appeals court judges Denny Chin, Susan Carney and Myrna Perez disagreed. Chin and Carney were appointed by former President Barack Obama and Perez was appointed by President Joe Biden.\n\nThe appeals court ruled that such evidence is usually excluded but that acceptable purposes for allowing it included showing \"motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.\"\n\nWhen Congress adopted rules that Trump cited, the appeals court found that the rules allowed courts to admit evidence that a \"defendant has the motivation or disposition to commit sexual acts.\"\n\nOne of the two said Trump pushed her against a wall and forcibly kissed her as she was conducting a magazine interview in the mid-2000s. The other woman described him grabbing her breasts and trying to kiss her while reaching up her skirt on an airplane in the late 1970s. Trump denies those allegations as well.\n\nThe Trump team also argued the jury shouldn't have been allowed to hear Trump saying on an \"Access Hollywood\" recording that he kisses women without waiting for them to give consent and that stars can grab women's genitals.\n\n\"The jury could have reasonably concluded from those statements that, in the past, Mr. Trump had kissed women without their consent and then proceeded to touch their genitalia,\" the appeals court ruled.\n\nCarroll's lawyers argued that her sexual abuse case against Trump wasn't even close , in part because two friends of Carroll testified they heard her story of being assaulted by Trump soon after she says it happened. The lawyers also said the testimony from the other women who said they were assaulted by Trump demonstrated his propensity to assault women \"in markedly similar ways across time.\"\n\nThe $5 million verdict is only part of Trump's legal troubles with Carroll. A separate federal jury awarded Carroll another $83.3 million for statements Trump made in 2019, soon after Carroll went public with her allegations. At that time, Trump said \"people should pay dearly for such false accusations.\" Trump is still appealing that larger verdict .\n\nTrump has said Carroll's story is false and she isn't his \"type.\" Carroll's legal team has noted that during a 2022 deposition Trump confused Carroll in a photo from 1987 for his former wife, Marla Maples. Carroll testified at length in the sexual abuse case about her assault allegations and was cross-examined by Trump's legal team.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Trump loses sexual abuse, defamation appeal against E.

His appeal focused on what he said were critical errors by U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, including allowing testimony from two other women who claimed they had been sexually accosted by Trump.\n\nJessica Leeds alleged that Trump started to grope her out of the blue while they were sitting next to each other on a flight to New York in the late 1970s, while Natasha Stoynoff testified that Trump pushed her against a wall and started kissing her in 2005, when she was at his Mar-a-Lago resort to interview him and Melania Trump for a story about their first wedding anniversary. Trump has denied their allegations.\n\nHis attorneys also cited Kaplan's decision to allow the jury to hear the so-called \"A ccess Hollywood \" tape as another error.

The \"evidence of other conduct was relevant to show a pattern tending to directly corroborate witness testimony and to confirm that the alleged sexual assault actually occurred,\" the ruling said.\n\nTrump is also appealing Carroll's $83 million defamation judgment against him in a separate but related case centering on defamatory comments he made about her while he was president and then after the $5 million verdict.\n\nThat case was actually the first suit she filed against Trump, but it was stalled while Trump argued that his comments were protected by presidential immunity, a claim the judge rejected.\n\nTrum p is a p p ealing that verdict to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, as well.\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com"

Jean Carroll won. A jury found last year that he was liable for sexually abusing Carroll and defaming her when the allegations became public.\n\nCarroll, a former magazine columnist, alleged that Trump raped her in a Bergdorf Goodman department store dressing room in 1996. The trial also involved a 2022 Truth Social post where Trump called the allegations a hoax.\n\nIn the federal court verdict from a three judge panel, jurors found that Trump did not commit rape, but found him guilty of sexual abuse and defamation. They awarded Carroll $2.02 million for sexual assault and $2.98 million in damages for defamation.\n\nIn January, a different jury ordered Trump to pay Carroll $83 million for defamation and reputational damage. He is appealing that verdict as well. In his denials, he said Carroll is \"not my type.\" He also said she made up the claim to promote her memoir.\n\nThe verdicts in Carroll's favor represent the first time that Trump has ever faced real consequences for his misogyny and alleged sexual violence. More than two dozen women have accused him of sexual assault. He has denied all allegations.\n\n\"I filed this lawsuit against Donald Trump to clear my name and to get my life back,\" Carroll said in a statement at the time of the $5 million verdict. \"Today, the world finally knows the truth. This victory is not just for me but for every woman who has suffered because she was not believed.\"\n\nTrump's lawyers argued in their appeal that the $5 million verdict should be thrown out because the judge permitted testimony from two other women who accused Trump of sexual misconduct during the trial. They also said he should not have allowed jurors to view the 2005 Access Hollywood tape where Trump bragged about groping women.\n\n\"We conclude that Mr. Trump has not demonstrated that the district court erred in any of the challenged rulings.

Jean Carroll jury verdict\n\nManage your account\n\nPresident-elect Trump on Tuesday asked a federal appeals court to reconsider a jury's verdict finding him liable for sexually abusing and defaming advice columnist E. Jean Carroll, insisting the trial was tainted by improper evidence.\n\nTrump asked the full 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to rehear the case after a three-judge panel on the court upheld the $5 million verdict late last month.\n\nThe new filing offers a full-throated rejection of Carroll's claims that Trump sexually assaulted her at a Manhattan department store in the mid-1990s, calling her story \"decades-old, facially implausible, politically motivated allegations.\"\n\n\"Carroll waited over 20 years to falsely accuse President Trump, did so at a time calculated to injure him politically and profit herself, and told a story that precisely matches a plotline from one of her favorite TV shows,\" the filing reads.\n\nTrump's lawyers' appeal revolves around arguments that the trial judge wrongfully allowed jurors to hear from two other women who accused the former president of sexual misconduct and listen to the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape, in which Trump is heard discussing grabbing women sexually without their consent.\n\n\"Taken together, these errors will result in the erroneous admission of inflammatory propensity evidence in many future cases, resulting in unjust verdicts based on passion and prejudice instead of the law and evidence,\" Trump's attorneys wrote in the petition.\n\nTrump's appeal is led by D. John Sauer, one of his personal attorneys who is Trump's nominee for solicitor general. The petition also listed Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, who are nominated to the No. 2 and No. 3 roles at the Justice Department, respectively.\n\nThe Hill has reached out to a spokesperson for Carroll's legal team for comment.\n\nAfter Carroll's attorneys respond in court filings, the full 2nd Circuit bench could vote to take up the appeal, a three-judge panel could rehear it or the court could reject Trump's petition entirely. Then, Trump could still seek the Supreme Court's review.\n\nCarroll has taken the president-elect to trial twice, spurring some of the highest-profile civil litigation against him as he campaigned for a second White House term.\n\nShe won the $5 million at the first trial in May 2023 by convincing a jury by a preponderance of the evidence that Trump sexually abused the advice columnist and later defamed her by denying her story.\n\nThat verdict underpinned the second trial, when a jury last year awarded Carroll another $83.3 million for other Trump statements ruled defamatory. Trump has similarly appealed that verdict, though it remains in earlier stages.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Trump's New E. Jean Carroll Defense Is That He Assaulted Other Women\n\nManage your account\n\nDonald Trump on Friday inexplicably started detailing two horrific sexual assault allegations made against him, as part of a hapless attempt to discredit a completely different sexual assault allegation.\n\nDuring a press conference in New York City, Trump gave rambling remarks in which he made gross references to two women who claim he sexually abused them. His comments came shortly after oral arguments concluded for the day in Trump's appeal of the verdict in E. Jean Carroll's sexual abuse and defamation case against him.\n\nTrump's lawyers argued in court Friday that  Carroll's 2023 rape trial was tainted by the presence of other allegations. While attempting to follow their lead to downplay Carroll's claims against him, Trump recapped the accusations two women made against him during the trial-as if that would somehow make him seem less guilty.\n\n\"There were two witnesses. One is a woman who followed me for years,\" Trump said , talking about Jessica Leeds, who told jurors at Carroll's civil trial that Trump had groped her when they sat next to each other on a plane to New York City in the late 1970s.\n\n\"There was no conversation. It was like out of the blue. It was like a tussle,\" Leeds claimed at the time.\n\nTrump's characterization of the interaction was quite a bit different: \"She said in 1979 I was in an airplane with her, commercial flight, and ... we became very intimate,\" said the former president.\n\nAs he told the story, Trump interrupted himself to say, \"I was famous then too. I've been famous for a long time,\" apropos of nothing. Later Trump tried to return to this point, dismissing the claims, saying, \"It's very funny, when you're rich and famous, you get lot of people come up with a lot of stories.\" Combined, Trump's remarks sounded eerily similar to his infamous Access Hollywood tape, where he claimed that \"when you're a star they let you\" grab their genitals.\n\nThroughout his explanation of the supposedly \"totally made-up story,\" Trump continued to insist that he didn't know when exactly their interaction had taken place, noting that this likely happened \"a long time ago,\" in 1979.\n\n\"I believe I had some pretty big success then, and I was being talked about a lot. Maybe The Art of the Deal was out, you know, sometime after that, I'm not sure. But I was well known,\" Trump said. As it happens, The Art of the Deal came out almost 10 years later, in 1987. In attempting to make light of the serious allegation, Trump boasted about his popularity and seemed to reveal his own faulty memory.\n\n\"And passengers are coming into the plane, and she said I was making out with her, and then, after 15 minutes-and then she changed her story a couple of times, maybe it was quicker-that I grabbed her at a certain part, and that was when she had enough,\" Trump said.\n\n\"So think of the impracticality of this,\" Trump urged. Later, he implied that her story made no sense because \"back in those days\" there was an arm rest between passengers on airplanes.\n\n\"What are the chances of that happening? What are the chances?\" Trump questioned. \"And, frankly, I know you're going to think it's a terrible thing to say, but it couldn't have happened. It didn't happen. And, she would not have been the chosen one. She would not have been the chosen one.\"\n\nThe story was \"a total lie,\" according to Trump. \"Now, I assume she'll sue me now for defamation like I got sued by E. Jean Carroll.\"\n\n\"No police reports, no witnesses, no corroboration of any kind. No criminal suggestions. No nothing,\" Trump said, appearing to read off a card in front of him.\n\nTrump then moved on to the allegations made against him by journalist Natasha Stoynoff, who'd testified that while she visited Mar-a-Lago to interview Trump and Melania for an article in 2005, the former president had pushed her against a wall and forcibly kissed her, before they were discovered by Trump's butler.\n\nThroughout Trump's remarks Friday, he repeatedly referred to pieces of paper he was holding, but that did not seem to help him recall key details-like, who he was actually choosing to defame in the first place.\n\n\"Her name was ... whoever. Let's see. Her name ... was who?\" Trump leaned back so his lawyer, Alina Habba, could feed him the answer.\n\n\"Swornov? Yeah. I don't have it,\" Trump said , confused. \"Whatever her name was-I don't know the lady, so. Perhaps it's better that way, but I don't know the lady.\"\n\nTrump claimed he couldn't possibly have assaulted her, because she had ultimately written a \"beautiful story.\"\n\nThroughout his remarks, Trump's lawyers looked increasingly displeased with their client's ramblings-but it seems that Trump wasn't too happy with them, either.\n\n\"I'm disappointed in my legal talent, I'll be honest with you,\" Trump said while standing right in front of them, complaining that they had not brought up \"such a famous dress \" that was \"Monica Lewinsky part two,\" which he claimed would have exonerated him."

Jean Carroll expressed \"very serious concerns\" Thursday that she won't be able to collect the $83 million from former President Trump that a jury awarded in Carroll's defamation lawsuit last month, citing Trump's various legal woes.\n\n\" He simply asks the Court to 'trust me' and offers, in a case with an $83.3 million judgment against him, the court filing equivalent of a paper napkin; signed by the least trustworthy of borrowers,\" Roberta Kaplan, Carroll's lawyer, wrote in court papers .\n\nThe new filing responds to Trump's demand that his trial judge delay enforcing the eight-figure sum as the former president attempts to get the verdict reduced or eliminated entirely in post-trial motions. In the alternative, Trump asked the judge to allow him to post bond in a \"substantially reduced amount.\"\n\nOpposing those demands, Carroll pointed to the more than $454 million judgment in Trump's civil fraud case, which only grows in interest each day it's left unpaid.\n\n\"To begin, recent developments give rise to very serious concerns about Trump's cash position and the feasibility (and ease) of collecting on the judgment in this case,\" Carroll's lawyers wrote.\n\nTrump on Wednesday offered to post a $100 million bond in the fraud case while he appeals, writing in court filings that the eye-popping judgment made it \"impossible\" to secure a bond in the full amount.\n\nFormer advice columnist E. Jean Carroll, right, leaves federal court with her lawyer Roberta Kaplan, Thursday, April 27, 2023, in New York. Donald Trump's lawyer sought Thursday to pick apart a decades-old rape claim against the former president, questioning why accuser E. Jean Carroll did not scream or seek help when Trump allegedly attacked her in a department store.(AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews)\n\nA New York judge in the trial court's appellate division ruled that enforcement of the multimillion-dollar judgment would not be paused unless Trump could post a complete bond but did pause the enforcement of two penalties regarding the former president's ability to seek loans and serve in top leadership positions of his and other New York companies.\n\nIf Trump posts the full judgment, the financial penalties will be immediately paused. If he doesn't, under the Wednesday ruling, New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) can begin to collect the full amount - a process that could mean selling famed properties or other assets.\n\nA federal jury in New York awarded Carroll the $83.3 million after Trump was ruled to have defamed the advice columnist by denying her sexual assault claims in 2019, when Carroll came forward publicly.\n\nTrump has insisted that Carroll made up the story to sell her book.

In a deposition with James's office last year, Trump said he has \"substantially in excess of $400 million in cash.\"\n\nBut between the $454 million judgment in the fraud case and the $83.3 million verdict in Carroll's case, it's unclear the former president has the cash to pay up.\n\nCarroll on Thursday also noted the 91 charges across four criminal cases that could \"end his career as a businessman permanently.\"\n\nTrump's first criminal trial over a hush money deal during the 2016 election is scheduled to begin next month in New York. He also faces federal prosecutions in Washington, D.C., for alleged election interference and in Florida for his purported mishandling of classified documents, plus charges in Georgia he interfered in the state's election.\n\n\"Moreover, by the time the post-trial motions (or the appeal) are fully resolved, Trump may be in a very different position,\" Carroll's lawyers wrote.\n\n\"He could then be President of the United States; he could then be a convicted criminal serving time behind bars; or, given his advanced age, Carroll may be forced to reckon with his estate.

Jean Carroll's lawsuit against former President Donald Trump. They found him liable for sexual abuse and awarded Ms. Carroll $5 million, but they rejected her claim of rape.\n\nLoading...\n\nMay 09, 2023, 4:11 p.m. ET | New York\n\nA jury found Donald Trump liable Tuesday for sexually abusing advice columnist E. Jean Carroll in 1996, awarding her $5 million in a judgment that could haunt the former president as he campaigns to regain the White House.\n\nThe verdict was announced in a federal courtroom in New York City on the first day of jury deliberations. Jurors rejected Ms. Carroll's claims that she was raped but found Mr. Trump liable for sexually abusing her.\n\nHours earlier, U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan read instructions on the law to the nine-person jury before the panel began discussing Ms. Carroll's allegations of battery and defamation shortly before noon.\n\nMr. Trump, who did not attend the trial, has insisted he never sexually assaulted Ms. Carroll or even knew her.\n\nMr. Kaplan told jurors that the first question on the verdict form was to decide whether they think there is more than a 50% chance that Mr. Trump raped Ms. Carroll inside a store dressing room. If they answered yes, they would then decide whether compensatory and punitive damages should be awarded.\n\nIf they answered no on the rape question, they could then decide if Mr. Trump subjected her to lesser forms of assault involving sexual contact without her consent or forcible touching to degrade her or gratify his sexual desire. If they answered yes to either of those questions, they would decide if the damages were appropriate.\n\nOn defamation claims stemming from a statement Mr. Trump made on social media last October, Mr. Kaplan said jurors needed to be guided by a higher legal standard - clear and convincing evidence.\n\nHe said they would have to agree it was \"highly probable\" that Mr. Trump's statement was false and was made maliciously with deliberate intent to injure or out of hatred or ill will with reckless disregard for Ms. Carroll's rights.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Trump posted a new message on social media, complaining that he is now awaiting the jury's decision \"on a False Accusation.\" He said he is \"not allowed to speak or defend myself, even as hard-nosed reporters scream questions about this case at me.\"\n\nMr. Trump said he will not speak until after the trial, \"but will appeal the Unconstitutional silencing of me ... no matter the outcome!\"\n\nMr. Trump never attended the trial, which is in its third week, and rejected an invitation to testify, which the judge extended through the weekend even after Mr. Trump's attorney, Joe Tacopina, said Thursday that his client would not testify.\n\nMr. Tacopina told the jury in closing arguments Monday that Ms. Carroll's account is too far-fetched to be believed. He said she made it up to fuel sales of a 2019 memoir in which she first publicly revealed her claims and to disparage Mr. Trump for political reasons.\n\nMs. Carroll's attorney, Roberta Kaplan, cited excerpts from Mr. Trump's October deposition and his notorious comments on a 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" video in which he said celebrities can grab women between the legs without asking.\n\nShe urged jurors to believe her client.\n\n\"He didn't even bother to show up here in person,\" Mr. Kaplan said. She said much of what he said in his deposition and in public statements \"actually supports our side of the case.\"\n\n\"In a very real sense, Donald Trump is a witness against himself,\" she said. \"He knows what he did. He knows that he sexually assaulted E. Jean Carroll.\"\n\nMs. Carroll testified that she had a chance encounter with Mr. Trump at the Bergdorf Goodman store across the street from Trump Tower. She said it was a lighthearted interaction in which they teased each other about trying on a piece of lingerie before Mr. Trump became violent inside a dressing room.\n\nMr. Tacopina told jurors there was no reason to call Mr. Trump as a witness when Ms. Carroll can't even recall when her encounter with Mr. Trump happened.\n\nHe told the jury Ms. Carroll made up her claims after hearing about a 2012 \"Law and Order\" episode in which a woman is raped in the dressing room of the lingerie section of a Bergdorf Goodman store.\n\n\"They modeled their secret scheme on an episode of one of the most popular shows on television,\" he said of Ms. Carroll.\n\nTwo of Ms. Carroll's friends testified that she told them about the encounter with Mr. Trump shortly after it happened, many years before the \"Law and Order\" episode aired.\n\nThis story was reported by The Associated Press.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Jean Carroll accused President Donald Trump of sexually assaulting her in a dressing room at the Bergdorf Goodman department store in Manhattan 23 years ago, few of the nation's major media outlets treated it as bombshell news.\n\nJust a few days later, however, many journalists and critics have begun to wonder why. The president immediately denied what would  have been an explosive, news-dominating allegation, and he quickly attacked the well-known author's credibility, suggesting her possible ulterior motives.\n\nMs. Carroll leveled her accusations, after all, in an excerpt taken from her fifth book , and published Friday in New York Magazine - a little more than a week before her book's scheduled release. \"Shame on those who make up false stories of assault to get publicity for themselves, or sell a book, or carry out a political agenda,\" President Trump said.\n\nIn the #MeToo era, editors must be extremely cautious in handling sexual assault accusations. But allegation fatigue should not cause news outlets - or other institutions - to pass over credible new charges.\n\nThe columnist's accusation and the president's denial were all but absent in this weekend's headlines and Sunday morning roundtables, and many media watchers decried the fact that this latest allegation barely caused a stir .\n\nYet when it comes to discerning the credibility of those who allege sexual assault, many media ethicists and journalists say, it is actually essential that news outlets react in a sober-minded and particularly careful way.\n\n\"I do think that in the MeToo era, news outlets have had to be extremely cautious and extremely meticulous about what they publish,\" says Lauren Wright, lecturer in politics and public affairs at Princeton University in New Jersey, and a frequent political analyst on Fox News, CNN, and other news outlets. \"They do check it out, they do figure it out, and they do have that due diligence process, and that sometimes takes a few days.\"\n\nThe reporting of The New York Times and other outlets, in fact, helped give voice to the many women who were sexually harassed and assaulted by Hollywood moguls like Harvey Weinstein as well as Fox News titans Bill O'Reilly and Roger Ailes.\n\nStill, critics singled out the particular dearth of coverage in this weekend's editions of the Times, which won a Pulitzer Prize for its investigations of what became the #MeToo movement. On Monday, the publication's executive editor, Dean Baquet, admitted that \"we were overly cautious\" in their handling of Ms. Carroll's allegations against the president.\n\nBut Mr. Baquet also provided insight into the guidelines the paper employs when trying to assess the credibility of an accuser. These include locating sources other than those mentioned by the accusers who are willing to corroborate their allegations on the record. In this story, Mr. Baquet said, The Times could not find any independent sources beyond the two friends Ms. Carroll cited in her book, or any other additional corroborating evidence.\n\nNevertheless, given that a respected public figure like Ms. Carroll, whose advice column \"Ask E. Jean\" has appeared in Elle magazine since 1993, was making a public allegation against a sitting president \"should've compelled us to play it bigger,\" he said.\n\n\"But the history of coverage of sexual assault in America's media has always been one of extreme caution, and that is driven by a sense of fairness,\" says Ken Paulson, former editor-in-chief of USA TODAY and now the director of the Free Speech Center at Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro. \"It's an allegation that, once unveiled, never gets put away.\"\n\nAnd all things being equal, Mr. Paulson suggests, President Trump's questions about the credibility of his accuser and her possible motives are usually valid concerns.\n\n\"If you take the same fact situation, and someone in your community accuses a small-town mayor of rape from 23 years earlier, and there's no other indications of such behavior,\" he says, \"you would look at that with considerable caution. You would ask understandable questions: Why is the allegation being made today?\"\n\nBut as he and other observers point out, all things are far from equal when it comes to President Trump. Ms. Carroll is the 22nd woman to accuse Trump on the record of sexual assault or misconduct, and hers is in many ways the most serious, as she alleges an attack that included forced penetration.\n\nAdd to these accusations, too, the fact that the president described sexually assaulting women in the infamous Access Hollywood video and audiotapes.\n\n\"The credibility regarding charges of sexual assault should be the same as in any other matter: What are the facts, and who and how many people can testify to those facts?\" says Paul Levinson, professor of media studies at Fordham University in New York. \"People should make decisions about whom to believe with the utmost gravity. The credibility of the accused and the accuser should both be taken into account.\"\n\nEven though Dr. Wright at Princeton University agrees that the news media has generally handled the recent allegations of rape against the president in an even-handed and proper way, she points out that it is far more complicated when it comes to assessing the credibility of women accusing powerful men of sexual assault.\n\n\"The first thing we always do is question their credibility and ask questions about them,\" she says. \"And their claims are always scrutinized ad nauseam.\"\n\n\"And the baseline, I would say, is not that we believe women, the baseline is that we do not believe women,\" continues Dr. Wright, author of \"Star Power: American Democracy in the Age of the Celebrity Candidate.\" \"And that has been the case going back to the beginning of time, as long as humans have existed - women have not been believed.\"\n\nFalse accusations are rare when it comes to sexual assault, according to an in-depth survey of existing research on the subject by the National Sexual Violence Resource Center , a nonprofit in Pennsylvania. Only 2% to 7% of accusations in various parts of the counter were found to be fabricated or false.\n\n\"Nobody wants to become famous from their story of sexual assault,\" Dr. Wright says. \"I mean, this idea has been proven again and again, that women face many more consequences when they come out with their story, and the rewards, really, are nonexistent. Society actually punishes you.\"\n\nSome observers also saw an \"outrage fatigue\" at work in the news media's cautious response to Ms. Carroll's accusations, especially on the heels of the divisive confirmation hearings of Justice Brett Kavanaugh last year.  Others pointed out, too, that the most recent allegations against President Trump were part of a busy weekend in the news, including the humanitarian crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border and the administration's mulling military action against Iran.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

And that, in some way, can affect editors who sort of go, here we go again.\"\n\n\"But I guess the long and short of it is that I think that the press overall has acted responsibly, even though there are factors in this case that would lead you not to strip it across the top of your front page in a headline,\" he continues. \"These should give anyone caution, but it also doesn't mean you shouldn't cover the accusations, and that you should actually dig deeper.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Jean Carroll in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room some 30 years ago.\n\nThe case involves civil charges, unlike the historic criminal indictment of Mr. Trump earlier this month by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. Civil trials adjudicate disputes between people or organizations and don't result in time in prison or on parole. In the vast majority of cases judgments against defendants result in money changing hands.\n\nThe former president has emphatically denied the alleged assault and suggested Ms. Carroll invented it to increase sales of a 2019 book in which she described the incident.\n\nA civil lawsuit against Donald Trump, starting tomorrow, could renew focus on his alleged pattern of sexual misbehavior. And it piles atop other legal challenges facing the former president.\n\nBut with trials and pending trials beginning to multiply, Mr. Trump and his lawyers face the prospect of lurching from one courtroom to the next, defending against an array of cases of varying levels of seriousness. Mr. Trump may soon be indicted in Georgia on charges related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 vote in that state. Federal special counsel Jack Smith looms in the background, investigating Mr. Trump's alleged role in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, and his possible illegal retention of classified documents following his term in office.\n\nThe Carroll case, set to go to trial on April 25, may also return to the headlines Mr. Trump's past crude statements about women, plus multiple allegations of groping and sexual misbehavior. U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan ruled in March that Ms. Carroll can present as evidence the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape, in which Mr. Trump boasted he could \"grab\" women, and the testimony of two other women, Natasha Stoynoff and Jessica Leeds, who have claimed he assaulted them.\n\nMs. Carroll is a New York-based journalist and a longtime former advice columnist for Elle magazine. In the mid-1990s she was host and producer of the \"Ask E. Jean\" show on NBC's America's Talking cable network, the predecessor to MSNBC.\n\nIn her legal complaint against Mr. Trump , Ms. Carroll says that one evening between the fall of 1995 and the spring of 1996 she left work and went to Bergdorf Goodman's to shop. Exiting empty-handed through a revolving side door, she encountered Mr. Trump entering through the same entrance.\n\nMr. Trump put his hand up to prevent her leaving and said, \"Hey, you're that advice lady!\" in Ms. Carroll's retelling. She replied, \"Hey, you're that real estate tycoon!\"\n\nThe pair began searching for a gift that Mr. Trump could give to an unnamed female acquaintance. He rejected a handbag and a hat, according to Ms. Carroll's complaint. He decided they should look at lingerie instead.\n\nEntering the lingerie department, Mr. Trump allegedly snatched up a bodysuit and insisted that Ms. Carroll try it on. She insisted he try it on. He maneuvered her into the dressing room, shut the door, and suddenly began to assault her, according to the complaint.\n\nShe tried to resist, stomping with her high heels, but Mr. Trump opened his overcoat and raped her, Ms. Carroll alleges. She ran out of the dressing room and the store onto Fifth Avenue.\n\n\"The whole attack lasted two to three minutes,\" her complaint alleges.\n\nMs. Carroll says that in the immediate aftermath of the incident she confided in two friends: writer Lisa Birnbach and news anchor Carol Martin. Both have since confirmed that she did so.\n\nBut Ms. Carroll ultimately decided not to go to the police, she says, in the belief that she would be dragged through the mud, and that the wealthy Mr. Trump could afford enough lawyers to legally crush her.\n\nShe remained silent for 20 years. Then came the public charges against movie producer Harvey Weinstein and the onset of the #MeToo movement. Ultimately, she wrote about the alleged assault as a section in her 2019 book, \"What Do We Need Men For?\" a collection of stories about men she judged the worst she had ever encountered.\n\nMr. Trump has denied Ms. Carroll's allegations in his typical forcefully worded style ever since they became public four years ago.\n\n\"I've never met this person in my life,\" then-President Trump said in a statement in June 2019 . \"She is trying to sell a new book - that should indicate her motivation. It should be sold in the fiction section.\"\n\nOn a number of occasions Mr. Trump has said Ms. Carroll is not his \"type,\" suggesting that it is improbable an assault occurred because he would not have pursued her romantically.\n\nHowever, during a deposition taken in October 2022, Mr. Trump mistook a photo of Ms. Carroll for a picture of Marla Maples, his second wife.\n\nFrom the portions of the transcript that have been released the deposition appears to have been combative . At times Mr. Trump became angry with Ms. Carroll's lawyer Roberta Kaplan. (She is unrelated to Judge Kaplan, who is scheduled to oversee the trial.)\n\n\"I will sue her after this is over, and that's the thing I really look forward to doing,\" Mr. Trump said of Ms. Carroll at one point.\n\n\"And I'll sue you too,\" he said to Ms. Kaplan.\n\nThe deposition also hints at the legal strategy Mr. Trump's lawyers may pursue in the trial after its scheduled beginning on Tuesday.\n\nMr. Trump continually challenges Ms. Carroll's mental stability throughout his interview with her lawyers. At one point, he indicates that he believes that during an interview on CNN with Anderson Cooper about her allegations, \"she said rape was sexy.\"\n\nThat seems a misreading of what Ms. Carroll said. In the interview, she expanded on why she does not use the word \"rape\" in conjunction with her allegations against Mr. Trump. That is partly because \"I think most people think of rape as being sexy,\" she said, according to a transcript of the interview .\n\n\"I thought of it as a violent incident. I thought of it as a fight,\" she said of her alleged encounter with Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Cooper is on the list of possible defense witnesses Mr. Trump's lawyers may call to the stand in the upcoming trial.\n\nMs. Carroll has filed two separate lawsuits against former President Trump centering on his alleged actions in the mid-1990s.\n\nShe first sued Mr. Trump for defamation in 2019 over claims that he had never met her, and that she had invented the attack to bolster her book sales. In September 2020, the Justice Department abruptly intervened in the proceedings on Mr. Trump's behalf, citing a law meant to protect federal employees from litigation stemming from their official duties.\n\nThat suit, \"Carroll I,\" has remained stuck while courts wrangle over whether Mr. Trump was acting within the scope of his duties as president when he spoke to the press in 2019 and denigrated Ms. Carroll and her motives.\n\nMs. Carroll filed her second lawsuit in November 2022, after New York state enacted a law opening a one-year window to allow victims of past sexual assaults to bring their old charges to court, despite statutes of limitations.\n\n\"Carroll II,\" like its predecessor, charges Mr. Trump with defamation. This time, the charge is derived from statements Mr. Trump made after he left office in January 2021, so the question of whether he was acting within the bounds of his duties as president at the time does not come into play. It adds in a battery claim for the alleged assault itself.\n\nIt is this second lawsuit that is coming to trial tomorrow in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, with Judge Kaplan presiding.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nJudge Kaplan recently denied a request by Trump lawyers for a one-month delay in the trial's onset due to the \"deluge of prejudicial media coverage\" resulting from the former president's indictment in New York state court on charges related to the payment of hush money to a porn star. The judge said there was no need for such a postponement, given that Mr. Trump is the subject of constant media attention, and that the media coverage of his indictment was largely \"invited or provoked by Mr. Trump's own actions.\"\n\nJudge Kaplan has also ruled that the jury will be allowed to hear the \"Access Hollywood\" tape , and the claims of Ms. Stoynoff and Ms. Leeds that Mr. Trump also attacked them. In cases such as this, evidence of previous alleged bad acts is often disallowed. But revisions to federal rules on evidence in the 1990s opened the door for its use in sexual assault cases.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Jean Carroll's sexual assault and defamation lawsuit against him. Historically that's been the case, he said.\n\n\"I guess that's been largely true. ... Unfortunately or fortunately,\" he said.\n\nThe verdict against Donald Trump could go beyond implications for the former president, potentially signaling a greater willingness to believe women's stories of assault.\n\nOn Tuesday, a New York jury replied, in essence, \"Not so fast. It's not going to be true for this case, at least.\"\n\nThe finding of the six men and three women of a federal jury on Tuesday that Mr. Trump is liable for sexually assaulting Ms. Carroll in the 1990s, and defaming her since by calling her a liar, is a serious legal defeat for a man who once sat in the Oval Office and wants to do so again.\n\nBut in some ways, it may be more than that, say some experts. It could also be a marker for how the law and courts have evolved in recent years to make it less difficult - though perhaps still not easy - for women to tell their stories of assault and be believed.\n\n\"I think this verdict is a teachable moment for America. It demonstrates that jurors will believe survivors who bring sexual assault cases many years after the incident, because of the very real dynamics that deter them from coming forward,\" says Barbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan who is now a law professor at the University of Michigan.\n\nThe Carroll lawsuit involves civil charges, unlike the historic criminal indictment of Mr. Trump last month by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg on charges related to the payment of hush money to a porn star. Civil trials adjudicate disputes between people or organizations and don't result in sentences of prison or parole. In the vast majority of cases, judgments against defendants result in money changing hands.\n\nOn Tuesday, after only three hours of deliberation, that is what the jury decided should happen. It ruled that Mr. Trump should pay around $5 million in damages to Ms. Carroll for sexually assaulting her in a dressing room at the Bergdorf Goodman department store sometime in the mid-1990s, and later using harsh language to call her a liar after she made her assault allegations public in a 2019 book.\n\nThe jury did not find that Mr. Trump raped Ms. Carroll, as she had charged.\n\nAfter the verdict, Mr. Trump continued to insist that the assault had never occurred and that he would press for the ruling to be overturned.\n\n\"I have no idea who this woman, who made a false and totally fabricated accusation, is. Hopefully justice will be served on appeal!\" Mr. Trump wrote Wednesday on Truth Social.\n\nThe former president has also continued to criticize federal District Judge Lewis Kaplan, calling him \"completely biased\" and \"terrible.\" Meanwhile, he has begun to raise money off the verdict. One fundraising letter emailed to supporters Wednesday morning said that the U.S. justice system has been hijacked by sinister political forces and Mr. Trump's \"freedom and justice did not matter to the Marxists who orchestrated this witch hunt in a city where the voter registration of the jury pool favors Democrats 7:1.\"\n\nThe trial of Ms. Carroll's accusations against Mr. Trump played out in the courtroom almost as a clash of two eras - the time before the #MeToo movement, and the time after.\n\nAs New York Times opinion columnist Michelle Goldberg put it , \"The trial itself was a test of how much #MeToo has changed the culture.\"\n\nThe New York state law under which Ms. Carroll was able to pursue damages for a decades-old incident was itself something of a #MeToo artifact . Under the Adult Survivors Act, which took effect late last year, victims of sexual abuse have until November 2023 to file civil complaints against their alleged abusers.\n\nDuring the trial, Ms. Carroll's lawyers took pains to explain to the jury why someone such as their client might have remained silent about abuse for years, afraid that they would not be believed and their allegations ridiculed. They talked about how victims of violence can remember some things vividly, and other things not at all - and how their reactions can vary in later years.\n\nOn the other hand, Mr. Trump's lawyer, Joseph Tacopina, ran what might have been a textbook defense against sexual assault allegations in the 1990s, long before the pathbreaking rape prosecutions of Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein and comedian Bill Cosby.\n\nMr. Tacopina bored in on why Ms. Carroll had kept quiet so long, why she had not gone to the police at the time, and whether she thought rape was \"sexy.\"\n\nHe asked directly why she hadn't screamed.\n\nMs. Carroll said she had tried to push Mr. Trump off her, stomped on his foot, hit him with her handbag, and tried to knee him.\n\n\"I was in too much of a panic to scream,\" she testified. \"I was fighting.\"\n\nIn the end, the jury did not accept the old stereotype that an assault victim would surely scream as loudly as possible, behave in predictable ways, and run to law enforcement.\n\n\"The verdict ... demonstrates that the focus should not be on whether the survivor screamed or resisted, but on the misconduct of the assailant,\" says Professor McQuade.\n\nWhen Mr. Trump was indicted in early April by Mr. Bragg, his standing within the Republican Party strengthened. Voters who previously might have been leaning toward Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis or other possible GOP standard-bearers turned toward the former president, perhaps in solidarity against perceived Democratic overreach. Mr. Trump quickly built a solid nomination lead.\n\nIt's difficult to predict whether that will happen again - or indeed, what will happen to Mr. Trump's standing with the larger electorate. The Carroll verdict is the ending of a case, not a beginning. It involves ugly behavior. But it was a civil trial, a lawsuit - not a prosecution with the threat of prison at the end.\n\nMr. Trump survived the \"Access Hollywood\" tape once before, when it came out just prior to the 2016 vote. Some top Republicans thought his crude comments would doom him in the general election, and that he should drop out.\n\nJournalist Robert Costa, then with The Washington Post, interviewed Mr. Trump the morning after the \"Access\" tape broke. On Wednesday he posted his memories of the encounter on Twitter . Mr. Trump was \"flippant\" and \"short,\" wrote Mr. Costa, who is now with CBS News.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nWhen Mr. Costa asked about the issues raised by the tape, Mr. Trump kept talking about his core voters, focused on what he would say to them that day. He seemed bored by any discussion of moral or political consequences.\n\nAt the end of the interview Mr. Trump emphasized that he would never quit the race. \"Forget that. That's not my deal,\" he said, according to Mr. Costa.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in\n\nMonitor journalism changes lives because we open that too-small box that most people think they live in.

Two convictions for defamation against writer E. Jean Carroll will cost him some $88 million, unless the awards are reduced on appeal. He will likely be on the hook for hundreds of millions more after New York state Justice Arthur Engoron, who has already found the Trump family business liable for financial fraud, rules on penalties in that case.\n\nAt the same time Mr. Trump's big criminal trials are appearing increasingly less likely to produce verdicts prior to the 2024 presidential election. Less-than-speedy judicial decisions have pushed back federal proceedings charging him with trying to overturn the 2020 vote and illegally retaining classified documents. In Georgia, charges that the prosecutor hired a romantic partner have muddied prospects for that state's sweeping election interference case.\n\nHeadline-grabbing criminal cases against the former U.S. president are getting delayed or are running into snags. But high-dollar civil judgments seem likely to have a real impact on his personal finances.\n\nThe bottom line is that Mr. Trump's legal strategy of attempting to drag out cases to lessen any political impact on November's election could be working.\n\n\"He has been remarkably successful thus far at delaying his criminal trials,\" says Daniel Urman, a professor of law and public policy at Northeastern University.\n\nFor Mr. Trump, the potential outcome of the civil cases has always seemed less dire than the possible consequences of the criminal proceedings. Civil cases don't result in jail sentences. Instead, they typically produce monetary judgments.\n\nBut the size of the award against the former president in the Carroll defamation case, along with what may be an even larger judgment in the New York state fraud case, could pinch the finances and cash flow of even a wealthy real estate magnate.\n\nLate last month, a federal jury awarded Ms. Carroll more than $83 million in damages for defamation after she accused Mr. Trump of sexually assaulting her decades ago in a department store dressing room. He had denied the charge, and attacked the writer in bitter, personal terms.\n\nThis sum is stacked onto $5 million Ms. Carroll won from Mr. Trump last year in a related legal proceeding.\n\nWhile these judgments will almost certainly be appealed, Mr. Trump under New York law will have to either produce the entire sum to be held in trust while the appeal proceeds or post a bond equal to the amount.\n\nMeanwhile New York state Attorney General Letitia James is asking for a $370 million judgment against Mr. Trump and co-defendants for exaggerating his firm's wealth to lenders. Judge Engoron has already ruled the defendants are guilty in this case. He is planning on issuing a ruling on the size of penalties by mid-February.\n\n\"That's the working timeline,\" said Alfred Baker , a spokesperson for New York's Office of Court Administration, last week.\n\nA total of half a billion dollars in civil judgments would not bankrupt the billionaire Mr. Trump. But it could drain his ready cash and force the sale or mortgaging of real estate assets.\n\n\"I believe we have substantially in excess of $400 million in cash, which is a lot for a developer,\" said Mr. Trump in a deposition last year for the Carroll case.\n\nMr. Trump's presence at the civil cases this year greatly increased media coverage and public awareness of the proceedings. His use of the courtroom as a quasi-stage to express discontent perhaps presaged the approach he may use if his criminal cases come to trial.\n\nIn the Carroll courtroom, Mr. Trump glowered, whispered loudly to his attorneys, and finally stalked out entirely during the summation by Ms. Carroll's attorney Roberta Kaplan.\n\nHis behavior was \"his way of sending a message to the jury and creating a circus,\" tweeted former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti on Jan. 26.\n\nIf so, it apparently did not work, as the jury returned its verdict of an $83 million judgement within a few hours.\n\nMr. Trump's evident desire to stretch out his criminal trials as long as possible has been more successful.\n\n\"He has absolutely used the opportunities available to him to the fullest in that way,\" says Professor Urman.\n\nTrump critics have hoped these trials might deliver a final blow to the former president's Oval Office hopes. That remains possible, but it now seems at least as likely that the most important of these cases will not wrap up before November.\n\nIf they do not, and Mr. Trump triumphs, upon his inauguration he is almost certain to order the Justice Department to drop the cases brought by special counsel Jack Smith - the federal election interference case and the prosecution for hiding classified documents at Mar-a-Lago after leaving office.\n\nPerhaps the most important current source of delay is the question of presidential immunity that Mr. Trump's lawyers have raised in regard to the election case.\n\nThey argue that Mr. Trump, as a former president, is immune from criminal prosecution for acts taken while in office if he is not first impeached and convicted by the Senate for those acts.\n\nThe case, under Judge Tanya Chutkan, has been paused for 50 days while this question is litigated. It is currently under consideration by a panel of the DC Court of Appeals and will almost certainly end up in the Supreme Court.\n\nOriginally, the trial in the election case was scheduled to begin on March 4. That date has now dropped off the public calendar of the federal court in Washington. It is unclear when the case might resume.\n\nThe federal classified documents case has similarly slowed following a relatively brisk beginning. Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointment to the federal bench, has run pretrial proceedings at a relatively leisurely pace. And any case in which litigation revolves around classified information is complicated, involving lengthy discussions among defense, prosecution, and judge as to what secrets can be used at trial, and how they should be handled.\n\nThe documents case is still scheduled to begin on May 20, but many legal experts doubt that deadline will be met.\n\nMeanwhile, whether the Georgia election case will proceed on schedule is now up in the air, as a state judge weighs whether prosecutor Fani Willis should be removed from the case following reports of her romantic relationship with a subordinate.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

That involves a novel interpretation of state law that prosecutors have used to charge the case as a felony.\n\n\"Trump prosecutions are no longer on pace to finish before the election, with the least important New York case now most likely to move in time,\" wrote Michigan State University political scientist Matt Grossmann on X, formerly Twitter, last week.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Attorney Alina Habba called the verdict \"manifest injustice\" and \"the culmination of a multi-year, politically fueled witch hunt.\" She and Trump lawyer Christopher Kise said the verdict, if upheld, would damage the business environment.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron issued his decision after a 21⁄2-month trial that saw the Republican presidential front-runner bristling under oath that he was the victim of a rigged legal system.\n\nJudge Engoron concluded that Mr. Trump and his co-defendants \"failed to accept responsibility\" for their actions and that expert witnesses who testified for the defense \"simply denied reality.\"\n\nThe judge called the civil fraud at the heart of the trial a \"venial sin, not a mortal sin.\"\n\n\"They did not rob a bank at gunpoint. Donald Trump is not Bernard Madoff. Yet, defendants are incapable of admitting the error of their ways,\" wrote Mr. Engoron, a Democrat. He said their \"complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological.\"\n\nThe stiff penalty was a victory for New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, who sued Mr. Trump over what she said was not just harmless bragging but years of deceptive practices as he built the multinational collection of skyscrapers, golf courses, and other properties that catapulted him to wealth, fame, and the White House.\n\nMr. Trump's lawyers had said even before the verdict that they would appeal.\n\nMs. James sued Trump in 2022 under a state law that authorizes her to investigate persistent fraud in business dealings.\n\nThe suit accused Mr. Trump and his co-defendants of routinely puffing up his financial statements to create an illusion his properties were more valuable than they really were. State lawyers said Mr. Trump exaggerated his wealth by as much as $3.6 billion one year.\n\nBy making himself seem richer, Mr. Trump qualified for better loan terms, saved on interest, and was able to complete projects he might otherwise not have finished, state lawyers said.\n\nEven before the trial began, Mr. Engoron ruled that Ms. James had proven Mr. Trump's financial statements were fraudulent. The judge ordered some of Mr. Trump's companies removed from his control and dissolved. An appeals court put that decision on hold.\n\nIn that earlier ruling, the judge found that, among other tricks, Mr. Trump's financial statements had wrongly claimed his Trump Tower penthouse was nearly three times its actual size and overvalued his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, based on the idea that the property could be developed for residential use, even though he had surrendered rights to develop it for any uses but a club.\n\nMr. Trump, one of 40 witnesses to testify at the trial, said his financial statements actually understated his net worth and that banks did their own research and were happy with his business.\n\n\"There was no victim. There was no anything,\" Mr. Trump testified in November.\n\nDuring the trial, Mr. Trump called the judge \"extremely hostile\" and the attorney general \"a political hack.\" In a six-minute diatribe during closing arguments in January, Mr. Trump proclaimed \"I am an innocent man\" and called the case a \"fraud on me.\"\n\nMr. Trump and his lawyers have said the outside accountants that helped prepare the statements should've flagged any discrepancies and that the documents came with disclaimers that shielded him from liability. They also argued that some of the allegations were barred by the statute of limitations.\n\nThe suit is one of many legal challenges facing Mr. Trump as he campaigns for a return to the White House. He has been indicted four times in the last year - accused in Georgia and Washington, D.C., of plotting to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden, in Florida of hoarding classified documents, and in Manhattan of falsifying business records related to hush money paid to porn actor Stormy Daniels on his behalf.\n\nOn Feb. 15, a judge confirmed Mr. Trump's hush-money trial will start on March 25 and a judge in Atlanta heard arguments on whether to remove Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from his Georgia election interference case because she had a personal relationship with a special prosecutor she hired.\n\nThose criminal accusations haven't appeared to undermine his march toward the Republican presidential nomination, but civil litigation has threatened him financially.\n\nOn Jan. 26, a jury ordered Mr. Trump to pay $83.3 million to writer E. Jean Carroll for defaming her after she accused him in 2019 of sexually assaulting her in a Manhattan department store in the 1990s. That's on top of the $5 million a jury awarded Ms. Carroll in a related trial last year.\n\nIn 2022, the Trump Organization was convicted of tax fraud and fined $1.6 million in an unrelated criminal case for helping executives dodge taxes on extravagant perks such as Manhattan apartments and luxury cars.\n\nMs. James had asked the judge to impose a penalty of at least $370 million.\n\nMr. Engoron decided the case because neither side sought a jury and state law doesn't allow for juries for this type of lawsuit.\n\nBecause it was civil, not criminal in nature, the case did not carry the potential of prison time.\n\nMs. James, who campaigned for office as a Trump critic and watchdog, started scrutinizing his business practices in March 2019 after his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen testified to Congress that Mr. Trump exaggerated his wealth on financial statements provided to Deutsche Bank while trying to obtain financing to buy the NFL's Buffalo Bills.\n\nMs. James' office previously sued Mr. Trump for misusing his own charitable foundation to further his political and business interests. Mr. Trump was ordered to pay $2 million to an array of charities as a fine and the charity, the Trump Foundation, was shut down.\n\nMr. Trump incorporated the Trump Organization in New York in 1981. He still owns it, but he put his assets into a revocable trust and gave up his positions as the company's director, president, and chairman when he became president, leaving management of the company to sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr.\n\nMr. Trump did not return to a stated leadership position upon leaving the White House in 2021, but his sons testified he's been involved in some decision making.\n\nMr. Engoron had already appointed a monitor, retired federal judge Barbara Jones, to keep an eye on the company.\n\nThis story was reported by The Associated Press.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

He got a reprieve Monday when an appeals court lowered the bond to $175 million. But other challenges await: His hush money trial now starts April 15.\n\nA five-member panel of appeals court judges allowed Mr. Trump to put up only $175 million to cover the nearly half-billion-dollar civil verdict. Mr. Trump's lawyers had argued that obtaining a bond big enough to cover the entire judgment, plus accrued interest, would have forced him to unload valuable real estate assets at fire-sale prices.\n\nThe appeals panel may have been comfortable with allowing the smaller bond due to those very assets. Mr. Trump's well-known buildings and golf courses are visible and valuable, and aren't going anywhere. They would be easy for New York Attorney General Letitia James to seize if the full judgment is upheld on appeal and the former president does not have the cash to pay the full amount.\n\n\"Trump is a real estate magnate, and that is a thing that makes him particularly easy to hold accountable,\" says Will Thomas, assistant professor of business law at the University of Michigan.\n\nMr. Trump now has 10 days to come up with the $175 million bond under Monday's appeals court ruling. That means he has postponed a possible financial crunch, in which the cash demands of this case collide with the $91 million sexual assault and defamation judgment against him and in favor of writer E. Jean Carroll. Together, the bond costs could possibly drain him and his company of most of its liquid assets.\n\nOn Monday, that bit of good news for Mr. Trump may have been counterbalanced by events in his criminal New York case on charges related to his alleged payment of hush money to a porn star. The presiding judge rejected Trump lawyers' arguments for delay due to a late delivery of documents related to the case from federal prosecutors, and reiterated that the trial will start April 15. It will be the first time in American history a former president has faced criminal charges in a courtroom.\n\nIn the New York civil trial, Judge Arthur Engoron found that Mr. Trump, his elder sons, and his business had knowingly falsified the values of some real estate assets to obtain lower interest rates. The $454 million judgment in the case was based on the money that prosecutors estimated the Trump Organization had saved via the falsehoods, and profits from two buildings sold during the period covered by the charges.\n\nUnder state law, Mr. Trump is required to post a bond equal to the judgment in order to stay collection of what he owes while he pursues an appeal. Monday's appellate order did not explain why judges reduced the amount necessary. But experts noted that they may simply have decided to split the $350 million difference between Judge Engoron's full judgment and the $100 million bond that Trump lawyers last week said was all the former president could afford.\n\nWhether the reduction presages anything about Mr. Trump's appeal prospects is unclear.\n\nJudge Engoron's determination that the Trump team grossly overstated the values of its holdings is likely to be affirmed by the appeals court, says Gregory Germain, director of the bankruptcy clinic at Syracuse University College of Law.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nHowever, there may be legitimate legal issues for review on appeal about how the trial judge determined damages in the case, says Professor Germain.\n\n\"So the [$175 million] amount probably doesn't tell us what Trump should have to pay,\" he says. \"Rather, it was an arbitrary figure set in an amount that Trump could likely afford, but more than Trump asked for, to make sure that he is afforded a fair opportunity to make his case on appeal.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

He scribbled notes on pieces of paper, threw some away, and then muttered quietly to his lawyers. He appeared to shake his head and then threw up his hands.\n\nIt was the third day of Mr. Trump's New York state civil trial this week on charges of fraudulently inflating the value of real estate assets, and he appeared to be getting restless. At the noon break, he spoke angrily to reporters about how unfair the judge and trial were. Then he left the courthouse, got on his jet, and flew back to his Florida residence, Mar-a-Lago.\n\nMr. Trump's departure was unsurprising. He does not have to attend the civil trial, and he had already sat through hours of testimony. Judge Arthur Engoron has already ruled against him and his businesses on the case's core fraud charge. The trial is now about six additional claims against Mr. Trump.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump's attendance at a civil court case this week hints at the high legal stakes - and at how he can employ trials as part of his presidential campaign.\n\nIt was his presence in the courtroom to begin with that may have been more remarkable - and indicative of the lawsuit's core challenge to Mr. Trump's identity as a successful businessperson. Mr. Trump's biggest legal problems remain criminal cases on allegations of election interference and illegal retention of classified documents. But he also faces a looming series of civil lawsuits such as the New York fraud trial, which could cost him hundreds of millions of dollars, threaten the stability of his business empire, and cast a harsh light on some of his personal behavior.\n\nIf nothing else, the civil trials add even more court dates to Mr. Trump's already crammed legal agenda. Mr. Trump and his companies face the daunting logistical challenge of organizing and paying for legal representation in serious cases for months, if not years, to come.\n\n\"This is like a hypothetical that a lot of law professors would reject. Imagine a person with this many pending legal actions,\" says Daniel Urman, a professor of law and public policy at Northeastern University in Boston.\n\nCivil court cases are different from criminal counterparts in a number of ways. The punishment for losing a civil suit is not a prison sentence, as can be the case with criminal prosecutions. It is generally a monetary payment or a court injunction against engaging in a particular activity. In civil suits, plaintiffs establish their claims by a preponderance of the evidence, instead of the \"guilt beyond a reasonable doubt\" standard of a criminal trial.\n\nThe New York trial that started Monday is a civil case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James that centers on charges that Trump businesses knowingly puffed up the estimated value of holdings such as Trump Tower to get favorable treatment from banks. Judge Engoron estimates that given the length of witness lists, it could last until just before Christmas.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Trump's lawyers asked an appeals court to halt proceedings in the New York trial while they fight a ruling in the case by Judge Engoron that could lead to the dissolving of some Trump companies and the loss of prized real estate assets.\n\nTwo further civil cases involving Mr. Trump are scheduled to go to trial in New York in January 2024. One is a battery and defamation suit against him from writer E. Jean Carroll, who won a $5 million judgment against Mr. Trump in May after he called her sexual assault allegations a \"complete con job.\"\n\nMs. Carroll's upcoming suit against the former president stems from remarks made during a different period of time. A judge has already ruled those remarks were also libelous. That means the only issue in January will be how much more money Mr. Trump will be required to pay.\n\nThen late in the month, a class-action lawsuit alleging that the former president and his children fraudulently convinced consumers to invest in get-rich-quick schemes is scheduled to begin in federal court. The suit charges that the Trumps received secret payments for promoting a number of business entities as legitimate opportunities when in reality they were scams that harmed unsophisticated investors.\n\nBeyond that, a number of individuals, including some Democratic members of Congress and police officers, have filed civil lawsuits against Mr. Trump for injuries and damage allegedly incurred during the Jan. 6 riot. Many of these have been combined into a single suit, Blassingame v. Trump , named for Capitol Police officer and plaintiff James Blassingame.\n\nA trial in Blassingame will likely not be scheduled until after the resolution of criminal cases against Mr. Trump for election interference filed by federal special counsel Jack Smith and Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis.\n\nCurrently the federal election case is scheduled to start on March 4, 2024. The sprawling Georgia case, with 18 defendants besides Mr. Trump, officially starts on Oct. 23 of this year with the trial of two Trump lawyers who have requested expedited proceedings. Mr. Trump himself will not be there. His Georgia trial has yet to be scheduled. But even in absentia, he and his central role in the alleged conspiracy to overturn Georgia's presidential vote may loom over the Atlanta courtroom.\n\nMr. Trump's 2 1/2-day attendance at his New York fraud trial may be a preview of how he deals with his criminal and important civil trials to come.\n\nIn court, the former president for the most part sat quietly, though he appeared agitated at times, particularly when prosecutors criticized Trump organization valuations of particular properties such as his Trump Tower triplex. Out of court, he spoke vehemently to reporters about what he claims is a political prosecution by a biased judge.\n\nOn Tuesday Mr. Trump received a sharp rebuke from the legal system for his sometimes incendiary social media language. After he posted a disparaging and untrue post on Truth Social about Judge Engoron's clerk, the judge ordered him to remove it and then forbade all parties in the proceedings from posting, emailing, or speaking publicly about any members of the judge's staff.\n\n\"Failure to abide by this ... will result in serious sanctions,\" said Judge Engoron in court, while Mr. Trump looked straight ahead.\n\nThis was a gag order, but a narrowly tailored one, said some experts.\n\n\"Engoron is striking a balance - ordering Trump not to attack court personnel but allowing him to speak [about Attorney General Merrick Garland] & judge himself,\" wrote Brookings Institution senior fellow Norm Eisen on X, the site formerly known as Twitter.\n\nMr. Trump's appearance in New York may have reflected the way the charges call into question his carefully developed image as a successful businessperson and real estate billionaire. In addition, the penalties of the trial could be enormously expensive, with a possible fine of up to $250 million, and destructive to his existing organization. Judge Engoron has already ordered the cancellation of legal certificates that have allowed Mr. Trump and his family to do business in the state and asked for the appointment of a receiver to oversee the dissolution of some Trump entities. The upshot is that the former president could lose control over highly visible New York assets, including Trump Tower.\n\nOutside the courtroom, Mr. Trump has angrily insisted that Judge Engoron was grossly undervaluing his Mar-a-Lago property by listing it as worth some $18 million, for instance. Given its association with the Trump brand and its quality, it is in fact worth over $1 billion, the former president said, calling it \"arguably the most valuable residential property in the country.\"\n\nThe January civil trial on Mr. Trump's alleged participation in get-rich-quick schemes may draw similar ire, given its subject. Both it and the New York fraud trial portray the former president as a cheat - not the shrewd mogul he portrayed on \"The Apprentice.\"\n\nBut Mr. Trump's appearance at the beginning of his New York trial undeniably drew substantial media attention, with live telecasts and continual updates on print media websites. That may be another aspect of Mr. Trump's thinking - if trials take you off the campaign trail, bring the campaign trail to you.\n\nDuring his break-session press conferences, Mr. Trump continued to insist to large groups of reporters that his legal predicament is one large witch hunt, all related to the witch hunts of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation and his two House of Representatives impeachments.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

His federal election interference case is on hold while the Supreme Court weighs his claim that presidents are immune from such prosecution. His Florida classified documents case has unfolded slowly since charges were filed last June. His Georgia state election trial hasn't been scheduled, as prosecutor Fani Willis faced questions over her relationship with a subordinate.\n\nOn Friday, the last criminal case that was proceeding on schedule derailed, as Mr. Trump's New York hush money trial was delayed at least a month. The culprit was a last-minute evidence dump from federal prosecutors who had previously looked at charging the former president.\n\nMonths ago, it looked like criminal lawsuits would feature prominently in Donald Trump's 2024 calendar. Instead, key cases have been delayed, while a civil fraud verdict weighs heavily on the presidential candidate.\n\nBut in civil cases, Mr. Trump has lately faced legal setbacks and embarrassment involving a core aspect of his identity: his wealth.\n\nThat became clear on Monday when Mr. Trump's lawyers said he was unable to secure a multimillion-dollar bond to cover the judgment against him in his New York state civil fraud case.\n\nIn a court filing, Trump attorneys said they had been turned down by 30 companies in their efforts to secure a bond they estimated would have to be at least $454 million. Obtaining financial backing of that magnitude \"is not possible under the circumstances presented,\" the filing said.\n\n\"Trump has been incredibly lucky with regard to his criminal trials, but his civil trials in New York could get him in a lot of trouble, with him needing to liquidate many of his assets,\" says Daniel Urman, a professor of law and public policy at Northeastern University, in an email response to questions.\n\nDelay has been a central pillar of Mr. Trump's defense against his criminal prosecutions. The closer trials are to November, the greater the chance judges might postpone them to avoid the appearance of influencing the 2024 presidential vote. If Mr. Trump again wins the presidency, he might order that the federal cases brought by special counsel Jack Smith be dropped by the Justice Department, or even pardon himself to avoid trial.\n\nAs matters stand, the only criminal case that seemed sure to wrap up prior to the election was the New York hush money case, which involves the money paid to porn actress Stormy Daniels to keep quiet about her allegations of an affair with Mr. Trump. Now even that is up in the air following last week's postponement.\n\nBut his civil trials - which typically result only in monetary judgments, not jail time - currently threaten to cost Mr. Trump unexpectedly large amounts of cash.\n\nWriter E. Jean Carroll's sexual assault and defamation suits against Mr. Trump have so far resulted in a stinging $88.3 million judgment. This figure could be reduced on appeal. It might also go up. Mr. Trump has continued to publicly deny the charges and insult Ms. Carroll, which he had been warned by the judge not to do, leaving him open to further legal proceedings.\n\nThe New York state civil fraud case, in which Judge Arthur Engoron ruled that Mr. Trump, his sons, and business associates illegally inflated the value of properties to obtain better terms on loans, added hundreds of millions of dollars more in penalties.\n\nIf the former president wants to stay the judgment while he appeals, he has to post with the court either the cash owed, or a bond to cover the amount plus interest, estimated at $454 million. If he does not, New York Attorney General Letitia James may begin seizing Trump assets to make sure the penalty gets paid.\n\nThe deadline is March 25. Mr. Trump has offered a bond of $100 million. The court may accept that, or delay proceedings.\n\n\"There's some reasons for the court to give him a stay pending appeal without posting a full bond. We'll see whether they do that or not,\" says Gregory Germain, director of the bankruptcy clinic at Syracuse University College of Law.\n\nBut the former president's difficulties in obtaining a bond suggest that he is less wealthy than he has publicly proclaimed, or that large financial institutions are wary of lending him money.\n\n\"He's not a good credit risk, I think, in a lot of ways,\" says Professor Germain.\n\nLike many real estate investors, Mr. Trump has much of his money tied up in buildings or land. But financial institutions won't accept such Trump assets as collateral for a bond, his lawyers wrote on Monday. They want either cash or other assets more readily converted to cash, such as securities.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nMr. Trump's lawyers also argued that he should not be forced to divest himself of buildings in order to raise money for the bond.\n\nObtaining cash \"through a 'fire sale' of real estate holdings would inevitably result in massive, irrecoverable losses - textbook irreparable injury,\" they wrote.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Speaking publicly about a legal case is unusual and risky, according to legal experts.\n\nLoading...\n\nJune 21, 2023, 12:14 p.m. ET | Washington\n\nCriminal defendants are routinely advised to avoid commenting on pending charges against them. But Donald Trump, the former president and current White House hopeful, is no ordinary defendant.\n\nIn his first televised interview since his arraignment last week on federal charges, the former president acknowledged that he delayed turning over boxes of documents despite being asked to do so, drew factually incorrect parallels between his case and classified document probes concerning other politicians, and claimed he didn't actually have a Pentagon attack plan that the indictment says he boasted about to others.\n\nThose comments - like any remarks made by a defendant about an ongoing case - could complicate his lawyers' work, potentially precluding defenses they might have otherwise wanted to make or alternately boxing them into certain arguments so as to remain consistent with their clients' claims. The interview could give the Justice Department compelling, and admissible, insight into Mr. Trump's state of mind as the case moves forward, allowing prosecutors to preemptively attack defenses he might intend to invoke.\n\n\"If my client went on TV and said everything that he said, I might have fainted,\" said Jeffrey Jacobovitz, a Washington criminal defense lawyer.\n\nThe interview with Fox News aired just hours after a federal magistrate judge granted a Justice Department request for a protective order in the case that would prevent the public disclosure of evidence provided to the Trump team through the information-sharing process known as discovery, though nothing said in the interview would seem to have run afoul of that directive.\n\nIt's part of a long-running pattern by Mr. Trump, who is also seeking the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, of commenting openly about legal matters. Sometimes those comments have been to his own detriment, including last month when E. Jean Carroll, the advice columnist who won a $5 million sexual abuse and defamation award against Mr. Trump, sought at least $10 million more over remarks he made after the verdict.\n\nThe stakes are even higher in a criminal case.\n\n\"You typically say to your clients, 'Don't make any statements. Direct people to me,'\" said Richard Serafini, a former Justice Department official and Florida defense lawyer. \"Just politely decline to make any comment about the case and let your attorney do any commenting for you.\"\n\nA Trump campaign spokesperson did not immediately respond to a question seeking comment about the Fox interview.\n\nThe indictment filed by Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith charges Mr. Trump with illegally retaining classified documents at Mar-a-Lago and obstructing government efforts to recover them, including by asking an aide to relocate boxes before a visit by investigators and suggesting that his lawyer hide or destroy documents demanded by a grand jury subpoena.\n\nIn the interview Monday night, Mr. Trump repeatedly denied wrongdoing.\n\nBut in so doing, he seemed to undercut potential future arguments from his lawyers that he was not intimately involved in the handling of the boxes, or that he had moved quickly to cooperate with demands to give the records back. He asserted incorrectly that he was entitled under the Presidential Records Act to retain the documents that he took with him from the White House and acknowledged that he delayed giving the boxes over because he wanted to first remove personal belongings that investigators say were commingled with the files - something he suggested he had been too busy to do.\n\nAsked about an allegation in the indictment that he told his lawyer to tell the Justice Department that a subpoena for records had been fully complied with, he said, \"Before I send boxes over, I have to take all of my things out. These boxes were interspersed with all sorts of things: golf shirts, clothing, pants, shoes. There were many things.\"\n\n\"He's essentially admitting that he knew the documents were there,\" Mr. Jacobovitz said. \"That's inconsistent with saying, 'It was planted there.'\"\n\nOne of Mr. Trump's GOP rivals, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, said the procrastination excuse, in his mind, served as proof of obstruction of justice, given that Mr. Trump is alleged to have caused his lawyers to certify to the Justice Department, incorrectly, that the requested classified materials had been returned.\n\n\"It appears to me last night, as a former prosecutor, that he admitted obstruction of justice on the air last night,\" Mr. Christie said. \"I can tell you this: His lawyers this morning are jumping out of whatever window they're near.\"\n\nIn addition, Mr. Trump denied the Justice Department's characterization of a core allegation in the indictment - that during a 2021 meeting at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, he showed off a Pentagon \"plan of attack\" and told others that it was \"secret\" information that he could no longer declassify because he wasn't president anymore. But Mr. Trump, in the interview, denied that he was holding a specific document.\n\n\"There was no document. That was a massive amount of papers and everything else, talking about Iran and other things,\" Mr. Trump told Fox News host Bret Baier. \"And it may have been held up or may not, but that was not a document. I didn't have a document, per se. There was nothing to declassify. These were newspaper stories, magazine stories, and articles.\"\n\nThe episode detailed in the indictment is based on an audio recording obtained by prosecutors, who could also presumably call as witnesses people who were present for the Bedminster encounter to testify about the document that's alleged to have been shown off.\n\nBut as is always the case with Mr. Trump, the court of public opinion matters, too. Well-practiced in legal delay tactics, Mr. Trump could hope to drag out the proceeding so long that a trial does not conclude until after the election.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

      "text": "E. Jean Carroll lawyer suggests third Trump defamation lawsuit possible after new comments\n\nDonald Trump on Monday once again denied allegations by E. Jean Carroll that he raped and defamed her, despite facing nearly $90 million in civil penalties for making similar statements about the writer.\n\nCarroll's attorney quickly responded that the writer's legal team is closely monitoring Trump's latest remarks about her - and suggested that a third defamation lawsuit could be in store for the former president .\n\nTrump in an interview on CNBC's \" Squawk Box \" said that several civil court judgments against him in New York - two of them in Carroll's favor - will cause companies to leave the state.\n\n\"People aren't moving into New York, because of the kind of crap they're pulling on me,\" he said.\n\nThey're \"the most ridiculous decisions,\" Trump said, \"including the 'Ms. Bergdorf Goodman,' a person I'd never met.\"\n\nCarroll has said Trump raped her in a dressing room in the Bergdorf Goodman department store in Manhattan in the mid-1990s.\n\n\"I have no idea who she is, except one thing, I got sued,\" he said in Monday's interview. \"From that point on I said, 'Wow, that's crazy, what this is.'\"\n\n\"I got charged, I was given a false accusation and had to post a $91 million bond on a false accusation,\" Trump added, referring to the bond he secured in recent days to guarantee the most recent judgment in Carroll's favor in Manhattan federal court.\n\nThe interview echoed remarks Trump made about Carroll over the weekend at a campaign rally in Georgia, where the presumptive Republican presidential nominee accused her of making \"false accusations.\"\n\nAfter the CNBC interview aired, Carroll's lawyer Roberta Kaplan in a statement said, \"The statute of limitations for defamation in most jurisdictions is between one and three years.\"\n\n\"As we said after the last jury verdict, we continue to monitor every statement that Donald Trump makes about our client, E. Jean Carroll,\" Kaplan said.\n\nGeorge Conway, an attorney and leading Trump critic who encouraged Carroll to file her first defamation suit against him, in a tweet Monday said that the former president had opened himself up to a third lawsuit from the writer.\n\n\"The fact that Trump libeled @ejeancarroll on @CNBC @SquawkCNBC is highly significant for a procedural reason in addition to a substantive one,\" Conway wrote in his post on the social media site X.\n\nBecause Trump's remarks were made on the CNBC show, which is broadcast from Manhattan, Carroll \"likely may now sue\" in the same federal court where she filed her first two lawsuits against him, Conway wrote in his post on the social media site X.\n\n\"If she does that, the case would be assigned to Judge Lewis A. Kaplan as a case related to the earlier two cases that produced $88.3 million in damages awards,\" Conway wrote. The judge is not related to Carroll's lawyer.\n\nCarroll in a 2019 magazine article first publicly accused Trump of raping her.\n\nShe then sued him in Manhattan federal court alleging defamation after the then-president denied the rape claim, and accused her of making up her account because of political animus and a desire to boost sales of her book.\n\nCarroll sued Trump in the same court again in late 2022, for battery related to the alleged rape, and for defamation related to new comments he had made about her.\n\nTrump, who had left the White House by then, in those October 2022 comments also referred to Carroll as \"Ms. Bergdorf Goodman.\"\n\nA jury last May in the second case awarded Carroll $5 million in damages after finding Trump liable for sexual abusing and defaming her.\n\nIn January, another jury ordered Trump to pay $83.3 million for defaming Carroll in the statements he made about her rape claim when he was president.\n\nTrump is appealing the verdicts in both cases.\n\nHe has posted bonds and cash totaling $97.2 million to secure the judgments in Carroll's favor as he appeals them. The money and bond he put up would be returned if he wins his appeals.\n\nTrump separately faces a judgment of $454 million in total damages and interest after losing a lawsuit by the New York Attorney General's Office accusing him of civil business fraud.\n\nDon't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Trump loses appeal of E. Jean Carroll $5 million defamation verdict\n\nA federal appeals court on Monday upheld a $5-million verdict that E. Jean Carroll won against Donald Trump when a jury found the U.S. president-elect liable for sexually abusing and later defaming the former magazine columnist.\n\nA unanimous three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan rejected Trump's argument that the trial judge should not have let jurors hear evidence about the Republican's alleged past sexual misconduct, making the trial and verdict unfair.\n\nThe court said that evidence, including Trump bragging about his sexual prowess on an \"Access Hollywood\" video that surfaced during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, established a \"repeated, idiosyncratic pattern of conduct\" consistent with Carroll's allegations.\n\n\"Taking the record as a whole and considering the strength of Ms. Carroll's case, we are not persuaded that any claimed error or combination of errors in the district court's evidentiary rulings affected Mr. Trump's substantial rights,\" the court said in an unsigned decision.\n\nThe May 2023 verdict stemmed from an incident around 1996 in a Bergdorf Goodman department store dressing room in Manhattan, where Carroll, now 81, said Trump raped her, and an October 2022 Truth Social post where Trump denied Carroll's claim as a hoax.\n\nThough jurors in federal court in Manhattan did not find that Trump, 78, committed rape, they awarded the former Elle magazine advice columnist $2.02 million for sexual assault and $2.98 million for defamation.\n\nA different jury ordered Trump in January to pay Carroll $83.3 million for defaming her and damaging her reputation in June 2019, when he first denied her rape claim.\n\nIn both denials, Trump said he did not know Carroll, she was \"not my type,\" and that she fabricated the rape claim to promote her memoir.\n\nSteven Cheung, a Trump spokesperson, said in a statement that Americans \"demand an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and a swift dismissal of all of the Witch Hunts, including the Democrat-funded Carroll Hoax, which will continue to be appealed.\"\n\nIt was not clear if any appeal would go to the U.S. Supreme Court. Trump tapped Cheung last month to be his White House communications director.\n\nRoberta Kaplan, a lawyer for Carroll, said in a statement: \"E. Jean Carroll and I are gratified by today's decision.\"\n\nCarroll's cases are continuing despite Trump's having won a second four-year White House term.\n\nIn 1997, in a case involving former President Bill Clinton, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously that sitting presidents have no immunity from civil litigation in federal court over actions predating and unrelated to their official duties as president.\n\nTrump argued the $5-million verdict should be thrown out because the trial judge, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who is not related to Roberta Kaplan, should not have let jurors hear testimony from two other women who accused him of sexual misconduct.\n\nOne, businesswoman Jessica Leeds, said Trump groped her on a plane in the late 1970s. The other, former People magazine writer Natasha Stoynoff, said Trump forcibly kissed her at his Mar-a-Lago estate in 2005.\n\nTrump's lawyers also said the trial judge should not have let jurors watch the 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" video, where Trump boasted graphically about forcing himself on women.\n\nBut the appeals court said that in each of these encounters, \"Mr. Trump engaged in an ordinary conversation with a woman he barely knew, then abruptly lunged at her in a semi-public place and proceeded to kiss and forcefully touch her without her consent.\"\n\nIt said this was \"relevant to show a pattern tending to directly corroborate witness testimony and to confirm that the alleged sexual assault (of Carroll) actually occurred.\"\n\nThe court also rejected Trump's claim that Kaplan should have allowed evidence that a prominent Democratic critic, billionaire LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, funded Carroll's case, saying it had \"little probative value.\" Carroll is also a Democrat.\n\nJudge Kaplan also oversaw the trial that ended with the $83.3 million verdict.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "E. Jean Carroll lawyer says Trump claims of judge conflict no basis to toss $83.3 million verdict\n\nE. Jean Carroll 's lawyer on Tuesday rebutted a claim that she was mentored by the judge who oversaw the rape defamation trial of Donald Trump , and said there is \"no basis' to toss the recent $83.3 million verdict against the former president in Carroll's favor.\n\nCarroll's lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, blasted Trump's attorney Alina Habba for raising \"false allegations of a mentor-mentee relationship\" between Kaplan and U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan when they both worked at the prestigious and large New York law firm Paul, Weiss three decades ago.\n\nThe Kaplans are not related.\n\nRoberta Kaplan, in a letter to the judge, noted that \"the length of our overlap at Paul, Weiss was less than two years,\" and that she does not remember ever interacting with Judge Kaplan during that time, when she was a junior litigation associate and he was a senior litigation partner.\n\nRoberta Kaplan joined the firm in October 1992 and Lewis Kaplan left Paul, Weiss in August 1994 upon his confirmation as judge.\n\nRoberta Kaplan also told the judge in a letter that she reserved the right to \"seek sanctions\" against Habba for making \"false and vexatious claims.\"\n\nHabba replied to the letter later Tuesday, denying she made any false claims, noting that she had merely asked if there was such a mentor relationship with the judge.\n\n\"Since Ms. Kaplan has now denied that there was ever a mentor-mentee relationship between herself and Your Honor, this issue has seemingly been resolved,\" Habba wrote the judge.\n\nBut in a footnote to that sentence, Habba added: \"There are, however, various other issues relating to the Court's conduct, including potential bias hostility towards defense counsel, that will be raised in post-trial motions and on appeal.\"\n\nHabba first noted the claims in a letter to the judge Monday, three days after a Manhattan federal court jury found that Trump should pay Carroll $83.3 million in damages for defaming her in 2019 when he denied her claim that he raped her in the mid-1990s.\n\nThat civil judgment came nearly eight months after another civil trial ended with a jury awarding Carroll $5 million in damages from Trump for defamatory statements he made about her in 2022. As in the second trial, Roberta Kaplan represented Carroll and Judge Kaplan presided over the case.\n\nHabba's letter suggested that if there was a previously undisclosed conflict or potential conflict between Carroll's lawyer and the judge, it \"could certainly prove relevant to President Trump's forthcoming Rule 59 motion\" to seek a new trial or to radically reduce the massive damages awarded.\n\nThe letter said that Habba learned for the first time this weekend, from a New York Post article, allegations that the judge \"had a 'mentor' type relationship with\" Roberta Kaplan.\n\nThat article contained a quote, purportedly from a former Paul, Weiss partner, saying \"Lew was like her mentor.\" The person quoted was unnamed.\n\n\"We believe, and will argue on appeal, that the Court was overtly hostile towards defense counsel and President Trump, and displayed preferential treatment towards Plaintiff's counsel,\" Habba wrote.\n\n\"Indeed, the rulings, tone, and demeanor of the bench raised significant concerns even before the New York Post's investigative journalism unearthed these new facts,\" she added.\n\nThe letter said that if Judge Kaplan \"truly worked with Ms. Kaplan in any capacity - especially if there was a mentor/mentee relationship - that fact should have been disclosed before any case involving these parties was permitted to proceed forward,\" Habba wrote.\n\nRoberta Kaplan, in her reply to the judge Tuesday, wrote, \"As Ms. Habba well knows, these allegations are utterly baseless.\"\n\n\"During that relatively brief period more than thirty years ago, I do remember the Paul, Weiss partners with whom I worked and none of them was Your Honor,\" Roberta Kaplan wrote.\n\n\"More specifically, I have no recollection from that time period of ever interacting with Your Honor on a case, participating with Your Honor in a client or case-related meeting, or attending a court proceeding with Your Honor. In fact, I remember no direct interaction from that time period with Your Honor at all,\" the letter from Carroll's attorney said.\n\nRoberta Kaplan added, \"Given the above, there was nothing for Your Honor to disclose.\"\n\nThe lawyer also noted that the fact that she and the judge had both worked at Paul, Weiss previously was a matter of public record before the trial.\n\n\"A jury of Donald Trump's peers has now twice found him liable for sexual assault, defamation and $88 million in compensatory and punitive damages,\" Roberta Kaplan wrote.\n\n\"There is no basis to set either verdict aside.\"\n\nTrump, who is the leading contender for the Republican presidential nomination, is appealing the verdict in the first trial, and plans to appeal the verdict of the second trial.\n\nDon't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Trump says 'I would love it' when judge threatens to kick him out of E. Jean Carroll trial\n\nUpdate: Jury rules Trump must pay E. Jean Carroll $83.3 million in damages for defamation\n\nA New York federal judge on Wednesday threatened to kick Donald Trump out of court for making \"disruptive\" comments at the former president's trial on sex assault defamation claims by E. Jean Carroll .\n\nTrump fired back at the judge and the threat, saying, \"I would love it.\"\n\nJudge Lewis Kaplan's warning to Trump came after Carroll's lawyer complained that he had continued making comments audible to jurors - including, \"This really is a con job\" - as Carroll testified for the first time in Trump's presence.\n\nKaplan earlier had cautioned Trump to \"keep his voice down.\"\n\n\"Mr. Trump has the right to be present here. That right can be forfeited, and it can be forfeited if he is disruptive, and if he disregards court orders,\" Kaplan said after the seven-man, two-woman jury was excused for lunch at the U.S. District Court in Manhattan.\n\n\"Mr. Trump, I hope I don't have to consider excluding you from the trial. I understand you are very eager for me to do that,\" the judge said.\n\nTrump raised his hands in the air and shook them in response.\n\n\"I would love it, I would love it,\" Trump said.\n\nKaplan then said, \"I know you would because you just can't control yourself in this circumstance.\"\n\nTrump later blasted Kaplan in a post on his Truth Social site.\n\n\"I feel an obligation to be at every moment of this ridiculous trial because we have a seething and hostile Clinton-appointed Judge, Lewis Kaplan, who suffers from a major case of Trump Derangement Syndrome,\" Trump wrote.\n\nThe judge began the trial's second day hours earlier by snapping at Trump's lawyer, Alina Habba, when she repeated her call to postpone the trial so that Trump could attend his mother-in-law's funeral.\n\n\"I said sit down!\" Kaplan told Habba.\n\nHabba replied, \"I don't like to be spoken [to] like that ... I will not speak to you like that.\"\n\nKaplan shot back, \"It is denied. Sit down.\"\n\nTrump grumbled, \"Nasty guy,\" after the tense exchange.\n\nTrump's ire continued when Carroll began testifying about the reputational and emotional harm she suffered from the defamatory statements he made as president in 2019, and afterward, when he denied her claim that he sexually assaulted her in a New York City department store in the mid-1990s.\n\n\"To have the President of the United States, one of the most powerful persons on earth, call me a liar for three days and say it 26 times - I counted them - it ended the world I had been living in and I lived in a new world,\" Carroll testified.\n\nTrump, 77, slammed the defense table at one point, shook his head in anger and disbelief, and made comments that were audible in the courtroom when Carroll answered questions from her lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, who is not related to the judge.\n\nAfter the mid-morning recess in the proceedings, Carroll's other attorney, Shawn Crowley, told Judge Kaplan that Trump had been sitting at the defense table and loudly saying things including, \" Carroll's statements are false,\" and \"now she seems to have gotten her memory back.\"\n\nThe judge admonished Trump after the recess.\n\n\"Before we bring in the jury, I'm just going to ask Mr. Trump to take special care to keep his voice down so the jury does not overhear it,\" Kaplan told him.\n\nIn her testimony, Carroll said, \"I am here because Donald Trump assaulted me and when I wrote about it, he lied and he shattered my reputation.\"\n\n\"He lied last month, on Sunday, yesterday and I want my reputation back,\" the former Elle magazine advice columnist said.\n\n\"I am 80 and I spent 50 years building my reputation. My column was very popular,\" Carroll testified. \"Yesterday, I opened up Twitter and it said, 'Hey lady, you're a fraud.'\"\n\nTrump had claimed he never met Carroll, which was not true, that she had made up her allegation of rape to sell a book she was writing and that she was \"not my type.\"\n\n\"I'm not his type means I'm too ugly to assault,\" Carroll said.\n\nShe testified that ever since Trump denied her allegations, the messages from his supporters to her \"have never stopped.\"\n\n\"I receive them all the time, sometimes hundreds a day,\" Carroll said. \"The common theme is, 'You're a liar, you hurt victims, you are ugly.' \"\n\nShe also said she had kept a gun because of her fear about death threats she has received for making her allegation about Trump.\n\nThis trial is the second trial to be held in connection with Carroll's allegation and Trump's defamation of the writer.\n\nLast year, a Manhattan federal court jury ordered Trump to pay Carroll $5 million after finding that he was civilly liable for sexually abusing her in the attack at the Bergdorf Goodman store in the 1990s, and for defaming her in statements he made about her in late 2022.\n\nThe jury did not find that Trump had raped Carroll, as she had alleged in a lawsuit. But that finding hinged on the fact that Carroll could not say whether he had penetrated her in the store's dressing room with his penis or a finger.\n\nUnder New York state law, rape involves penetration by a penis. But Kaplan has noted in subsequent court orders Carroll's use of the term rape is consistent with how the public often defines it, and with how other states' penal codes define it.\n\nTrump, who did not attend that trial, is appealing the verdict in that case.\n\nThe current trial is solely dealing with the monetary damages Trump must pay Carroll for defamatory statements he made about her in 2019 while president, and at different times later when he denied her allegations.\n\nKaplan previously ruled that because of the first jury's verdict, there was no longer a legal question that Trump had defamed Carroll.\n\nCarroll's lawyers are asking for at least $10 million in damages in this case.\n\nHabba last week unsuccessfully asked Kaplan to postpone the trial so that Trump could attend the funeral of his wife Melania Trump's mother, Amalija Knavs, in Florida on Thursday without having to miss being at the trial that day.\n\nTrump at a campaign event earlier this week condemned Kaplan for refusing to postpone the trial, calling him and other judges in cases involving him \"animals.\"\n\nWhen the trial began Tuesday with jury selection, Habba complained about Kaplan's refusal to delay the case until after the funeral.\n\nShe resurrected the complaint on Wednesday morning, with Trump sitting close to her.\n\n\"My client and I would like to reiterate that she [Carroll] can sit here every day and she did not have death in her family, and it is insanely prejudicial,\" Habba said.\n\n\"I am asking your honor to have the kindness to let my client be with his family and not miss trial,\" the lawyer said.\n\nKaplan again rejected the request and sharply told Habba to \"sit down\" when she persisted.\n\nTrump, who faces criminal indictments in four separate courts, is the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nOn Monday, Trump won by a landslide in the Iowa Republican caucuses. He hopes to drive out his remaining challengers, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley, with another big victory in the New Hampshire primary next week.

Jean Carroll , getting the attention of her lawyer.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social , the former president began with \"Happy Memorial Day to All\" and quickly derailed into a tirade against Manhattan federal court Judge Lewis Kaplan and Carroll's claims: \"TWO separate trials that awarded a woman, who I never met before (a quick handshake at a celebrity event, 25 years ago, doesn't count!), 91 MILLION DOLLARS for 'DEFAMATION.'\"\n\nKaplan presided over the case in which a jury in May 2023 found Trump liable for sexually abusing Carroll in a Manhattan department store in the 1990s.

Carroll was awarded $83.3 million in damages, which Trump is appealing .\n\nCarroll's lawyer Roberta Kaplan, who is not related to the judge, swiftly responded to Trump's post. \"We have said several times since the last jury verdict in January that all options were on the table. And that remains true today-all options are on the table,\" the lawyer said.\n\nThe Biden campaign also responded to Trump's post . \"Trump posts Memorial Day message with zero mention of fallen American service members, instead calling those who don't support him 'Human Scum,'\" the campaign posted on social media platform X.\n\nRoberta Kaplan on March 11 suggested that another defamation lawsuit could be in store after comments Trump made in an interview with CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\n\n\"The statute of limitations for defamation in most jurisdictions is between one and three years,\" Kaplan said in a statement after the Trump interview aired. \"As we said after the last jury verdict, we continue to monitor every statement that Donald Trump makes about our client, E.

      "text": "Appeals court rejects Trump's request to pause proceedings in E. Jean Carroll case\n\nA federal appeals court on Thursday denied former President Donald Trump 's request to halt proceedings in the upcoming E. Jean Carroll defamation trial .\n\nIn a court filing last week, Trump's attorneys asked the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to delay the case for 90 days while he considered appealing the court's previous rejection of his efforts to use presidential immunity as a defense.\n\nThe appeals court denied that request on Thursday, allowing the trial to begin Jan. 16.\n\nTrump's request for a pause in the proceedings came after the appeals court unanimously ruled that the former president had waited too long - three years - to raise his presidential immunity defense in the defamation trial.\n\nTrump had argued that he couldn't be sued for remarks he made in 2019 about Carroll and the claims of sexual assault against him because he was president at the time. He also contended that his comments were related to his official duties as president because he needed to speak publicly about the accusations being false.\n\nRead more on NBC News\n\nThe court noted that while Carroll filed her defamation suit in November 2019, followed by Trump's response in January 2020, he didn't bring up the presidential immunity defense until January 2023. Allowing him to use that defense now would cause \"undue prejudice\" to Carroll, the judges said in their ruling.\n\nThe upcoming trial is the second one involving Trump and Carroll, a magazine writer who alleged Trump raped her in the mid-1990s and defamed her after she spoke out publicly with her accusations in 2019. Trump has repeatedly denied the allegations. A jury this year found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation and awarded Carroll $5 million in damages, a verdict Trump is appealing.\n\nThe second trial centers on remarks Trump made about Carroll during his presidency and after the $5 million verdict, including his disparaging comments against her such as calling her a \"whack job.\" The trial, which is expected to last three to five days, only focuses on what money damages Carroll is entitled to.\n\nU.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in June denied Trump's immunity argument, writing that presidential immunity is \"not a 'get out of damages liability free' card.\"\n\nTrump has also raised the presidential immunity argument in the election interference case brought against him by special counsel Jack Smith. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan shot down his argument in that case, ruling this month that the former president was not immune to the criminal charges. Trump, who has pleaded not guilty in the case, appealed the ruling to the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. The Supreme Court last week denied Smith's request for the high court to immediately decide the matter.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "E. Jean Carroll rests case in civil trial after jurors see video of Trump confusing her with his ex-wife\n\nLawyers for E. Jean Carroll rested her civil case against Donald Trump on Thursday, shortly after jurors were shown a deposition video of the former president confusing the accuser with his ex-wife Marla Maples.\n\n\"It's Marla,\" Trump said during a deposition for the case when shown a picture of him, Carroll and Carroll's ex-husband in the 1980s.\n\n\"That's Marla, yeah. That's my wife,\" Trump continued before being corrected by his lawyer, Alina Habba. \"No, that's Carroll,\" Habba said. Trump then responded the photo was \"very blurry.\"\n\nThe end of Carroll's case potentially paves the way for the trial to move to closing arguments on Monday. Trump's lawyers said Wednesday that he will not testify and that they are not putting on any witnesses .\n\nTrump, however, told reporters on a golf course in Ireland on Thursday that he was \"going back to New York\" because of the case.\n\nAsked if he was going to the trial, he said, \"I'll probably attend,\" according to a Sky News video of his remarks. \"She's a fake,\" he said of Carroll. \"It's a disgrace.\"\n\nAsked if he had any comment on his client's remarks, Trump lawyer Joe Tacopina said, \"No.\"\n\nCarroll has sued Trump for battery and defamation, charging he raped her in the dressing room of a Manhattan department store in the 1990s and then falsely accused her of concocting a \"hoax\" after she went public with her claim in 2019.\n\nIn the excerpts played for the jury in Manhattan federal court, Trump maintained that despite the Maples mixup , Carroll was \"not my type.\" Later, he was asked if the three women he'd married were his type. \"Yeah,\" he answered.\n\nTrump also acknowledged that when Carroll went public with her claims in a book she'd written, the then-president accused her of trying to boost her sales with a made-up story for financial and political reasons - even though at that point he didn't know her political affiliation, her financial situation or her publisher.\n\nAsked what the basis for his allegations were, Trump answered, \"I don't know.\"\n\nRead more from NBC News:\n\nFour Proud Boys members found guilty of seditious conspiracy in Jan. 6 trial\n\nEx-wives, 'Access Hollywood' and a 'big fat hoax': Notable moments from Trump's deposition in the E.

Really sick. There is something wrong with her,\" Trump said.\n\nIn the deposition, Trump also mocked two other women who've accused him of sexual misconduct: Jessica Leeds , a retired stockbroker, and Natasha Stoynoff , a former People magazine reporter.\n\nBoth testified during the trial. Leeds claims Trump groped her on a plane flight to New York in the late 1970s, while Stoynoff says Trump accosted her when she went to interview him and his wife, Melania Trump, in 2005.\n\nTrump called Leeds' allegations \"ridiculous\" and Stoynoff's claims \"a phony charge.\"\n\nCarol Martin, a longtime friend of Carroll's who is one of two people Carroll said she told about the attack shortly after it happened, testified live before the jury Thursday.\n\nMartin said she had advised Carroll not to report the incident to the police. \"He has lots of attorneys,\" Martin said she told Carroll. \"He would bury her.\"\n\nMartin said she now regrets giving Carroll that advice: \"I'm not proud of that.\"\n\nAs for Carroll's claim itself, Martin said, \"I believed it then, and I believe it today.\"\n\nDr. Ashlee Humphreys, a sociology professor at Northwestern University, was one of the final witnesses in the case. Humphreys estimated it would cost up to $2.7 million for Carroll to try to repair the damage done to her reputation by Trump's statements.\n\nCarroll is also seeking unspecified money damages for battery as well as emotional harm and damage caused by the attack.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Trump may have defamed E. Jean Carroll again, one day after posting a $91.6 million bond for last case\n\nFormer President Donald Trump on Saturday stood by his 2019 statement that writer E. Jean Carroll made a \"totally false accusation\" against him, despite similar claims resulting in him losing a defamation case in January.\n\nCampaigning at a rally in Rome, Georgia, Trump referenced the $91.6 million bond he posted on March 8, three days before his deadline to pay $83.3 million in damages to Carroll for defaming her in statements he made as president after denying her accusation that he'd raped her in a department store dressing room in the 1990s.\n\nCarroll first came forward in 2019 with sexual assault claims against Trump before another civil trial in May 2023, where a New York jury found that the former president sexually abused Carroll but didn't rape her.\n\n\"I just posted a $91 million bond, $91 million on a fake story, totally made-up story,\" Trump said, adding that the judgment was, \"based on false accusations made about me by a woman that I knew nothing about, didn't know, never heard of, I know nothing about her.\"\n\nThe 77-year-old made similar remarks in a June 22, 2019, statement, MSNBC legal correspondent Lisa Rubin posted on X on Saturday, including a document of Trump's denial of knowing \"who this woman is.\"\n\n\"She wrote a book, she said things, and when I denied it, I said, 'It's so crazy, it's false,' I get sued for defamation,\" Trump said on Saturday before referring to New York's Adult Survivors Act , which lifted the state's statute of limitations for one year, allowing survivors of sexual assault to sue no matter how long ago the alleged abuse happened.\n\n\"They changed the law that allowed women to go back, like unlimited ... then she went back and she said, mid-90s maybe, I have no idea,\" he said.\n\nOn top of the $83.3 million in damages is a $5 million sexual abuse and defamation verdict that Carroll won against Trump last year. In February, the former president was also ordered to pay $464 million in damages for a separate fraud case against Trump and top executives at his company - he plans to appeal all three verdicts.\n\nTrump also shared his concerns about Lewis Kaplan, the federal judge who denied his request to delay the defamation judgment, calling him a \"Trump-deranged, angry man.\"\n\nBoth Carroll's legal team and the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Trump suffers big loss in E. Jean Carroll defamation case, judge says he's liable\n\nUpdate: Jury rules Trump must pay E. Jean Carroll $83.3 million in damages for defamation\n\nA federal judge on Wednesday ruled that Donald Trump is civilly liable for defamatory statements he made about writer E. Jean Carroll in 2019 when she went public with claims he had raped her decades earlier.\n\nJudge Lewis Kaplan, as part of that ruling, said the upcoming trial for Carroll's lawsuit against Trump will only deal with the question of how much the former president should pay her in monetary damages for defaming her.\n\nNormally, a jury would determine at trial whether a defendant is liable for civil damages claimed by a plaintiff.\n\nBut Kaplan found that Carroll was entitled to a partial summary judgment on the question of Trump's liability in the case.\n\nHe cited the fact that jurors at a trial in a separate but related lawsuit in May found that Trump sexually abused Carroll in a New York department store in the mid-1990s, and defamed her in statements he made when he denied her allegation last fall.\n\nCarroll's lawyers argued, and Kaplan agreed, that the jury's verdict in that case effectively settled the legal question of whether Trump had defamed her in similar comments he made about Carroll in 2019.\n\n\"The truth or falsity of Mr. Trump's 2019 statements therefore depends - like the truth or falsity of his 2022 statement - on whether Ms. Carroll lied about Mr. Trump sexually assaulting her,\" Kaplan wrote in his 25-page decision in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.\n\n\"The jury's finding that she did not therefore is binding in this case and precludes Mr. Trump from contesting the falsity of his 2019 statements,\" Kaplan wrote.\n\nThe ruling is the latest in a series of big losses for Trump in lawsuits filed by Carroll.\n\nAt the trial that ended in May, Trump was ordered to pay Carroll $5 million in damages for the comments he made after he was president. Trump is appealing the verdict and damages in that case.\n\nThe suit that was the subject of Kaplan's ruling Wednesday relates to statements about Carroll that Trump made when he was president as he denied her claim of rape.\n\nTrial in that case is set to begin Jan. 15, just as the Republican presidential nomination contest is set to heat up with primaries and caucuses. Trump is the front-runner in the contest for the 2024 GOP nomination.\n\nCarroll's lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, who is not related to the judge, in a statement, said, \"We look forward to trial limited to damages for the original defamatory statements Donald Trump made about our client E Jean Carroll in 2019.\"\n\nTrump's lawyer, Alina Habba, said, \"We remain very confident that the Carroll II verdict will be overturned on appeal which will render this decision moot.\"\n\n\"Carroll II\" is the shorthand name for Carroll's second lawsuit, which was the subject of the trial that ended in May.\n\nHabba said she believes that a federal appeals court in New York will block the upcoming trial in Carroll's first lawsuit from starting as scheduled \"as it considers the meritorious defenses that have been raised by President Trump.\"\n\nTrump is appealing Judge Kaplan's dismissal of his own claim that Carroll defamed the former president when she reiterated her claim that Trump had raped her. Trump's argument is based on the fact that jurors at the trial in May had not found that he raped Carroll, but had instead sexually abused her.\n\nJudge Kaplan, in an August ruling, brushed aside Trump's argument, saying that the jury's finding that Trump had \"deliberately and forcibly\" penetrated Carroll is consistent with the common use of the term rape, if not the technical definition under New York law.\n\nA month earlier, the Department of Justice dropped its nearly three-year-long effort to shield Trump from civil liability in the suit related to comments he made about Carroll as president. The DOJ had argued that Trump was acting within the scope of his office as president when he made the statements about Carroll.\n\nIn dropping that argument, the DOJ cited a decision by the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., which suggested Trump could be personally sued if his statements did not have the purpose of serving the U.S. government.\n\nThe department also noted that Trump's allegedly defamatory statements about Carroll continued after he left the White House in early 2021 and that those statements are included in an amended suit Carroll filed against him last month.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Trump counterclaim against E. Jean Carroll dismissed, DA can get deposition\n\nUpdate: Jury rules Trump must pay E. Jean Carroll $83.3 million in damages for defamation\n\nA federal judge on Monday dismissed a defamation counterclaim by Donald Trump against writer E. Jean Carroll in her pending lawsuit that accuses the former president of defaming her after she wrote that he had raped her.\n\nJudge Lewis Kaplan, in a separate order made public Monday, ruled that Carroll's lawyers can give the Manhattan District Attorney 's office a videotape and transcript of the deposition of Trump they took last fall for the lawsuit.\n\nThat order raises the chance that Trump's sworn testimony in Carroll's case could be used against the former president as part of the DA's pending criminal prosecution.\n\nDistrict Attorney Alvin Bragg Jr. charged Trump, 77, earlier this year with falsifying business records related to a 2016 hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels . That case, in which Trump has pleaded not guilty, is set to go to trial next May.\n\nTrump's counterclaim in the Carroll suit focused on what he argued were her false statements, which he alleged badly harmed his reputation, a day after a jury verdict in May in her favor for $5 million for sexual abuse and defamation in a related civil lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.\n\nCarroll during a CNN interview said that she thought, \"Oh, yes, he did - oh, yes, he did\" - after jurors in that case did not find that Trump had raped her.\n\nIn the same interview, Carroll described her encounter in court with Trump's lawyer Joseph Tacopina right after the jury verdict, when Tacopina shook hands with her attorney, Roberta Kaplan, who is not related to the judge.\n\n\"Well, Joe Tacopina is very likeable. He's sort of like an 18th century strutting peacock,\" Carroll said on CNN. \"So, he sticks out his hand - first he congratulated Robbie. And then, he was congratulating people on the team. And as I put my hand forward, I said, 'He did it and you know it.' Then we shook hands, I passed on.\"\n\nJudge Kaplan, in dismissing the counterclaim, wrote that Carroll's statements repeating a claim that Trump had raped her were \"substantially true\" because the jury had found he digitally penetrated her, even if it did not find that he had penetrated her with his penis, as is required for a rape charge under New York law.\n\n\"In fact, both acts constitute 'rape' in common parlance, its definition in some dictionaries, in some federal and state criminal statutes, and elsewhere,\" Kaplan wrote.\n\nRoberta Kaplan, in a statement on the judge's ruling, said, \"We are pleased that the Court dismissed Donald Trump's counterclaim.\"\n\n\"That means that the January 15th jury trial will be limited to a narrow set of issues and shouldn't take very long to complete,\" Roberta Kaplan said. \"E. Jean Carroll looks forward to obtaining additional compensatory and punitive damages based on the original defamatory statements Donald Trump made in 2019.\"\n\nTrump's lawyer Alina Habba said, \"We strongly disagree with the flawed decision and will be filing an appeal shortly.\"\n\nBragg's office in May issued a subpoena for the videotape and transcript of the deposition Trump gave in Carroll's civil case last fall.\n\nTrump's lawyers then asked a New York state court judge to block the subpoena.\n\nThe judge last month ruled that Kaplan, who is overseeing Carroll's case, should decide whether a protective order covering the deposition precluded it from being given to the DA's office by her lawyers.\n\nKaplan, in his order made public Monday, said Carroll's lawyers could comply with the subpoena.\n\nAlthough Trump's lawyers had argued in the state court action that the deposition was covered by the protective order, they did not renew that argument to Kaplan.\n\nCarroll's lawyers declined to comment Monday on the district attorney's subpoena.\n\nBragg's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the judge's order allowing him to obtain the deposition.\n\nThe deposition Trump gave features an exchange he had with Roberta Kaplan, who asked him about the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" comment made years earlier. In those comments, Trump bragged about sexually groping women without asking for their consent and getting away with it because he was a \"star.\"\n\n\"Well, historically, that's true with stars,\" Trump answered.\n\nRoberta Kaplan then asked him if was \"true with stars that they can grab women\" by their genitals.\n\n\"Well, that's what - if you look over the last million years, I guess that's been largely true. Not always, but largely true. Unfortunately, or fortunately,\" Trump replied.\n\nCarroll's lawyer then asked him if he considered himself to be a \"star.\"\n\n\"I think you can say that, yeah,\" he answered.\n\nCarroll, 79, sued Trump in 2019, claiming the then-president defamed her in comments he made earlier that year denying allegations she first made in a New York magazine article that he raped her in the dressing room of a Manhattan department store after a chance encounter in the mid-1990s.\n\nThat suit is the one scheduled to go to trial in January.\n\nCarroll separately sued Trump in late 2022. That action made the civil claim of rape - based on her account of the alleged attack in the 1990s - along with defamation, which stemmed from disparaging comments Trump made about her in 2022.\n\nCarroll's allegation of rape was allowed under a new state law that opened a one-year window permitting accusers in sexual abuse cases to file civil claims that otherwise would be barred by the statute of limitations.\n\nThat second case went to trial this spring and ended when the jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing Carroll and defaming her, and ordered him to pay Carroll $5 million in compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nTrump is appealing that verdict.\n\nIn July, Judge Kaplan rejected a request by Trump to sharply reduce the jury award against him.\n\n\"The jury in this case did not reach 'a seriously erroneous result,'\" Kaplan wrote in an order that quoted Trump's arguments.\n\n\"Its verdict is not 'a miscarriage of justice,'\" the judge wrote.\n\nEarlier in July, the U.S. Department of Justice dropped a nearly three-year effort to shield Trump from civil liability from Carroll's first lawsuit, which relates to comments he made about her while president.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Trump Now Owes E. Jean Carroll Over $90 Million With Interest As Appeals Court Hears First Case\n\nAn appeals court will consider Friday whether the $5 million judgment against former President Donald Trump in writer E. Jean Carroll's first trial against him should stand, the first of two multi-million fines he's been ordered to pay in Carroll's defamation cases-which have kept accruing millions in interest as Trump's appeals have played out, adding up to over $90 million.\n\nE. Jean Carroll arrives at Manhattan federal court on May 9, 2023, in New York.\n\nCarroll sued Trump for defamation twice after he publicly attacked her for accusing him of sexually assaulting her in the 1990s, with one case going to trial in May 2023 and the other in January (he has denied the allegations).\n\nA jury ordered Trump to pay $5 million for defamation and sexual abuse-but did not find him liable for rape-in the first trial, which a federal appeals court will hear arguments about on Friday, as Trump claims the district court should not have entered \"inflammatory\" evidence like the \"Access Hollywood\" tape in which Trump bragged about \"grab[bing]\" women \"by the pussy.\"\n\nTrump was later ordered to pay $83.3 million after a trial in the second case, which was just to determine damages for defamation since Trump had already been found liable in the first trial.\n\nInterest on both of those judgments keeps accruing until the appeals process ends, with Carroll's attorney Roberta Kaplan telling Forbes that based on the federal statute determining interest-which pegs the interest rate to the Treasury yield on the date the judgment is entered-Trump is paying interest at a rate of 4.72% on the $5 million judgment and 4.76% on the $83.3 million one.\n\nBased on those interest rates, Forbes estimates Trump now owes approximately $5.3 million in the first trial and $85.3 million in the second-adding up to $91 million in total.\n\nTrump has posted bond in both cases-paying the money he owes into a court-controlled account-which includes enough money to cover interest on the payments, paying $5.5 million in the first case and $91.6 million in the second.\n\nTrump's attorneys and campaign have not responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe appeals court will hear oral arguments in the first Carroll case Friday morning. It's unclear when they could issue their ruling after that, though attorney Mitchell Epner told Forbes it's likely to take a few months, predicting a ruling would come out either at the end of this year or beginning of 2025. As Trump is also appealing the other Carroll judgment-which came out months afterwards, and thus hasn't been scheduled yet for an appeal-Epner said it's also possible the court could wait to decide both cases at the same time, though it's unclear if they will. While only the $5 million judgment is up for appeal on Friday, it's likely that any decision in that case will affect the second $83.3 million fine. The verdict in the first trial formed the basis of the jury's deliberations in the second, since the second jury just determined damages based on Trump already being found liable for defamation and sexual abuse. That means if the appeals court were to strike down the first jury's verdict and rule Trump isn't liable after all, it's likely the second verdict against Trump would be thrown out as well.\n\nTrump has denied sexually assaulting Carroll and has denied the defamation allegations, and his lawyers have argued in court that Carroll has profited off of her allegations against Trump and used them to her own benefit. The ex-president has continued to attack Carroll, claiming she's lying and he doesn't know her, even as the trials against him have moved forward.\n\nNo-interest keeps accruing while the case gets appealed and isn't affected by any orders in the interim. Epner noted to Forbes that appeals are \"the whole reason why interest accrues,\" as otherwise a defendant could simply keep dragging out a payment for years by appealing a case, and given the rate of inflation, any payment they'd ultimately make at the end of that process would be worth less than if they paid it off on time.\n\nForbes values Trump's net worth at $3.9 billion as of Friday morning, ranking him the 874th richest person in the world. Most of his net worth is based on his stake in Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social, however, with a smaller portion dominated by real estate. The ex-president only has an estimated $413 million in cash and liquid assets, which is what would be used to cover his legal liabilities. There is no indication that Trump has used donor funds to cover his judgment fees, as he has for paying his lawyers .\n\nIn addition to the two judgments against Trump in the Carroll cases, the ex-president has also been ordered to pay $454.2 million in the civil fraud case brought in New York against Trump and his business associates. That judgment is also accruing interest while Trump appeals it, at an approximate rate of more than $100,000 per day.\n\nCarroll sued Trump for defamation in 2019 after publicly accusing him of raping her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in the 1990s. Trump denied Carroll's allegations and publicly attacked her in response, claiming the writer isn't \"my type.\" The writer's initial lawsuit is actually the second one that went to trial, after getting stalled in court for years, and Carroll's second lawsuit, brought under New York's Adult Survivors Act, was the one that went to trial first. Both trials were based on substantially similar comments, allowing the jury's ruling in the first trial to affect the second case. Trump has continued to deny Carroll's claims despite the multi-million dollar judgments against him, leading Carroll's attorneys to suggest they could bring another lawsuit.\n\nDan Alexander contributed reporting.\n\nOne Community.

      "text": "Trump Posts $91.6 Million Bond In E. Jean Carroll Case As He Appeals\n\nFormer President Donald Trump posted a $91.6 million bond Friday after losing writer E. Jean Carroll's defamation case against him, also appealing the eight-figure judgment, as the ex-president faced a Monday deadline to pay the judgment against him-though he still has hundreds of millions more to pay in a separate civil fraud case.\n\nE. Jean Carroll departs a Manhattan federal court after her defamation trial against Donald Trump on ... More January 26 in New York City.\n\nTrump's attorneys notified the court Friday that he had posted the bond, which guarantees his ability to pay the $83.3 million verdict against him in the case plus interest, and asked the court to block the judgment against Trump from being enforced while he appeals the case.\n\nThe bond was underwritten by insurance company The Chubb Corporation, a copy of the bond filed in court shows-whose CEO Trump previously appointed to his trade advisory committee in 2018-though it's unclear how Trump secured the bond and if he paid cash or put up any of his properties as collateral.\n\nTrump faced a Monday deadline to put up the money he owes in the case, as he had 30 days after the judgment on Feb. 8 to either pay cash or post an appeals bond before Carroll could ask the court to enforce the judgment and seize Trump's assets.\n\nTrump has to pay the money even as he appeals the case against him, though he could get the money back if he wins the case in appeals court.\n\nThe ex-president asked the court to pause the judgment against him while he filed post-trial motions, which the court had not yet ruled on, though U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan rejected a separate request from Trump on Thursday to delay the judgment for three days after the court ruled on the pause request.\n\nTrump attorney Alina Habba said in a statement to Forbes the ex-president's legal team is \"highly confident that the Second Circuit will overturn this egregious judgment,\" while Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung noted a bond had been filed in the \"full amount\" and said \"all of the Crooked Joe Biden - directed Hoaxes will be crushed and President Trump will Make America Great Again.\"\n\nForbes estimates Trump's cash and liquid assets at $413 million , part of a total $2.6 billion estimated net worth .\n\nTrump still has to pay an additional $454.2 million- and counting -as part of the separate civil fraud case against him and his company. New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought the case, is expected to start enforcing that judgment, and potentially seizing Trump's properties, if he does not pay by March 25. With the amount Trump owes exceeding his estimated cash in the bank, it's still unknown how Trump will come up with what he owes or secure a bond, whether that could include borrowing against or selling his properties, obtaining loans or seeking help from wealthy friends.\n\nKaplan chastised Trump on Thursday for waiting until the last minute to ask the court to pause the monetary judgment against him, writing that the ex-president's last-minute scramble to post a bond \"is a result of his own dilatory actions.\" Trump \"has had since January 26 to organize his finances with the knowledge that he might need to bond this judgment, yet he waited until 25 days after the jury verdict\" to ask the court to delay the payment deadline, Kaplan wrote.\n\nCarroll sued Trump in 2019 for defamation after she publicly accused him of sexual assault, alleging the then-president raped her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in the 1990s. Trump attacked Carroll in response, denying her account and claiming she isn't \"my type,\" leading the writer to file suit. Trump's reaction to her allegations caused Carroll \"emotional pain and suffering at the hands of the man who raped her, as well as injury to her reputation, honor and dignity,\" she alleged in the lawsuit. The case went to trial in January, years after its filing, as it stalled in court while Trump tried to have it dismissed. By that point, a second case Carroll filed against Trump-under New York's Adult Survivors Act-had already gone to trial, with a jury ruling in May 2023 Trump was liable for defamation and sexual assault, but not rape, and ordering him to pay $5 million. Since the comments at issue in the 2019 lawsuit were substantially similar to the case that had already gone to trial, Trump was found liable in the 2019 case even before the trial, and the jury only had to determine how much Trump had to pay in damages. The jury ruled that Trump had to pay $18.3 million in compensatory damages and $65 million in punitive damages, which are meant to dissuade Trump from further defaming Carroll."

Jean Carroll More Than 35 Times-Ahead Of Today's Potential Testimony\n\nFormer President Donald went on yet another manic social media posting spree demeaning writer E.

More president Donald Trump has been postponed after a juror and one of Trump's lawyers reported feeling ill on January 22, 2024 in New York City.  (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)\n\nTrump posted more than 35 times about Carroll in a period of eight hours overnight Thursday, sharing various articles from conservative social media sites digging into her social media history and past interviews-hours before her defamation trial against him resumes in Manhattan.\n\nThe tirade comes as Trump is expected to testify Thursday before a jury deciding how much in damages he owes her for denying her sexual abuse claims against him, which a separate jury found him liable for in May last year, awarding her $5 million in damages.\n\nMany of Trump's posts were ones he has shared before, including alleged screenshots purporting to show the former longtime Elle columnist-who frequently wrote about sex-discussing the topic on her social media pages.\n\nTrump quoted articles highlighting billionaire LinkedIn co-founder and Democratic mega donor Reid Hoffman's role in funding her lawsuit, alleging the case is \"a false accusation forced into the public eye by Democrat operatives,\" referring to previous revelations that Carroll's initial sexual abuse suit was funded by American Future Republic, a nonprofit Hoffman backs.\n\nTrump also directed his ire at presiding Judge Lewis Kaplan, calling him \"a 100% Trump Hater\" who is \"looking to do a number\" on him.\n\nTrump is back in court after a three-day hiatus from the trial, which was postponed Monday when a juror and his lawyer Alina Habba told Judge Lewis Kaplan they had fallen ill. Trump is listed as one of two possible witnesses for the defense on Thursday. He is prohibited from saying anything to contest the previous jury's decision that he sexually abused Carroll, but has indicated-both in his Truth Social posts overnight and in interviews with reporters-he will defy the judge's orders and reiterate his previous claims to the jury that he does not know who Carroll is. Trump has clashed with Kaplan throughout the trial, which began on Jan. 16. As Carroll was testifying last week, the judge ordered Trump to \"keep his voice down\" as he spoke to his lawyer while she was on the stand, threatening to remove him from the courtroom. \"I would love it,\" Trump retorted.\n\nThe trial resumes after Trump won the New Hampshire primary Tuesday, beating his sole remaining competitor former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley by 11 points, effectively paving his path to the GOP nomination after a record-breaking win in Iowa last week."

      "text": "E. Jean Carroll's Case Against Trump Explained\n\nWriter E. Jean Carroll sued then-President Donald Trump in 2019 for defamation after alleging he raped her in a department store dressing room in the 1990s-here's what to know about the civil case as it continues to wind through the courts three years later, and as Trump finally sat for a deposition on Wednesday. ( UPDATE : A jury found Trump sexually abused Carroll and owes her $5 Million In Damages .)\n\nE. Jean Carroll sued Trump for defamation in 2019 after he denied her rape allegations against him.\n\nHow It Started: Carroll wrote in a June 2019 New York Magazine article excerpting her book that Trump raped her in a dressing room at Bergdorf Goodman in the 1990s-but Trump denied the allegations, saying, \"I've never met this person in my life,\" Carroll is \"not my type,\" and the incident \"never happened.\"\n\nThe Lawsuit: Carroll then sued Trump for defamation as a result of his comments in November 2019, alleging the then-president's reaction to her allegations caused her \"emotional pain and suffering at the hands of the man who raped her, as well as injury to her reputation, honor and dignity.\"\n\nWhat She's Asking For: Carroll's lawsuit asks for an unspecified amount of monetary damages, which would be determined at trial, and for the court to order Trump to retract his allegedly defamatory statements.\n\nLawsuit Moves Forward: Carroll initially sued Trump in New York Supreme Court, where Justice Verna L. Saunders ruled in August 2020 that the case could move forward, rebuffing a request from Trump to put the case on hold while a separate defamation case against him, which also involved allegations of sexual misconduct, played out.\n\nGovernment Steps In: The Justice Department (during the Trump Administration) moved the case to federal court in September 2020 and asked the court to substitute the government as the defendant in the case instead of Trump himself, arguing that Trump's denials were made as part of his official role as president, and thus Carroll's lawsuit should be against the United States and not Trump as a private citizen.\n\nWhy That Matters: If a court determines that Trump's comments fell under the scope of his presidency and the federal government can be substituted as the defendant, it means Carroll's case will almost certainly fail, the New York Times notes , as the government cannot be sued for defamation like individual citizens can.\n\nBiden Administration Weighs In: While the government asked to intervene in the lawsuit when Trump was president, the Biden Administration hasn't backed away from the case, and said in a court brief in June 2021 that while Trump's comments were \"crude and disrespectful\" and Carroll's allegations \"cast doubt\" on Trump's \"fitness for office,\" it ultimately believes the comments fell into the scope of his employment as president and thus Carroll's case should be dismissed.\n\nWhat Courts Have Said: The federal district judge hearing the case rejected the government's attempt to substitute itself for Trump in October 2020-an appeals court then threw out that ruling in September but didn't decide whether Trump was actually acting within the scope of his employment, instead sending that question to a different appeals court in Washington, D.C., to decide (which remains pending).\n\nDiscovery In The Case: Carroll's attorneys have accused Trump throughout the litigation of refusing to turn over documents and other materials as part of the discovery process-including his deposition-saying in a September letter to the court that while Trump has gotten thousands of documents from Carroll, he's only turned over eight documents himself and has \"stonewalled\" their requests and \"violated every deadline that applied to his discovery responses without any credible excuse for his failure.\"\n\nTrump's Deposition: After U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan rebuffed Trump's request to delay his deposition and discovery until the appeals court rules on the government intervening, Trump was deposed in the case on Wednesday, and his attorney Alina Habba said he answered questions in the deposition and did not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights (attorneys for Carroll said they were \"pleased\" to take Trump's deposition but are unable to comment further).\n\nA second case to be filed. Carroll's attorneys have said she intends to file a second lawsuit against Trump under New York's newly passed Adult Survivors Act, which gives adults who were victims of sexual assault a one-year period in which to file litigation against their abusers if the statute of limitations has otherwise expired. Carroll intends to file the lawsuit on November 24, when it becomes possible to do so under the law, and her attorneys signaled they're hoping the case can be tried alongside her defamation suit in February. Whatever Trump said during his deposition on Wednesday could also be used as evidence against him in that case, and Kaplan pointed to the impending second case as a reason to justify Trump being deposed now.\n\nTrump countersued Carroll in response to her defamation case, which alleged harassment on her behalf through her allegations against him and sought financial damages. That suit was thrown out in court in March, however, as Kaplan ruled Trump brought the countersuit in \"bad faith\" and accused him of using the lawsuit as a tactic to further delay her defamation case.\n\nCarroll's suit and allegations against Trump are part of a broader series of sexual misconduct allegations against him, with more than 20 women publicly alleging Trump in some way assaulted or harassed them. (Trump has repeatedly denied the accusations.) In her lawsuit, Carroll alleges Trump's response to her allegations was \"fully consistent with his tried-and-true playbook for responding to credible public reports that he sexually assaulted women,\" claiming Trump has \"openly suggested sexual assault is inevitable when men and women interact\" and has a history of allegations that he has touched women inappropriately. Trump \"knew he was lying\" when he denied Carroll's rape allegations against him, Carroll alleges, and he \"knew he had raped her, just as he had sexually assaulted many other women over many years.\" Besides Carroll, Apprentice contestant Summer Zervos also sued Trump for defamation in 2017, after he denied her sexual assault allegations against him and called them \"lies.\" Zervos dropped that lawsuit in November 2021, without receiving any settlement payments from Trump, with her attorney saying she \"no longer wishes to litigate against the defendant and has secured the right to speak freely about her experience.\" The attorney specified Zervos stood by her allegations of assault, though Trump ultimately hailed the lawsuit being dropped as him being \"totally vindicated.\"\n\nTrump Rape Lawsuit From E.

      "text": "Another Loss For Trump: Judge Rules His Comments About E. Jean Carroll Were Defamatory\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is liable for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll when he made comments in 2019 opposing her allegations that he sexually assaulted her, a judge ruled Wednesday, which means an upcoming trial in the case will only determine how much Trump has to pay in damages-on top of the $5 million a jury already forced Trump to pay Carroll earlier this year.\n\nWriter E. Jean Carroll leaves a Manhattan court house after a jury found former President Donald ... More Trump liable for sexually abusing her in a Manhattan department store in the 1990's on May 9 in New York City.\n\nTrump will go to trial in January 2024 against Carroll over comments he made in 2019, in which he claimed he \"never met this person in his life\" and Carroll is \"not my type,\" said Carroll's sexual assault claims were \"totally false\" and the incident \"never happened,\" and claimed she made the accusations in order to sell copies of her book.\n\nThe trial is separate from one that took place in May, in which a jury found Trump liable of sexually assaulting Carroll in the 1990s-but not raping her-and that he defamed her in comments made in 2022, in which he similarly called Carroll's allegations a \"con job\" to promote her \"crummy book\" and said the writer is \"not telling the truth\" and \"a woman who I had nothing to do with.\"\n\nU.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan granted Carroll's motion for summary judgment ahead of the January trial, finding Trump liable for defamation for his 2019 comments based on the jury verdict in the other case, after Carroll argued the judge should rule now because the 2019 comments were \"substantially the same\" as the one the jury found defamatory.\n\nThat verdict \"plainly established that Trump's 2019 statements were false (not substantially true),\" Kaplan ruled Wednesday, also finding Trump made his 2019 comments with \"actual malice,\" meaning he made them knowing that they were false.\n\nTrump argued the trial should still go forward to determine liability, claiming the two sets of statements had different elements so the jury didn't rule on everything, but Kaplan struck down the ex-president's argument, saying it \"defies common sense and mischaracterizes Ms. Carroll's defamation claim.\"\n\nCarroll's attorney, Roberta Kaplan, told Forbes in a statement they \"look forward to trial limited to damages for the original defamatory statements Donald Trump made about our client E Jean Carroll in 2019,\" while Trump's attorney Alina Habba said they \"remain very confident\" that the jury's verdict in the other lawsuit will be overturned on appeal, \"which will render this decision moot.\"\n\n\"The truth or falsity of Mr. Trump's 2019 statements ... depends-like the truth or falsity of his 2022 statement-on whether Ms. Carroll lied about Mr. Trump sexually assaulting her,\" Kaplan wrote in his ruling Wednesday. \"The jury's finding that she did not is therefore binding in this case and precludes Mr. Trump from contesting the falsity of his 2019 statements.\"\n\nCarroll's defamation trial against Trump is scheduled to begin on January 15, 2024. The ruling Wednesday means the jury will only decide how much Carroll should be awarded in damages, given Kaplan has already found Trump is liable for defamation. The jury awarded Carroll $2.98 million for Trump's defamatory comments made in 2022 (in addition to $2 million for sexual assault), but this trial is seeking an even higher settlement, as Carroll's complaint asks for no less than $10 million. Trump is also appealing the jury's verdict in the other case against him and has requested a new trial, which is still pending.\n\nTrump has strongly denied Carroll's allegations of assault and defamation. The former president called the jury verdict against him in May a \"disgrace,\" saying it was a \"a continuation of the greatest witch hunt of all time.\"\n\nCarroll first accused Trump of sexual assault in 2019, claiming in a piece published by the Cut that the then-real estate mogul forcibly assaulted and raped her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in the 1990s. After Trump publicly opposed her allegations and disparaged Carroll, the writer first sued Trump for defamation in November 2019, alleging Trump's comments caused her \"emotional pain and suffering at the hands of the man who raped her, as well as injury to her reputation, honor and dignity.\" The case-which is the one now going to trial in January-started in state court but was then moved to federal court, and Carroll filed a second lawsuit in November 2022 accusing Trump of sexual assault under New York's Adult Survivors Act, which lifted the statute of limitations for one year regarding adult victims of sexual assault. That lawsuit resulted in the trial earlier this year and the jury finding Trump guilty of assaulting Carroll.\n\nCarroll's case against Trump over his 2019 comments has taken longer to go to trial as courts have tried to determine whether Trump was acting within the scope of his duties as president when he opposed the writer's allegations. That obstacle was cleared up in July, when the Biden Administration's Justice Department reversed course after previously defending Trump's position and said the agency now \"lacks adequate evidence to conclude\" Trump was acting as president when he made the comments, and it would not shield Trump from the defamation claims.\n\nTrump Calls E.

      "text": "Trump Goes To Trial Against E. Jean Carroll-Again: Here's What To Know\n\nBy Alison Durkee\n\nBy Alison Durkee , Forbes Staff. Alison is a senior news reporter covering US politics and legal news.\n\nBy Alison Durkee ,\n\nForbes Staff.\n\nWriter E. Jean Carroll's trial against former President Donald Trump for defamation will begin Tuesday, the second time they've gone to court against each other, as a jury will determine damages against the ex-president for defaming Carroll after she accused him of sexual assault-and it could result in Trump having to pay out millions.\n\nWriter E. Jean Carroll (right) leaves after her civil trial against former President Donald Trump at ... More Manhattan Federal Court on May 09, 2023 in New York City.\n\nCarroll accused Trump of sexually assaulting her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in the 1990s, and subsequently sued the ex-president for defamation after he repeatedly criticized her in 2019 in response, claiming he didn't know Carroll, that she had lied about the assault and saying the writer is \"not my type.\"\n\nThe writer filed two separate lawsuits against Trump; the second, which accused him of both sexual assault and defamation, went to trial in May 2023 and ended with a jury finding Trump liable for defamation and sexual assault-but not rape-and ordering him to pay $5 million.\n\nCarroll's first lawsuit, which solely accuses Trump of defamation, is now going to trial starting Tuesday, but a jury will only determine how much Trump has to pay in damages, after the judge ruled Trump can already be found liable for defamation in this case, given how similar the allegations are to the first trial.\n\nCarroll is asking the jury to force Trump to pay her $10 million in damages, plus an unspecified amount in punitive damages-which are meant to deter Trump from continuing to defame Carroll, as he's done on social media.\n\nGiven that Trump has already been found liable for sexual assault, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan ruled in January that Trump can't defend himself in court by claiming he didn't sexually assault Carroll, that he doesn't know her or that she's lying.\n\nTrump has said he'll attend the trial and could testify-which has been a source of contention, with Carroll's attorney asking the court to impose restrictions on Trump if he does testify, like forcing him to acknowledge the limitations on his testimony under oath, because they fear Trump will try to \"intentionally [turn] this trial into a circus.\"\n\nThe trial, which will have a jury, is expected to last five to seven days, according to court filings . Trump is expected to attend the trial when it begins on Tuesday, the New York Times reports , though it's still unclear when exactly he could testify, if he does. (He did not testify in Carroll's first trial against him.) The ex-president asked for the trial to be postponed for a week due to the death of his mother-in-law, and while the judge refused that request-and noted that Trump was trying to postpone the trial but still had a campaign event scheduled-Kaplan said that if his lawyers rest their defense in the trial on Thursday, Trump could still testify on Monday.\n\nWhether Trump will testify, and what could happen if he does. The ex-president told reporters on Thursday-after Kaplan's ruling limiting what he could say in court about the case-that he planned to attend the trial and would \"explain I don't know who the hell [Carroll]\n\nTrump, who has strongly denied all of Carroll's allegations, has continued to go after the writer even after being found liable for defaming her. The ex-president claimed he didn't know Carroll after the jury verdict in his first trial and has never stopped attacking her publicly for her claims against him, recently posting about Carroll more than 40 times on Truth Social in a single day. The continued attacks, which could be a basis for future defamation allegations against him, could fuel Carroll's request for the jury to award a high amount of punitive damages that would deter Trump from speaking out in the future. Money is \"really the only avenue through which the court or the jury can put an end to this,\" attorney Ben Chew, who represented actor Johnny Depp in his defamation case, told the Times .\n\nThe Carroll trial is already the second court appearance Trump will make in 2024, after the ex-president attended and spoke at closing arguments in the civil fraud trial against him and his company last week. Trump is expected to have a busy year in court, with potentially all four criminal cases against him set to go to trial this year. (He has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges against him.) The former president told reporters last week he \"want[s] to go to all of my trials.\"\n\nCarroll first alleged Trump raped her in a 2019 New York Magazine article excerpting her book, with the then-president immediately denying the allegations, saying \"I've never met this person in my life,\" Carroll is \"not my type,\" and the incident \"never happened.\" The writer sued Trump for defamation in November 2019, alleging Trump's reaction to her allegations caused her \"emotional pain and suffering at the hands of the man who raped her, as well as injury to her reputation, honor and dignity.\" She then filed her second lawsuit in November 2022, alleging sexual assault under New York's Adult Survivors Act, which gave adult victims of sexual assault a one-year window to file litigation even if the statute of limitations had expired. That second case went to trial first as Carroll's initial lawsuit spent years making its way through court, as Trump unsuccessfully tried to have the case dismissed because he claimed his comments about Carroll were made as part of his official role as president and thus couldn't be litigated. The case is going to trial now after a federal appeals court also twice denied Trump's claims to have \"presidential immunity\" from the allegations, ruling in December that Trump hadn't made that claim soon enough.\n\nE.

More Manhattan Federal Court following the conclusion of the civil defamation trial against former President Donald Trump on January 26, 2024 in New York City. A jury awarded Carroll a total of $83.3 million dollars in her week long civil defamation trial against former President Trump, including $18.3 million in compensatory damages and $65 million in punitive damages, finding that Trump acted maliciously for one of the two statements at issue.  (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)\n\nIn an interview with CNN Monday morning, E. Jean Carroll described seeing Donald Trump for the first time since 1996, when she says he assaulted her in a fitting room in a New York department store. \"And there he was,\" she said. \"And he was nothing. Just, no power. He was zero. I was flabbergasted.\"\n\nAsked if she made eye contact with the former president, she said \"many times,\" and described the experience as looking at \"an emperor without clothes.

More closing arguments at his civil fraud trial at State Supreme Court. (Photo by Lev Radin/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images)\n\nA New York jury last week decided that Trump should pay Carroll a staggering $83.3 million in damages for defamatory statements he made about Carroll. Appearing on CNN This Morning , Carroll told anchors Poppy Harlow and Phil Mattingly Monday, in her first television interview since the verdict, she said she'd been anxious about facing Trump in court.\n\n\"I had been prepared for the worst force, you know, on the Earth today. The most powerful, the most effective, the most money, the richest, the most, you know? And there he is, he's nothing. It's just the people around him who give him the power.\"\n\nCarroll's attorney, Roberta Kaplan, who appeared on CNN beside her client, described her experience delivering closing arguments, when Trump stood up and walked out of the courtroom. \"I thought to myself, whoa, in a case about whether you can follow the rules or not, and you can not be a bully, not following the rules and acting like a bully is not a good move.\"\n\nTrump, who had disparaged Carroll and the trial as it was going on, stayed silent in the aftermath of the verdict, avoiding any direct attacks on Carroll. He did, however, call the verdict \"absolutely ridiculous\" and said he would appeal. \"Our Legal System is out of control, and being used as a Political Weapon\" he said on his Truth Social platform.\n\nTrump has, however, shared articles from right-leaning media sites, including an opinion piece by Raheem Kassam in The National Pulse calling the Carroll verdict \"the Greatest Miscarriage of Justice in Modern American History.\"\n\nCarroll is set for a prime time interview Monday, sitting down with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow on The Rachel Maddow Show ."

Jean Carroll, claiming the $2 million he was ordered to pay her for sexual abuse was \"grossly excessive\" because the jury ruled the incident between the two in a department store dressing room was sexual abuse, not rape.\n\nWriter E. Jean Carroll won $5 million from Trump for sexual abuse and defamation damages.\n\nTrump's claim, filed by his lawyer Joe Tacopina in a Manhattan court Thursday, asks for a re-trial of the civil case brought by Carroll, who won $5 million in damages in May for sexual abuse and defamation related to an incident in the mid-1990s.\n\nAlthough Carroll said Trump raped her in a department store dressing room, the jury found that she was sexually abused, which Trump said in his latest filing \"could have included groping [her] breasts through clothing,\" which is \"a far cry from rape.\"\n\nThe filing claims Trump did not cause Carroll \"diagnosed mental injury\" because she said during the trial she was \"a happy person\" and did not suffer from mental illnesses like PTSD or depression.\n\nHe also argued the $3 million defamation charges, which he was given for a Truth Social post denying her allegations, are \"based on pure speculation\" about how much of an impact it had on the public.\n\nIn response to the filing, Carroll's attorney, Robbie Kaplan, called Trump's claims \"frivolous.\"\n\nThe two-week trial wrapped up in early May, and included graphic testimony from Carroll, who described being pushed into a dressing room, where Trump \"inserted his penis\" into her. Trump did not appear in court, but the jury was shown his deposition, in which he doubled down on his comments about grabbing women that he made in an old Access Hollywood video. The jury ruled the assault was sexual abuse-not rape-for which Trump was ordered to pay $2 million, in addition to $3 million for defamation. Three days after the verdict, Trump filed to appeal . He also said during a CNN town hall following the trial that it was \"a rigged deal\" and Carroll is a \"wack job\" with a \"made-up story.\"\n\nTrump Sexually Abused E.

Jean Carroll in a department store in the 1990s, but unanimously rejected her claim that Trump raped her, the New York Times and CNN reported Tuesday.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump speaks to guests at the 2023 NRA-ILA Leadership Forum on April 14 in ... More Indianapolis.\n\nThe jury in New York federal court reportedly awarded Carroll $2 million in damages for sexual abuse, and roughly $3 million for defamation based on Trump's social media posts denying the encounter with Carroll.\n\nAfter a two-week trial, the jury of six men and three women reached a verdict after fewer than three hours.\n\nCarroll said, \"We're very happy,\" as she was escorted from the courtroom to her car, according to reporter Adam Klasfeld.\n\nTrump responded to the verdict in an all-caps Truth Social post , calling it \"a continuation of the greatest witch hunt of all time\" and insisting he doesn't know Carroll-Trump's legal team said it plans to appeal the ruling, CNN and Reuters reported.\n\nClosing arguments wrapped up Monday afternoon, with Trump's lawyer Joe Tacopina arguing the alleged rape didn't happen and it was a fabricated story with political motives, and Carroll's lawyers highlighting that Trump did not testify nor make an appearance in court for the trial.\n\nTacopina asked the jury if they \"believe the unbelievable,\" arguing Carroll would have reported the rape-which allegedly occurred nearly 30 years ago-right after it happened.\n\nHe also posited that Carroll and two women, whom she said she immediately told about the assault and who testified during the trial, colluded to ruin Trump's political ambitions and to sell her memoir.\n\nCarroll's lawyers Mike Ferrara and Roberta Kaplan have countered by saying Trump's history of sexual assault-he has been accused by numerous women in the past, though never convicted-was clear before Carroll's accusations when he won the 2016 presidential election.\n\nWriter E. Jean Carroll leaves court on Monday, one day before jurors found Trump liable for sexually ... More abusing her in the 1990s.\n\nTrump posted to Truth Social on Tuesday morning calling Carroll's accusations false. He also said he was not allowed to \"speak or defend myself,\" likely referring to earlier Truth Social posts he made on the first day of the trial. In those two posts, which have been deleted, he called the case a \"scam\" and a \"political operative,\" but Judge Lewis Kaplan asked Tacopina to ensure Trump stopped posting online about the trial while it was ongoing. In Tuesday's post, Trump said he plans to \"appeal the Unconstitutional silencing of me...no matter the outcome.\"\n\nCarroll, who wrote an advice column for Elle for several decades, first accused Trump of rape in 2019, when she published an excerpt of her memoir in which she describes an attack in a dressing room in the department store Bergdorf Goodman. The two were shopping together before they entered a dressing room together and he pulled down her tights and raped her, she has said. Carroll said the incident occurred in the mid-1990s, but Carroll was able to file the assault claim in 2022 after the passage of the Adult Survivors Act, which allows adult sexual assault victims to file suits no matter how long ago the conduct occurred. Trump has denied Carroll's allegations, at one point claiming she was \"not my type,\" which Carroll claimed contributed to her defamation.\n\nOn Friday, Trump's deposition was unsealed, in which he answered questions from Carroll's and his own lawyers. One major point was a tape from Access Hollywood in which Trump infamously said he can \"grab\" women because of his status. During the deposition, Trump doubled down on the comments: \"Historically, that's true for stars,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, or fortunately.\" The jurors were shown both the Access Hollywood tape and the deposition. During his deposition, Trump was also shown an old photo of him and Carroll together, but he repeatedly misidentified her as his ex-wife, Marla Maples. After being corrected, he confirmed that Maples was his type.\n\nBesides having to pay the damages, it's unclear whether the jury's decision will impact Trump's ongoing presidential run. He is set to participate in a presidential town hall hosted by CNN on Wednesday evening in New Hampshire. Trump is currently the front-runner among Republicans running for the 2024 election.\n\nThis trial was the result of the second of two lawsuits filed by Carroll against Trump. The first, which was filed in 2019 before the Adult Survivors Act was passed, only alleges defamation-not sexual assault-for the comments Trump made after Carroll published the excerpt of her memoir recounting the alleged rape. The first lawsuit faces delays because it was filed while Trump was serving as president, and government employees are generally protected from defamation claims, which could cause Carroll's case to fail. It was indefinitely postponed a month before the trial for the second lawsuit began.\n\nTrump Rape Trial Begins Tuesday-Here's What To Know (Forbes)\n\nE.

He was found liable for defamation and sexual abuse, ordered to pay Carroll a total of $88.3 million. Trump denies Carroll's claim and has since appealed.\n\nOn Wednesday, within hours of the president-elect defeating Vice President Kamala Harris to secure a second term, Carroll expressed disappointment on social media that her warnings about Trump appeared to have little impact on the election's outcome.\n\n\"I tried to tell you,\" Carroll wrote on X, formerly Twitter .\n\nIn the days leading up to the election, Carroll shared posts to X that indicated she was voting \"for the candidate who does not assault women\" and reminding voters that Trump was ordered to pay her \"because a unanimous federal jury found he lied.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out for comment to Trump's office via email on Wednesday night.\n\nWhile Trump was found civilly liable for sexual abusing Carroll rather than raping her, Judge Lewis Kaplan ruled that the rape claim was \"substantially true\" while dismissing Trump's 2023 defamation lawsuit against Carroll.\n\nTrump's appeals of the Carroll suits are still pending.

He is due to be sentenced later this month.\n\nFormer Attorney General Bill Barr urged Attorney General Merrick Garland and state prosecutors to \"respect the people's decision\" by immediately dismissing all cases against Trump during a Fox News appearance on Wednesday.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nAila Slisco is a Newsweek night reporter based in New York.

Jean Carroll , who was found to have been sexually assaulted by Donald Trump , will likely pursue a $83-million judgment against the president-elect \"with renewed vigor\" after an appeal court victory, a trial attorney has told Newsweek .\n\nNewsweek has contacted legal representatives for Trump and Carroll via email for comment.\n\nThe Carroll case feeds into a wider debate about sexual harassment and sexual assault, particularly after the rise of the Me Too movement.\n\nShe will be permitted to pursue the $88.3 million that Trump owes her from two cases, even though the Republican will be sworn in as U.S. president on January 20.\n\nThat is likely to cause political embarrassment for the new president as he seeks to consolidate power after his inauguration.\n\nOn Monday, the New York Court of Appeals ruled that the trial judge was correct in allowing two other women to testify about Trump's history of sexual harassment.\n\nHis accuser had sued him for $5 million, which was awarded, and, in May, 2024, she successfully sued him for an additional $83.3 million for defamation .\n\nThe appeal court rejected his claims that Lewis Kaplan, the trial judge in Carroll's first case, should not have allowed two women to testify that Trump had previously sexually harassed them.\n\nThe court also rejected Trump's claim that Kaplan should not have allowed Carroll's legal team to introduce the infamous Access Hollywood tape, in which Trump had boasted that women allow famous men like him to grab them in a sexual way, without first seeking their consent.\n\nJohn J. Perlstein spoke to Newsweek after the New York court rejected Trump's appeal against a $5-million sexual assault and defamation case.\n\n\"Relying solely on evidentiary rulings can be challenging, as a significant portion of the decision-making process rests with the discretion of the trial judge,\" he said.\n\n\"In this instance, the judge deemed it necessary to establish a pattern of behavior in order to prove the claim.\n\n\"This ruling may suggest that the defense will pursue the second $83-million lawsuit with renewed vigor,\" he said.\n\nThe Court of Appeals ruled on Monday that \"Mr. Trump has not demonstrated that the district court erred in any of the challenged rulings.\n\n\"Further, he has not carried his burden to show that any claimed error or combination of claimed errors affected his substantial rights as required to warrant a new trial,\" the court said.\n\nRoberta Kaplan , Carroll's attorney, said in a statement that \"Both E. Jean Carroll and I are gratified by today's decision. We thank the Second Circuit for its careful consideration of the parties' arguments.\"\n\nTrump spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement that the case is part of a vendetta against the president-elect.\n\n\"The American People have reelected President Trump with an overwhelming mandate, and they demand an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and a swift dismissal of all of the witch hunts,\" Cheung said.\n\nCarroll will be free to collect the $88.3 million she won in both cases against Trump, even after he is inaugurated as president in January.\n\nA 1997 Supreme Court ruling found that lawsuits against sitting presidents can proceed if they do not involve actions that the president took while in office.\n\nIn the 1997 case, Paula Jones won the right to pursue a case against then President Bill Clinton for sexual harassment.\n\nHowever, it is possible that Trump may appeal Monday's ruling to the Supreme Court.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nSean O'Driscoll is a Newsweek Senior Crime and Courts Reporter based in Ireland.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nA federal appeals court on Monday upheld a $5 million verdict that found President-elect Donald Trump liable for sexually abusing and later defaming magazine writer E. Jean Carroll .\n\nTrump was ordered earlier this year to pay Carroll $83.3 million for defamatory statements he made about her in 2019. A jury in Manhattan had found Trump liable in September 2023 for defaming Carroll for comments he made about sexual assault allegations brought by the former Elle columnist.\n\nThe 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the $5 million verdict awarded to E. Jean Carroll for defamation and sexual abuse, affirming the Manhattan jury's decision in a written opinion.\n\nCarroll, a longtime magazine columnist, testified during the 2023 trial that a chance meeting with Trump in the spring of 1996 took a dark turn. According to Carroll, what began as a lighthearted exchange escalated into a violent assault after the two entered a department store dressing room.\n\nTrump opted not to attend the initial trial, where he consistently denied the allegations. However, he briefly testified during a follow-up trial earlier this year, which concluded with an $83.3 million judgment against him. The second trial stemmed from comments Trump made in 2019, while serving as president, after Carroll publicly detailed the accusations in her memoir.\n\nWhile Trump was found civilly liable for sexual abusing Carroll rather than raping her, Judge Lewis Kaplan ruled that the rape claim was \"substantially true\" while dismissing Trump's 2023 defamation lawsuit against Carroll.\n\nThe president-elect's return to power may have little bearing on the case since it is a civil rather than criminal matter. A 1997 Supreme Court ruling found that lawsuits against sitting presidents can proceed if they do not involve actions that the president took while in office.\n\nHowever, Trump's two pending criminal matters-felony election subversion cases in Georgia and at the federal level-are all but certain to be dismissed or at least set aside due to his election victory, since sitting presidents cannot be criminally prosecuted under the law.\n\nIn the ruling this week, the appeals court said : \"Mr. Trump now appeals, contending that the district court (Lewis A. Kaplan, Judge) erred in several of its evidentiary rulings. These include its decisions to admit the testimony of two women who alleged that Mr. Trump sexually assaulted them in the past and to admit a recording of part of a 2005 conversation in which Mr. Trump described to another man how he kissed and grabbed women without first obtaining their consent. Mr. Trump contends that these and other asserted errors entitle him to a new trial.\"\n\n\"On review for abuse of discretion, we conclude that Mr. Trump has not demonstrated that the district court erred in any of the challenged rulings. Further, he has not carried his burden to show that any claimed error or combination of claimed errors affected his substantial rights as required to warrant a new trial,\" the court said.\n\nRoberta Kaplan, Carroll's attorney, said in a statement sent to Newsweek : \"Both E.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nLisa Rubin, an MSNBC legal correspondent and former litigator, wrote on Saturday in an opinion column that former President Donald Trump 's handling of the E. Jean Carroll cases align with what she calls the \"twin pillars\" of his messaging: \"martyrdom and misogyny.\"\n\nTrump, the GOP's presidential nominee, attended an appeals hearing in Manhattan on Friday regarding the first of two civil cases brought by Carroll. In May 2023, a jury found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation, awarding Carroll $5 million. In a separate case concluded in January 2024, the former president was ordered to pay Carroll an additional $83.3 million for defamatory statements made about the first trial.\n\nCarroll, a former Elle writer, claimed that Trump sexually assaulted her in a Bergdorf Goodman department store in New York in the 1990s and then defamed her character in 2022 by claiming the assault never happened because she wasn't his \"type.\"\n\n\"The Carroll case plays right into the twin pillars of Trump's messaging: martyrdom and misogyny,\" Rubin, a former legal analyst for The Rachel Maddow Show and Alex Wagner Tonight , wrote in her MSNBC column. \"Trump stewed silently during court so he could unleash his grievances after, all with the goal of filling his campaign coffer and pushing back on [Vice President Kamala] Harris' 'prosecutor versus sexual abuser' framing.\"\n\nNewsweek has contacted Trump's campaign via email on Saturday for comment.\n\nFollowing the hearing, Trump held a press conference at Trump Tower in Manantan where he openly criticized his own legal team . \"I'm disappointed in my legal talent, I'll be honest with you,\" he stated as his attorneys stood behind him.\n\nHe questioned their strategy, particularly their failure to mention potential DNA evidence related to a dress Carroll allegedly wore during the incident. Stains on it were tested and found to have an unknown man's DNA present, but Trump's team refused to submit his DNA for testing, causing a standoff in the original case.\n\nTrump's attorney, Will Scharf, defended their position, stating, \"It's really important to remember that E. Jean Carroll's story, at its heart, is an utterly implausible he said-she said story.\"\n\nDuring the press conference, Trump also reiterated his claims of innocence: \"So I didn't show up, and I was found guilty for something I did not do with a woman that I have never seen, touched, or in any way was involved with.\" These comments could potentially expose Trump to further legal risk, given the substantial judgments already against him for defamation.\n\nRubin wrote on Saturday that Trump's courtroom appearances and subsequent press conferences serve a dual purpose: reinforcing his narrative of persecution while energizing his base and boosting fundraising efforts. This strategy appears to have been effective in the past, with reports indicating significant fundraising spikes coinciding with major legal developments.\n\nPolitico reported one of Trump's strongest fundraising days in early 2024 coincided with New York Attorney General Letitia James ' move in her civil fraud case against him . The Associated Press, meanwhile, reported that over a third of Trump's $141 million May fundraising total came within 24 hours of his conviction on 34 felony counts in the New York hush money case . Trump maintains his innocence both cases.\n\nHowever, this fundraising strategy shows signs of volatility. In August, when Trump's legal troubles were less prominent and he received a favorable Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity, his campaign contributions reportedly declined. During this period, Vice President Kamala Harris ' campaign significantly outperformed Trump's, raising $361 million compared to his much lower total.\n\nAs the 2024 presidential race intensifies, Rubin wrote in her column that the former president's legal challenges continue to play a significant role in his campaign strategy.\n\n\"Trump and his campaign advisers well understand the perverse relationship between his perceived victimization through the civil and criminal cases against him, on the one hand, and his popularity among his base, on the other,\" she wrote.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nAdeola Adeosun is the Newsweek Weekend Night Editor based in Atlanta, Georgia.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nDonald Trump will likely seek to either reduce or overturn the $83.3 million E. Jean Carroll defamation award, an attorney has said.\n\nOn January 26, a New York jury made the award after Trump repeatedly denied sexually assaulting Carroll in a department store changing room in the mid-1990s.\n\nLitigation attorney Colleen Kerwick said that Trump's first option will likely be to file post-trial motions to reduce the verdict.\n\n\"Judge Lewis Kaplan has the authority to enter a conditional order of remittitur, compelling E. Jean Carroll to choose between a reduction of the verdict and a new trial if his court determines that the award is intrinsically excessive,\" she said.\n\nFor the award to be deemed excessive, Kaplan would have to find the amount greater than the amount a reasonable jury could have awarded.\n\n\"If that Motion for Remittitur is denied, it would still provide his attorneys with an opportunity to expand the Record on Appeal as nothing new can be introduced at the Appellate level-the Appellate Court's task is to look over Judge Kaplan's work and determine if he abused his discretion or erred as a matter of law in his rulings,\" Kerwick said.\n\nOverturning the verdict may prove difficult, Kerwick added.\n\n\"Judge Kaplan is very well respected by the Appellate Court and has himself sat by designation on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals so it is an uphill battle to overturn him.\"\n\nAnother approach may be to challenge the Adult Survivors Act, through which Carroll took her case.\n\nThe act allowed people in New York to file a lawsuit against an abuser or institution that protected the abuser-no matter when the assault took place, even if it's outside the statute of limitations.\n\n\"I would expect the appeal to hinge on whether the Adult Survivors Act violates the due process clauses of the constitution. Once a statute of limitations has run, the defense of that statute is a vested right and should not be taken away through legislative action,\" she said.\n\n\"If the sexual assault verdict falls on this ground, it would follow as a natural corollary that the defamation verdicts fall with it. It may be time for him to retain a more seasoned Appellate Counsel as sometimes it is the best lawyer, versus the interests of justice, which prevails.\"\n\nShe said Trump, frontrunner for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, has already challenged the act at the district court level and he may lose at the Second Circuit.\n\n\"This is a question that the U.S. Supreme Court may take up,\" she added.\n\nTrump, who had denied wrongdoing, was ordered to pay writer E. Jean Carroll $83.3 million in compensation and damages after a New York jury on Friday found that he had defamed her again in a second civil case .\n\nIn an earlier case, a separate jury concluded that Trump had sexually abused Carroll in a Manhattan department store during the 1990s, then defamed her character when she went public with the accusation. Carroll was awarded $5 million in damages, but the former president described the verdict as part of \"the greatest witch hunt of all time.\" Trump continued to criticize Carroll publicly, after which the New York writer launched a second defamation case .\n\nOn Friday, Trump was instructed to pay Carroll an additional $18.3 million in compensation along with $65 million in punitive damages. Reacting to the judgment on X, formerly Twitter , Carroll shared a New York Times article about her victory and wrote : \"ELATION!!!!\"\n\nTrump expressed his anger at the court's decision on his Truth Social website, posting: \"Absolutely ridiculous! I fully disagree with both verdicts, and will be appealing this whole Biden Directed Witch Hunt focused on me and the Republican Party.\" He added: \"Our Legal System is out of control, and being used as a Political Weapon.

Jean Carroll , on social media after the former president testified in court during the sexual assault defamation civil trial.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump once again denied that he abused or even knows the former Elle columnist. He also described the ongoing civil proceedings as a disgrace to the country.\n\n\"I don't even know who this woman is. I have no idea who she is, where she came from. This is another scam, it's a political witch hunt, and somehow we're going to have to fight this stuff,\" Trump said in a video message posted on Truth Social. \"We cannot let our country go into this abyss, this is disgraceful.\"\n\nTrump took to the witness stand in his defense on Thursday as part of Carroll's lawsuit saying the former president defamed her character in 2019 while denying that he sexually assaulted her at a Bergdorf Goodman store in New York in the 1990s. This lawsuit is different from a sexual battery and defamation suit which Carroll has already won against Trump, where a jury in May 2023 ruled Trump was liable for sexually abusing Carroll at the department store and then defaming her character while denying the incident occurred. The former president was ordered to pay Carroll $5 million in damages.\n\nJudge Lewis Kaplan, the judge who has presided over both the current and previous civil trial between Carroll and Trump, previously told the former president's lawyers they could not try and argue to the jury that the 2024 GOP frontrunner did not abuse the writer during the current proceedings.\n\nAs a result, Trump was limited in what he could say when he took to the stand on Thursday, and only answered a handful of questions . But, outside the court, the former president has frequently targeted Carroll on social media, sometimes posting about her dozens of times a day ahead of proceedings.\n\nIn the video posted on Truth Social, Trump also made reference to how his lawyers had tried to introduce evidence allegedly linking Carroll's legal bills to George Soros , the billionaire philanthropist who is often the target of Republican attacks and conspiracy theories over donations to Democratic and liberal causes. Kaplan rejected the request during Thursday's proceedings.\n\n\"You have a woman that's financed and lied about it, she totally lied about it, by Democrat operatives like just about the biggest one there is. And she said that wasn't true. They found that she lied about it,\" Trump added. \"And the judge wasn't even I guess letting it be put in as evidence. The whole thing is a scam, and it's a shame and it's a disgrace to our country.\"\n\nCourt documents have shown that Carroll's case against Trump has been funded by LinkedIn founder and Democratic donor Reid Hoffman, who had partnered with Soros to set up an organization battling disinformation. There is, however, no evidence to suggest that Soros has been involved in Carroll's case.\n\nCarroll's legal team has been contacted for comment via email.\n\nDuring his testimony, Trump was asked by his lawyer Alina Habba if he stood by the comments he made during his 2022 deposition, where he denied the assault took place, to which Trump replied \"100 percent.\"\n\nHabba directly asked if he denied the allegation from Carroll. Trump said he did and considered the claim a \"false accusation\" before he was cut off by the judge.\n\nHabba then asked if he ever instructed anyone to \"hurt Ms Carroll in your statements?\" while denying the sexual assault claims. Trump replied: \"No, I just wanted to defend myself, my family and, frankly, the presidency.\"\n\nDuring cross examination from Carroll's lawyers, Trump said that he did not attend the previous civil trial in 2023 involving himself and Carroll, as he was under no obligation to do so.\n\nKaplan ruled in September that Trump had defamed Carroll while denying that he sexually assaulted her, including suggesting she made up the attack to sell copies of her book. The current proceedings in New York are so the jury can determine how much Trump will have to pay Carroll in damages.\n\nCarroll is seeking at least $10 million from the former president.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nEwan Palmer is a Newsweek News Reporter based in London, U.K. His focus is reporting on US politics, and Florida news.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump posted a bond of nearly $92 million on Friday as he appeals the E. Jean Carroll defamation case.\n\nCarroll filed a lawsuit against Trump in 2019, claiming that Trump accused her of lying when she came forward with sexual assault allegations. She accused Trump in 2019 of raping her in a department store dressing room in the mid-1990s.\n\nA jury in a civil trial found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation last May in another defamation case that Carroll filed in 2022. The jury awarded Carroll $5 million.\n\nTrump has denied all wrongdoing in both lawsuits and claimed that they are politically motivated as he is the GOP front-runner in the 2024 presidential race. He continued to deny that he even knew Carroll, let alone sexually assaulted her, throughout a trial held in January to determine how much Trump would pay in damages in the 2019 lawsuit. The jury from the damages trial ordered Trump to pay Carroll $83.3 million .\n\nTrump's lawyers requested that the $83.3 million verdict be appealed. In order to prevent Carroll's lawyers from collecting the judgment in the meantime, he had to post a bond, according to MSNBC legal analyst Lisa Rubin.\n\nAccording to a court document filed on Friday, the former president posted a bond worth $91,630,000. The bond is greater than the judgment amount because, according to Rubin, typically, New York federal courts require 111 percent of the judgment amount to be posted.\n\n\"Due to the numerous prejudicial errors made at the lower level, we are highly confident that the Second Circuit will overturn this egregious judgment,\" Trump attorney Alina Habba told Newsweek via email on Friday.\n\nWhen Newsweek reached out to Carroll's lawyer via email on Friday, a representative responded: \"No comment.\"\n\nNewsweek also reached out to Trump's campaign via email for comment.\n\nTrump also tried to appeal the $5 million verdict from last May, but a federal judge upheld it last July.\n\nMinutes after the $83.3 million verdict was given on January 26, Trump called it \"absolutely ridiculous\" and blamed President Joe Biden .\n\nHe wrote on his social media platform Truth Social: \"I fully disagree with both verdicts, and will be appealing this whole Biden Directed Witch Hunt focused on me and the Republican Party. Our Legal System is out of control, and being used as a Political Weapon. They have taken away all First Amendment Rights. THIS IS NOT AMERICA!\"\n\nDuring an interview on ABC 's Good Morning America , Carroll's lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, said while sitting alongside Carroll that she is \"pretty confident\" that they will be able to collect the $83.3 million \"one way or the other.\"\n\n\"We might not get it right away. But one way or the other, he owns a lot of real estate. It can be sold. We will collect the judgment ,\" Kaplan said.\n\nTrump must also pay another $454 million by March 25 in a separate civil case brought on by New York Attorney General Letitia James. Judge Arthur Engoron found the former president liable for fraud last September, and in February, he ordered him to pay $355 million plus interest.

      "text": "Pay Up, Trump\n\nDonald Trump\n\nElizabeth Nolan Brown | 12.31.2024 9:53 AM\n\nTrump can't dodge damages payment. Donald Trump is still on the hook for a $5 million payment to writer E. Jean Carroll, who accused Trump of sexually assaulting and defaming her in a civil suit against the former and future president.\n\nIn 2023, a jury found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation and awarded Carroll $5 million in damages. (The jury did not find Trump liable for rape, an allegation Carroll also levied at Trump.) The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit has upheld that judgment.\n\nTrump's appeal argued that the lower court should not have allowed testimony by two women other than Carroll who say Trump sexually assaulted them and should not have allowed the jury to hear the Access Hollywood video in which Trump made his now infamous \"grab them by the pussy\" comment.\n\n\"We conclude that Mr. Trump has not demonstrated that the district court erred in any of the challenged rulings. Further, he has not carried his burden to show that any claimed error or combination of claimed errors affected his substantial rights as required to warrant a new trial,\" the ruling said.\n\nTrump maintains that the alleged 1996 rape in a Bergdorf Goodman department store never happened and that the case is part of a politicized witch hunt against him. \"The American People have re-elected President Trump with an overwhelming mandate, and they demand an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and a swift dismissal of all of the Witch Hunts, including the Democrat-funded Carroll Hoax, which will continue to be appealed,\" Steven Cheung, a spokesperson for Trump, said in a statement yesterday.\n\nCarroll was also awarded $83 million in a separate defamation case , this one revolving around comments Trump made about Carroll when he was president. Trump is also appealing that case.\n\nBiden's last-minute Ukraine cash surge. The Biden administration \"is sending nearly $2.5 billion in security assistance to Ukraine, as the Biden administration continues to rush military aid to Kyiv in the weeks before President-elect Donald J. Trump takes office,\" The New York Times reports .\n\n\"I've directed my administration to continue surging as much assistance to Ukraine as quickly as possible, including drawing down older U.S. equipment for Ukraine, rapidly delivering it to the battlefield and then revitalizing the U.S. defense industrial base to modernize and replenish our stockpiles with new weapons,\" President Joe Biden said in a Monday statement.\n\nThis comes in addition to the $3.4 billion in budget aid to Ukraine that the Treasury Department has just released. Those billions mark \"the final disbursement of funds appropriated under the bipartisan Ukraine Security Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2024.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Trump is trying to end the war between Ukraine and Russia-which has now been going on for almost three years-through his purported powers of negotiation. It's not going well .\n\nWhile Russia has yet to receive any official proposals from Trump, \"we are not happy, of course, with the proposals made by members of the Trump team to postpone Ukraine's admission to NATO for 20 years and to station British and European peacekeeping forces in Ukraine,\" said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in response to leaks of Trump's alleged proposals.\n\nFree the nipple: A federal judge has blocked Tennessee's Protect Tennessee Minors Act from going into effect , calling the measure unconstitutional. The law, which was supposed to take effect tomorrow, would have required age verification for adult websites. \"The First Amendment is not shy in its protective sweep,\" wrote Judge Sheryl H. Lipman in an order granting a request for a preliminary injunction against the law.\n\n\"To be sure, freedom of speech is not absolute. But the door preventing the state from intruding into this area 'must be kept tightly closed and opened only the slightest crack necessary' to promote state interests,\" wrote Lipman. \"Based on the record at this stage, it appears that Tennessee has wedged its foot in the door farther than the Constitution will likely tolerate.\"\n\n\"The Protect Tennessee Minors Act stands in a graveyard full of similar content-based restrictions at the state and federal level that lived-and died-before it,\" Lipman noted.\n\nMany of those proposed restrictions have been challenged by the Free Speech Coalition, an adult-industry trade group that brought this lawsuit. \"We applaud the Court's decision,\" said Free Speech Coalition Executive Director Alison Boden in a statement . \"This is a deeply flawed law that put website operators at risk of criminal prosecution for something a [ sic ] trivial as a mention of the human nipple.\"\n\nKentucky man killed by cop who accidentally showed up at his house. A 63-year-old man was killed in Kentucky when police serving a warrant to someone else accidentally went to his house instead.\n\nOfficers with the London City Police in Laurel County, Kentucky, \"mistakenly went to the wrong address while attempting to serve a search warrant,\" reports Local 12 Cincinnati. One of them ended up killing Douglas Harless, a resident of the house they mistakenly showed up at.\n\nAs usual with such situations-and how insane and terrible that there is a \"usual\" with such situations-the police seem to be trying to absolve themselves of wrongdoing by claiming that Harless pointed a gun at them. But pointing a gun at people who appear to be breaking into your house isn't exactly an unreasonable response.\n\nKentucky State Police are investigating and have not yet released body cam footage from the shooting.\n\nScenes from Ohio: The Columbus Dispatch remembers Ohio's Playboy Club , which at the time of its 1982 opening was one of eight Playboy Clubs in the country. Then-Coumbus Mayor Tom Moody reportedly said, in 1983, that \"the development of the Playboy Club in Columbus is good for this city. I expect to use my honorary key; I expect to take my wife there.\" It's hard to imagine a politician daring to say something like that today! Of course, not everyone was so welcoming:\n\n...the Columbus Playboy Club did meet with opposition from others who cited family values and anti-pornography campaigns as reasons to stop the club from opening. Some feminist groups organized against the club as well. In January 1983, feminist activists threw plastic bags full of red paint against the building and posted a 3-foot sign declaring that the Playboy Foundation \"offers women to the public as products not as humans.\"\n\nDespite the pushback, others beyond Mayor Moody were excited for the club to open. National Bunny Director Harriet Bassler reported receiving more than 3,000 applications from Columbus-area women hopeful to don the iconic satin suit, bunny ears and cotton tail. Ultimately, 30 women made the cut to become the club's Bunnies.\n\n• Yikes: Letting an inebriated customer go back to their hotel room could apparently be grounds for negligent homicide charges in Argentina.

      "text": "Second Circuit Panel Upholds E. Jean Carroll's $5M Win Against Donald Trump as to 1996 Sexual Abuse and 2022 Defamation\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nFree Speech\n\nEugene Volokh | 12.30.2024 1:15 PM\n\nThe short introduction from the 17,000-word Carroll v. Trump , decided today by Second Circuit Judges Denny Chin, Susan Carney, and Myrna Pérez:\n\nIn this case, after a nine-day trial, a jury found that plaintiff-appellee E. Jean Carroll was sexually abused by defendant-appellant Donald J. Trump at the Bergdorf Goodman department store in Manhattan in 1996. The jury also found that Mr. Trump defamed her in statements he made in 2022. The jury awarded Ms. Carroll a total of $5 million in compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nMr. Trump now appeals, contending that the district court (Lewis A. Kaplan, Judge ) erred in several of its evidentiary rulings. These include its decisions to admit the testimony of two women {Jessica Leeds and Natasha Stoynoff} who alleged that Mr. Trump sexually assaulted them in the past and to admit a recording of part of a 2005 conversation in which Mr. Trump described to another man how he kissed and grabbed women without first obtaining their consent. Mr. Trump contends that these and other asserted errors entitle him to a new trial.  {[As to those other errors], Mr. Trump argues that the district court unreasonably restricted his defense by precluding (1) evidence that some of Ms. Carroll's legal fees were being paid for by one of Mr. Trump's political opponents and (2) portions of a transcript made by Ms. Carroll of a 2020 interview between Ms. Carroll and Ms. Stoynoff that, Mr. Trump argues, suggests that Ms. Carroll coached Ms. Stoynoff on her testimony. Mr. Trump also asserts that the district court erred in preventing him from cross-examining Ms. Carroll on three matters: her out-of-court claim that she possessed Mr. Trump's DNA; her decision not to file a police report; and her failure to seek surveillance video footage from Bergdorf Goodman.}\n\nOn review for abuse of discretion, we conclude that Mr. Trump has not demonstrated that the district court erred in any of the challenged rulings. Further, he has not carried his burden to show that any claimed error or combination of claimed errors affected his substantial rights as required to warrant a new trial....\n\nI have little to say about the substance of the analysis, since it has to do with evidentiary issues that I generally don't follow; the opinion is available here , and is generally quite readable. (No part of the opinion deals with the substantive law of libel, which I do follow.) But here's what struck me as an interesting and relatively self-contained analysis as to the litigation funding question:\n\nThe facts established during the ensuing discovery confirmed that Ms. Carroll's case was taken on a contingency fee basis, and that, in September 2020, Ms. Carroll's counsel received outside funding from a nonprofit to help offset costs. There was no evidence to suggest that Ms. Carroll was personally involved in securing the funding, interacted with the funder, received an invoice showing the arrangement before or after her counsel received the outside funding, or had discussed the arrangement with anyone between learning of it in September 2020 and being deposed in October 2022.\n\nUpon consideration of this evidence, the district court granted Ms. Carroll's motion to preclude evidence and argument about the litigation funding in the case. The district court concluded:\n\nIn general, litigation funding is not relevant. Here I allowed very limited discovery against what seemed to me a remote but plausible argument that maybe something to do with litigation funding arguably was relevant to the credibility of one or two answers by this witness in her deposition. I gave the defense an additional deposition of the plaintiff, and I gave the defense limited document discovery.\n\nOn the basis of all that, I have concluded that there is virtually nothing there as to credibility. And even if there were, the unfair prejudicial effect of going into the subject would very substantially outweigh any probative value whatsoever.\n\nWe perceive no abuse of discretion here.\n\nFirst, district courts regularly exclude evidence of litigation financing ..., finding it \"irrelevant to credibility\" and that it \"does not assist the factfinder in determining whether or not the witness is telling the truth.\"\n\nSecond, the district court did not abuse its discretion in precluding cross-examination on this point because, as the district court found, Ms. Carroll's prior statement on the litigation funding was not sufficiently probative of her credibility. Ms. Carroll plausibly represented that she had forgotten about the limited outside funding counsel obtained in September 2020 when this question was first posed to her in 2022, and the additional discovery did not indicate otherwise. Rather, it showed that Ms. Carroll simply was not involved in the matter of who was or was not funding her litigation costs. Ms. Carroll testified that, after her counsel informed her in September 2020 that they had received some outside funding, she did not speak with her counsel about this topic again until the spring of 2023 and did not even know the funder's political position or why they were partially funding her lawsuit.\n\nTherefore, by the time of her deposition in October 2022, Ms. Carroll had not spoken with her counsel about the matter of outside funding for over two years. It was not an abuse of the district court's discretion to conclude that the available litigation-funding evidence would have little probative value compared to its potential for unfair prejudice....\n\nFor similar reasons, we conclude that extrinsic evidence of the litigation funding had minimal, if any, probative value on the issue of Ms. Carroll's bias and motive....\n\nTo the extent Mr. Trump argues that the acceptance of outside funding goes toward Ms. Carroll's motive in lodging these allegations at Mr. Trump, the discovery also confirmed that Ms. Carroll publicly accused Mr. Trump of sexual assault over a year before the outside litigation funding was secured. Moreover, whether the outside funder was politically opposed to Mr. Trump was of little probative value because Ms. Carroll herself frankly admitted her political opposition to Mr. Trump, and her key witnesses testified to their opposition as well. On multiple occasions, defense counsel was able to bring out the political opposition and distaste for Mr. Trump held by Ms. Carroll and her witnesses.\n\n{Mr. Trump separately argues that the district court also \"improperly restricted questioning and argument regarding [an attorney, George] Conway.\" Ms. Carroll testified at trial that about one month after she publicly accused Mr. Trump of sexually assaulting her, she attended a party where she met a lawyer named George Conway. Mr. Conway encouraged Ms. Carroll to seriously consider filing a lawsuit against Mr. Trump. The district court sustained an objection to portions of Mr. Trump's opening statement that concerned Mr. Conway on the ground that counsel was impermissibly arguing to the jury that Mr. Conway had recommended Ms. Carroll's counsel.\n\nEven if Mr. Conway's conversation with Ms. Carroll was somehow probative of bias, we find no error in the district court's ruling. Argument related to Ms. Carroll's choice of counsel had been ruled inadmissible pursuant to Ms. Carroll's unopposed motion in limine . Further, contrary to Mr. Trump's representation on appeal, defense counsel was permitted to meaningfully cross-examine Ms. Carroll about Mr. Conway. Ms. Carroll acknowledged that Mr. Conway had encouraged her to file the lawsuit, and defense counsel was able to argue these facts to the jury during summation.}\n\nIn light of the minimal probative value of the evidence, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding it under Rule 403 [which provides that \"a court may exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or more of the following: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence\"].\n\nRoberta A.

      "text": "8 Reasons Why E. Jean Carroll Won Her Sexual Abuse and Defamation Lawsuit Against Trump\n\nSexual Assault\n\nJacob Sullum | 5.10.2023 2:25 PM\n\nFour years ago, when former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll first publicly claimed that Donald Trump had raped her in a department store dressing room, she was not sure of the exact date or even the year when that happened. Her account, which described an assault that she said she had suffered more than two decades before, was not supported by direct evidence, eyewitnesses, or a police report. Yesterday a federal jury in Manhattan nevertheless accepted the gist of her accusation, although its $5 million judgment against Trump was based on sexual abuse rather than rape, plus the conclusion that Trump had defamed Carroll by calling her a liar.\n\nTrump's defenders dismissed the verdict as plainly irrational and politically motivated, suggesting that a fair assessment of Carroll's claims was more than could be expected in a city that overwhelmingly favored Trump's opponents in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections. \"In New York you can't get a fair trial,\" Trump's lawyer, Joseph Tacopina, complained . But there are several explanations for the outcome that do not hinge on assuming the jurors were so biased against Trump that they were determined to side with Carroll, regardless of what the evidence showed.\n\nFirst, this was a civil trial, meaning the verdict was supposed to be based on a preponderance of the evidence, as opposed to the much more demanding standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, which is required for a criminal conviction. The question for the jurors was whether it was more likely than not that Trump had sexually assaulted Carroll.*\n\nSecond, two of Carroll's friends, journalist Lisa Birnbach and former TV anchor Carol Martin, testified that she had told them about the incident shortly after it happened. In the spring of 1996, Birnbach said , she received a distraught phone call from Carroll, who described a rape that was consistent with the account that she gave in 2019 and during the trial . Martin described a contemporaneous in-person conversation during which Carroll said \"Trump attacked me\" but did not use the word rape .\n\nThird, two women, both of whom had previously told their stories publicly, testified that Trump had assaulted them, which Carroll's lawyers argued was part of a pattern. In the late 1970s, former stockbroker Jessica Leeds said , she was sitting next to Trump on a flight to New York when he \"decided to kiss me and grope me,\" putting his hand up her skirt. In late 2005, former People magazine reporter Natasha Stoynoff said , she visited Mar-a-Lago while working on a story about Trump's first year of marriage to his current wife, Melania. Stoynoff testified that Trump suddenly pushed her up against a wall and began kissing her, leaving her \"flustered and sort of shocked.\"\n\nFourth, Carroll's lawyers cited the notorious 2005 tape in which Trump bragged about grabbing women's genitals. \"You know, I'm automatically attracted to beautiful [women],\" he told Access Hollywood 's Billy Bush during that conversation, which came to light the month before the 2016 presidential election. \"I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.\" You can \"grab 'em by the pussy,\" he added. \"You can do anything.\"\n\nFifth, Trump did himself no favors during a deposition in which Carroll's lead lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, asked him about those remarks. \"Well, historically that's true with stars,\" he said. \"It's true with stars that they can grab women by the pussy?\" Kaplan asked. \"If you look over the last million years,\" Trump replied, \"I guess that's been largely true, not always, but largely true-unfortunately or fortunately.\" When Kaplan asked if Trump considered himself \"a star,\" he said, \"I think you can say that, yeah.\"\n\nSixth, Trump insisted that he did not know Carroll, despite photographic evidence that they had met, and his denial of her charges hinged largely on his claim that \"she's not my type\"-as if he could imagine behaving as Carroll claimed he had with a woman he found more attractive. Kaplan noted that when she showed Trump a picture of Carroll greeting him at a social event in the 1980s, he mistook her for Marla Maples, his second wife. \"The truth is that E. Jean Carroll, a former cheerleader and Miss Indiana, was exactly Donald Trump's type,\" Kaplan told the jury.\n\nSeventh, Tacopina argued that Carroll's accusation, which she first publicly lodged in a 2019 memoir that was excerpted in New York magazine, was financially and politically motivated. But the idea that she had suddenly invented the story to boost sales of her memoir was contradicted by Birnbach and Martin's testimony. And if Carroll's aim was to hurt Trump's prospects as a presidential candidate, you might think she would have made the accusation in 2016. Carroll said she did not initially report the assault because she worried about the consequences of accusing a wealthy and prominent man, which was consistent with the advice that Martin said she regretted giving her at the time. Carroll said she was emboldened to come forward by the #MeToo movement, which is consistent with the timing of her public account.\n\nEighth, although Trump complains that he was not allowed to present his side of the story, he chose not to take the stand or even attend the trial. Michael Ferrara, one of Carroll's lawyers, emphasized that point toward the end of the trial. \"He just decided not to be here,\" Ferrara told the jury. \"He never looked you in the eye and denied raping Ms. Carroll.\"\n\nThe jurors notably did not accept Carroll's characterization of her encounter with Trump as rape, which under New York law requires \"sexual intercourse,\" meaning penile penetration. But they did conclude it was more likely than not that Trump had \"sexually abused\" Carroll, which involves nonconsensual sexual contact, and \"forcibly touched\" her, which involves touching \"the sexual or other intimate parts of another person for the purpose of degrading or abusing such person, or for the purpose of gratifying the actor's sexual desire.\"\n\nTacopina argues that the distinction drawn by the jury makes the verdict \"strange.\" But you can also view it as a sign that the jurors were not as biased against Trump as his supporters claim and that they made a serious attempt to assess the evidence. While Birnbach's testimony supported the rape claim, for example, Martin's testimony was consistent with the characterization on which the jury settled.\n\nAlthough the jury heard only from Carroll, Leeds, and Stoynoff, nearly two dozen other women have publicly accused Trump of sexual assault or harassment. Several of them described behavior strikingly similar to what Trump has said a \"star\" like him can get away with. In light of that history, a fair-minded person might reasonably conclude that he probably did something like what Carroll described, even without the benefit of the evidence presented during the trial.\n\nAccording to Trump, of course, all of those women are lying. Like every other accusation against him, he says, their stories are part of a long-running Democratic \"witch hunt.\"\n\nEven after a jury concluded that Trump had defamed Carroll by calling her story \"a complete con job,\" \"a Hoax,\" and \"a lie,\" he was undeterred. \"I have no idea who this woman, who made a false and totally fabricated accusation, is,\" he wrote on Truth Social this morning.\n\n\"Somehow we're going to have to fight this stuff,\" Trump added . \"We cannot let our country go into this abyss. This is disgraceful.\"\n\nAs usual, Trump conflates the country's fate with his own. But he is right that the verdict against him is further evidence of something disgraceful, although not in the way he means.\n\n*Clarification: For Carroll's defamation claim, the standard was the intermediate \"clear and convincing evidence,\" both with regard to whether Trump's statements were false and with regard to whether he made them with \"actual malice.\"\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "The Trump v. ABC Defamation Decision That Led to the $15M Settlement\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nFree Speech\n\nEugene Volokh | 12.14.2024 9:20 PM\n\nFrom the July 24 opinion by Chief Judge Cecilia Altonaga (S.D. Fla.) that led to ABC's $15M (plus $1M in attorney fees plus an editor's note) settlement filed today:\n\nOn March 10, 2024, Stephanopoulos interviewed United States Representative Nancy Mace; ABC and ABC News broadcast the interview as part of the show This Week with George Stephanopoulos. In the interview, Stephanopoulos asked Mace about her endorsement of Plaintiff despite the fact he was \"found liable for rape\" [in E. Jean Carroll's civil case against him]. He repeated the phrase ten times during the interview, at one point stating \"[j]udges and two separate juries have found him liable for rape,\" and \"[t]he Judge affirmed that it was, in fact, rape.\" A screenshot of a newspaper headline stating that \"Judge clarifies: Yes, Trump was found to have raped E. Jean Carroll[,]\" was shown near the end of the broadcast....\n\nTrump sued, arguing that the jury had concluded he had not committed rape but had only committed sexual abuse; ABC argued that, in context, the jury in Carroll v. Trump must have concluded he committed digital penetration, which is a form of rape or in any event tantamount to rape. But Chief Judge Altonaga disagreed:\n\n\"Under the substantial truth doctrine, a statement does not have to be perfectly accurate if the 'gist' or the 'sting' of the statement is true.\" ...\n\n[In resolving this question], the Court is mindful of the specific setting in which the statements were made. Here, Stephanopoulos was not describing Plaintiff's actions or Carroll's testimony against him; he was describing the jury's verdict.\n\nThis distinguishes several of the cases Defendants cite. In those cases, courts concluded it is substantially true for publications to describe forced sexual contact as rape when reporting on the events themselves. See, e.g. , Moore v. Lowe (N.D. Ala. 2022) (concluding that it was substantially true to report that the plaintiff was accused of attempted rape, even if the statement would lead readers to believe he was accused of \"forced vaginal sex rather than forced oral sex\"); Nanji v. Nat'l Geographic Soc. (D. Md. 2005) (concluding it was not inaccurate to \"use [] the term 'rape' as shorthand for sexual misconduct\" when recounting \"the abundance of sexual misconduct evidence in the public records\").\n\nMore to the point, Defendants also cite cases finding substantial truth can arise when describing charges of forced sexual contact as charges for rape. Yet, these cases all involved underlying law that seemingly did not distinguish between rape and other forced sex crimes. See, e.g. , Simonson v. United Press Int'l, Inc. (7th Cir. 1981) (noting \"that 'rape' as defined by common usage is incorporated into second-degree sexual assault under Wisconsin law\"); Hovey v. Iowa State Daily Pub. Bd., Inc. (Iowa 1985) (citing Simonson and noting that \"[t]he definition of the crime of rape provided by the criminal law of Iowa was subsumed into the crime of sexual abuse with the adoption of the new Iowa Criminal Code\"); Moore (noting, without addressing, the defendant's argument that forced oral sex constituted rape under Alabama law).\n\nHere, of course, New York has opted to separate out a crime of rape; and Stephanopoulos's statements dealt not with the public's usage of that term, but the jury's consideration of it during a formal legal proceeding. Thus, while Defendants' cited cases are compelling, they are not directly responsive to the issue of whether it is substantially true to say a jury (or juries) found Plaintiff liable for rape by a jury despite the jury's verdict expressly finding he was not liable for rape under New York Penal Law.\n\nTo the contrary, one of Defendants' cited cases suggests Florida courts do not consider legal definitions to be mere formalities in this context. See Clark (determining that use of the term \"rape\" to describe an arrest for sexual battery \" in the absence of formal legal charges is [ ] not defamatory\"). The Court thus cannot definitively say it was substantially true to report on the (single) jury's verdict in Carroll II -which did not find Plaintiff liable for rape as that term is defined under New York law-as finding Plaintiff liable for rape.\n\nCertainly, Defendants' theory has one credible supporter: Judge Kaplan, who repeatedly determined that the jury's verdict-regardless of its finding that no rape as defined by New York's Penal Law had occurred-amounted to a finding of liability for rape as rape is commonly understood. As explained, however, Judge Kaplan's findings do not have preclusive effect here. The Court is thus only persuaded that substantial truth would arise if the jury's verdict of \"No\" was presented in combination with Judge Kaplan's additional findings. The Court considers that aspect of Defendants' arguments now, considering the allegedly defamatory segment in its entirety and in context, from the perspective of a reasonable viewer.\n\nUnder that standard, a reasonable jury could interpret Stephanopoulos's statements as defamatory. Stephanopoulos's exchange with Mace lasted about ten minutes, during which Stephanopoulos stated ten times that a jury-or juries-had found Plaintiff liable for rape. In fact, of course, the Carroll II jury did not find Plaintiff liable for rape under New York Penal Law; it was Judge Kaplan who determined that the jury's verdict amounted to liability for rape. Yet, none of these particularities make it into the segment such that a reasonable viewer would have indisputably understood what Defendants now brief in detail.\n\nInstead, at one point, Stephanopoulos asked to display a screenshot of a newspaper article about Judge Kaplan's findings and stated that \"the Judge affirmed that it was, in fact, rape.\" This ostensible \"clarification\" occurred late in the segment and did not include any further explanation; viewers were simply treated to a ten-second glimpse of a headline and partially blurred text, with no mention of Judge Kaplan by name or any description of why his description of the verdict differed from the jury's actual verdict as recounted by Mace. On this record, the Court finds that the segment is, at least, \"confusing or ambiguous\" and susceptible to defamatory interpretation.\n\nOnce again, the Court does not find that a reasonable jury must-or even is likely to-conclude Stephanopoulos's statements were defamatory. A jury may, upon viewing the segment, find there was sufficient context. A jury may also conclude Plaintiff fails to establish other elements of his claim. See Readon v. WPLG, LLC (Fla. 3d DCA 2021) (\"The First Amendment safeguards publishers from defamation suits brought by public figures unless the publisher acts with actual malice.\" (citations omitted)). But a reasonable jury could conclude Plaintiff was defamed and, as a result, dismissal is inappropriate.\n\nFor much the same reason, Chief Judge Altonaga also rejected defendants' fair report privilege arguments, which applies only to substantially accurate reports of court proceedings.\n\nTrue, the fair report privilege absolves the media of the burden to be \"technically precise\" in their descriptions of legal proceedings. But the privilege does not protect media where the omission of important context renders a report misleading. See Dershowitz v. Cable News Network, Inc. (S.D. Fla. 2021) (rejecting the application of the fair report privilege, where playing a partial video clip, as opposed to the full video, \"presented an official proceeding in a misleading manner\"). Here, a reasonable viewer-especially one who was aware that Plaintiff had been charged with rape under New York Penal Law-could have been misled by Stephanopoulos's statements, which did not include the jury's original findings and only fleetingly referenced the interpretation Judge Kaplan later offered.\n\nThere's a lot more in the opinion , including a juicy (is there any other kind?) collateral estoppel issue. The settlement also obligates ABC to add an editor's note saying that \"ABC News and George Stephanopoulos regret\" the statements about Trump.

Trump (S.D.N.Y.):\n\nThis is a defamation case brought by writer E. Jean Carroll against President Donald Trump, as he then was, for statements Mr. Trump made in June 2019 shortly after Ms. Carroll publicly accused him of sexual assault. In those statements, Mr. Trump denied Ms. Carroll's accusation, stated that he \"has no idea who this woman is,\" and suggested that she fabricated her accusation for ulterior and improper purposes, including to increase sales of her then-forthcoming book in which she discusses having been sexually assaulted by Mr. Trump and other men.\n\nIn a second and very closely related case (\" Carroll II \"), Ms. Carroll sued Mr. Trump for the alleged sexual assault itself and for defamation based on a statement that Mr. Trump published on his social media platform in October 2022 that was substantially similar to his June 2019 statements. That case was tried in April and May 2023. The jury unanimously found that Mr. Trump had sexually abused Ms. Carroll and defamed her in his October 2022 statement. It awarded Ms. Carroll a total of $5 million in compensatory and punitive damages: $2.02 million for her sexual assault claim, and $2.98 million for her defamation claim.\n\nIn this case (\" Carroll I \"), Ms. Carroll seeks damages and other relief for defamation for Mr. Trump's June 2019 statements only. The matter now is before me on Mr. Trump's motion for summary judgment dismissing the action on four grounds:\n\nHis arguments are without merit....\n\nRoberta Kaplan, Michael Ferrara, Shawn Crowley, Trevor W.

Jean Carroll for damaging her reputation after she accused him of sexual assault. A separate jury last year awarded Carroll $5 million from Trump for sexual abuse and defamation.\n\nAdd interest payments on top of that and the judgments could deal a staggering blow to the personal fortune that remains core to Trump's political appeal. He has adamantly denied wrongdoing and pledged to appeal, a process that could take months or even years.\n\nIn the meantime, here's what we know about what Trump owes, whether he'll have to pay up, and what comes next:\n\nThe verdict in the civil fraud trial requires Trump to pay interest on some of the deal profits he has been ordered to give up. New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought the case, said the interest payments totaled $99 million and would \"continue to increase every single day until it is paid.\"\n\nBetween Friday's ruling and the two judgments in Carroll's case, Trump would be on the hook for about $542 million in legal judgments.\n\nTrump owes another $110,000 for refusing to comply with a subpoena in the civil fraud case and $15,000 for repeatedly disparaging the judge's law clerk in violation of a gag order. As part of Friday's ruling, the judge also ordered both of Trump's sons to pay $4 million apiece.\n\nTrump's court-ordered debts don't end there. Last month, he was ordered to pay nearly $400,000 in legal fees to The New York Times after suing the newspaper unsuccessfully. He is currently appealing a judgment of $938,000 against him and his attorney for filing what a judge described as a \"frivolous\" lawsuit against Hillary Clinton.\n\nIt's not uncommon for the size of judgments, particularly high-dollar amounts, to be reduced on appeals.\n\nThe appeal in Trump's civil fraud case will go before an intermediate-level court first. If it returns an unfavorable ruling, Trump could try to get the case taken up by New York's top appellate court, though legal experts say that is unlikely.\n\nTrump has already deposited $5 million owed to Carroll for the first defamation case into a court-controlled account, along with an additional $500,000 in interest required by New York law. Carroll will not have access to the funds until the appeals process plays out.\n\nHe may soon be forced to do the same for the $83.3 million judgment in the second Carroll verdict. Alternatively, he could secure a bond and pay only a portion up front - though that option would come with interest and fees and likely require some form of collateral. Trump would have to find a financial institution willing to front him the money.\n\nIn the civil fraud case, it will be up to the courts to decide how much Trump must put up as he mounts his appeal. And he may be required to pay the full sum immediately after the appellate court rules, which could come as soon as this summer, according to University of Michigan law professor Will Thomas.\n\n\"New York's judicial system has shown a willingness to move quickly on some of these Trump issues,\" Thomas said. \"When we hear from the first appellate court, that's a point where money is almost certainly going to change hands.\"\n\nTrump has claimed he's worth over $10 billion. Most estimates, including an assessment by the New York attorney general, put that figure closer to $2 billion.\n\nIn his 2021 statement of financial condition, Trump said he had just under $300 million in \"cash and cash equivalents.\" He has since made a number of sales, including his New York golf course and his Washington, D.C., hotel, and may also soon get a windfall when his social media company, Truth Social, goes public.\n\nBut even with those income streams, it's unclear whether Trump and his family members have enough cash on hand to pay all the money they now owe.\n\nFederal election law prohibits the use of campaign funds for personal use. But the rules are far murkier when it comes to tapping political action committees - or PACs - for a candidate's expenses.\n\nOver the last two years, Trump's Save America political action committee, his presidential campaign and his other fundraising organizations have devoted $76.7 million to legal fees. Campaign finance experts expect Trump will try to spend PAC money to defray the cost of his judgments in some way.\n\n\"The likelihood of the Federal Election Commission in its current configuration pursuing these violations is not terribly great,\" said Daniel Weiner, director of the Brennan Center's Elections and Government Program.\n\nUnder the judge's ruling Friday, Trump would still be liable to pay even if the Trump Organization declares bankruptcy. If Trump personally declared bankruptcy, the enforcement of the judgment against him would be paused. But political commenters say such a drastic step is unlikely.\n\nDespite the fact that several of his previous companies have gone bankrupt, Trump has repeatedly bragged about the fact that he has never, personally, declared bankruptcy.\n\nLegally, Trump would face the same consequences as any American refusing to pay a legal judgment, including the possibility of having his assets seized and his wages garnished.\n\n\"The president is not a king and the president's assets are not sacrosanct just because he happened to be the president,\" Weiner said.\n\nOn Friday, the judge overseeing Trump's civil fraud case appointed an additional monitor to oversee the Trump Organization's finances, finding they could not be trusted to follow the law. In the event that Trump refused to hand over payments, the courts would have additional discretion to go after Trump and his businesses.\n\n\"They have a huge amount of power particularly for someone like Trump who has physical assets inside the state,\" Thomas, the law professor, said. \"The court might say we're going to freeze your bank account. Or even worse, they could say, 'We're seizing Trump Tower and we're putting it up for sale.'\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

      "text": "Jury Finds Trump Liable for Sexual Abuse and Defamation of Writer E. Jean Carroll\n\nDonald Trump\n\nElizabeth Nolan Brown | 5.10.2023 9:40 AM\n\nE. Jean Carroll awarded $5 million in civil case against Trump. More than a dozen women have accused President Donald Trump of inappropriate sexual conduct, including numerous allegations of sexual harassment and assault. Now, for the first time, a jury has found Trump guilty of one of these claims. On Tuesday, a Manhattan jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing and defaming writer E. Jean Carroll.\n\nCarroll accused Trump of raping her in a department store dressing room in the 1990s. Trump called the allegation \"a complete con job\" and \"a lie.\"\n\nThe jury did not find Trump guilty of rape, but did find him guilty of sexual abuse and defamation. Carroll was awarded $5 million in damages in the civil court case.\n\n\"It was not clear why jurors chose the lesser offense of abuse over rape,\" notes The New York Times . \"Sexual abuse is defined in New York as subjecting a person to sexual contact without consent. Rape is defined under state law as sexual intercourse without consent that involves any penetration of the penis in the vaginal opening.\"\n\nNonetheless, Carroll seems satisfied with the verdict. \"I filed this lawsuit against Donald Trump to clear my name and to get my life back,\" she said in a statement . \"Today, the world finally knows the truth. This victory is not just for me but for every woman who has suffered because she was not believed.\"\n\nIn a Truth Social post, Trump responded \"I have absolutely no idea who this woman is. This verdict is a disgrace-a continuation of the greatest witch hunt of all time!\"\n\nOpinions are mixed on whether the jury's finding will hurt Trump politically.\n\n\"In a better world it would matter, but in the debased and polarized American politics of 2023, it may not,\" writes the Wall Street Journal editorial board, expressing some skepticism that this case was brought for the right reasons:\n\nYet if most Republicans dismiss the verdict as one more political assault, Mr. Trump's opponents and the press have themselves to blame. ... This lawsuit, like the two impeachments and the recent Alvin Bragg indictment that stretches the law, seems less an attempt to get at the truth than to find some way, any way, to disqualify him from ever becoming President again. Voters don't like being told that a man they elected should be disqualified by members of the opposite party or the press.\n\nMeanwhile, at The New York Times , David French dismisses the idea that the case was simply a matter of \"he said, she said\":\n\nCarroll provided her own testimony, of course. But she also presented evidence that she had told others about the assault at the time, as well as evidence from other women that Trump had assaulted them and touched them without their consent.\n\nTrump declined to testify at the trial, but the jury did see his videotaped deposition , during which he denied Carroll's claims but also doubled down on his assertions in the infamous \" Access Hollywood\" video . \"I just start kissing them,\" he said on the tape, \"It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.\" He added: \"Grab 'em by the [genitals]. You can do anything.\"\n\nIn the deposition, Carroll's lawyer, Roberta A. Kaplan, asked Trump specifically about that quote. \"Well, historically, that's true with stars,\" he responded. When she pressed him, he doubled down: \"Well, that's what-if you look over the last million years, I guess that's been largely true,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Not always, but largely true. Unfortunately or fortunately.\"\n\nI spent decades litigating cases, including a number of sexual harassment cases, and as I watched the evidence accumulate, I reached a tipping point-I would have been surprised by any verdict other than the one we received Tuesday.\n\nBut French is still skeptical that the result will make a difference to Republican voters.\n\nThe BBC talked to nine Republican female voters and found \"his strongest supporters echoed Mr Trump's claim that he is the victim of a witch hunt,\" while \"others said the verdict was further evidence that the party needs to find an alternative in 2024.\"\n\n\"Republicans challenging former President Donald Trump for the 2024 nomination were divided Tuesday after the 76-year-old was found liable for sexual abuse and defamation ,\" notes the New York Post .\n\nA number of Senate Republicans expressed concern that the verdict would affect Trump's electability. \"You never liked to hear that a former president has been found-in a civil court-guilty of those types of actions,\" said South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds.\n\nRepublican strategist Rick Tyler suggested the verdict would matter little to strong Trump supporters but could be bad news for Trump when it comes to swing voters, \"making him unelectable in the general.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden is now considering invoking the 14th Amendment to declare limits on U.S. government debt illegal. Last week, Biden said he had \"not gotten there yet\" but would not rule this extraordinary measure out, as a standoff between Republicans and Democrats over raising the debt ceiling persists. On Tuesday, he told reporters \"I have been considering the 14th Amendment.\" Noting that it would face litigation, he added: \"I'm thinking about taking a look at-months down the road-to see what the court would say about whether or not it does work.\"\n\nWikipedia won't comply with U.K. age verification proposal. The U.K.'s massive Online Safety Bill \"will touch on almost every aspect of online life in Britain,\" notes The Guardian . The bill is currently before Parliament. As part of its requirements, websites must have \"proportionate systems and processes\" designed to prevent minors from encountering harmful content, internet and telecoms lawyer Neil Brown told BBC News. In some cases, this means websites must verify user ages.\n\nBut age verification would \"violate our commitment to collect minimal data about readers and contributors,\" the Wikimedia Foundation's Rebecca MacKinnon told the BBC. \"The Wikimedia Foundation will not be verifying the age of UK readers or contributors,\" she said.\n\nTechdirt has more details about the Online Safety Bill and its issues here . \"The UK government still hopes to bend the internet to its will , but it's constantly finding out it won't be as easy as just declaring a bunch of stuff illegal,\" Mike Masnick writes:\n\nThe usual suspects have been cited in support of ruining the internet: hate speech, [child pornography], etc. While the proposed measures might have some immediately noticeable effect, those effects will likely be limited to showboat-y, ineffectual fining of non-compliant tech companies, perhaps with a few threats of prosecution thrown into the mix.\n\nNotably, the bill targets tech companies , rather than those engaging in the activities the UK government wants to see eradicated. Tech companies are pushing back, though. Some of the biggest providers of encrypted communication services have already told the UK government they'll exit the British market , rather than make their offerings less secure.\n\nIt's not just encryption being targeted by the UK government. The government is also demanding service providers collect and retain more information about their users, supposedly to ensure the proverbial children aren't exposed to content above their pay age grade.\n\nA new Department of Energy rule will make manufactured homes less affordable , the Wall Street Journal editorial board warns :\n\nSome 22 million Americans live in manufactured homes, often called mobile homes, and their median household income is $35,000 a year. The average cost of a manufactured home ranges from $72,000 to $132,000, compared to $365,000 for a traditional house. Manufactured homes were about 9% of new single-family home starts in 2021, providing more than 100,000 affordable homes.\n\nYet they are also the only single-residence housing entirely regulated by the federal government, in part because they are transported around the country after factory production. The Department of Housing and Urban Development for decades oversaw construction, safety and efficiency standards for the units, but in 2007 House Democrats gave the Energy Department power to impose energy-efficiency mandates.\n\nEnter Jennifer Granholm's Energy Department, which last year unveiled a rule that condensed a decade of incremental efficiency rules into one turbocharged mandate. The low-cost manufactured home industry will be subject to standards that far surpass those applied to homes built on lots.\n\nThe result could be thousands of dollars tacked on to the cost of new mobile homes.\n\nIt's yet another way U.S. regulations are driving up the cost of housing. In so many ways, this country makes small or atypical housing arrangements illegal or more expensive-and folks wonder why we have such a large homeless population .\n\nWe get so worried that housing meets certain standards or preferences that we overlook the fact that tiny, crowded, or otherwise less desirable housing is better than no housing at all, a paradox Matthew Yglesias tackled in a Slow Boring post last year. Yglesias notes that mid-20th century, housing in which adults shared rooms was not uncommon, though it is today:\n\nThis decline in housing crowding is in part a triumph. Our society has gotten richer, our homes have gotten much larger on average, and material living standards have improved.\n\nBut in addition to reducing housing crowding through economic growth, the United States has also waged a multi-faceted war against the legality of small dwellings, with boarding houses and single-room occupancy (SRO) hotels driven out by zoning codes. But rather than improve life for those who would have previously lived in these accommodations, the move has largely shifted people into homeless shelters or sleeping on the street. As long as the unhoused are in shelters, they are largely out of sight out of mind as far as the electorate is concerned. But a mix of objective scarcity of shelter space and rising drug addiction has helped increase the number of visibly homeless people sleeping rough in American urban centers.\n\nA barebones boarding house or hotel room may not be anyone's ideal,\n\nbut it is a lot better than sleeping in a car or in a tent. And an accommodation that you actually pay for and rent has considerable advantages over a shelter. It's your space on your terms and you can keep your stuff there.\n\nA market in low-end housing, as opposed to a network of nonprofit- or government-operated shelters also accounts for the fact that tastes and preferences differ. Some people might prefer to stay in an [single-room occupancy] with very strict rules as a way to protect themselves from disorder and nuisance. Others might prefer much laxer rules so they could indulge in alcohol or other private vices.\n\n• \"Working Minnesotans would be guaranteed up to 20 weeks of paid time off to care for a baby, loved one, or their own medical issues under legislation that narrowly passed the state Senate Monday,\" reports Axios . \"A .7% payroll tax, split between employers and employees, would fund the program.\"\n\n• The latest Washington Post-ABC News poll finds two-thirds of those surveyed support keeping the abortion drug mifepristone legal .\n\n• Rep.

      "text": "Given George Stephanopoulos' Carelessness, ABC's Defamation Settlement With Trump Seems Prudent\n\nDefamation\n\nJacob Sullum | 12.16.2024 5:35 PM\n\nIn an interview with Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) on ABC's This Week last March, host George Stephanopoulos repeatedly and inaccurately asserted that Donald Trump, now the president-elect, had been \"found liable for rape.\" A week later, Trump sued ABC and Stephanopoulos for defamation in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, noting that a jury had deemed Trump civilly liable for \"sexual abuse,\" not \"rape.\" Over the weekend, ABC News announced that it had reached a $15 million settlement with Trump in the form of a contribution to Trump's presidential library. ABC also agreed to cover $1 million in Trump's legal expenses.\n\nThe settlement is highly unusual in the annals of Trump's many lawsuits against news outlets, which typically feature claims with a much weaker legal and empirical basis. Some Trump critics explicitly or implicitly faulted ABC for folding, saying its decision is apt to have a chilling impact on journalism. But any such threat can be mitigated by applying normal standards of journalistic care-standards that Stephanopoulos conspicuously failed to uphold in this case.\n\nIn his interview with Mace, Stephanopoulos was talking about two cases involving the journalist E. Jean Carroll's allegation that Trump sexually assaulted her in a department store dressing room in the mid-1990s. In one case, a New York jury last year concluded that Carroll had proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Trump had \"sexually abused\" her. The jurors also agreed that Trump had defamed Carroll by calling her a liar and awarded her $5 million in damages. But they expressly concluded that Carroll had failed to prove Trump had \"raped\" her.\n\nWhat's the difference? At the time of the verdict against Trump, New York defined \"sexual abuse\" as \"sexual contact...by forcible compulsion.\" A rape charge, by contrast, required \"sexual intercourse,\" which was limited to \"vaginal penetration by a penis.\" A bill that New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed into law last January broadened the definition of \"rape\" to include any \"nonconsensual vaginal, oral and anal sexual contact.\" But when the jury issued its verdict in May 2023, the narrower definition of \"rape\" still applied.\n\nIn a related case, Carroll alleged that Trump's post-verdict comments had defamed her by continuing to portray her as a liar. Last January, a jury awarded Carroll $83.3 million in compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nNeither verdict found Trump \"liable for rape\" as that term was legally defined at the time. And as Trump's defamation complaint notes, Stephanopoulos was aware of that point.\n\nAfter the first verdict, Stephanopoulos interviewed Carroll on Good Morning America . \"Yesterday in the courtroom,\" he said, \"the first announcement was made, and it was that he was not found liable for rape. What were you thinking at that moment?\" During the interview, Trump's lawsuit notes, the on-screen banner said (accurately), \"Former President Found Liable for Sexual Abuse & Defamation.\" ABC later \"posted a clip of the interview on its website\" accompanied by the (accurate) summary, \"Longtime advice columnist E. Jean Carroll said she feels 'fantastic' one day after a jury found former President Donald Trump liable for battery and defamation in her lawsuit against him.\"\n\nOn the February 4, 2024, edition of This Week , Stephanopoulos again accurately noted (twice) that \"juries have found [Trump] liable for sexual assault and defamation.\" Yet five weeks later, when Stephanopoulos interviewed Mace, he claimed no fewer than 12 times that Trump had been deemed liable for \"rape.\"\n\nAfter the interview aired, according to Trump's complaint, his lawyers \"contacted Defendants seeking a retraction of the false and defamatory statements made during the Interview as well as an apology for making the false and defamatory statements.\" But ABC \"did not issue an apology, did not issue a retraction, and did not direct or request that that Stephanopoulos correct the various defamatory and false statements he made during his show.\"\n\nABC \"instead modified the headline of a related article from 'Nancy Mace defends her support for Trump after he was found liable for rape' to 'Nancy Mace defends her support for Trump after he was found liable for sexual assault.'\" The article itself, however, continued to quote \"Stephanopoulos' false statements.\"\n\nAs a public figure, Trump would have had to prove that Stephanopoulos made those statements with \"actual malice,\" meaning he knew they were false or made them with reckless disregard as to whether they were true. \"Given Stephanopoulos' knowledge of the actual verdicts,\" the complaint argues, \"and given his vast experience as a journalist, his repeated statements that Plaintiff was found liable for rape were false, intentional, malicious and designed to cause harm.\"\n\nIn its motion to dismiss the lawsuit last May, ABC argued that Stephanopoulos spoke truthfully, if roughly, when he said Trump had been \"found liable for rape.\" When Trump sued Carroll for defamation, ABC noted, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan ruled that her statements about his conduct \"were at least 'substantially true'\" because \"the jury's finding that Mr. Trump 'sexually abused' Ms. Carroll implicitly determined that he forcibly penetrated her digitally-in other words, that Mr. Trump in fact did 'rape' Ms. Carroll as that term commonly is used and understood in contexts outside of the New York Penal Law.\"\n\nIn rejecting ABC's motion to dismiss last July, however, U.S. District Court Judge Cecilia Altonaga held that, notwithstanding Kaplan's view, \"a reasonable jury could interpret Stephanopoulos's statements as defamatory.\" That does not necessarily mean Trump would have prevailed if the case had gone to trial. But Trump's argument in this case certainly is more credible than the legal claims he has made in other lawsuits against news outlets.\n\nIn 2022, for example, Trump sued CNN, arguing that its description of his stolen-election fantasy as \"the Big Lie\" was defamatory. In a lawsuit he filed last October, Trump is seeking $10 billion in damages from CBS because he did not like the way 60 Minutes edited an interview with Vice President Kamala Harris. By making her seem more cogent than she really was, the lawsuit implausibly claims, CBS violated the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act .\n\nUnlike such frivolous cases, the defamation lawsuit against ABC and Stephanopoulos alleged facts that might persuade a reasonable jury to side with Trump. And the lawsuit could have been avoided if Stephanopoulos had spoken more carefully or if ABC had conceded that he should have.\n\nDespite that reality, MSNBC legal analyst Barbara McQuade seems to think ABC should have kept fighting. \"ABC actually had a very strong case, but chose to settle,\" she said on Saturday. \"I do worry about the effect this could have on others and the chilling effect it might have on people who otherwise would be critical of Donald Trump.\"\n\nElection lawyer Marc Elias, founder of Democracy Docket , had a stronger take : \"Knee bent. Ring kissed. Another legacy news outlet chooses obedience.\"\n\nDefamation attorney Ken Turkel, speculating about why ABC decided to settle now instead of \"preparing for summary judgment to challenge the legal sufficiency of [Trump's] claim,\" similarly suggested to CNN's Brian Stelter that \"perhaps they didn't want to be actively litigating against a sitting president.\" But Turkel also wondered whether ABC worried that internal communications obtained during discovery might have made it look even worse that it already did.\n\nConservative commentator Eric Erickson also thinks that explanation is plausible. \"Unlike some of the journalists commenting, I not only practiced law, but represented a newspaper and television station, working under a very skilled partner who did First Amendment law,\" he wrote on X Sunday morning. \"No, a $15 million settlement is not the cost of doing business. It is avoiding discovery.\"\n\nThe venerable First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams told Stelter a settlement of \"this magnitude\" is \"disturbing.\" But he noted that \"the case undoubtedly posed a genuine level of risk for ABC since George Stephanopoulos had inaccurately summarized the jury verdict as one in which the jury had found Trump liable for rape when it had instead found him liable for 'sexual abuse' and not rape.\"\n\nAs part of the settlement, ABC appended a note to its March 10 story about the Mace interview: \"ABC News and George Stephanopoulos regret statements regarding President Donald J. Trump made during an interview by George Stephanopoulos with Rep. Nancy Mace on ABC's This Week on March 10, 2024.\" The story still includes Stephanopoulos' assertion that Trump was \"found liable for rape,\" which accurately reflects what he said but not what the jury actually found.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "E. Jean Carroll's $83 Million Verdict, Explained\n\nHow likely is the verdict to stand?\n\nA federal jury awarded E. Jean Carroll more than $80 million last month in her defamation lawsuit against former President Donald Trump. The path to that verdict was anything but straightforward, thanks to claims presented in two separate but related lawsuits.\n\nThe strikingly different verdicts returned by the two juries raise a question: Will the second, $83 million verdict be reduced?\n\nWhat prompted Carroll's first lawsuit?\n\nThe basis for Carroll's initial lawsuit was that in late 1995 or early 1996, Carroll, then a 52-year-old journalist, TV commentator, and advice columnist for Elle magazine, encountered Donald J. Trump, then a 49-year-old businessman, in the Bergdorf Goodman department store in New York City. After some banter about shopping advice from the \"advice lady\" and which one of them would try on an item of ladies' lingerie, Trump suddenly pushed Carroll against a wall in an unoccupied dressing room and forcibly sexually assaulted her, penetrating her vagina with both a finger and his penis, she later testified .\n\nCarroll did not go public with her accusations until June 2019, when New York magazine published an excerpt from her then-upcoming book, What Do We Need Men For? , that featured a detailed account of the assault. Trump, who was by then more than halfway through his term as president, responded later the same day and in the ensuing days, publicly denying that he had ever even met Carroll, and charging that she had fabricated the story to increase book sales and advance a political agenda.\n\nIn November 2019, Carroll sued Trump in state court in New York. The suit, referred to as Carroll I , sought damages for defamation only, because a suit for assault and battery had long been barred by the applicable statute of limitations. The following September, while Donald Trump was still president, the Department of Justice asked to \"remove\" the case from state court to the United States District for the Southern District of New York, asserting that it was really a suit against the United States since speaking to the public and the media on matters of public concern were within the scope of Trump's employment as a government official.\n\nWhen a case is removed from state to federal court, there is a change of courthouses only, not the applicable law. Accordingly, when Carroll I was eventually assigned to Senior Judge Lewis Kaplan, he based his later rulings in the case on New York rather than federal law.\n\nWhat led to Carroll's second lawsuit?\n\nLitigation over who was the proper defendant (as well as whether Donald Trump could claim immunity from the suit) continued well into 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, in October 2022, Trump-by this time out of the White House and back to being a private citizen-published a lengthy post on Truth Social doubling down on his verbal attacks on Carroll. He referred to Carroll I as the \"Ms. Bergdorf Goodman case,\" and said it was \"a complete con job,\" a hoax, and a lie. He tripled down by saying in a deposition that Carroll was a \"nut job,\" and again denying that he had met her or even knew who she was before the first suit was filed.\n\nOn November 24, 2022, Carroll filed her second defamation suit, referred to as Carroll II, in federal court. Suing in federal court at the outset was appropriate this time, because Carroll was still a New Yorker, while defendant Trump had become a resident of Florida. In such a \"diversity of citizenship\" case, New York state law rather than federal law would again apply. The second Carroll v. Trump case was also assigned to Judge Kaplan.\n\nBecause of a recently enacted New York statute, the Adult Survivors Act (ASA), there was a major substantive difference between Carroll I and Carroll II . The ASA, signed into law by Gov. Kathy Hochul in 2022, created a one-year \"lookback\" window that allowed plaintiffs to file civil claims for sexual assault for which the statute of limitations had already expired. In her second lawsuit, therefore, Carroll was able to sue Trump for both the 2022 defamation and the 1996 sexual assault, in federal court but under New York law.\n\nWhat was the verdict in Carroll II ?\n\nWith Carroll I still tied up in satellite litigation, Carroll II was tried first, beginning on April 25, 2023. On May 9, 2023, after three hours of deliberation, the anonymous nine-person jury delivered a unanimous \" special verdict \"-written answers to a series of narrow and logically sequenced questions that Judge Kaplan had posed. These answers showed that the jury had found at least these facts: 1) During the Bergdorf Goodman incident, Trump penetrated Carroll's vagina with one or more of his fingers; 2) Carroll did not consent to this penetration; and 3) Trump's assertions in 2022 that Carroll had fabricated her entire account was false, and Trump knew it was false.\n\nAlthough the jury had not been convinced that Trump had penetrated Carroll with his penis (which would constitute rape under New York law), its special verdict meant that she had prevailed on both of her substantive claims-sexual abuse and defamation. The jury then answered another set of questions to explain how it reached its damages award-a total of $5 million, which included both compensatory damages and punitive damages, for both the assault and the defamation. That verdict is on appeal, but it cast a large shadow on the proceedings of Carroll I when it came to trial last month.\n\nWhy was the second verdict in Carroll I so large?\n\nTrial in the original defamation-only case was finally set to begin in mid-January 2024. In September 2023, however, Judge Kaplan ruled that the jury in Carroll II had conclusively determined all the issues in Carroll I except the amount of the damages that Trump would owe. Under the doctrine of collateral estoppel , which is essentially a \"you don't get two bites at the same apple\" rule, Trump would be precluded from arguing that he did not sexually assault Carroll in the dressing room at Bergdorf Goodman's, and he (therefore) would also be precluded from arguing that he told the truth when he repeatedly insisted that she had fabricated the whole incident.\n\nAlthough this meant that the jury would go about its work with Trump's liability already established and not subject to challenge, that liability was limited to the defamation only, not the sexual attack (which formed no part of the claims in Carroll I .) Moreover, to avoid \"double-dipping\" by Carroll, the jury would not be allowed to consider any injury that Trump's 2022 defamatory statements might have caused.\n\nThis made the jury's eventual January 26 verdict all the more astonishing. Instructed to consider only the defamation and not the sexual assault, the jury awarded E. Jean Carroll $7.3 million for the emotional harm and $11 million for injury to her reputation (including monies needed to mount a public relations campaign to restore it). Punitive damages were set at $65 million-again pursuant to instructions prohibiting consideration of the sexual assault.\n\nWill the verdict stand?\n\nTrump has indicated he will appeal the eye-popping numbers. He will likely argue that more than $18 million in compensatory damages for defamation only was excessive and the result of passion and prejudice. After all, he could say, the first jury awarded only a total of $5 million for compensatory damages and punitive damages, for both defamation and the sexual assault. He could also assert that the jurors could not have reached that compensatory award without considering the sexual assault and thus violating the court's instructions.\n\nRegarding punitive damages, Trump would probably argue that $65 million is so far out of the norm that it can only be explained by an unreasonable urge to \"soak the rich.\" He will also point to a line of Supreme Court cases holding that \"grossly excessive\" punitive damages can violate the Due Process Clause of the federal Constitution as well.\n\nThe upshot of all this will likely be a remittitur by Judge Kaplan, which is a reduction in the jury awards to the highest amount that would not be excessive. That would give Carroll a choice: accept the Kaplan's reduction in awards or face a new trial (which would again be limited to a determination of damages only). If Carroll accepted the reduced awards, Trump could still appeal, but his appeal would be correspondingly weaker.\n\nTrial court judges are given a great deal of discretion in crafting remittiturs, because they heard every word that the jurors heard during the trial and watched each witness's demeanor during testimony. In this case, Kaplan will probably consider some combination of the following factors.\n\nFirst, with respect to compensatory damages, it might be said that being defamed from the bully pulpit of the White House (as in Carroll I ) is more fraught than being defamed by a prominent and controversial private citizen (as in Carroll II ). That could justify a higher award in the former case, but perhaps not as high as the jury's award. Second, with respect to punitive damages, it might be said that although defamation-the only claim at issue in Carroll I -is not as reprehensible as sexual assault, abusing the powers of the presidency to target a private citizen is sufficiently egregious to merit a higher award than in the case of a wealthy private citizen, although again not without limits. Finally, in setting an award that will send both a punitive and a prophylactic message-which is the mission of punitive damages, after all-Kaplan may take into account Trump's misconduct in the presence of the jury, when he disrupted Carroll's testimony by audibly objecting and protesting from his seat in the courtroom.\n\nWilliam Hodes is professor emeritus of law at Indiana University, and a co-author of the legal ethics treatise \"The Law of Lawyering.\" In 1996-97, he clerked for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who had been one of his law professors 30 years earlier.\n\nYour membership includes the ability to share articles\n                with friends.

      "text": "Assessing Claims That New York Changed Its Laws So E. Jean Carroll Could Sue Trump\n\nAdvocates for sexual assault victims pushed for similar laws for years prior to the Carroll lawsuit.\n\nE. Jean Carroll, an advice columnist and author, has won two civil suits against former President Donald Trump since May 2023. In the wake of the latest ruling, in which a jury awarded her $83.3 million for defamation , a prominent social media influencer alleged that New York changed its laws solely to allow Carroll to sue the former president.\n\nNY changed their laws specifically to allow Jean Carroll to sue Trump\n\nShe has no evidence he assaulted her\n\nHe never even met her\n\nBut when he proclaimed his innocence, she sued him & won $80+ million dollars\n\nThe machine is trying to stop Trump at all costs\n\nBut it won't work pic.twitter.com/tBPIqzgBWn\n\n- DC_Draino (@DC_Draino) January 26, 2024\n\nFirst, DC Draino is falsely implying that the latest ruling against Trump was the result of a change in New York law. New York did pass a law in 2022 allowing sexual assault victims to file civil suits, but the lawsuit that eventually yielded the $83.3 million award was filed by Carroll in 2019. Moreover, the lawsuit involved only defamation for statements Trump made after New York magazine published an excerpt of a book by Carroll alleging that Trump had sexually assaulted her in a New York City department store in the mid-1990s. That lawsuit was put on hold by the Justice Department while Trump was president.\n\nIn 2022, New York passed the Adult Survivors Act, which created a one-year lookback period during which adult victims of alleged sexual offenses could file civil suits against perpetrators regardless of whether the standard statute of limitations had already passed. Prior to its non-retroactive expansion in 2019, New York's statute of limitations on sexual assault was generally three years for criminal cases, leaving Carroll well past any window for a criminal complaint. Carroll sued Trump once the Adult Survivors Act took effect, and in May 2023, a jury awarded Carroll $5 million after finding Trump was responsible for sexual abuse and defamation.\n\nThere is no evidence that New York adopted its law specifically to target Trump. Significant advocacy existed for the statute of limitations window passed by New York before Carroll filed her lawsuits, and other states-including Louisiana , California , and North Carolina -have passed similar laws. When state Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal first introduced the legislation in 2019, he cited its potential to aid victims of Jeffrey Epstein but mentioned no one else by name.\n\nThe Adult Survivors Act was passed by the New York State Assembly in May 2022 and signed by Gov. Kathy Hochul five days later was modeled after the 2019 Child Victims Act . That bill, which was also sponsored by Hoylman-Sigal, created a similar lookback period for individuals who previously suffered sexual abuse before the age of 18. The law also extended the statute of limitations for civil and criminal cases.\n\nWhile the Adult Survivors Act did allow E. Jean Carroll to pursue a civil lawsuit against Trump for sexual abuse allegations that occurred nearly two decades prior, the bill's support in New York was not rooted in Carroll's allegations against the former president.\n\n\"The idea that New York passed that bill in order to get Donald Trump is so obviously false having watched this issue in New York for a long time,\" Walter Olson, a legal writer and fellow at the Cato Institute, told The Dispatch Fact Check . \"Debates about reopening statutes of limitations on sex abuse have been going on for decades. It's a big big issue in all sorts of states.\"\n\nMore than 3,000 civil suits were filed during the window opened by the Adult Survivors Act, including against former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Eric Adams-both Democrats. A number of prominent hospitals and prisons were also sued, alongside a variety of other institutions.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com .

      "text": "Does the Delay in Trump's Defamation Trial Amount to 'Election Interference'?\n\nThe judge postponed the proceedings because a juror and Trump's own lawyer were ill.\n\nSocial media users are making claims of \"election interference\" after the judge in Donald Trump's defamation trial involving E. Jean Carroll delayed proceedings on Monday. The former president was scheduled to potentially testify in the civil trial before traveling to New Hampshire on Tuesday for the state's Republican primary. One viral tweet by user \"johnny maga\" garnered more than 307,000 views in less than three hours and was even retweeted by Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik.\n\nBREAKING: The judge in Trump's E. Jean Carroll defamation trial just delayed todays trial until tomorrow - the day of the NH primary\n\nELECTION INTERFERENCE!\n\n- johnny maga (@_johnnymaga) January 22, 2024\n\nThe decision to delay proceedings, however, actually stems from the reported illnesses of a juror and lawyer, and was made at the request of Trump attorney Alina Habba. As the New York Times reports, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan told lawyers for both Trump and Carroll on Monday that one of the trial's nine jurors had called in sick while en route to the courthouse. Habba also reported feeling ill after recently being exposed to COVID-19, despite testing negative.\n\nThe New York Times story reported that Habba initially requested for the trial to be postponed for a single day, but changed her request to two days after being reminded by Trump of Tuesday's primary election. Judge Kaplan said that it is possible that the court reconvenes on Tuesday morning, though proceedings could be delayed further depending on the health of participants. The judge did not say whether Trump would be able to testify Wednesday, but he hasn't ruled it out. \"Circumstances may result in your getting what you ask for, and maybe not,\" he told Habba, according to Reuters .\n\nTrump previously faced Carroll in a civil trial that resulted in a May 2023 jury ruling ordering the former president to pay $5 million in damages to Carroll for sexual abuse and defamation. The current lawsuit dates back to 2019, when Carroll sued Trump for making defamatory statements after she accused him of sexually assaulting her in the 1990s. That suit was blocked by the Department of Justice on the grounds that \"Trump's comments were made in his official capacity as president,\" delaying the case until the Biden administration allowed it to go forward. Trump's statements against Carroll were already found by a judge to be libelous in September 2023, meaning that the current trial will only determine the amount he must pay in damages.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com .

The original post appeared on the pro-Trump TikTok account of a user named Legends 291, and similar claims have since spread to other social media platforms including Facebook , X , Instagram , and Threads .\n\n\"Trumps Convictions have all been overturned and he is getting his $500,000,000.00 Back!\" the TikTok post 's text said. \"Proven in the Appellate Courts that it was all political and a sham. TRUMP 2024.\" The post received more than 150,000 likes on the video-based platform.\n\nThe TikTok post includes audio of news footage from WNBC 4 New York that has no relation to the textual content of the post. The news segment reports that Sheena Wright was resigning from her position as first deputy mayor of New York City in the wake of the Justice Department's indictment of New York City Mayor Eric Adams. Trump was not mentioned or referred to a single time in the audio.\n\nScreenshots of the TikTok post were soon reshared across other social media platforms.\n\n\"Is this true?\" asked one Facebook user . \"And don't read some headline and tell me you know.\"\n\nTrump has spent the last two years embroiled in various legal cases . He's been convicted in one criminal trial, lost two civil defamation suits, and was found guilty in a lawsuit brought by the state of New York alleging fraud. None of those decisions have been overturned.\n\nRegarding the criminal cases , Trump was convicted in New York in May on 34 counts of fraud related to his hush-money payments to the adult film performer Stormy Daniels. Special counsel Jack Smith has brought two federal cases against him, one for his alleged mishandling of classified documents after his presidency and one for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Trump also faces state charges in Georgia for racketeering, related to his attempt to meddle in the 2020 election. Both federal cases and the Georgia case have faced delays, but all are still active.\n\nAs for the civil cases, the writer and advice columnist E. Jean Carroll won two civil judgments against him for defamation-one in 2023 and one in January of this year-totaling $88.3 million . However, Trump has appealed both judgments. And in February, New York state Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron ordered Trump to pay $454 million and ruled him culpable for financial fraud. Engoron found that Trump had inflated the value of his assets on financial statements-on properties including his Florida Mar-a-Lago home and Trump Tower in Manhattan-which deceived banks and insurance companies of the former president's accurate net worth.\n\nThat decision has not been overturned. Trump appealed the decision after securing the $175 million required for him to post bond. A New York appellate court on September 26 heard opening arguments for the case from New York state prosecutors and lawyers representing the former president, though no decision-upholding or overturning the judgment-has been issued. The court is considering the appeal from Trump's legal team and the case is currently pending.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court's presidential immunity ruling in Trump v. United States prompted Trump's legal team to appeal the New York conviction, arguing evidence used in the trial is now protected under presidential immunity and cannot be used to prosecute him. Merchan is scheduled to rule on Trump's appeal on November 12 , precisely one week after the presidential election. The sentencing date for Trump's New York criminal conviction was initially scheduled for July 11, though the judge presiding over the trial-Judge Juan Merchan- later delayed the sentencing until November 26, weeks after Election Day.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com .

      "text": "Mostly Peaceful Sexual Abuse\n\nRepublicans and the E. Jean Carroll verdict.\n\nNever Trump conservatives are a pessimistic bunch but there's one point on which even many of us feel a twinge of optimism. What if one of Donald Trump's primary opponents attacked his character and fitness for office unabashedly?\n\nThat tactic has never been tried in a campaign, at least not early enough to affect the outcome. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz each resorted to it in desperation in 2016 after Trumpmania had built enormous momentum and their own stars had begun to fall.\n\nWhat if someone with the populist stature of, say, Ron DeSantis took it to Trump over his personal corruption early and often in the coming campaign, when many Republican voters might still be persuadable? Would those zombified partisans suddenly awaken after eight years to their hero's many flaws?\n\nThe only way to find out is to try , some Never Trumpers insist, and I suppose that's true. But I am not optimistic , as regular readers may recall.\n\nOur friend David French wrote today at the New York Times about E. Jean Carroll's civil suit, in which a certain presidential frontrunner was held liable for sexually abusing and later defaming Carroll . \"Now the G.O.P. faces a very different kind of trial, one conducted not before a jury, but before a watching nation,\" said French, speculating about how Republican voters might react to the verdict. \"It's a test of decency, integrity and respect, and it is a great tragedy of our time that no one can presume that it's a test the party will pass.\"\n\nThis too seems unduly optimistic to me insofar as it sounds a note of uncertainty and suspense. There's no suspense. We can presume, with absolute confidence, that the party will fail the test of institutional character he describes.\n\nConsider these responses to the verdict yesterday.\n\nMarco Rubio : \"That jury's a joke. The whole case is a joke... If someone accuses me of raping them and I didn't do it, and you're innocent, of course you're going to say something about it ... it was a joke.\"\n\nLindsey Graham : \"I think you could convict Donald Trump of kidnapping Lindbergh's baby... I question the whole process.\"\n\nTommy Tuberville : \"They're going to do anything they can to keep him from winning. It ain't gonna work ... people are gonna see through the lines, a New York jury, he had no chance.\" He went on to say that the verdict \"makes me want to vote for him twice.\"\n\nIt's true that Rubio, Graham, and Tuberville are Trump allies, but that's the point: Even a multimillion-dollar judgment holding Trump liable for sexually abusing a woman proved no match for their allegiance in the aftermath. And none of the three are close Trump cronies the way, say, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz are. Rubio and Graham are mainstream politicians with their roots in the pre-Trump Republican Party, and each challenged Trump in the 2016 primary. Yet neither batted an eye at the verdict.\n\nNever mind Trump's allies. Consider how his primary opponents, all of whom theoretically have an incentive to hold the outcome of the trial against him, responded. \"I wasn't one of the jurors and I'm not privy to all of the facts that they have, but I'll say what everyone else is privately thinking,\" Vivek Ramaswamy told Politico .\"If the defendant weren't named Donald Trump, would there even be a lawsuit?\" When the only woman in the Republican field was asked how she felt about the verdict, she ... had no feelings at all.\n\nHugh Hewitt: \"Reaction to the verdict in Carroll v. Trump?\"\n\nNikki Haley: \"I mean, I'm not going to get into that. That's something for Trump to respond to. You know, I mean I think the focus has to be not to be distracted.\" pic.twitter.com/nX7gJA62Dj\n\n- Republican Voters Against Trump (@AccountableGOP) May 10, 2023\n\nWhether Haley and Ramaswamy are \"opponents\" of Trump in any meaningful sense or running for president to raise their public profiles is an open question. But how about Mike Pence, who's eyeing a run himself, is universally well-known, and surely won't be part of any future Trump administration? He has every reason to lower the boom on the frontrunner, one might think. But one would be wrong :\n\n\"I would tell you, in my 41⁄2 years serving alongside the president, I never heard or witnessed behavior of that nature,\" he said [of Carroll's allegations].\n\n...\n\n\"It's just one more instance where - at a time when American families are struggling, when our economy is hurting, when the world seems to become a more dangerous place almost every day - [there's] just one more story focusing on my former running mate that I know is a great fascination to members of the national media, but I just don't think is where the American people are focused.\"\n\nSo it came to pass that one of the most prominent Christian politicians in the country, who has both moral and electoral reasons to condemn an opponent who's been credibly accused of sexual assault, opted instead to vouch for that opponent while blaming the media for thinking the matter should be relevant in choosing a party nominee.\n\nAnd if it's true that Pence never witnessed any troubling sexually tinged behavior by his former running mate in the Trump White House, perhaps it's because he's not as observant as some of his colleagues in the administration were .\n\nAs I write this Wednesday afternoon, Ron DeSantis has yet to comment on the outcome of the Carroll trial. But the most he's apt to say when he does is to gently suggest that a man with a sexual abuse judgment hanging around his neck might not be the candidate to woo suburban women back to the party in 2024. It's unfathomable that he'll draw an inference from it about Trump's fitness for office the way a precious few Republicans, like Mitt Romney and Asa Hutchinson , did yesterday.\n\nThere's no suspense as to how the base of this party will respond to the Carroll verdict, which is why most Republican politicians have reacted the way they have. It's also why there's no reason to believe a dogged attack on Trump's character in the primary would hurt him more than it would hurt the attacker.\n\nThe first rule of the modern Republican Party, it's said, is \"You can't criticize Trump.\" But that's not correct.\n\nThe actual rule is \"You can't take sides with the left against Trump.\" It just so happens that every moral objection to Trump's character and fitness is now \"coded\" as leftist in nature.\n\nFor the time being, it remains safe to criticize Trump in ways that don't side with the left. John Cornyn , for instance, wrung his hands after the Carroll verdict over how it might further damage the GOP's chances in a general election. He doesn't object to what Trump was held liable for doing, in other words, he objects to the prospect of the libs holding power for another four years. His heart is in the right ideological place even if his electoral analysis is in error.\n\nThe same goes for attacking Trump on policy from the right, I expect. If DeSantis accuses him of indulging Anthony Fauci too much on lockdowns or of falling short on walling off the border, that critique will also be tolerated. Again, the attacker's heart would be ideologically pure.\n\nTo fault Trump for not being worthy of the presidency is another matter entirely.\n\nIt was different in 2016. If you had asked a Republican voter at the time how one should feel about Trump's character, most would have called it troubling but not disqualifying, particularly relative to the Democratic alternative on the ballot that year. You were free to deride Trump's fitness for office-you were even correct to do so in some respects-so long as you recognized that he was the lesser of two evils when it came time to vote.\n\nIn 2023, the question of Trump's character has become a litmus test of right-wing authenticity. To deem him unfit for office is necessarily to have been corrupted by left-wing propaganda, even if the \"propaganda\" in question is Trump being accused of sexual misconduct by 20+ women and then being held liable for sexual abuse in court.\n\nThis explains why so many conservatives, elected and otherwise, resorted to grumbling about the \"New York jury\" after yesterday's verdict. If the jurors were a bunch of partisan blue-state hacks, as their critics insinuate, it's passing strange that they ended up finding Trump not liable on Carroll's most sensational claim, that he raped her. But since holding him accountable for any moral failing is behavior that's now associated exclusively with Democrats, the belief on the right that the verdict could only have been tainted by politics will be inescapable.\n\nThat dynamic conveniently makes it impossible for Trump's fitness for office to be challenged legitimately by someone on his own side, as challenging him on those grounds means you're not on his side at all.\n\nReporter Benjy Sarlin captured the absurdity when he tweeted , \"It's hard to sum up the 2024 situation more succinctly than this: Trump is already calling DeSantis a groomer based 100% on innuendo with 0 penalty; and DeSantis cannot respond by citing an actual jury finding of sexual abuse.\" It's ludicrous. But it's also completely rational for DeSantis and the rest of the field under the circumstances to overlook the Carroll trial, since to mention it would be to take sides with the left against Trump. And that would disqualify them, not him.\n\nAs a case in point, consider that there's only one Republican weighing a run for president who's willing to speak the blunt truth about yesterday's verdict.\n\nChristie on the Carroll verdict, mocking Trump for saying he doesn't know her (to Kilmeade) pic.twitter.com/DJssViIdgb\n\n- Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) May 10, 2023\n\nChris Christie on Trump:\n\n\"Why do we keep making excuses?....his own words in his deposition said that, what he said in the Access Hollywood Tape about being able to assault women with impunity because you're a star. He said, I'm a star and that's true.\" pic.twitter.com/TUaFYvaPau\n\n- Republican Voters Against Trump (@AccountableGOP) May 10, 2023\n\nCare to guess how Chris Christie has been polling lately?\n\nHe's at -62 among Republicans in the latest CBS survey when they're asked whether they might vote for him in the primary or aren't considering doing so. That's the worst split in the field among nine candidates tested, lower than Asa Hutchinson. Christie hasn't held public office of any kind since 2018 and spent most of the eight years since Trump took over the party as an ally of the former president, so Republicans have no policy reason to despise him. It's because he's been outspoken lately about Trump-specifically, crossing the red line by questioning his fitness and character repeatedly-that he's become as radioactive among Republican voters as Liz Cheney has.\n\nThat being so, why should we believe that a full-frontal attack on Trump's corruption by DeSantis or anyone else would hurt Trump more than it would hurt them?\n\nHere's a charming passage from the Washington Post 's reporting on the Carroll trial.\n\nIn private, Trump has dismissed Carroll as \"Ms. Bergdorf,\" referring to the Bergdorf Goodman department store where she said Trump attacked her. Trump also said he would not have assaulted her because she was too old - and that if he had, it would not have been in a department store dressing room but instead at one of his own properties.\n\nMost men would respond with moral indignation upon being accused of a sex crime, not by reasoning that the accuser isn't the type of woman he'd be inclined to assault. Most men also wouldn't muse that celebrities like him historically have been able to assault women with impunity, \"unfortunately or fortunately.\" Fortunately?\n\nE. Jean Carroll told friends at the time about what Trump allegedly did to her. Other women who claim that he touched them without their consent testified at the trial. Those facts, plus his own comments, plus the many other accusations of sexual misconduct made against him over time should have led Republicans to greet the verdict with, at best, ambivalence. Instead reactions like this abound:\n\nDoes the Manhattan jury need to report the in-kind contribution it just gave to the Trump campaign?\n\n- Michael Knowles (@michaeljknowles) May 9, 2023\n\nBecause Trump can no longer be criticized on moral grounds from the right, being held liable for sexual abuse needs to be spun as an affirmative good practically amounting to a campaign donation. You'll never see a more elegant summary of modern conservatism's civic bankruptcy. It can't be long before some especially excitable populist, eager to signal the depth of his devotion to the cause, ends up defending Trump's sexual abuse of Carroll as \"mostly peaceful.\"\n\nIn practice, Republicans have now confirmed the truth of Trump's famous quip that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue without losing any votes. When he said that in 2016, it was a comic exaggeration of a basic truth, that his most fervent supporters follow him blindly. It's no longer an exaggeration and no longer applies to only his most fervent supporters. If he murdered someone in broad daylight in 2023, rank-and-file Republicans would find a way to excuse it.\n\nThese people, most of them nominally Christian, have developed and installed nothing less than an alternate morality based on tribalism. Behind the complaints about the \"New York jury\" is the idea that only a panel of Republicans, not Americans, is qualified to sit in judgment of Trump as peers-although if a jury of Republicans were to find him liable, they'd naturally be dismissed as Never Trumpers. Again, the moral \"logic\" of the modern right is that only right-wingers can properly hold Trump accountable, yet to hold him accountable is to disqualify oneself as a right-winger.\n\nIronically, that logic is self-reinforcing. Because no Republican prosecutor will investigate him, it falls exclusively to Democratic prosecutors to do so. And because only Democratic prosecutors are investigating him, no self-respecting Republican prosecutor would do so.\n\nThere is, in short, no such thing in the right's new moral cosmology as a fair process that produces an adverse outcome for Trump. On any moral or legal challenge, either he's exonerated or he's a victim of injustice. \"Can't attack him for being arrested, can't attack him for losing a suit involving heinous allegations, can't attack him for being investigated over classified documents, or efforts to overturn the election,\" Semafor noted, summarizing the unwritten rules of the Republican presidential primary. Hopefuls like DeSantis are just following the moral code that's been foisted upon them by their constituents.\n\nI'm not a religious person but the word for this ersatz morality is \"wicked.\" And in many cases, I suspect, it's heartfelt. Jonah Goldberg noted recently on The Remnant how taxing it is psychologically for a person to behave cynically; as time passes, a Marco Rubio or a Lindsey Graham who defends Trump reluctantly as a matter of political self-interest will grow more enthusiastic about him simply to spare themselves the agony of their thoughts and words being perpetually at odds.\n\nIf rank-and-file Republicans weren't deadly serious about their new morals, the judge in the Carroll trial wouldn't have had to warn jurors not to reveal their identities , the sort of precaution courts typically take with mobsters and terrorists. But this wicked movement is one that Ron DeSantis and the rest want to lead, so these are the moral rules by which they'll need to play. I hope they're at peace with their choice.\n\nNick Catoggio is a staff writer at The Dispatch and is based in Texas.

      "text": "Judgment Day\n\nNot just for Donald Trump, but for the Republican Party as a whole.\n\nYou are not Alexander the Great. Neither am I. We do not have the option of simply cutting through the Gordian knot-we must untangle it, strand by strand, one maddening little bit at a time, an exercise that can seem pointless until you reach that satisfying moment when you can see how the thing finally will be unwound.\n\nIn the matter of Donald Trump, the serial bankrupt game-show host who was, incredibly enough, once the president of these United States, there are two tangled strands: the legal issues and the political issues. Each strand is further subdivided into many more tangled threads, which on the legal side include the January 6 matters; the more significant failed coup d'état in the form of the attempted nullification of the rightful election of Joe Biden under a host of preposterous legal pretexts; the classified documents matter; the attempt to suborn election fraud on Trump's behalf in Georgia and elsewhere; the matter of business fraud in Trump's account of his bribe to pornographic performer Stormy Daniels to keep quiet about his adultery with her; the civil matter of whether Trump has again defamed the writer E. Jean Carroll, who already has won a civil case in which she alleged that Trump sexually assaulted and defamed her.\n\nThere are fine legal distinctions to be made, of course. These do not, in general, do very much to support the position that Donald Trump should be elected president again. For example, Trump's lawyers have taken issue with the use of the word \"rape\" in the Carroll matter, producing this response from the judge in the case:\n\nThe finding that Ms. Carroll failed to prove that she was 'raped' within the meaning of the New York Penal Law does not mean that she failed to prove that Mr. Trump 'raped' her as many people commonly understand the word 'rape.'  ... Indeed, as the evidence at trial recounted below makes clear, the jury found that Mr. Trump in fact did exactly that. ... The jury's finding of sexual abuse ... necessarily implies that it found that Mr. Trump forcibly penetrated her vagina.\n\nIt bears repeating that this is a judge -the judge overseeing the case in question-writing in his professional capacity. This isn't an MSNBC panelist engaged in maximal spin. Nor are your eyes-or your memory-deceiving you about the events of January 6, the piles of classified documents stacked in the toilet at Mar-a-Lago, the transcript of that \"perfect\" telephone call to the election officer in Georgia, that $130,000 hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels. If you have followed Donald Trump's career at all, you know that his entanglement with Stormy Daniels wasn't even his first involvement with the pornography business.\n\nThat sound you hear is 40 million right-wing evangelical fingers going into 40 million right-wing evangelical ears and 20 million grimly pious mouths chanting, \"Nah! Nah! I can't hear you!\" But, \"Woe unto them who call evil good and good evil, who justify wickedness for profit.\"\n\nYou are not imagining any of this. Hunter Biden may be a reckless dope fiend-he may even be, as the math would suggest, a clown made of crack in some parallel universe-but none of that changes the facts of the case against Trump .\n\n(\" The Case Against Trump \"-somebody should write a pamphlet with that title.)\n\nI am no kind of lawyer, much less the kind who prosecutes or defends cases such as these, to the extent that there are \"cases such as these.\" My amateur status being stipulated, I generally agree with the lawyers around here and elsewhere in my own orbit, whose judgment as of this moment is that the documents case is the most likely to produce a felony conviction of Donald Trump, the New York business-records case the least likely, and the matter that we put in the box labeled-wrongly-\"January 6\" full of uncertainties and complications that make it very difficult to foresee the outcome.\n\nThe \"January 6\" business-and I put it in quotation marks because the sacking of the Capitol on that infamous day, grotesque as it was, was a relatively minor spectacle accompanying the actual attempt to overthrow the government happening elsewhere, the would-be courtroom coup with the phony electors and the rest of it-is particularly vexing. It is one of those things that make you say, \"There ought to be a law ...\" It is, in fact, one of those things that it is very difficult to believe that there isn't a law against. Jack Smith no doubt will make a masterly attempt to show that Trump committed felonies in that matter, and he may well prevail.\n\nTrump's team seems poised to make a First Amendment defense. That isn't as straightforward as you might assume: If a mob boss says to an underling, \"I wish somebody would drop Joey Coconuts into the Schuylkill River for good,\" he doesn't necessarily get a free-speech get-out-of-jail free card, even if he didn't say, \"I want you to murder Joey Coconuts, and I'll pay you $5,000 to do it.\" But, at the same time, the First Amendment probably does protect a few hundred sobbing permutations of \"I wuz robbed!\" And if dishonest allegations of election fraud are a crime, then a whole lot of Democrats should have gone to prison after the 2004 presidential election . That isn't \"whataboutism\"-it is a reminder that there isn't a federal statute prohibiting ordinary garden-variety lies .\n\nYes, Trump was engaged in much more than that, but it's no good pretending that a brick wall isn't made of bricks, and it will be very difficult trying to show that 10,000 actions, each legal on its own discrete terms, somehow add up to a crime -a crime in the legal sense, not a crime in the moral sense.\n\nLawyers and their clients can be fined for abusing the legal system, or attempting to abuse it, through frivolous lawsuits. Indeed, Trump and his lawyer Alina Habba were ordered to pay just shy of $1 million in January of this year over a bogus lawsuit filed against Hillary Clinton and other political enemies some years ago. But, because we want people to feel free to go to court to seek redress of actual wrongs, there are limits to that sort of thing. Because we want there to be a free and open political discourse, there are limits to the kinds of sanctions that we can impose for political communication, including dishonest, irresponsible, and dangerous political communication. That Donald Trump is a villain in the transcendental sense is obvious to anybody with eyes-proving that Donald Trump is guilty of a felony to the satisfaction of a jury under the rules of our criminal-justice system is a much less certain thing.\n\nThe legal question is not our only question: The law may not be able to punish Trump for simple lies, or even for weaponized lies, but that doesn't mean that we, as a republic, are powerless to act-if we choose to act.\n\nThat brings us to the other major strand: The many, many offenses of Donald Trump that are, by any honest and intelligent account, evil even in those cases in which they are not criminal . In our political culture, these distinctions land a bit differently than they do in, say, the European Union, where, to take one example, a Holocaust denier or a Nazi revanchist could be prosecuted as a criminal for acts and speech that would, under our rules, be protected by law even as the wickedness of such an inclination was generally acknowledged. (Indeed, institutions such as our First Amendment are necessarily only for those ideas and positions that seem evil to some non-trivial group of people-the kind of political ideas that nobody objects to do not require much protection.) That is not to say that Donald Trump did not commit any crimes in his attempt to hold on to political power after losing the 2020 election-it is to say that proving him guilty of crimes is a complicated and difficult thing.\n\nWhat is neither complicated nor difficult is-or should be-the judgment that happens outside of the court of law. Of course, Donald Trump was manifestly unfit for the office he sought-or any office of public trust-in 2016. He was known to be unfit for any position of trust, at least by such people who knew of him at all, back when parachute pants were in fashion and \"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go\" was on the radio. Trump is unfit for office, and the people who work for him today are unfit for public trust as well: Susan Wiles , Jason Miller , spokesman Steven Cheung, and the rest of Trump's 2024 team would, in any self-respecting society, be pariahs and kept as far from political power as is possible in a society that does not use exile as a political sanction. The 54 percent of Republicans who tell pollsters they support Trump in 2024 deserve every bit of the contempt and derision they will receive, and the 2024 Republican hopefuls who cannot quite manage to say the plain things about Trump in plain language have no business seeking the most powerful office in the government of the most powerful nation in the world.\n\nHistory is testing Nikki Haley, Tim Scott, Ron DeSantis, et al., and they are failing that test. Mike Pence, who advertises himself as a man of faith, ought to face the fact that he is never going to be president of these United States and instead of worrying about his moribund career pay some attention to the state of his immortal soul-which is the only thing of real value he has left, having forfeited his reputation, his self-respect, and any claim on the respect or goodwill of his countrymen. But Trump has a relentlessly degrading effect on the people around him: Ted Cruz, having been relentlessly humiliated by Donald Trump and having acquiesced to the humiliation of his wife at the same time, would walk barefoot through the snow like Henry IV at Canossa if he thought he would get a pat on the head from Trump in return. Even Sen. Cruz doesn't dispute the facts of the case , of course-how could he? He is still in possession of a working brain -it his soul that he sold.\n\nBut what are the facts of the case to such a man as Ted Cruz? To Sean Hannity? To 54 percent of Republican voters?\n\nSycophant is an ugly word, but it isn't ugly enough for Republicans in 2024. The judgment on Trump is, necessarily, a judgment on the Republican Party as a whole, on those who adhere to it, those who make excuses for it, those who cannot bring themselves to call it what it is. What do they do? Mutter about how \"it wasn't really rape , you know, according to the New York Penal Law.\"\n\nI do not know how any one of these trials is going to turn out. But, at a certain level, I don't need to. And neither do you.\n\nThat is because the uncontested facts of the case-of the cases-are enough to disqualify Donald Trump from any position of trust. We all know this. Ted Cruz knows it, Sean Hannity knows it, Rudy Giuliani, in his rare lucid moments, knows it. There isn't any dispute about whether the affair with the pornographic performer happened or whether money changed hands to facilitate its conclusion more conveniently; there isn't any question about whether Trump had piles of classified documents sitting beneath the gilt chandelier of the Mar-a-Lago toilet; there isn't any question about the fact that Trump did, in fact, try to nullify the 2020 election and unconstitutionally hold on to power. These uncontested facts ought to be understood as dispositive. The fact that they have not disqualified Donald Trump in the hearts and minds of Republican voters is not a judgment on Trump-it is a judgment on Republican voters.\n\nSpeaking of First Amendment defenses-some years ago, during the 2007-08 financial crisis, there was some talk of taking action against the big credit-rating agencies-Moody's, Standard & Poor, Fitch-that had put gold-plated ratings on mortgage-backed securities and related instruments that turned out to be hot garbage. The first line of defense for the credit-rating agencies was going to be free speech: They are paid to give their opinion about the creditworthiness of institutions and instruments, and they are allowed to be wrong .\n\nFitch has now downgraded the credit of the U.S. government, sending the Biden administration into an enraged lather. (It is hard to tell when Janet Yellen is enraged, I know, but, if you look closely, you'll see it .) What that means is that a few days ago Fitch had judged the U.S. government to be the most creditworthy institution in the world, or equal to other institutions also enjoying its very highest rating, but, now, it judges the U.S. government to be one degree short of that standard. This is the second time in modern U.S. history the government has been given a downgrade. The reason for dinging the federal credit rating is what you would think it is: bad governance when it comes to fiscal issues, big and bigger deficits, rapidly accumulating debt, expected deterioration in the fiscal situation and in the overall economy, etc. As ABC News put it:\n\nAnalysts downplayed the immediate economic effect of the rating decision but said it marks a significant milestone on a path of increasing debt that could ultimately raise the nation's borrowing costs, threaten economic growth and hike interest rates for consumer loans like credit cards and mortgages.\n\nSo, what it means: Not much.\n\nThat seems to be the consensus, anyway. Some big institutions hold U.S. government debt because they more or less have to, some because they want to, preferring dollar-denominated assets to those attached to other, less credible currencies; demand for U.S. government debt is intimately related to demand for U.S. dollars, which are sought-after because they offer a good store of value and because many international deals and settlements (e.g., payments for oil deliveries) are denominated in U.S. dollars. Nobody at the People's Bank of China or Morgan Stanley or Blackrock or ExxonMobil needs Fitch to tell them what the fiscal situation of the U.S. government is. They know whether they want to hold U.S. government securities, how many they want to hold, on what terms they want to hold them, etc. The only people who really care what the ratings agencies say are institutions that have to care for regulatory reasons and politicians who are embarrassed by the downgrade.\n\nWe have had cheap, cheap, cheap money for a very long time. We have got used to it and have baked all sorts of assumptions about cheap money into the economic cake, both in the public sector and in the private sector. Do you know what the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was in 1982? It was 16.04 percent-rates are less than half that today, and people in the real-estate world are weeping tears of blood like Le Chiffre. Around the same time, Treasuries were paying about 15 percent interest-great if you wanted a low-risk portfolio, but tough if you were the federal government trying to borrow money. If interest rates were at 1980s levels with today's debt load, the federal government would be obliged to pay about $5 trillion a year in interest-which is more than the federal government collected in all taxes combined in 2022, or about 80 percent of combined federal spending for 2022.\n\nThat's why you care about the creditworthiness of the federal government-real or perceived-even if you don't care very much about Fitch's downgrade per se .\n\nHere is a weird sentence from the Wall Street Journal :\n\nWoung-Chapman, whose ancestry includes Chinese, German, Indian and African, says she liked how intensely curious Chapman was about her background.\n\nThere's a noun missing. We have a string of national adjectives-Chinese, German, Indian, and African-modifying ... nothing. You can see how it would be a tricky sentence, because the noun you want there is \"ancestry,\" which already appears earlier in the sentence and which, therefore, would sound repetitive, having already appeared earlier in the sentence. But people can get pretty queasy about words related to ancestry if they feel too emotionally or socially loaded: For example, the writer could have written about \"Chinese, German, Indian, and African blood,\" but blood as a shorthand for ancestry can sound creepy in some circumstances, and the history of the idea of \"one drop of African blood\" in the American context is kind of lurking in the background. Paternity, heritage, and words of that sort also have undertones that can make some writers nervous. The author could have substituted background for the first ancestry and then used ancestry later in the sentence, or used a word such as antecedents or the more precise progenitors . But a string of adjectives modifying an invisible mystery word doesn't really work-in fact, it draws attention to the very thing one assumes the author was, consciously or unconsciously, attempting to avoid.\n\nYou can buy my most recent book, Big White Ghetto , here .\n\nYou can buy my other books here .\n\nYou can see my New York Post columns here .\n\nPlease subscribe to the Dispatch if you haven't .\n\nSometimes, it is necessary to resist the temptation to be liked. Everybody wants to be liked, but it isn't always the right thing.\n\nI was sad to read about the death of Patrick Cates, who had been the principal of Highland Park High School in the eponymous affluent Dallas enclave and, many years before taking that job, my senior English teacher at Lubbock High School. Mr. Cates was not the kind of teacher you liked -his natural affect, at least at that point in his life, was not warm. But he was the kind of teacher who did his students an enormously important service: He was serious, precise, demanding, and demanded that we be serious and precise in his class. On the first draft of the first big paper students submitted for his class, almost every student-and this was an honors class full of very competitive kids-received a failing grade on grammar and usage. For some of them, it was the first failing grade they ever had received on an assignment. This had the wonderful effect of awakening students to the fact that these considerations are important and that grammar and usage have to be studied and learned, that what sounds correct to us isn't necessarily correct. Poetry may be sublime and ineffable, but there was, in Mr. Cates's classroom, a right way to write about it and a wrong way. He wasn't a teacher I loved or one who left me with fond memories, but he did his job and, in doing so, did us all a lot more good than we might have noticed at the time. Job well done, Mr. Cates.\n\nKevin D. Williamson is national correspondent at The Dispatch and is based in Virginia.

Jean Carroll in 1996.\n\nThe jury had ordered Trump to pay Carroll $5 million in damages for the alleged abuse and defaming her with comments he made in 2022.\n\n\"On review for abuse of discretion, we conclude that Mr. Trump has not demonstrated that the district court erred in any of the challenged rulings. Further, he has not carried his burden to show that any claimed error or combination of claimed errors affected his substantial rights as required to warrant a new trial,\" the judges wrote.\n\n\"This case is a textbook example of implausible allegations being propped up by highly inflammatory, inadmissible propensity evidence,\" Sauer charged during oral arguments on Sept. 6.\n\nCarroll's attorney, Roberta Kaplan, argued that the evidence in question established that the behavior alleged by her client was part of a larger pattern for Trump.\n\nTrump, who attended the hearing, shook his head as Kaplan spoke. He did not attend the May 2023 defamation trial-a fact Kaplan pointed out in making her case.\n\n\"[Trump] had every opportunity to take the stand and rebut all this evidence. He did not,\" Kaplan said.\n\nThe appellate judges ultimately sided with the original ruling made by Judge Lewis Kaplan (no relation to the defense attorney), finding that the district court's admission of the challenged evidence was appropriate.\n\n\"Taking the record as a whole and considering the strength of Ms. Carroll's case, we are not persuaded that any claimed error or combination of errors in the district court's evidentiary rulings affected Mr. Trump's substantial rights,\" they wrote, concluding that a new trial was unwarranted.\n\nIn response, Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement that Americans \"demand an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and a swift dismissal of all of the Witch Hunts, including the Democrat-funded Carroll Hoax, which will continue to be appealed.\"\n\nIn a separate case decided earlier this year, a jury ordered Trump to pay Carroll $83.3 million in damages, finding that comments he made about her in 2019 were defamatory."

Jean Carroll have claimed in court that former President Donald Trump is making \"meritless\" claims that she failed to meet her burden in showing his conduct was the cause of her injuries as part of her defamation case against him.\n\nThe lawsuit accused him of having denied raping her in a dressing room at the Bergdorf Goodman department store in Manhattan in 1995 or 1996.\n\nLawyers for President Trump had unsuccessfully attempted to dismiss the lawsuit on the basis he should be granted absolute presidential immunity in the case.\n\nThe jury was instructed to accept as true the sexual assault allegations, as a separate civil case last year found President Trump liable for \"sexual battery\" and awarded Ms. Carroll $5 million in damages, including $2 million in damages for sexual abuse and around $3 million for defamation.\n\nHis legal team is hoping the verdict will be set aside or the amount will be greatly reduced by U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who is overseeing the case.\n\n\"Trump took the stand for less than three minutes. And the jury returned a verdict entirely in favor of Carroll, awarding her $83.3 million in damages,\" Ms. Kaplan wrote in the March 26 filing. \"Trump argues that Carroll failed to show that 'her injuries were not caused by third parties,' and asserts (without support) that she 'cannot recover if the evidence establishes one or more possible causes of injury for which [Trump] is not responsible ... By contrast, Carroll offered overwhelming evidence that Trump's defamation caused her injuries,\" the lawyer continued.\n\nPresident Trump, the lawyer said, \"has provided no basis for overturning the jury's verdict\" in the defamation lawsuit against him and his arguments as part of efforts to set aside January's verdict or, at a minimum, reduce the amount of money he now owes Ms. Carroll, are \"meritless,\" the lawyer concluded.\n\nFor this reason, Ms. Kaplan asked the court to deny a renewed motion filed by President Trump's legal team alleging Ms. Carroll failed to show his actions caused injury.\n\nSpeaking earlier this month after President Trump posted the $91.6 million bond, his lawyer, Alina Habba said she was hopeful his appeal would be successful.\n\n\"Due to the numerous prejudicial errors made at the lower level, we are highly confident that the Second Circuit will overturn this egregious judgment,\" Ms. Habba said in a statement.\n\nThe Epoch Times has contacted Ms. Habba for further comment."

      "text": "Trump Walks Out Mid-Trial as E. Jean Carroll Seeks $24 Million in Damages\n\nFormer President Donald Trump abruptly left the courthouse in the middle of closing arguments that mark an end to the defamation trial in the case brought against him by writer E. Jean Carroll.\n\nThe courthouse was packed Friday morning for the conclusion of the trial. Minutes after the plaintiff's side began its closing statement, President Trump got up and left without notice. He did not return for the rest of the statement.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan interrupted attorney Roberta Kaplan, of no relation, to add, \"The record will reflect that Mr. Trump just rose and walked out of the courtroom.\"\n\nMs. Kaplan's statement was preceded by a heated exchange between defense attorney Alina Habba and Judge Kaplan, who threatened jail time when she continued to talk after he told her to stop.\n\n\"You are on the verge of spending some time in the lockup. Now sit down,\" Judge Kaplan said.\n\nExchanges between the judge and defense were also tense the day before when Ms. Habba wanted to call President Trump as her last witness.\n\n\"Ms. Habba, I will decide what he has a right to do. That is my job, not yours,\" the judge said. When President Trump tried to speak up during this exchange, the judge admonished him.\n\nEventually, President Trump was allowed to testify, albeit briefly. Ms. Habba was also asked to guarantee that she would ask President Trump whether he intended to incite people to harm Ms. Carroll with his statements.\n\nPresident Trump answered, \"No, I just wanted to defend myself, my family-\" and intended to elaborate on his answer, but the judge struck from the record everything after the word \"no.\"\n\n\"This case is about punishing Donald Trump for what he's done and what he continues to do,\" Ms. Kaplan said. \"This trial is about getting him to stop.\"\n\nWhile President Trump was still in office, Ms. Carroll accused him of sexually assaulting her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room sometime in the 1990s. He publicly denied the accusation in a statement and interview responses while also claiming that he didn't know who she was and suggesting that she was trying to gain publicity to sell her book.\n\nMs. Carroll sued President Trump for defamation in 2019 based on those statements. President Trump countersued, but the suit was denied.\n\nThe countersuit later became the rationale for an appeals court to deny a dismissal of the case based on presidential immunity, with the plaintiff arguing that President Trump had waived this immunity when he litigated the case.\n\nIn 2019, New York also passed the Adult Survivors Act, which would allow sexual abuse cases to be brought outside of the statute of limitations for a new period of one year. It was signed into law in 2022, and Ms. Carroll then sued President Trump in a second case accusing him of rape and defamation in new statements that he had made about her.\n\nIn May 2023, a jury awarded Ms. Carroll $5 million on this second case, finding that President Trump was liable for defamation and sexual battery instead of rape. Ms. Carroll then amended her first case to seek $10 million in damages based on the formula used in the first case to arrive at $5 million.\n\nJudge Kaplan, presiding over both cases, then issued a summary judgment finding President Trump liable for defamation in the first case, stating that the facts were the same in both cases.\n\nPresident Trump has said he will appeal the rulings in both cases."

      "text": "Republicans, Democrats React to Verdict Against Trump in E. Jean Carroll Lawsuit\n\nRepublicans and Democrats reacted to the May 9 news that a jury found former President Donald Trump liable for sexually assaulting advice columnist E. Jean Carroll in 1996, resulting in an award of $5 million in a judgment that could plague the former president as he campaigns for reelection.\n\nSen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) responded to The Epoch Times' question about the verdict by saying, \"I congratulate Jean Carroll on her victory. This is Donald Trump's first conviction, but I don't expect it to be his last conviction. I think this Trump on trial journey is just beginning.\"\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) was asked by reporters his thoughts on whether the ruling should-or would-make it difficult for Trump to continue his campaign. Shortly after the news broke, the senator responded by saying that is \"up to voters\" as to whether they think he should be president.\n\nSen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) also answered reporters' questions about the jury's finding on battery and defamation, saying, \"You never like to hear that a former president has been found in a civil court guilty of those types of actions ... we are looking for an individual to lead this party forward in a united method.\"\n\nRounds also said he is \"looking forward to Tim Scott\" as a possible presidential candidate, and that he believes Scott is someone who could \"reunite the party.\"\n\nWhen asked by The Epoch Times whether he thought the allegations against Trump were credible, Rounds said, \"I don't know anything more about it than what the jury does, and the jury says they were.\"\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) also reacted, including with misinformation, saying Trump was \"convicted\" of sexual assault. In reality, the former president was found civilly liable to Carroll.\n\nThe verdict was announced on the first day of jury deliberations in a New York federal courtroom. The jury dismissed Carroll's allegations that she was raped but found Trump responsible for assault.\n\nEarlier in the morning on May 9, U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan instructed the nine-person jury on the law before the panel began discussing Carroll's allegations of battery and defamation around noon.\n\nKaplan instructed jurors that the first question on the verdict form was to determine whether Trump assaulted Carroll in a department store dressing room with a probability greater than 50 percent. If they responded affirmatively, they would then determine whether to award compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nIf they answered no to the rape question, they could then determine whether Trump subjected her to lesser forms of assault, such as sexual contact without her consent, forcible stroking to denigrate her, or sexual gratification. If they answered yes to either of these inquiries, they will determine whether or not damages are warranted."

      "text": "Appeals Court Weighs Trump's Bid to Overturn E. Jean Carroll Verdict\n\nNEW YORK-Lawyers for former President Donald Trump argued in a Lower Manhattan courtroom on Friday morning, seeking to toss out a jury verdict that found that Trump liable of sexual abuse and defamation against writer E. Jean Carrol.\n\nTrump attended the hearing, sitting by himself in a chair behind a row of lawyers in a courtroom of the federal appeals court. He did not attend the 2-week trial in the case last year, which resulted in a jury awarding Carroll $5 million after finding Trump sexually abused her.\n\nTrump's attorney D. John Sauer argued that in all the previous proceedings, Carroll's lawyers failed to invoke any law that Trump had violated. The plaintiffs' strategy, he said, was to rely on inflammatory evidence of questionable relevance, for example concerning the Access Hollywood recording in which Trump made sexually explicit remarks about women.\n\n\"They relentlessly hammered the propensity evidence, the Access Hollywood tape,\" Sauer said.\n\n\"This case is a textbook example of implausible allegations being propped up by highly inflammatory, inadmissible\" evidence, Sauer added.\n\nCarroll's lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, said the evidence in question was proper. The attorney dwelt on the fact that Trump did not attend the defamation trial in person, and contended there was sufficient evidence backing Carroll's claim that Trump sexually assaulted her in a department store dressing room decades ago.\n\n\"E. Jean Carroll brought this case against him. Donald J. Trump assaulted her in the dressing room of Bergdorf Goodman in 1996, and then defamed her by saying she was crazy,\" Kaplan said.\n\nAppearing unconcerned about Sauer's assertions that the plaintiffs wanted to inflame the jury with lurid accounts of alleged conduct by Trump, Kaplan doubled down on her portrayal of Trump as a predator who repeatedly tried to get women to lower their defenses by coming across as mild and friendly.\n\nKaplan called this modus operandi \"pleasant chatting.\"\n\n\"It was pleasant chatting, and then he would, from almost out of nowhere, pounce,\" Kaplan said.\n\nShe also questioned the timeliness of Trump's in-person appearance and the legal arguments his lawyers sought to make on his behalf.\n\n\"He was given every opportunity by Judge Kaplan to attend his trial,\" she said.\n\nThe three-judge panel court is unlikely to issue a ruling before November's presidential election.\n\nAfter the hearing, Trump held a press conference at Trump Tower where he denied Carroll's allegations and denounced what he said is broad abuse of the justice system in the various cases against him.\n\nOne of Trump's attorneys, Will Scharf, spoke at the press conference and alleged that Carroll's \"story at its heart is an utterly implausible he said-she said story\" and that there was \"no corroboration for anything she has ever claimed about President Trump.\"\n\nIn January, in a separate case, a jury awarded Carroll another $83.3 million in damages for comments Trump had made about her while he was president, finding that they were defamatory."

      "text": "Judge Rules for E. Jean Carroll in Trump Defamation Case\n\nU.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan ruled in a pretrial summary judgment that the upcoming Jan. 15, 2024, trial will only be about how much former President Donald Trump owes writer E. Jean Carroll in her defamation suit.\n\nMs. Carroll had brought two lawsuits against President Trump, one for defamation and the second for sexual battery and defamation in 2022 remarks, and won the second case earlier this year. The cases center around Ms. Carroll's public accusation in 2019 that he raped her in the mid-1990s at a department store. When he was in office, President Trump publicly refuted the accusation and claimed that he had never met her. Ms. Carroll claimed that these high-profile public statements were defamatory. President Trump also claimed defamation in a countersuit, which was thrown out.\n\nIn 2022, New York state enacted the Adult Survivors Act, which allowed victims to bring forth sexual offense cases outside of the statute of limitations for one year, between November 2022 and November 2023.\n\nIn May, Ms. Carroll won $5 million in the sexual battery lawsuit. The jury found that President Trump \"sexually abused\" Ms. Carroll, using the term defined by the court, and also found him liable for defamation. She then amended her first lawsuit, seeking $10 million in compensatory damages.\n\nThe judge wrote that there was no genuine issue regarding material facts to be tried, as they had already been settled in the other, similar case, and thus Ms. Carroll was entitled to a judgment.\n\nWhile the second lawsuit centered around remarks President Trump made in 2022, the jury also heard arguments on similar remarks he made in 2019 about not knowing Ms. Carroll and criticizing the book she had been promoting at the time.\n\nPresident Trump's attempt to challenge the charges against him again in the separate case was denied.\n\n\"The truth or falsity of Mr. Trump's 2019 statements therefore depends-like the truth or falsity of his 2022 statement-on whether Ms. Carroll lied about Mr. Trump sexually assaulting her. The jury's finding that she did not therefore is binding in this case and precludes Mr. Trump from contesting the falsity of his 2019 statements,\" the judge wrote. \"Mr. Trump's contrary arguments are all unpersuasive.\"\n\nMs. Carroll had argued that \"no reasonable person could believe that Trump acted with actual malice in October 2022 but lacked it in June 2019\" in her push for a summary judgment.\n\n\"Shame on those who make up false stories of assault to try to get publicity for themselves, or sell a book, or carry out a political agenda.\"\n\nHe was referencing what happened to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, whom he had nominated for the seat.\n\nMs. Carroll's story had been published in New York Magazine, and President Trump criticized both the writer and publication for publishing the story with \"zero evidence.\"\n\n\"False accusations diminish the severity of real assault,\" he said.\n\nThe court documents also included a 2019 interview in which President Trump was asked about the accusations. He responded to questions about his claim that he never met her and a photo showing that they stood next to each other in a line, repeating his earlier statements and calling the accusation an \"absolute disgrace.\"\n\nIn 2022, President Trump made a post about the case on Truth Social after Ms. Carroll gave an interview about it with CNN's Anderson Cooper.\n\n\"This 'Ms. Bergdorf Goodman case' is a complete con job. ... She completely made up a story that I met her at the doors of this crowded New York City Department Store and, within minutes, 'swooned' her. It is a Hoax and a lie,\" he wrote.\n\nPresident Trump addressed the interview in which \"she was promoting a really crummy book\" and called the accusation a \"scam,\" accusing Ms. Carroll of changing her story and not being able to recount when the event took place.\n\nThe $2.98 million figure awarded for defamation in the second case had been decided based on a formula devised by Northwestern University professor Ashlee Humphrey, according to the judge's Sept. 6 order.\n\n\"The ultimate calculations Professor Humphreys reaches are different in both cases,\" Judge Kaplan wrote, ordering that the trial in January deal with the amount in damages owed."

He denied the accusations in public statements, leading her to sue for defamation.\n\nLast year, Ms. Carroll brought a sexual assault case against President Trump when New York state passed a law allowing such cases to be brought outside the statute of limitations. The lawsuit included additional statements President Trump made about Ms. Carroll, claiming her accusations were part of a publicity stunt to sell her book.\n\nA jury found President Trump liable for \"sexual battery\" and awarded Ms. Carroll $5 million. President Trump is also appealing this case.\n\n\"The truth or falsity of Mr. Trump's 2019 statements therefore depends-like the truth or falsity of his 2022 statement-on whether Ms. Carroll lied about Mr. Trump sexually assaulting her.

He later returned, and then left again before the jury delivered the verdict."

FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\n\"Kudlow\" panelists Pam Bondi and Gregg Jarrett react to a judge ordering former President Trump to pay more than $350 million in a New York fraud case.\n\nFormer President Trump is facing hundreds of millions of dollars in looming penalties from civil cases that could challenge the ability of Trump and his organizations to fund the legal judgments against them.\n\nA New York judge on Friday ruled that Trump and other defendants in the case committed fraud while building his real estate empire by deceiving banks, insurers and others by overvaluing his assets and exaggerating his net worth on financial documents used to secure financing for various transactions.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron ruled that the former president and his organizations owe more than $354 million in damages , plus 9% interest, and also barred Trump from running a business as an officer or director in New York State for three years. The judge is expected to issue a decision on the amount that Trump will have to pay soon, and he may increase that amount to $370 million plus interest sought by New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nThe fraud ruling comes weeks after Trump was ordered to pay more than $83 million in a defamation case brought by writer E. Jean Carroll, who accused Trump of sexual assault and had previously been awarded more than $5 million from Trump in a separate civil case. In total, the more than $400 million in penalties is a significant sum that has prompted speculation about the ability of the former president and his organizations to pay the bill without having to sell off assets.\n\nTRUMP BARRED FROM OPERATING BUSINESS, ORDERED TO PAY OVER $350 MILLION IN NY CIVIL FRAUD CASE\n\nFormer President Trump slammed the ruling from what he called \"a crooked New York judge\" in remarks to the press at Mar-a-Lago on Friday. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images / Getty Images)\n\nTrump's net worth has been estimated at $2.6 billion by Forbes, and a Trump Organization document that was included as evidence during the trial indicated that Trump had $293.8 million in \"cash and cash equivalents\" at his disposal in 2021.\n\nThe AG's office said that figure included $93 million in assets that weren't liquid. The document also put Trump's net worth at $4.5 billion, which he has called too low.\n\n\"We didn't include billions of dollars in brand value,\" Trump said in an October 2022 deposition. \"If I wanted to show you a good statement, I would have added maybe $10 billion or something for the brand.\"\n\nIt's unclear how much cash and liquid assets Trump currently holds, but assuming the fraud penalties are upheld, that amount would be insufficient to cover his court liabilities without putting properties up as collateral during appeal or liquidating those assets by selling them.\n\nNEW YORK AG TAKES VICTORY LAP AFTER TRUMP FRAUD RULING: 'JUSTICE HAS BEEN SERVED'\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James sought $370 million plus interest as penalties in Trump's fraud case. (Mike Segar-Pool/Getty Images / Getty Images)\n\nTrump attorney Christopher Kise said Friday that Trump \"will of course appeal\" and added that he \"remains confident the Appellate Division will ultimately correct the innumerable and catastrophic errors made by a trial court untethered to the law or to reality.\"\n\nLawyers told the New York Post that Trump will likely have to put up 10% of the penalty in cash and use properties as collateral to cover a security bond while the case is under appeal. The appeals court could ultimately reduce the penalties ordered by the judge, although that isn't certain and the appeals process could take years.\n\nTRUMP BLASTS 'CLUBHOUSE POLITICIAN' JUDGE AFTER BEING FINED $350M, DEFENDS THE 'GREAT COMPANY' HE BUILT\n\nThe Trump Organization told FOX Business in a statement that the ruling \"is a gross miscarriage of justice\" and that the Trump Organization \"has never missed any loan payment or been in default on any loan.\"\n\n\"The lenders in each of these transactions were some of the largest banks in the world, they were represented by the most prestigious law firms in the country, and they performed extensive due diligence prior to entering into these transactions - and in the end, Deutsche Bank and others made hundreds of millions of dollars of profits all while having an incredible relationship with our organization.,\" the Trump Organization continued.\n\nThe Trump Organization also said that the New York attorney general's \"gross overreach and brazen attempt... to exert limitless power where no private or public harm has been established\" would \"only further expedite the continuing exodus of companies from New York\" if the ruling is allowed to stand.\n\nFormer President Trump and his organizations may have to divest some property assets to help foot the bill for massive legal penalties. (Leonardo Munoz/VIEWpress / Getty Images)\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul has sought to tamp down concern from those in the business and investment community that the case against Trump could be a sign of things to come for other companies, saying that most business owners are law-abiding and that the judge found Trump violated the law.\n\n\"This is really an extraordinarily unusual circumstance because the law-abiding, rule-following New Yorkers who are businesspeople have nothing to worry about because they're very different from Donald Trump and his behavior,\" she said on the \"Cats Roundtable\" radio show with billionaire Jon Catsimidis.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\"The governor of New York does not have a say in the size of a fine. And we want to make sure we don't have that level of interference,\" Hochul added. \"You do not want me as governor to be telling judges that I'm going to overrule their decisions.

Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, discusses whether the Pentagon will hold Iran responsible for drone attacks on U.S. troops in the Middle East on 'Varney & Co.'\n\nA conservative watchdog group is calling for billionaire Democratic megadonor and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman's ouster from the Microsoft board of directors.\n\nThe National Legal and Policy Center is a shareholder in the company and argues that Hoffman's political activism, as well as his past association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, harm the company's image.\n\n\"While the National Legal and Policy Center respects Mr. Hoffman's right to make political donations, as Microsoft shareholders, we believe his partisan political activities damage the firm's reputation,\" says a letter sent this month from Paul Chesser, director of the NLPC Corporate Integrity Project, to Sandra E. Peterson, the Microsoft legal independent director and chair of the governance nominating committee.\n\nHoffman co-founded LinkedIn in 2003, sold it to Microsoft in 2016 for $26.2 billion , and joined the Microsoft board of directors.\n\nReid Hoffman speaks onstage at WIRED25 Festival: WIRED Celebrates 25th Anniversary  Day 1 on October 13, 2018 in San Francisco, California. (Getty Images / Getty Images)\n\n\"In addition, Mr. Hoffman's political activism, and affiliation with controversial and unethical organizations, risk alienating a significant portion of the firm's customer base, which could be offended by Mr. Hoffman's political activities,\" the NLPC letter continues. \"He often adopts a caustic and vindictive approach, which is unbecoming of a signature representative of the company, not to mention as the iconic co-founder of one of its top products.\"\n\nDOZENS OF STATES SUE META ALLEGING SOCIAL MEDIA 'PROFOUNDLY ALTERED' MENTAL, SOCIAL REALITIES OF AMERICAN YOUTH\n\nThe letter asks the board to request Hoffman's resignation and to prevent him from running for another term on the board.\n\nA Microsoft spokesperson told FOX Business that \"Microsoft has nothing to share.\"\n\nFOX also reached out to Greylock, a venture capital firm where Hoffman is a partner to attempt to get a comment from Hoffman. The company did not respond by publication time.\n\nThe NLPC letter's first objection was, \"Mr. Hoffman's ties to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein are a significant liability to Microsoft's reputation.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported in May that Hoffman visited Epstein's private Caribbean Island , called Little St. James, part of the U.S. Virgin Islands, on at least one occasion in 2014. The report also revealed Hoffman was planning to stay at Epstein's luxury Manhattan townhouse in December 2014 after a late arrival in New York City.\n\n\"Mr. Hoffman's connections with Mr. Epstein present a significant liability to Microsoft's brand,\" the Friday NLPC letter to Microsoft says.\n\nPresident Biden speaks at a groundbreaking for an Arcosa Wind Towers Inc. manufacturing facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on Wednesday, Aug. 9, 2023. (Photographer: Ramsay de Give/Bloomberg via Getty Images / Getty Images)\n\nThe letter states Hoffman's \"unethical and brazenly political activism make him unsuitable to serve on Microsoft's board.\"\n\nThe letter mentions that he financed Project Birmingham during Alabama's special U.S. Senate election 2017.  Hoffman was forced to issue an apology in 2018 when it came to light the project falsely tried to give the impression that the Russian government was supporting Alabama Republican candidate Roy Moore in the special Senate election. Moore lost the race to Democrat Doug Jones.\n\nThe letter notes that court filings showed that Hoffman - through his nonprofit American Future Republic - paid the legal bills of E. Jean Carroll, a former journalist who successfully sued Donald Trump for defamation after the 45th president denied her allegation of sexual assault from the mid-1990s.\n\nThe letter goes on to note that Hoffman provided financial backing to digital advertising firm MotiveAI. The company set up a page called \"Drain the Swamp,\" which during the rocky Supreme Court confirmation battle over Brett Kavanaugh, promoted a conspiracy theory that in the 1990s Kavanaugh helped former President Bill Clinton and first lady Hillary Clinton cover up the murder of a White House aide, the Daily Beast reported.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nFOX Business correspondent Lydia Hu has the latest on efforts to prevent the state from seizing the presumptive GOP presidential nominee's assets while he appeals the judgment on 'The Big Money Show.'\n\nFormer President Donald Trump posted a $175 million bond in the New York civil fraud case Monday, after a state appeals court decided last week to reduce the amount required from $454 million.\n\nThe bond protects Trump's assets from seizure by New York Attorney Letitia James while he appeals Judge Arthur Engoran's decision finding him liable for fraud.\n\nTrump obtained the bond from Knight Specialty Insurance Company, whose Chairman Don Hankey said negotiations included accepting a combination of cash and investment-grade bonds from Trump as collateral. Trump ultimately posted all cash for the appeal bond, Hankey said. TRUMP'S TRUTH SOCIAL LOST $58 MILLION IN 2023, AND THE STOCK IS TAKING A HIT\n\n\"It's a big bond for us to underwrite. But, you know, Donald Trump came up with all cash. So at the end, it was an easy decision and with almost no risk,\" said Hankey.\n\nTrump's lawyers previously told the court that Trump did not have the cash to secure a bond for the full amount of the judgment, adding that nearly 30 insurance companies declined to underwrite a bond for the former president.\n\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump waves to the crowd on the field during halftime in the Palmetto Bowl between Clemson and South Carolina at Williams Brice Stadium on November 25, 2023 in Columbia, South Carolina.

He's not spoken with the former president but he'd welcome a conversation.\n\n\"I respect the fact that he has had to step back from business and donate his time to running the country, and I'm sure his net worth has taken a big drop in the last, you know, 4 or 5 years with everything he's been doing for the country,\" Hankey said. \"I'd like to thank him for that.\"\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump arrives for a Super Tuesday election night watch party at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, US, on Tuesday, March 5, 2024.

However, we support the rule of law and our role in it. We considered this the right thing to do and we frankly left our own personal feelings aside.\"\n\nHankey also worries about criticism.
