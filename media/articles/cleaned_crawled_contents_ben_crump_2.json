      "text": "'She should be found guilty': Family attorney Ben Crump slams ex-cop Kim Potter for killing Daunte Wright\n\nThe former Minnesota police officer Kim Potter, who faces manslaughter charges for fatally shooting 20-year-old Black man Daunte Wright during a traffic stop, is expected to take the stand in her own defense Friday. Potter claims she reached for her Taser and drew a pistol by mistake. \"Black people should not be killed in America over misdemeanor, pretextual traffic stops,\" says Benjamin Crump, attorney for Wright's family.\n\nThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: I want to go on to another case and then another one. I want to ask you about the Minnesota manslaughter trial of former Brooklyn Center police officer Kimberly Potter. Local media reports Potter is expected to take the stand in her own defense today, on the eighth day of testimony. The white woman is charged with first-degree and second-degree manslaughter in the killing of 20-year-old Black motorist Daunte Wright during a minor traffic stop in April. Bodycam video showed Potter pointing her 9-millimeter pistol at Wright, repeatedly shouting \"Taser!\" before firing a single bullet into Wright's chest. Potter claims she drew the pistol by mistake. She's a [26-year] police veteran who was training other officers when she shot Wright.\n\nJust before Daunte was killed, he called his mother to say he was being pulled over, allegedly because an air freshener was obscuring his rearview mirror and for an expired registration tag. Katie Bryant, Wright's mom, testified about this phone call in Kim Potter's trial last week. She was the prosecution's first witness.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: The call ended. Katie Bryant later made a video call. A woman, likely Daunte Wright's partner, Alayna Albrecht-Payton, who was in the car at the time of his killing, answered the phone.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: In the end, they ended up handcuffing Daunte Wright's partner. The prosecution rested its case Thursday. One of its witnesses, Minnesota state investigator Sam McGinnis, testified this week that Potter failed to test her Taser as required on the day she fatally shot Wright. He also laid out the differences between a Glock pistol and a Taser.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Meanwhile, Wednesday, use-of-force expert Seth Stoughton testified for the prosecution that Potter acted unreasonably in shooting Wright. He said, quote, \"The use of deadly force was not appropriate. The evidence suggests a reasonable officer in Officer Potter's position could not have believed it was proportional to the threat at the time,\" he said. Stoughton is a professor at University of South Carolina School of Law who also testified for the prosecution at Chauvin's trial. Ben Crump, your response to Kim Potter's trial so far? What do you expect the outcome to be? You're Daunte Wright's family's attorney.\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP: We expect that there will be accountability for another unjustified death of another young Black man. When you think about this excuse that it was an innocent mistake, it wasn't innocent at all for her and the police officers to yet again have a pretextual stop of a minority in Minneapolis. We know that these pretextual stops, whether you say it's an air freshener obscuring the view of the driver, whether you say it's an expired registration - during the pandemic, where they have been given memos that they should not be stopping motorists for expired license plates because they were closed - which leads to them engaging in the most use of force.\n\nShe should be found guilty for two reasons, because they were violations of policy irrespective of her plea that it was an innocent mistake. Number one, you never should have violated your policy and used a Taser for a traffic stop. And they tried to offer this justification that, oh, she feared it was a life-or-death situation. But when we look at the video, we must remember, never was anybody in a life-or-death situation based on what we can see with our eyes. And everything that Daunte Wright was accused of was a misdemeanor. So, Black people should not be killed in America over misdemeanor pretextual traffic stops. Secondly, when she employed the Taser, she aimed it at his chest. That again was a violation of the policies of the Brooklyn Center Police Department. So she should be convicted on manslaughter, because she was reckless, she was flagrant, and she was reckless in following the policies that she had been trained on for 26 years. She was the training officer teaching rookie cops on how to interact with citizens. And there cannot be a different standard for when they interact with white citizens versus Black citizens.\n\nWe just had the guilty verdict and the plea in Derek Chauvin's case, and I expect we should get a guilty verdict in Kim Potter's case. But I will say this: These are great victories in the interest of justice, but at what cost? George Floyd and Daunte Wright should be living today, enjoying the holidays with their families. These young Black fathers have been taken from their children unjustly and unconstitutionally and unnecessarily.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And I just wanted to clarify, as you said, Kim Potter is a 26-year veteran, not 26-year-old police veteran, and she was training two other officers on the scene. It so much reminds me of the Philando Castile case, because you have a man who is stopped - I mean, remember, in this case, when we talk about air freshener hanging from the mirror, it's those little Christmas tree-like air fresheners. That's the kind of thing that we're talking about, that so many people have. But Philando Castile, who's shot, and his girlfriend, his partner, films him dying, and she ultimately is arrested, just as the partner of Daunte Wright is arrested. They spend more time arresting her than helping him.\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP: Yeah. And that's the tragic circumstance. It seems to be that Black lives don't matter in the moments when they are trying to justify killing another Black person. And you just see them start to conspire to try to cover up something they know is wrong. We have to continue to shine a light on this, because it's happening far too often. Even in the aftermath of George Floyd, we continue to see these unjust killings all over America of unarmed Black people."

      "text": "Malcolm X's family files $100M lawsuit alleging FBI, CIA and NYPD had role in murder\n\nOMAHA - The family of Omaha-born Malcolm X filed a $100 million lawsuit Friday that accuses multiple federal and state law enforcement agencies of playing a role in the murder of the human rights leader nearly 60 years ago.\n\nWith Malcolm X's daughter Ilyasah Shabazz at his side, nationally known civil rights attorney Ben Crump said the family's legal team has been busy \"unearthing\" new evidence since the exoneration in 2021 of two of the three men convicted in Malcolm X's killing.\n\n\"We are not just making history, but we're making a path for justice,\" Crump said at a news conference live streamed from New York. \"We believe, a precedent-setting path for justice for those who have been denied justice by the American legal system for far too long.\"\n\nThe 85-page lawsuit details nine causes of action against the Department of Justice, FBI, CIA and New York Police Department. Announced earlier, the case was officially filed on Friday in a U.S. District Court of New York.\n\nThe Crump-led legal team alleges the government agencies, after playing a \"significant role\" in events leading to Malcolm X's assassination, engaged in a decades-long coverup to shield their involvement.\n\nThe agencies named as defendants either declined to comment or did not respond to a reporter's request for a response.\n\nMalcolm X supporters in Nebraska - where a long and bumpy road preceded Malcolm X's induction this year into his home state's Hall of Fame - said they appreciated the dogged pursuit for justice.\n\nState Sen. Terrell McKinney, who also led this year's effort to honor Malcolm X with a state recognition day , said he hoped that recent events shed more attention on contributions of the oft-misunderstood vocal advocate for Black empowerment.\n\n\"The perception of Malcolm X, I feel, is shifting, which is good,\" said the lawmaker who represents the North Omaha district where the icon was born. \"The more things that highlight who he was and what actually happened bring more light and support for the things he was fighting for, and the strides that still need to be made.\"\n\nNow, nearly a century since his birth in 1925 as Malcolm Little, plans are underway in Omaha to expand a memorial at his birthplace memorial site. A $20 million state grant awarded earlier this year jump-started the fundraising for a museum and cultural education center at the 18-acre property near 35th and Pinkney Streets.\n\nJoAnna LeFlore-Ejike of Omaha, executive director of the Malcolm X Memorial Foundation, has helped lead other local efforts to draw attention to Malcolm X and his work. She recently spoke alongside Ilyasah Shabazz when an artist's Malcolm X bust was unveiled for placement in the Hall of Fame in the State Capitol.\n\nFriday, LeFlore-Ejike said the foundation \"fully supports the Shabazz family in their quest for justice and an accurate historical account of Brother Malcolm's life and his tragic assassination.\"\n\nMalcolm X was 39 years old when he was shot 21 times by multiple gunmen as he was about to give a speech at the Audubon Ballroom in New York on Feb 21, 1965. His wife, Betty Shabazz,  and three older children, including Ilyasah, were there at the time.\n\nIlyasah told reporters Friday that she was grateful on behalf of her five sisters to stand with a legal team aiming to correct history.\n\nA photograph displayed at the event showed her mom, pregnant with twins at the time, trying to help her husband as he lay on the ground.\n\nIlyasah reflected on how her mom, who had survived a firebomb at their house a week earlier, had attempted to save Malcolm X with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. She remarked how her mother later turned the ballroom site into the current Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Education Center -  \"a place of triumph ... to carry his work forward.\"\n\nAccording to the legal complaint, the federal agencies and the New York police department were aware of threats to Malcolm X's life and failed to intervene. It contends that the entities, under the direction of J. Edgar Hoover, then-FBI head, conspired to reduce his protection and left him open to an attack that the legal team asserts the agency knew was imminent.\n\nCrump said that for decades, the FBI and its leaders viewed Black activism as a threat to national security.\n\nThe lawsuit says that defendant Hoover in 1956 codified a secret, nationwide program known as the Counterintelligence Program, or COINTELPRO, which labeled prominent Black activists as extremists and targeted leaders such as Malcolm X, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., members of the Black Panther Party and others.\n\nA news release said the Malcolm X family and the legal team seek \"accountability for the systemic negligence and intentional actions that deprived Malcolm X's family and the world of his life and legacy.\"\n\nCrump said his team, which seeks a jury trial, will lay out how the FBI and CIA collaborated with undercover agents within the Nation of Islam. The team alleged in the lawsuit that despite knowing the threats at hand, law enforcement arrested key security guards days before Malcolm X was killed, reducing his protection.\n\nThe security guards have come forth with statements that they were drawn away, said Crump, to make Malcolm X an easier target.\n\nHe said his team also has learned that federal agents, including undercover operatives, were in the ballroom during the assassination and did not intervene.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Malcolm X is described as one of the greatest Black liberation leaders and public intellectuals of his generation: a minister, teacher, human rights activist, founding member of the Organization of Afro-American Unity and Muslim Mosque, who \"fought against racism, colonialism, and oppression, and advocated for Black people to engage in self-determination.\"\n\nCrump spoke with several other prominent civil rights lawyers who are members of the legal team, including Shabazz family attorney Ray Hamlin.\n\nHamlin said the family's battle for justice has been going on for decades and is bolstered by new information shaken loose recently, and since two of the three men convicted for Malcolm X's death were exonerated three years ago.\n\nLaw enforcement investigators, during the renewed probe led by then-Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, had found shaky evidence and that authorities withheld information. The exonerated men later received a reported $36 million settlement from the city and state of New York.\n\n\"We will ensure that his message lives on,\" Hamlin said of Malcolm X, \"and that he will not be silenced.\"\n\nMalcolmX Complaint\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\n\nNebraska Examiner is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

      "text": "Malcolm X assassination: Former security guards reveal new details pointing to conspiracy\n\nOn the 59th anniversary of the assassination of Malcolm X, two former security guards are speaking out for the first time about how they were falsely arrested by the New York Police Department as part of a conspiracy to remove his protection before he was killed. We hear from Khaleel Sayyed, 81, who says he was detained on trumped-up charges just days before Malcolm X was fatally shot, and we speak with Ben Crump and Flint Taylor, two civil rights attorneys who are working with the family. They are calling on New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a former police officer, to support the release of key evidence in the case. We are \"trying to peel back the layers to finally, after 59 years, get some measure of justice for Malcolm X's family,\" says Crump. Taylor also places the assassination in the context of police and the FBI targeting Black civil rights leaders through COINTELPRO, such as Fred Hampton, which he helped expose in a landmark case in Chicago.\n\nThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: It was 59 years ago this week that civil rights leader Malcolm X was assassinated, February 21st, 1965, as he stood at the podium before a crowd here in New York in Harlem's Audubon Ballroom. His wife, Betty Shabazz, pregnant with twins, and his four daughters were in the ballroom looking on. As Malcolm began speaking, a man shouted, accusing another of picking his pocket, creating a disturbance. A smoke bomb was thrown. Amidst the confusion, three gunmen at the front of the hall opened fire. Malcolm was hit 17 times in the ensuing hail of bullets. He died on the stage as chaos erupted.\n\nOn Wednesday night, at what is now the Malcolm X and Betty Shabazz Center in Washington Heights, Malcolm's daughter Ilyasah Shabazz recalled that horrifying day.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Malcolm X's daughter Dr. Ilyasah Shabazz, speaking last night at the former Audubon Ballroom, now the Malcolm and Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Education Center, during a commemoration marking the 59th anniversary of the assassination of Malcolm X. Malcolm X often began his speeches, including the one that was cut short by that hail of bullets, by addressing everyone in the room. This a speech he gave in 1964 at the Audubon Ballroom.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: Well, 59 years after Malcolm X's assassination this week, two former members of his security team have come forward for the first time to reveal details of their entrapment and imprisonment by New York police just days before he was killed. Yesterday, one of the two men and family members of Malcolm X appeared at a press conference. This is 81-year-old Khaleel Sultarn Sayyed.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: So, that was 81-year-old Khaleel Sultarn Sayyed, speaking Wednesday alongside our next two guests, who are fighting for justice for Malcolm X's family to expose the depth of the government's involvement in the assassination of the civil rights icon, both the NYPD and the FBI. We're joined now by Ben Crump, civil rights attorney, and Flint Taylor, lawyer and co-founder of the People's Law Office in Chicago.\n\nWe welcome you both back to Democracy Now! Ben Crump, let's begin with you. Can you put that testimony in context? I was there last year for the 58th anniversary of Malcolm X's assassination, when you also held a news conference revealing new information. Talk about this year and the significance of what these two men had to say.\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP: Thank you so much, Amy.\n\nIt is quite significant when you consider last year Mustafa Hassan, who was shown in photographs in The New York Times was present in the Audubon theater the day Malcolm X was assassinated - in fact, he was the one who was seen grabbing one of the assailants as he tries to escape after shooting Malcolm X. And his testimony was very riveting, because he said there was no presence of uniformed New York police officers, and they came up after all the chaos after Malcolm had been shot, and the first thing he heard them say, \"Is he with us? Is he one of us?\" as if even NYPD knew there were undercover police officers in the Audubon theater that day, and they didn't know what they had done in the theater that day.\n\nAnd now this year, we have two additional witnesses, who have never before spoken, come and offer new evidence. These were members of Malcolm X's security team: Walter Bowe, who is now 93 years old, who was a charter member of the OAAU with Malcolm X, as well as Khaleel Sayyed, who we just heard from. And both of these individuals were framed by Ray Wood, who, unbeknownst to them, was an undercover police officer working with BOSSI and the FBI. And he -\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Explain what BOSSI is.\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP: It's the Bureau of Special Services, that was specifically targeted to infiltrate Black organizations. They infiltrated the Black Panthers, CORE, as well as Malcolm X's organization and the Nation of Islam there in the city of New York. They were an arm, if you would have, like a little brother to the FBI there in New York. And so, what they were doing, we believe, was carrying out the deeds at the behest of J. Edgar Hoover at the very top.\n\nAnd these young men, just as other individuals have been wrongfully convicted to cover up for the conspiracy to assassinate Malcolm X, they were arrested five days before Malcolm X was assassinated. They believe that their arrests had everything to do with Ray Wood and BOSSI and the FBI trying to be complicit, if you would, in Malcolm X's assassination. And so, that's why attorney Flint Taylor and I and Ray Hamlin and our legal team are trying to peel back the layers to finally, after 59 years, get some measure of justice for Malcolm X's family.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: And, Ben Crump, could you explain what was the pretext for their arrests? Can you talk about the destroy the Statue of Liberty conspiracy?\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP: Absolutely. So, this wasn't the only time we saw the workings of Raymond Wood, this undercover New York police officer. He also used this to have the members of the Panther 21. Afeni Shakur, Tupac Shakur's mother, was a member of the Panther 21. And they were all arrested under this pretense that they were endeavoring to bomb United States monuments - namely, the Statue of Liberty. Well, that's the same exact thing that they said about Khaleel Sayyed and Walter Bowe, Malcolm X's security members. They said that they were out to bomb the Statue of Liberty. I mean, you would think that they could come up with something new. But all of these Black self-determination organizations, they would infiltrate them and try to say, \"Oh, they were conspiring to bomb the Statue of Liberty, so we have to arrest them.\" And so, that's exactly what they did to Panther 21, and it's exactly what they did to Malcolm X's security detail. They came up with a bogus theory and had them convicted of crimes that was orchestrated by undercover police officers.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Now, Ben Crump, can you talk about the man who was in the Audubon Ballroom with a long gun under his trench coat, the one who was set free?\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP: Certainly. As attorney Flint Taylor from the People's Law Office in Chicago, who has joined our legal team to get justice for Malcolm X's family, articulated, Bradley, this individual, who we know from the files that have been revealed, had a shotgun and was one of the killers of Malcolm X, yet he was not arrested. He was able to leave the Audubon Ballroom free. And they arrested two innocent people, we believe, to cover up for those individuals who they knew were responsible for Malcolm X's death.\n\nAnd this Bradley fellow was then, four years later, arrested for a bank robbery, he and his accomplice. His accomplice was in prison for 25 years, but yet Bradley was allowed to escape - walk away out the jail scot-free. And so, you know that they have something connected with this Bradley character, if he continues to commit major crimes, federal crimes, and yet the government lets him walk scot-free, as if he has something that they are connected, to say that he will have no culpability for his dastardly deeds.\n\nAnd that's why we want these files. We want these files to see what connections, to see who were those undercover agents that were in the Audubon Ballroom the day Malcolm X was assassinated. And the reality is this here. It's 59 years later. Who are they trying to protect? What person's life will be put in danger 59 years later? They continue to offer us excuse after excuse after excuse every time we get FOIAs for the information. They even went so far as to tell us that one of the reasons they can't give us the information that we request on the surveillance of Malcolm X and the documentation that they have on Malcolm X is because Malcolm X is potentially still alive.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Is potentially still alive? Let's bring Flint Taylor in right now. You stood there in the Audubon Ballroom, the site where Malcolm X was gunned down 59 years ago this week, yesterday with the family of Malcolm X, with Dr. Ilyasah Shabazz, with Ben Crump. But you're actually based in Chicago. And if you can talk about why it is possible, almost 60 years later, all of these documents do not become public, and the experience you have back in Chicago trying to get information on another leader, the Black Panther leader, Fred Hampton and Mark Clark, when they were gunned down in 1969?\n\nFLINT TAYLOR: Good morning. Thank you for having me on.\n\nYes, it was a very powerful experience standing there, for the first time for me, in that ballroom. And as you may know, I stood in the blood of Fred Hampton the morning that he was assassinated 55 years ago. And, of course, that had a similarly powerful effect on me and the people in the People's Law Office at that time. And that started us on a 13-year battle to find out the truth and to change the narrative of what happened to Fred Hampton, the young, 21-year-old, very articulate, very powerful, very charismatic leader, young Black Panther leader.\n\nAnd, of course, at first, they talked about it as a shootout. And as we got into the litigation and as the community raised the case in the public eye over years, we were able to fight to get evidence that was covered up, by the FBI predominantly, that there was this COINTELPRO program, Counterintelligence Program, a super-secret program that was targeting the Black Panthers, attempting to destroy the Black Panthers at that time - it came from Hoover in Washington - and that it also claimed as part of its program dealing with what they call messiahs, who would bring together and lead the Black liberation movement. And they cited to Malcolm X as one of those messiahs.\n\nSo, there's evidence that is starting to come out about Malcolm X. That piece existed back then. But what's coming out now, as attorney Crump has mentioned, is this file on William Bradley, an FBI file, and a statement straight from Hoover that said there were nine informants, FBI informants, in the ballroom, and that at all costs they should not let those informants be known, and at all costs not let it be known what they might have been doing, and whether they were working, of course, for COINTELPRO, because we know that what the FBI was doing was trying to foment the split between the Nation of Islam and Malcolm and his organization. So, you put this evidence together, and you demand more evidence about Bradley, about those informants, about BOSSI's role. And BOSSI seems to be kind of a junior FBI COINTELPRO program in New York. I shouldn't say \"seems to be,\" but was. And so, that's where we stand.\n\nAnd that's one of the reasons that attorney Crump asked me and my office to come in, because we fought this case, similar case, an assassination case, that had in it the FBI covered up the Chicago police informants. Of course, the main informant in our case in Chicago was William O'Neal, who set up the assassination of Fred Hampton. So those same questions come up here. And after Cyrus Vance revealed the tip of the iceberg with regard to the FBI files that had been suppressed and the BOSSI files that had been destroyed, that's when attorney Crump and, of course, the family and now the People's Law Office have become involved.\n\nAnd we feel that it's not only a civil case for justice, but that it's a human rights case. And it's not only a case that has significance in New York, not only significance nationally, but it has international significance. And I think attorney Crump and I are both calling on the mayor of the city of New York and the federal government for transparency, for giving us these files and for, in fact, all these years later, making reparations. And that's what it is. It's reparations, not unlike the reparations that we fought for and obtained in Chicago for the survivors of police torture. It's reparations to the family. It's reparations to the community of New York and nationally, in terms of justice and in terms of compensation.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Ben Crump, let's end with you. Flint just mentioned the mayor of New York, right? Eric Adams is a former police officer. Have you spoken with him? Is he joining the call for the documents, both in BOSSI and the New York Police Department and the FBI, to be opened, more than a half a century after Malcolm X's assassination?\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP: At this time, we are unaware if he will join us in that call for transparency. I know that in past conversations, Ilyasah and myself have felt assured that New York Police Department would - I'm sorry, the city leadership in New York would do the right thing here and help Malcolm X's family finally get justice. Now, with attorney Flint Taylor and I and our legal team, we have put the ball squarely in their court to be able to tell us if they're going to be on the right side of history 59 years later. Will they give up their records?\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Well, Ben Crump, we're going to leave it there. We're going to ask you to stay for a few minutes so we can ask about the Houston police shooting of Eboni Pouncy, an amazing story, with video just revealed, and we'll post it at democracynow.org . Ben Crump, civil rights attorney. Flint Taylor, co-founder of People's Law Office of Chicago. To see all our coverage of the Malcolm X assassination, go to democracynow.org .

During the interview, GMA anchor Janai Norman asked RowVaughn Wells about the part of the footage where her son could be heard calling her name in agony as he was beaten by police officers.\n\nReacting to that part of the footage, she said, \"It was very difficult. As a mother, you want to always be there when your children need you. So when I heard that my son was calling my name and I wasn't there for him, that just hurt my heart.\"\n\nShe also shared her take on the charges brought against the Memphis police officers involved.\n\n\"After the charges were explained to me, I'm actually okay with the charges,\" she said. \"The district attorney and the Chief of police has done an excellent job in getting this done quickly and swiftly, and we still have more to do.\"\n\nAt one point during the interview, Nichols' stepfather also weighed in when he was asked about the other first responders and officers who were also on the scene.\n\n\"Mr. Well, what do you think of the other first responders who were there, the sheriff's deputies who have since been relieved of duty?\" Norman asked. \"Do you think that there are others who should also be charged?\"\n\n\"When asked whether or not some of them should face charges,\" Rodney Wells said, \"Most definitely. It looks as though it may be maybe five, six other police officers that should be charged in this case.\"\n\nSo far, there are five Black police officers facing charges in connection with Nichols' deadly beating. However, Rodney Wells has also raised about the white officer who was also involved as he wondered why he hasn't been charged.\n\n\"There was also at the initial encounter with my son, there was a white officer that was tasing my son,\" he said. \"And we don't understand how come his name was not put out there or mentioned in this whole fiasco. So, yes, I think that there should be quite a few additional charges.\"\n\nCrump also shed light on the dominant issue that continues to plague communities across the country.\n\n\"It's institutionalized police culture that continues to have implicit bias whether the office is black, Hispanic, or white, where the excessive force continues to be exerted against black people and brown people,\" Crump explained. \"We don't see our white brothers and sisters who are unarmed, brutalized like this by police, and we have to finally get police reforms. Rovan continues to pray like so many.\"\n\nWatch the video below or at this link."

Doctors took tissue samples from her womb, unknowingly, that went on to become one of the most productive cell lines, leading to groundbreaking research that became a cornerstone of modern medicine, from cancer care and HIV/AIDS treatment to helping scientists produce remedies for several diseases, including the first polio vaccine and even COVID-19 vaccines. Her cells were just known as \"HeLa\" cells - H-E-L-A - the first two letters of Henrietta Lacks's first and last name. But even her family had no clue about her legacy until more than 20 years after her death.\n\nThe new lawsuit denounces a racist medical system and accuses Thermo Fisher of using the HeLa cell line without their consent, while making billions of dollars in profit. The family announced the lawsuit on Monday, 70 years to the day after Henrietta Lacks's death. This is her granddaughter, Kimberly Lacks.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: For more, we go to Baltimore to speak to Ron Lacks, one of the grandsons of Henrietta Lacks, author of Henrietta Lacks: The Untold Story . We are also joined by one of the family's attorneys, the leading civil rights lawyer Ben Crump.\n\nWe welcome you both to Democracy Now! Ben, let's start with you. Talk about why you're suing this particular pharmaceutical company and more about what happened to Henrietta Lacks.\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP: Surely, Amy. Thank you for having Ron and I to talk about this landmark lawsuit, that is based on the principle of not just simple justice, not just social justice, but this lawsuit is based largely, in part, on this notion of genetic justice - the belief that justice should flow from one generation to the next.\n\nWe have sued Thermo Fisher Scientific, and there will be others, who have derived benefit from the immortal cells of Henrietta Lacks 'til this day. And we believe unjust enrichment is the legal theory, that is well established, that allows the estate of Henrietta Lacks to make this claim, that taking her cells was wrong. And the law says if you are unjustly enriched from the wrongdoing, then you should not be allowed to continue to benefit at the peril of the victim, which is Henrietta Lacks.\n\nAnd that's why her family, her linear descendants, are saying, \"Why is it that Henry Ford's family can define his legacy and benefit from his legacy and pass it on to generations of his legacy and unborn children who have yet to come into the world?\" But their grandmother, this Black woman, her great contributions to medicine, her story is being told by everybody else. They are saying, \"We get the right to define her legacy.\" Everybody else is benefiting. Pharmaceutical companies are making billions upon billions of dollars from Henrietta Lacks' miraculous [inaudible] - and their family hasn't received -\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Ben Crump, let me ask you - you're freezing a little bit on Skype. But the company, Thermo Fisher, why just one company then?\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP: Well, we believe there will be others. There were many corporations in the aftermath of George Floyd who made a commitment to social justice, because they watched George Floyd suffer for nine minutes and 29 seconds. I submit that what Henrietta Lacks went through was equal, if not far worse than what George Floyd suffered. So, for all those pharmaceutical companies who have made billions, who made the commitment to social justice in the aftermath of George Floyd, well, you can prove that commitment by doing right by Henrietta Lacks finally, do right by her, say her name, because her life mattered and Black lives matter. You acknowledge that she was, you know, miraculous. Her cells are the cornerstone of modern medicine, with having medical vaccines created from her cells, or developed, with polio, with cancer research. They did in vitro advancements, COVID-19 vaccination -\n\nAMY GOODMAN: What were so special about Henrietta Lacks's cells?\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP: Well, you know, that's a great question. Everybody should know the name of Henrietta Lacks, I mean, not just people in America but all over the globe, because her cells, for the first time in the history of the world, survived outside of her body. They did this medical experiment in Johns Hopkins, which was tantamount to medical racism, because they used her as a lab rat, as they used many other Black people in that era. But they took the cells. They were trying to see if a cell could survive outside of the body. And nobody to that point could, but Henrietta Lacks' miraculous cells not only survived, but they regenerated every 24 hours and kept regenerating every time they would [inaudible]. The cell would continue to regenerate from another cell. And so, this was a medical marvel for scientists to be able to use research of actual cells.\n\nAnd so, her cells have saved millions and millions of lives. And so, that's why, as her grandson Ron Lacks says, his grandmother is up in heaven, and she's looking down and saying, \"How tremendous it is that my cells are doing all these good things,\" and she sees all these companies making all this money - I mean, billions of dollars - and she says, \"Well, what about my children? What about my family?\"\n\nAnd that's why we're bringing this landmark case, not only based in these principles of civil rights but also in the theory of unjust enrichment, because equity would demand, justice would demand, that Henrietta Lacks' estate is allowed to benefit from the use of her cells. Thermo Fisher does not have intellectual property rights over her cells superior to her flesh and blood.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: We're going to go to Ron in one second, but, Ben Crump, I watched your news conference carefully on Monday. That was 70 years to the day that Henrietta Lacks died, and you made a reference to her suffering at the end of her life. Yes, she was a cervical cancer patient, but you talked about radioactive rods being put inside her - can you explain? - that weren't actually - this procedure wasn't done to help her?\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP: Absolutely. They were not trying to help her with her cancer. They were experimenting with her, using her as a lab rat, as with the time in the 1950s with Black people. We must remember, this was the era when they did the Tuskegee experiment. They did the Alabama appendectomy, where people like Fannie Lou Hamer, Black women, went to hospitals and were lied to. They said they were treating them, and they actually sterilized them, where they could have no children. And you had Black soldiers during this time, in World War II, being put in gas chambers with faulty gas masks so they could study the effects of the gas chambers on the human body. And when those Black soldiers complained, Amy, they were court-martialed and put in prison.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And as a result of the medical experimentation on the African American community, like Tuskegee, you have the situation where African Americans today are concerned about the COVID-19 vaccine, asking, \"Is there experimentation being done right here?\"\n\nBut I want to go right now to Ron Lacks, the grandson of Henrietta Lacks and the author of Henrietta Lacks: The Untold Story .\n\nRon, thanks so much for joining us. Your grandmother has led to so many medical breakthroughs because of her line, her cell line, the HeLa cells. I was just talking to a science student who said he was told it was based on a Helen Lane. And, of course, it's the first two letters of both of her names, Henrietta Lacks. When did you learn how that cell line was being used? And talk about the significance of this lawsuit.\n\nRON LACKS: Through my mother, Bobbette Lacks. She uncovered it when she was having lunch with a neighbor. And she was introduced as Bobbette Lacks. And a professor said, \"We're working with someone's cells named Henrietta Lacks.\" And then my mother told him, \"That's my mother-in-law.\" And that's when we first found out, in 1973.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: So, talk about growing up as the grandson of Henrietta Lacks and what you understood, and how you actually learned about what happened with your grandmother, and what caused you to write your book, Henrietta Lacks: The Untold Story .\n\nRON LACKS: Well, when they started doing interviews with my family, that's when more information about what was going on at the time. So, I was young. I was a teenager. So I didn't understand it too much until later years, when I found out all what her cells has been doing. And my father, I watched him try to get lawyers, with no success. So, he was - my parents was trying to find out what was going on with the cells and who was doing what. And we found out that pharmaceuticals was enriching themselves. So, my father, like I said, unsuccessfully, tried. And coming up, it took a strain on him, because he watched his mother when he was a teenager. The radiation bars that was inserted in her took its toll on his mother, and he watched that. And he's disturbed from that right to this day.\n\nSo, when this hit the media, they took a different approach to the family. Where my father was trying to explain what was going on with him trying to get control of Henrietta's legacy, they turned their back on him, even at a meeting with NIH and Johns Hopkins, and my dad was there with his attorney. And they had Rebecca Skloot on the line, mainly listening to what she had to say, instead of my dad and his attorney.\n\nSo, I've seen the total disrespect to my father. And I had to get what he experienced from his mother to what we was going through. And the world should know what was done to this family. They tried to divide us. They tried to keep us in the dark about things. And I had to tell the story. It's a very interesting story, what we went through. And I think no family should ever go through this.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And then, talk about your attempts to bring lawsuits to challenge, reshape the narrative of your grandmother, and then going on your book tour, one place, and making the final connection in this latest lawsuit.\n\nRON LACKS: Well, like I said, they tried for years to get attorneys to take this case up. This is Johns Hopkins' backyard, so we wasn't getting nowhere. Only allies that we had was University of Maryland and Danny Glover, you know, the only ones that would respect the Lacks family. So, when I went to Texas on my first booking sign in, they embraced me, and I talked to the congregation there, and I met a young man, and he introduced me to Ben Crump. And that's when the light got shined on this situation. And I'm so happy. God is good.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: So, can you talk about how your family was defamed, the stories told about your family that were untrue, to discredit you, to try not to seek some kind of reparations for what happened to your grandmother?\n\nRON LACKS: Well, OK, for one thing, Rebecca Skloot has embarrassed Henrietta's children, all four of them. She called my dad, Sonny and Abdul greedy, because they're only in this for the money. But my father and them was in this ever since 1973, just trying to get the rights to his grandmother's legacy. And Henrietta Lacks signed her name with an X -\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Rebecca Skloot, of course, is the author of another book on Henrietta Lacks, that has been a multiyear best-seller, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks . Go ahead, Ron.\n\nRON LACKS: Exactly. And she had in there that my grandmother signed her name with an X. That's why I put in the back of my book, with a poem, my grandmother's John Hancock, right in the back. She had beautiful penmanship. And illiterate - trying to say that my grandmother was illiterate. She wasn't. She was a beautiful, Black, intelligent woman that loved her family and loved her neighbors. So, my grandmother would feed the neighborhood. And now you're asking her not to feed her children? That don't sound right to me. She was a wonderful woman.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: What does it mean, as you move forward, your family standing together at this lawsuit, the grandchildren speaking up for your parents, the children of Henrietta Lacks?\n\nRON LACKS: For a next generation, that's what I'm saying, that the Lacks family needs to take back control of Henrietta's legacy, so we can pass down to the next generation of Lackses, so they won't have to go through this fight that my grandfather and my dad went through. So that's why I had to speak out and tell my story.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Ron Lacks, I want to thank you for being with us, grandson of Henrietta Lacks, author of Henrietta Lacks: The Untold Story , speaking to us from Baltimore, and Ben Crump, civil rights attorney, speaking to us from Houston.\n\nComing up, we speak to historian Keisha Blain, author of the new book, Until I Am Free: Fannie Lou Hamer's Enduring Message to America . All that and more, coming up."

      "text": "Man who filmed Ahmaud Arbery's death investigated in unrelated sex crimes\n\nThe man who filmed the fatal shooting of 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery and was later charged with murder in his death is now the subject of a state investigation on unrelated sex crimes, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. The Camden County Sheriff's Office asked the state bureau to investigate \"based on allegations made against William 'Roddie' Bryan, Jr.,\" the GBI tweeted Friday. \"The investigation is active and ongoing.\"\n\nBen Crump, an attorney representing Arbery's family, said in a tweet Friday that Bryan, who also faces a charge of criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment in Arbery's case, was denied bail. \"We must keep the pressure ON and get #JusticeforAhmaud,\" Crump said.\n\nThe video Bryan captured shows the moments leading up to Arbery's death on Feb. 23 in the Satilla Shores neighborhood, which is in South Georgia. Arbery was allegedly jogging when former cop and prosecutor's investigator Gregory McMichael and his son Travis McMichael hunted him down, accused him of trespassing onto the site of a home under construction, and killed Arbery. Bryan and the McMichaels were arraigned in court Friday in Brunswick, and they all pleaded not guilty, according to Channel 2 Action News.\n\nBryan's attorney Kevin Gough, made his client's case for bail before court Friday to News 4 Jax. \"Keeping him in jail isn't accomplishing anything,\" he said. \"Roddie is struggling in there. He's not used to being in jail. He lost his house, his car, his job and everything, everything he has left in the world is in storage. If he can get back out, he can reclaim his life.\"\n\nAssistant District Attorney Jesse Evans said during court the sex crimes investigation only \"heightens the risk of flight\" in Bryan's case, and Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, made a similar plea, News 4 Jax reported. \"Each time I visit there, I fear running into either man who killed my son,\" she said. \"William Bryan does not feel he did anything wrong. What is to stop him from doing it again?\"\n\nSuperior Court Judge Timothy Walmsley ultimately denied Bryan's bail as well as a motion requesting District Attorney Joyette Holmes be taken off the case, and another calling for a gag order, News 4 Jax reported. Marcus Arbery Sr., Ahmaud Arbery's father, applauded the court's decision in a statement Crump tweeted on behalf of Marcus Arbery. \"Bryan knowingly participated in the lynching of Ahmaud Arbery by documenting his murder, making it impossible for him to escape, and doing nothing to stop his murder,\" he said in the tweet.\n\nMarcus Arbery added: \"I suffered the deepest loss a father can endure when the McMichaels, with the knowing participation of William 'Roddie' Bryan jr., acted as my son's judge, jury and executioners.\"\n\nCrump also praised Holmes in his statement as a \"deeply experienced\" and \"excellent choice to prosecute this case.\" She is the first Black woman to serve as Cobb County's district attorney, and she was appointed to the Arbery case after a prosecutorial misconduct investigation was announced for two other Georgia prosecutors. A special prosecutor also stepped away from the case that took 74 days to even produce an arrest.\n\n\"It's ironic that the defendants are asserting their innocence and enjoying the American right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty,\" Crump said. \"Because they denied Ahmaud Arbery that basic right by presuming him guilty based on the color of his skin and ending his life.\""

      "text": "Woman suing Harvard for photos of enslaved ancestors says history is at stake\n\nWho has the right to own photos of slaves? We speak with Tamara Lanier, the great-great-great-granddaughter of Papa Renty, the enslaved man whose image was captured in a 19th century photograph currently owned by Harvard University. She is suing the school, accusing it of unfairly profiting from the images. We also speak with her attorney, Benjamin Crump.\n\nThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: We begin in Massachusetts, where the descendant of two enslaved people who were captured in mid-19th century photographs has sued Harvard University, accusing the university of unfairly profiting from their images. Tamara Lanier of Connecticut argues, in a lawsuit filed this month, that she and other descendants of Renty and Delia, two people held in bondage 169 years ago, should hold the rights to their photographs, not Harvard. Renty and Delia were forced to pose for the photographs in 1850 by a well-known Harvard professor, Louis Agassiz, and he commissioned the images to support his theory of polygenism, which purports that human races have different origins and that Africans and African Americans were inferior to whites. The theory was used to justify the ongoing enslavement of black people prior to the Civil War, as well as segregation.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: The images of Renty and Delia were used in a recent Harvard conference titled \"Universities and Slavery: Bound by History.\" This comes after administrators at Harvard and other elite universities have admitted they were founded largely through the labor of enslaved African people and profits generated by the slave trade.\n\nWell, for more, we're joined by two guests. Tamara Lanier is the plaintiff in the lawsuit against Harvard University, the great-great-great-granddaughter of Renty, the enslaved man whose image was captured in the mid-19th century daguerreotype owned by Harvard. Also with us, famed civil rights lawyer Benjamin Crump, representing Tamara Lanier in the lawsuit against Harvard University over the images of her ancestors.\n\nWe welcome you both to Democracy Now! Tamara, let's begin with you. Explain how you discovered that Harvard had these photographs of your relatives, of your ancestors.\n\nTAMARA LANIER: It's quite an amazing story, that started with a request by my mother that I document our lineage, our genealogy. And at her passing, I set out to do exactly that. And that was in 2010, where the internet wasn't as-the information wasn't as readily available as today. And I happened to be out walking for lunch one afternoon, and I stopped into a small ice cream shop. And I was speaking with the owner about my dilemma, and he offered to help. And it was actually him, Richard Morrison, of Norwich, who found the images on the internet.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Found the images. And how did you know that Renty was your great-great-great-grandfather?\n\nTAMARA LANIER: As a child, my mom often talked about her enslaved ancestors, particularly the man in the image, who she fondly referred to as Papa Renty. And she also talked about the fact, you know, of our lineage, how our family was broken apart by slavery. She remembered some of the family names. And so, when I met with Rich that afternoon, I gave him the names and the information that my mom had shared with me. And I didn't return to the ice cream shop for a while thereafter.\n\nBut when I did return, he said he had found amazing information on the internet, and particularly a picture of my grandfather. And the images-the information that Rich sent me included a narrative about who Louis Agassiz was. But he sent me an email with a number of links. And I remember reading the information about Louis Agassiz and being overwhelmed and shocked by it. And then, when I opened the link to the picture of Renty, it was a moment for me, because I knew immediately that this was the man that I had heard so much about throughout my childhood.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Benjamin Crump, could you talk about what you know of how Harvard acquired or utilized these photographs, and why your lawsuit argues that they never legally owned the images that they are profiting from?\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP: Certainly. It was the director Steve McQueen who told the story of Solomon Northup in his Oscar-winning movie 12 Years a Slave . Well, Renty is 169 years a slave. And the basic questions that our lawsuit asks is, one, \"How long will Harvard continue to condone slavery?\" and, two, \"When will Harvard University finally free Renty?\"\n\nHarvard University's professor Louis Agassiz was a racist. While Abraham Lincoln was talking about Emancipation Proclamation, he was going around the country professing that he could prove scientifically that black people were inferior to white people. He was an equal opportunity bigot, because he also fought to keep Jews and people from Ireland out of Harvard University. But in particular, he was focused on black people, proving that they were inferior. And so he wrote all these horrible things about black people to justify the continued enslavement of black people.\n\nAnd he sought to obtain ocular proof. And that's why he went down to South Carolina, because he was looking for a \"pure African,\" because after the ban on transporting slaves and importing slaves into America in 1807, many of the slave masters had sexually assaulted and raped so many black women that there were very few \"pure Africans,\" as Louis Agassiz had noted. So, he went to Charleston, South Carolina, and started looking there. But he found, in Columbia, South Carolina, at Benjamin Franklin Taylor's plantation, Renty and his daughter Delia. And he-they were referred to as \"the black African.\" And I remember Tamara asking her mother, \"But why did they call them 'the black African'? We're all from Africa.\" She did not know at that time about Louis Agassiz and that he was referred to as \"the black African\" because everybody knew that he was a \"pure African.\" And this is what Louis Agassiz had been looking for to support his racist beliefs.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And in terms of how Harvard-Harvard only discovered these photographs-right?-that they were stored in a file cabinet in one of its museums-back about 40 years ago. Could you talk about how they've used them since?\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP: Yes, sir. Harvard has used the pictures. They've licensed them. These daguerreotypes are very, very valuable. They are the earliest known photographs of American slaves and some of the earliest known photographs in America using this daguerreotype. And so, Harvard licensed them to be used in films. They were seen apparently in the movie Roots . And they've been used in several books. They are located in the Peabody Museum, that charges reproduction fees and such.\n\nBut really, it is priceless to Tamara Lanier and her family, because they're the linear descendants. And when Abraham Lincoln and the United States government freed black people in America, we didn't have any land. We didn't have 40 acres and a mule. We at least believe when we were freed, we had the right and ownership to our person. And incumbent in that was our image. But Harvard is telling Ms. Lanier and her family, \"No, no, Renty still belongs to us. He's still our property.\"\n\nAnd so this lawsuit just isn't about Tamara and the linear descendants of Renty; it really is about the linear descendants of all African slaves in America, because slavery was meant to make sure that we've had no familiar pedigree, that we could not trace our lineage. That's why they would break up the male and the female after they procreated, and they would take the children from their parents, because they did not want us to have a concept of family. They wanted us to think of ourselves only as property. And that's why it's so miraculous what Ms. Lanier has done and being able to prove the linear descendancy of her family, because many of us black people in America, we cannot do that, because the primary foundation of slavery was to make sure we couldn't do that, when they sold us off and changed our last names to whoever the plantation owner was.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: In 2016, Harvard University installed a plaque to commemorate four enslaved people who lived and worked at Wadsworth House, the one-time home of Harvard presidents. In an article for The Harvard Crimson , then-Harvard President Drew Faust wrote, quote, \"Slavery is an aspect of Harvard's past that has rarely been acknowledged or invoked. ... But Harvard was directly complicit in America's system of racial bondage from the College's earliest days,\" unquote. This is Harvard University former President Faust speaking at the unveiling of the plaque.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: So, that's past Harvard University President Drew Faust speaking at the unveiling of this plaque. Tamara Lanier, as you hear her speak, your thoughts?\n\nTAMARA LANIER: Well, interestingly enough, I received notice of that meeting from someone on social media, and I wrote to her and asked if I could attend that event, and I was denied, or I was told no. What resonates with me in that statement is when she talks about the past will never die and it will continue to shape us in ways that we shouldn't ignore or forget. That's exactly what she did with Renty and his legacy. At that time, she knew about Renty. She knew about me. She knew the stories that I've shared with everyone else. And I specifically asked her, \"Why is it that Harvard, the keeper of these images, is seemingly not interested, when the entire world is amazed?\" And that would have been a great opportunity to reference their legacy with slavery in Renty. But every time they had the opportunity to do the right thing by Renty, they chose not to.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: I wanted to ask you about that, because this lawsuit comes after numerous attempts by you to contact different parts of Harvard University to try to get some response.\n\nTAMARA LANIER: Yes.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Could you talk about that, who you reached out to, and what led you finally to say, \"I have to file a lawsuit\"?\n\nTAMARA LANIER: Virtually everyone. I sent emails. I think, ultimately, Dr. Faust was the last person in Harvard I reached out to. At that time, I think there was the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute. I spoke with professor Charles-at that time he was professor, not doctor-he may have been Dr. Charles Ogletree. I sent emails to Henry Gates.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And what did Charles Ogletree say?\n\nTAMARA LANIER: He was very supportive. He referred me to the Cambridge branch of the NAACP. I did travel to Cambridge and attended one of their meetings, where this was discussed, but not really much traction from that resource. I wrote to history departments, history professors. Again, as I explained in my email to Dr. Faust, I have sent emails almost to the point of ad nauseam , and no response.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: I'm curious what the response of Henry Louis Gates was, since he has spent so much time dealing with heritage and lineage and ancestry.\n\nTAMARA LANIER: He didn't respond.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: He didn't respond at all.\n\nTAMARA LANIER: Not at all.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: So, Benjamin Crump, you have called your lawsuit the most important lawsuit since Brown v. Board of Education . Talk about why.\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP: Certainly, especially as it relates to civil rights. Attorney Mike Koskoff and I have put forth this claim based on well-established precedents of property law. We've argued replevin, conversion, unjust enrichment, and, Amy, something very novel to be pled in contemporary pleadings, we argued that the 13th Amendment of the United States of America, which gave blacks not only the right to be free, but also the right to own property and to enter into contracts. And so, when Renty was freed in 1865, incumbent in that was his right to own his own image.\n\nThis is critical when you think about what Harvard is saying, that \"We own the rights, not your linear descendants.\" Black people didn't get any inheritance from any of our family members, because we were slaves. We couldn't own anything. And so, this lawsuit will speak to many issues that America has never sought to grapple with. They have just assumed that descendants of Africans should not be given anything for our contributions to this country, our over 400 years of free labor building this economy, bearing the cross on our back to make sure that America was able to thrive in the world. And so this lawsuit will speak to that. And if we're successful, it will be the first time that descendants of African slaves are ever given any kind of compensation, any way that the harm has been repaired from slavery.\n\nUntil Harvard condones-condemns what Agassiz did-because they have never done that-there will be a stain on their legacy as one of the world's leading educational institutions, their alumni diplomas will have a taint on it, and there will always be that asterisk there, that they are continuing to condone slavery, because your actions speak louder than your words. And so far, your actions to Tamara Lanier has been outrageous, when you think about their dismissive nature to her. Harvard, you're better than this.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And in terms of this long history of the country failing to live up to what was done during slavery, this calls to mind the Henrietta Lacks story with Johns Hopkins-\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP: Exactly.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: -and them benefiting from her cells. It also comes at a time when there's at least a few, for the first time, presidential candidates actually raising the issue of reparations for descendants of slaves here in the United States. I'm wondering if you could put it in that broader context of the reparations issue?\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP: Certainly. Even though this is well founded in property law, we would be naive to assume people won't see this as a reparations lawsuit. However, we understand that courts don't want to create laws; they leave that for the legislature. But make no mistake about it: It is landmark in its scope, because it will be the first time that descendants of African slaves in America have been compensated in any way, fashion or form from an American institution. And remember, Harvard is readily believed to be the leading American educational institution, with an endowment of $30 billion.\n\nThese photographs have an invaluable meaning to Ms. Lanier, but also to many people who are descendants of slaves. And why should it be locked away at Harvard University? Why shouldn't these daguerreotypes, these photographs, be used to tour the country and be able to talk about these issues of white supremacy that we thought we had overcome? But we know from Charlottesville, Virginia, in recent years, that it has been in vogue again to express that white supremacy may not be as bad as we, as society, has proved it to be, by many people. And to have the president of the United States say that there were good people on both sides is even more alarming. It makes Renty's fight even more relevant. And the young people, students all around the country have been signing petitions and starting to have marches to free Renty. It really heartens me, and it reminds me of what I did in college with Nelson Mandela, when we were talking about the need to have an abolishment of apartheid in South Africa. So, we take great solace regardless of what happens in the court of law, because they don't always get it right, but we take great solace in knowing that we are on the right side of history, and Harvard is not on the right side of history.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Finally, Tamara Lanier, we give you the last word. What do you want to see happen to these photographs?\n\nTAMARA LANIER: Well, I certainly want to consider all of the options. The one thing that I have talked about with my attorneys and with my family is, it's important for me that people know who Renty is and also who-or, who Renty was and who Agassiz was. And I hope that there is a greater education or a reteaching of history, so that we can dispute the legacy that Agassiz has kind of stained my family with.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: His name is all over Harvard.\n\nTAMARA LANIER: His name is all over Harvard.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nFILE - This photo provided by the U.S. Air Force, shows Senior Airman Roger Fortson in a Dec. 24, 2019, photo. (U.S. Air Force via AP)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - The family of a Black U.S. Air Force airman gunned down by a sheriff's deputy in Florida is represented by a prominent civil rights lawyer dubbed \" Black America's attorney general \" for his role in some of the most consequential cases of police brutality over the past decade and a half.\n\nBenjamin Crump rose to prominence representing the families of Trayvon Martin, George Floyd and other Black people whose deaths at the hands of law enforcement officials and vigilantes sparked the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nHe also represented families exposed to lead-contaminated water in Flint, Michigan, as well as the family of the late Henrietta Lacks , a Black woman whose harvested cells became a cornerstone of modern medical advances.\n\nThe 54-year-old civil rights lawyer from Florida has said his mission is to hold police and vigilantes who kill with impunity accountable by making their actions costly in the court of law.\n\n\"What I'm trying to do, as much as I can, even sometimes singlehandedly, is increase the value of Black life,\" Crump told The Associated Press back in 2021.\n\nOn Friday, former Okaloosa County deputy Eddie Duran was charged in the May shooting death of Roger Fortson, a 23-year-old senior airman who had answered his apartment door while holding a gun pointed toward the ground.\n\nHere is a look at some of Crump's most high-profile cases involving Black victims:\n\nThe 17-year-old unarmed teenager was fatally shot in an Orlando suburb in 2012 by a member of the community's neighborhood watch. The following year, Martin's parents settled a wrongful-death claim against the homeowners association for the gated community in Sanford. Crump said at the time the award amount was confidential. In his criminal trial later that year, George Zimmerman, whose father is white and whose mother is Hispanic, claimed self-defense and was ultimately cleared of all charges .\n\nThe unarmed 18-year-old was fatally shot by Darren Wilson, a white police officer, in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014. Brown's death sparked nationwide protests and became a catalyst for the Black Lives Matter movement. But a grand jury declined to indict Wilson, and the U.S. Justice Department opted against civil rights charges. Crump helped Brown's family eventually reach a $1.5 million wrongful death settlement with the city in 2017.\n\nThe 46-year-old died in May 2020 after Derek Chauvin, a white Minneapolis officer, pinned him to the ground with a knee to his neck in the case that sparked nationwide protests and a broader reckoning on racial justice. In March 2021, the city of Minneapolis agreed to pay a $27 million settlement to Floyd's family, which Crump said at the time was the largest pretrial civil rights settlement ever. The following month, Chauvin was convicted of murder and manslaughter.\n\nThe 26 year old was shot and killed in 2020 after Louisville police officers broke down her apartment door to serve a \"no-knock\" search warrant in a drug case. The city settled with Taylor's family for $12 million later that year in an agreement that also stipulated reforms on how warrants are handled by police. One of the former officers pleaded guilty to conspiracy that year while another faces retrial after a jury deadlocked last November over charges that he used excessive force in the botched raid. The Justice Department also filed civil rights charges against four officers in 2022, largely over the faulty warrant used to search Taylor's home. But on Friday, a federal judge dismissed some of the charges against two of the officers.\n\nThe 25-year-old was killed in 2020 while running in a neighborhood outside of the port city of Brunswick, Georgia. The three white men who chased him down in a pickup truck and fired at him with a shotgun at close range were convicted of murder in 2021. They are currently appealing their separate convictions on federal hate crime charges . Arbery's mother, meanwhile, filed a federal lawsuit against the three men and local authorities seeking $1 million.\n\nThe 29-year-old died in the hospital in 2023, three days after Memphis, Tennessee, police officers kicked, punched and hit him with a police baton during a traffic stop. Five now former officers, all Black, have been charged with second-degree murder. One pleaded guilty to federal charges in November. Another is expected to change his not guilty plea Friday. Crump, meanwhile, has filed a lawsuit on behalf of Nichols' family seeking $550 million .\n\n___\n\nFollow Philip Marcelo at twitter.com/philmarcelo .\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/John Minchillo, File)\n\nBen Crump, the Rev. Al Sharpton says, is \"Black America's attorney general.\"\n\nIn less than a decade, the Florida-based attorney has become the voice for the families of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and Tyre Nichols -- Black people whose deaths at the hands of police and vigilantes sparked a movement.\n\nHe has won multimillion-dollar settlements in police brutality cases. He's pushed cities to ban no-knock warrants. He has told a congressional committee that reform is needed because \"it's become painfully obvious we have two systems of justice; one for white Americans and one for Black Americans.\"\n\nAnd he's stood with Black farmers taking on an agribusiness giant, and families exposed to lead-contaminated water in Flint, Michigan.\n\nThis week, he's standing with the family of Ajike Owens , a Black woman fatally shot after going to the Ocala, Florida, apartment of her white neighbor, who earlier had yelled at and allegedly assaulted Owens' children as they played nearby. He called on the state attorney's office to \"zealously prosecute\" the shooter.\n\n\"He's a real believer in what he's doing. He has taken the attacks. He has taken the cases that others wouldn't take,\" Sharpton said, adding, \"People can go to him. The reason I trust him is because he has never misled me. Good or bad, he'll tell me the truth about a client.\"\n\nThese days, he seems to be everywhere. A Florida law school now bears his name . Last year, Netflix released \"Civil,\" a documentary about his civil rights work. And in the year prior, TIME named him to its 100 Most Influential People list.\n\nIn April of 2021, he joined with George Floyd's family in celebrating the conviction of ex-cop Derek Chauvin. Then he was among the mourners at the funeral for Daunte Wright , who was shot during a traffic stop in suburban Minneapolis in the week leading up to Chauvin's verdict - a juxtaposition he finds incredible.\n\n\"If ever there was a time for police to be on their best behavior, if ever there was a time for them to use the greatest standard of care, if ever there was a time for them to de-escalate, it was during this trial, which I believe was one of the most consequential police (and) civil rights cases in our history,\" Crump told The Associated Press in 2021.\n\n___\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: The Associated Press initially published a version of this profile of Ben Crump on May 2, 2021.\n\n___\n\nCritics see him as an opportunist who never fails to show up amid another tragedy. But those who know Crump say he's been fighting for fairness long before his name was in headlines.\n\n\"Where there's injustice, that's where he wants to be,\" said Ronald Haley, a Louisiana attorney, who's among a wide network of lawyers Crump works with on lawsuits. \"He understands he's needed everywhere, but he also understands he can't be everywhere.\"\n\nCrump, 51, is a tireless worker who mixes Southern charm, a talent for attracting media attention to his cases and a firm belief that racism afflicts the nation, and the courts are the place to take it on.\n\nHe has an uncanny way of making his clients feel like kin, they say.\n\n\"He has never missed a Thanksgiving to check in on me, he calls on Christmas,\" said Allisa Findley, who first met Crump three days after her brother, Botham Jean , was fatally shot in his apartment by a white Dallas police officer who mistook the Black man's apartment for her own.\n\n\"Even the little things, he makes time for it, when there are no cameras rolling,\" she said. \"He does feel like family. I consider Ben family.\"\n\nTerrence Floyd, a younger brother of George Floyd, said Crump's attention and care for his family over the last year has bonded them beyond the attorney-client relationship.\n\n\"It feels like it's more family-based than business,\" he said. \"After a while, I went from calling him 'Mr. Crump' to calling him 'Unc,' like he was one of my uncles.\"\n\nCrump keeps up a dizzying schedule that takes him all over, but he makes sure he's home for Sunday services at Bethel Missionary Baptist Church. He lives in Tallahassee with his wife and their 8-year-old daughter, Brooklyn; he also helped raise two cousins and became their legal guardian.\n\n\"I look at my daughter,\" Crump said, \"I look in her eyes, and then I look in the eyes of my nieces and nephews, and my little cousins - all these little Black and brown children. You see so much hope, so much optimism in their eyes. We've got to give them a better world.\"\n\nHe added: \"What I'm trying to do, as much as I can, even sometimes singlehandedly, is increase the value of Black life.\"\n\nCrump's path to becoming a lawyer and advocate began while growing up in Lumberton, North Carolina, where he was the oldest of nine siblings and step-siblings.\n\nIn his book \"Open Season: Legalized Genocide of Colored People,\" he described learning in elementary school that a white classmate's weekly allowance was as much as what his mother made in a week working two jobs at a shoe factory and a hotel laundry.\n\n\"I wanted to understand why people on the white side of the tracks had it so good and Black people on our side of the tracks had it so bad,\" he wrote.\n\nHe often recounts how he learned about the world by reading the newspaper to his grandmother and how his mother taught him the story of famed civil rights lawyer Thurgood Marshall, who became his hero.\n\n\"He has always gravitated toward leadership and being the answer to injustice,\" said Sean Pittman, an attorney who has been his friend for 30 years, since they met at Florida State University. There, Crump was president of the Black Student Union and led protests to bring attention to how the school recruited and treated Black students.\n\nBut his rise from personal injury attorney to a voice of Black America began in 2013 when he represented the family of Trayvon Martin , a teenager killed by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida. He then took on the case for the family of Michael Brown who was fatally shot by a white officer near St. Louis.\n\nCrump organized marches and brought media attention to both of their deaths - each happening during the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nHe has gone on to win financial settlements in about 200 police brutality cases. In March of 2021, the city of Minneapolis agreed to pay $27 million to settle a civil lawsuit from George Floyd's family, which Crump at the time said is the largest pretrial civil rights lawsuit settlement ever.\n\n\"I keep hoping and believing, if we can make them pay multimillions of dollars every time they shoot a Black person in the back, that there will be less Black people shot in the back,\" Crump said. \"That's my theory, but it remains unanswered because they keep killing us.\".\n\nIn recent years, Crump waded into the TV and film world. He had a brief role in the 2017 film \"Marshall,\" which tells of the early life of his hero, who became the first Black U.S. Supreme Court justice.\n\nHis higher profile has brought more scrutiny and turned him into a frequent target. Conservative author Candace Owens in April accused Crump of trying to profit from police shootings and encouraging violent protests.\n\n\"Keeping racial issues alive has become a business in America,\" she told Fox News Channel's Laura Ingraham. \"It's Al Sharpton yesterday, Jesse Jackson tomorrow, Ben Crump today.\"\n\nIt doesn't really bother Crump: \"You can't care what the enemies of equality think of you,\" he said. \"It would be the height of arrogance to think that everybody is going to love you. It's not a popularity contest.\"\n\nIt's fitting that he is now mentioned among the giants of civil rights, said John Bowman, who has known him since Michael Brown's killing and has served as president of the St. Louis County NAACP.\n\n\"I can't get in his head and say he charted out this course, and said, 'I'm going to be the next strongest voice for injustice,'\" Bowman said. \"I do know that when the call was made, he didn't shy away or step back from it.\"\n\nBut Crump says he eventually would like to step back from it all.\n\n\"I literally pray for the day when I can close down the police brutality division of my law firm,\" he said, \"because I am so tired of seeing Black people killed by the police unjustifiably. I'd like to tell my staff that we no longer have to fight in the courts, or be counselors to so many grieving mothers and fathers.\"\n\n____\n\nMorrison reported from New York City.

(AP) - Before Trayvon Martin , George Floyd , Michael Brown , Breonna Taylor and other Black people died at the hands of white police officers or self-appointed vigilantes, there was Martin Lee Anderson.\n\nAnderson, a 14-year-old Black teenager, died in 2006 after he was kicked and beaten by guards at a boot-camp juvenile facility in Florida. His family looked for a lawyer to seek justice. No white attorneys wanted to take it on.\n\nThat was the first high-profile civil rights case at the national level for Ben Crump, a Black attorney from Florida. Now, Crump is a familiar presence at almost every major civil rights case in the country.\n\n\"Ben has always been a fighter for justice ... to shine a light on things that are not right,\" said Leon Russell, chair of the NAACP National Board of Directors.\n\nStaff at the facility where Anderson died were acquitted of criminal charges, but Crump later won a civil case for the boy's family.\n\nThat was only the beginning.\n\nWhen Trayvon Martin, 17, was fatally shot on Feb. 26, 2012, at a condominium complex in Sanford, Florida, his killer, George Zimmerman, was not initially arrested. Zimmerman, whose father is white and whose mother is Hispanic, was a self-appointed, armed neighborhood watcher who eventually claimed self-defense and was acquitted of murder charges.\n\nMartin, wearing a hoodie that would soon become an iconic image, was returning to his father's condo from a convenience store with a can of ice tea and a bag of Skittles when he was confronted by Zimmerman.\n\nCrump pushed for Zimmerman's arrest and joined with many prominent civil rights leaders to stage demonstrations calling for charges.\n\nIt was the Trayvon Martin case that gave rise to the Black Lives Matter movement, and Crump deserves much of the credit for that, the Rev. Jesse Jackson said in an interview with The Associated Press.\n\n\"It was a new stream of consciousness,\" Jackson said. \"We decided we're not going back. Everything else has come out of that. Don't Black lives matter? It made a big difference.\"\n\nCrump has been called Black America's attorney general for his unwavering work on civil rights cases, especially those involving Black people killed by police. In an interview, Crump said he does not take that label lightly.\n\n\"I try as sincerely as possible to give a voice to those who have no voice,\" Crump said. \"If I can see further, it's because I am standing on the shoulders of giants.\"\n\nCrump, 52, was born in Lumberton, North Carolina, one of nine siblings, but wound up attending high school in Plantation, Florida. From there it was Florida State University for college and law school and then a law firm with partner Daryl Parks in Tallahassee. They took on the Martin Lee Anderson case.\n\nNow, Crump has his own firm that handles civil rights cases across the country. He recites an African proverb to illustrate why it is so important to stand up for Black people who are victims of injustice.\n\n\"As long as the lion hunter gets to tell the story of the hunt, and the lions never get to tell the story, then all the glory will always go to the lion hunter,\" Crump said. \"Unless you have the historical knowledge of the culture, to hand down generation upon generation, then we are doomed to repeat the lessons we should have learned.\"\n\nCrump, who is seen almost everywhere a civil rights case emerges, still lives in Tallahassee with his wife Genae, who is assistant principal at a Leon County public school for at-risk kids, and their daughter, Brooklyn. He has won financial settlements in about 200 police brutality cases, including a $27 million settlement for George Floyd's family in the infamous Minneapolis case.\n\nBut he is not without his detractors. Samaria Rice, the mother of 12-year-old Tamir Rice , who was fatally shot by a white Cleveland police officer while holding a toy gun in 2014, released a statement at the time that criticized both Black Lives Matter activists and Crump.\n\nSamaria Rice said they should \"step down, stand back, and stop monopolizing and capitalizing our fight for justice and human rights.\" The statement also questioned whether Crump understood Ohio law. \"I fired him 6-8 months into Tamir's case,\" she wrote.\n\nBut Jackson, who marched with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and was with King when he was assassinated in 1968, said Crump is part of the new generation of civil rights leaders.\n\n\"Now we do have people at the state and national level to hold people accountable. We will have justice,\" Jackson said.\n\nWhen Crump thinks about the Trayvon Martin case, he said it's clear there is much more work to be done.\n\n\"Are we making progress? Are we going backwards?\" he said. \"I think about Trayvon Martin and the unknown Trayvon Martins, so often, when we think about the history of America. Who tells their story? Every day is a new day for us to make history.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(Travis Long/The News & Observer via AP, File)\n\nA South Florida law school on Thursday announced the creation of a social justice center named after Ben Crump, the Black civil rights attorney who has gained national prominence representing victims of police brutality and vigilante violence.\n\nThe Benjamin L. Crump Center for Social Justice, housed at the St. Thomas University College of Law in Miami Gardens, aims to nurture the next generation of civil rights lawyers while also pushing more racial and gender diversity in the legal profession, school officials told The Associated Press ahead of the announcement.\n\nCalls for racial justice grew louder in the wake of the 2020 protests over George Floyd's murder by a Minneapolis police officer. But the nation lacks a robust pipeline of social justice lawyers ready to take on such cases, said Crump, who has represented the families of Floyd, Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Breonna Taylor, among others.\n\n\"We really are trying to prepare an army - the next generation of social justice engineers,\" the Tallahassee, Florida-based attorney told the AP.\n\n\"We will have the next Thurgood Marshall, the next Constance Baker Motley, or the next Kamala Harris, to light the way for our community and get the American promise of liberty and justice for all,\" Crump added.\n\nBeginning with a $1 million leadership grant from Truist Financial Corp.'s charitable fund, the Crump Center will support an incubator program for students looking to establish themselves in civil rights and social justice lawyering. The center also will increase need-based financial aid for students and will assist new lawyers with expanded pro bono service placements.\n\n\"No one becomes Ben Crump on their first day as a lawyer, but mentorship is critical to building the confidence and the platform for people to excel,\" said Tamara Lawson, dean of the St. Thomas University College of Law.\n\nLawson said the center will focus on training students to be leaders in social justice lawyering. \"It's not just about participating in the work, but creating the vision and taking it to the next level,\" she said.\n\nOn Thursday, the law school also will launch a $35 million fundraising campaign to expand its ongoing training of lawyers who fight for social justice. The money is expected to be used for construction of a new building for the Crump Center, as well as new classrooms and simulated courtrooms, Lawson said.\n\nThe university's announcement comes a week after Crump, with civil rights leader the Rev. Al Sharpton and the family of Ahmaud Arbery , heralded guilty verdicts in the murder trial of three white men in Arbery's death. The 25-year-old Black man was chased and then shot and killed in February 2020 as he jogged through the men's Brunswick, Georgia, neighborhood. The verdicts notched yet another high-profile victory for Crump, whom some call \" Black America's attorney general. \"\n\nAs a past president of the National Bar Association, the largest network of predominantly Black attorneys and judges, Crump said civil rights and social justice lawyering isn't seen as a lucrative area of practice for aspiring attorneys. He said he hopes that lending his name to the center inspires law school students to consider social justice as a worthy, career-long pursuit.\n\n____\n\nMorrison is based in New York and writes about race and justice for the AP's Race and Ethnicity team.

(AP Photo/John Minchillo, File)\n\nBen Crump, the Rev. Al Sharpton says, is \"Black America's attorney general.\"\n\nIn less than a decade, the Florida-based attorney has become the voice for the families of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and Tyre Nichols -- Black people whose deaths at the hands of police and vigilantes sparked a movement.\n\nHe has won multimillion-dollar settlements in police brutality cases. He's pushed cities to ban no-knock warrants. He has told a congressional committee that reform is needed because \"it's become painfully obvious we have two systems of justice; one for white Americans and one for Black Americans.\"\n\nAnd he's stood with Black farmers taking on an agribusiness giant, and families exposed to lead-contaminated water in Flint, Michigan.\n\nThis week, he's standing with the family of Ajike Owens , a Black woman fatally shot after going to the Ocala, Florida, apartment of her white neighbor, who earlier had yelled at and allegedly assaulted Owens' children as they played nearby. He called on the state attorney's office to \"zealously prosecute\" the shooter.\n\n\"He's a real believer in what he's doing. He has taken the attacks. He has taken the cases that others wouldn't take,\" Sharpton said, adding, \"People can go to him. The reason I trust him is because he has never misled me. Good or bad, he'll tell me the truth about a client.\"\n\nThese days, he seems to be everywhere. A Florida law school now bears his name . Last year, Netflix released \"Civil,\" a documentary about his civil rights work. And in the year prior, TIME named him to its 100 Most Influential People list.\n\nIn April of 2021, he joined with George Floyd's family in celebrating the conviction of ex-cop Derek Chauvin. Then he was among the mourners at the funeral for Daunte Wright , who was shot during a traffic stop in suburban Minneapolis in the week leading up to Chauvin's verdict - a juxtaposition he finds incredible.\n\n\"If ever there was a time for police to be on their best behavior, if ever there was a time for them to use the greatest standard of care, if ever there was a time for them to de-escalate, it was during this trial, which I believe was one of the most consequential police (and) civil rights cases in our history,\" Crump told The Associated Press in 2021.\n\n___\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: The Associated Press initially published a version of this profile of Ben Crump on May 2, 2021.\n\n___\n\nCritics see him as an opportunist who never fails to show up amid another tragedy. But those who know Crump say he's been fighting for fairness long before his name was in headlines.\n\n\"Where there's injustice, that's where he wants to be,\" said Ronald Haley, a Louisiana attorney, who's among a wide network of lawyers Crump works with on lawsuits. \"He understands he's needed everywhere, but he also understands he can't be everywhere.\"\n\nCrump, 51, is a tireless worker who mixes Southern charm, a talent for attracting media attention to his cases and a firm belief that racism afflicts the nation, and the courts are the place to take it on.\n\nHe has an uncanny way of making his clients feel like kin, they say.\n\n\"He has never missed a Thanksgiving to check in on me, he calls on Christmas,\" said Allisa Findley, who first met Crump three days after her brother, Botham Jean , was fatally shot in his apartment by a white Dallas police officer who mistook the Black man's apartment for her own.\n\n\"Even the little things, he makes time for it, when there are no cameras rolling,\" she said. \"He does feel like family. I consider Ben family.\"\n\nTerrence Floyd, a younger brother of George Floyd, said Crump's attention and care for his family over the last year has bonded them beyond the attorney-client relationship.\n\n\"It feels like it's more family-based than business,\" he said. \"After a while, I went from calling him 'Mr. Crump' to calling him 'Unc,' like he was one of my uncles.\"\n\nCrump keeps up a dizzying schedule that takes him all over, but he makes sure he's home for Sunday services at Bethel Missionary Baptist Church. He lives in Tallahassee with his wife and their 8-year-old daughter, Brooklyn; he also helped raise two cousins and became their legal guardian.\n\n\"I look at my daughter,\" Crump said, \"I look in her eyes, and then I look in the eyes of my nieces and nephews, and my little cousins - all these little Black and brown children. You see so much hope, so much optimism in their eyes. We've got to give them a better world.\"\n\nHe added: \"What I'm trying to do, as much as I can, even sometimes singlehandedly, is increase the value of Black life.\"\n\nCrump's path to becoming a lawyer and advocate began while growing up in Lumberton, North Carolina, where he was the oldest of nine siblings and step-siblings.\n\nIn his book \"Open Season: Legalized Genocide of Colored People,\" he described learning in elementary school that a white classmate's weekly allowance was as much as what his mother made in a week working two jobs at a shoe factory and a hotel laundry.\n\n\"I wanted to understand why people on the white side of the tracks had it so good and Black people on our side of the tracks had it so bad,\" he wrote.\n\nHe often recounts how he learned about the world by reading the newspaper to his grandmother and how his mother taught him the story of famed civil rights lawyer Thurgood Marshall, who became his hero.\n\n\"He has always gravitated toward leadership and being the answer to injustice,\" said Sean Pittman, an attorney who has been his friend for 30 years, since they met at Florida State University. There, Crump was president of the Black Student Union and led protests to bring attention to how the school recruited and treated Black students.\n\nBut his rise from personal injury attorney to a voice of Black America began in 2013 when he represented the family of Trayvon Martin , a teenager killed by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida. He then took on the case for the family of Michael Brown who was fatally shot by a white officer near St. Louis.\n\nCrump organized marches and brought media attention to both of their deaths - each happening during the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nHe has gone on to win financial settlements in about 200 police brutality cases. In March of 2021, the city of Minneapolis agreed to pay $27 million to settle a civil lawsuit from George Floyd's family, which Crump at the time said is the largest pretrial civil rights lawsuit settlement ever.\n\n\"I keep hoping and believing, if we can make them pay multimillions of dollars every time they shoot a Black person in the back, that there will be less Black people shot in the back,\" Crump said. \"That's my theory, but it remains unanswered because they keep killing us.\".\n\nIn recent years, Crump waded into the TV and film world. He had a brief role in the 2017 film \"Marshall,\" which tells of the early life of his hero, who became the first Black U.S. Supreme Court justice.\n\nHis higher profile has brought more scrutiny and turned him into a frequent target. Conservative author Candace Owens in April accused Crump of trying to profit from police shootings and encouraging violent protests.\n\n\"Keeping racial issues alive has become a business in America,\" she told Fox News Channel's Laura Ingraham. \"It's Al Sharpton yesterday, Jesse Jackson tomorrow, Ben Crump today.\"\n\nIt doesn't really bother Crump: \"You can't care what the enemies of equality think of you,\" he said. \"It would be the height of arrogance to think that everybody is going to love you. It's not a popularity contest.\"\n\nIt's fitting that he is now mentioned among the giants of civil rights, said John Bowman, who has known him since Michael Brown's killing and has served as president of the St. Louis County NAACP.\n\n\"I can't get in his head and say he charted out this course, and said, 'I'm going to be the next strongest voice for injustice,'\" Bowman said. \"I do know that when the call was made, he didn't shy away or step back from it.\"\n\nBut Crump says he eventually would like to step back from it all.\n\n\"I literally pray for the day when I can close down the police brutality division of my law firm,\" he said, \"because I am so tired of seeing Black people killed by the police unjustifiably. I'd like to tell my staff that we no longer have to fight in the courts, or be counselors to so many grieving mothers and fathers.\"\n\n____\n\nMorrison reported from New York City.

(AP) - Before Trayvon Martin , George Floyd , Michael Brown , Breonna Taylor and other Black people died at the hands of white police officers or self-appointed vigilantes, there was Martin Lee Anderson.\n\nAnderson, a 14-year-old Black teenager, died in 2006 after he was kicked and beaten by guards at a boot-camp juvenile facility in Florida. His family looked for a lawyer to seek justice. No white attorneys wanted to take it on.\n\nThat was the first high-profile civil rights case at the national level for Ben Crump, a Black attorney from Florida. Now, Crump is a familiar presence at almost every major civil rights case in the country.\n\n\"Ben has always been a fighter for justice ... to shine a light on things that are not right,\" said Leon Russell, chair of the NAACP National Board of Directors.\n\nStaff at the facility where Anderson died were acquitted of criminal charges, but Crump later won a civil case for the boy's family.\n\nThat was only the beginning.\n\nWhen Trayvon Martin, 17, was fatally shot on Feb. 26, 2012, at a condominium complex in Sanford, Florida, his killer, George Zimmerman, was not initially arrested. Zimmerman, whose father is white and whose mother is Hispanic, was a self-appointed, armed neighborhood watcher who eventually claimed self-defense and was acquitted of murder charges.\n\nMartin, wearing a hoodie that would soon become an iconic image, was returning to his father's condo from a convenience store with a can of ice tea and a bag of Skittles when he was confronted by Zimmerman.\n\nCrump pushed for Zimmerman's arrest and joined with many prominent civil rights leaders to stage demonstrations calling for charges.\n\nIt was the Trayvon Martin case that gave rise to the Black Lives Matter movement, and Crump deserves much of the credit for that, the Rev. Jesse Jackson said in an interview with The Associated Press.\n\n\"It was a new stream of consciousness,\" Jackson said. \"We decided we're not going back. Everything else has come out of that. Don't Black lives matter? It made a big difference.\"\n\nCrump has been called Black America's attorney general for his unwavering work on civil rights cases, especially those involving Black people killed by police. In an interview, Crump said he does not take that label lightly.\n\n\"I try as sincerely as possible to give a voice to those who have no voice,\" Crump said. \"If I can see further, it's because I am standing on the shoulders of giants.\"\n\nCrump, 52, was born in Lumberton, North Carolina, one of nine siblings, but wound up attending high school in Plantation, Florida. From there it was Florida State University for college and law school and then a law firm with partner Daryl Parks in Tallahassee. They took on the Martin Lee Anderson case.\n\nNow, Crump has his own firm that handles civil rights cases across the country. He recites an African proverb to illustrate why it is so important to stand up for Black people who are victims of injustice.\n\n\"As long as the lion hunter gets to tell the story of the hunt, and the lions never get to tell the story, then all the glory will always go to the lion hunter,\" Crump said. \"Unless you have the historical knowledge of the culture, to hand down generation upon generation, then we are doomed to repeat the lessons we should have learned.\"\n\nCrump, who is seen almost everywhere a civil rights case emerges, still lives in Tallahassee with his wife Genae, who is assistant principal at a Leon County public school for at-risk kids, and their daughter, Brooklyn. He has won financial settlements in about 200 police brutality cases, including a $27 million settlement for George Floyd's family in the infamous Minneapolis case.\n\nBut he is not without his detractors. Samaria Rice, the mother of 12-year-old Tamir Rice , who was fatally shot by a white Cleveland police officer while holding a toy gun in 2014, released a statement at the time that criticized both Black Lives Matter activists and Crump.\n\nSamaria Rice said they should \"step down, stand back, and stop monopolizing and capitalizing our fight for justice and human rights.\" The statement also questioned whether Crump understood Ohio law. \"I fired him 6-8 months into Tamir's case,\" she wrote.\n\nBut Jackson, who marched with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and was with King when he was assassinated in 1968, said Crump is part of the new generation of civil rights leaders.\n\n\"Now we do have people at the state and national level to hold people accountable. We will have justice,\" Jackson said.\n\nWhen Crump thinks about the Trayvon Martin case, he said it's clear there is much more work to be done.\n\n\"Are we making progress? Are we going backwards?\" he said. \"I think about Trayvon Martin and the unknown Trayvon Martins, so often, when we think about the history of America. Who tells their story? Every day is a new day for us to make history.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

      "text": "Trayvon Martin Case: Zimmerman Builds His Defense\n\nAs investigators privately try to sort out what happened, lawyers are publicly spinning information for the benefit of their clients.\n\nReuters\n\nOne month after he shot Trayvon Martin to death, one week after police dispatch tapes revealed that he ignored a warning not to pursue the unarmed teenager, we are beginning to get glimmers of the details of the defense George Zimmerman will likely offer if he's ever charged with murder under Florida law, if he is ever sued by Martin's family in a wrongful death lawsuit, or if he's ever indicted by the Justice Department under a federal hate crime law.\n\nAs often occurs in these social wildfire stories, where the emotion and the recrimination and the suspicion and the outrage and the speculation far outpace the public disclosure of material facts, the counter narrative has begun to emerge -- and gain some traction. Craig Sonner, a Florida attorney, has been making the media rounds to deliver the message on behalf of his client. Appearing on CBS News Saturday morning, Sonner said :\n\nTo CNN's Anderson Cooper, Sonner was even more explicit. The lawyer told the cable host that Zimmerman's \"nose was broken, he sustained injury to his nose and on the back of his head, he sustained a cut that was serious enough to merit stitches, but it took too long to get to the hospital.\" In the meantime, the venerable Associated Press now is reporting, as wire copy undisputed fact, that \"at some point\" that deadly night the two men \"got into a \" fight .\"\n\nContrast Sonner's story, and the AP's curious certainty, with the sworn affidavit reportedly signed by Martin's girlfriend, who says that she was talking on her cellphone with Martin when Zimmerman attacked him. The young woman reportedly says that Martin was attempting to get away from Zimmerman -- literally running away from a confrontation -- when the older, heavier, armed man cornered him and gunned him down.\n\nOn the one hand, Sonner says Zimmerman was bloodied and bruised in his battle with Martin -- the essence of a justifiable homicide defense ('Stand Your Ground\" version or otherwise). On the other hand, Martin was a good student with no history of violence, who was carrying nothing more than candy and an iced tea at the time of the incident, and who had no evident motive to attack Zimmerman from behind, from in front or from the side.\n\nSonner is doing what lawyers do -- making the best available argument on behalf of his client and trying to shape public opinion in case any of this ever gets to a jury. By offering verifiable details, by imprinting Zimmerman's story onto the court of public opinion, he's also making it easier for law enforcement officials (and the media) to figure out what the evidence is and what it proves or disproves. This is a good thing-- no matter what you think may have happened.\n\nSo many questions! If Zimmerman was injured as badly as his lawyer says, then it's time to see what the hospital records say about his treatment. Were his wounds consistent with a deadly battle? Were there any injuries to Martin's body, other than the fatal wound, that would suggest that such a sustained fight occurred? And what did Sonner mean, exactly, when he told Cooper that \"it took too long to get to the hospital\"? When was Zimmerman treated?\n\nHow did the police view Zimmerman's alleged injuries that night? Was their evaluation of Zimmerman reasonable? This is vital, remember, because Florida law doesn't automatically allow a person to lawfully kill another person in self-defense just because the two are involved in a fistfight. The person who pulls the trigger has to feel it is \"reasonably\" necessary to prevent \"death or great bodily harm.\" A broken nose may not cut it. A blow to the head might.\n\n(Not for nothing, it's important to remember that all this political and legal talk, in Florida and elsewhere, about revising the state's controversial \"justifiable homicide\" law would have absolutely no impact upon the Zimmerman case. He'll be evaluated based solely on how the law read and was interpreted on February 26 and not by how the law may be changed in the future).\n\nIf there was a fight between Martin and Zimmerman, and if the evidence suggests that it was a serious one, it will be awfully difficult for prosecutors in good faith to indict Zimmerman for murder. It will also make it impossible for federal investigators to label this as a \"hate crime.\" What's left, then, is a civil lawsuit filed by Martin's family against Zimmerman -- and, Crump now suggests, perhaps against the (deeper pockets) homeowners association as well.\n\nThe homeowners association? What? At the same time that Sonner was trying to rehabilitate Zimmerman, the Martin family attorney, Ben Crump, was suggesting that Zimmerman's homeowners association may have some civil liability here because it reportedly encouraged residents to coordinate their \"neighbor watch\" concerns with Zimmerman. Crump would have to prove that this was negligence. Good luck with that -- and bring on the depositions!\n\nThus we have now entered the two-track phase of a high-profile case. The first track is the official one -- undertaken largely in private -- where new investigators are sorting out exactly what happened. The second track is the unofficial one -- played out in public view -- where the lawyers are spinning information for the tactical and strategic benefit of their clients. What can the rest of us do? Take what we now hear with skepticism. And wait for more facts to emerge.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

As if holding the targets weren't offensive enough, Sgt. Ron King then tried to give them to his fellow officers in the Port Canaveral Police Department for target practice. This did not go over well. The other officers refused the gift, superiors were notified and, after a review, King was dismissed from the force. Ben Crump, the Martin family's lawyer, told the press it was \"absolutely reprehensible\" that an officer like King \"would use the image of a dead child as target practice.\" Crump added, \"Such a deliberate and depraved indifference to this grieving family is unacceptable.\" King plans to apologize to the Martin family.\n\nOf course, this is just the latest deplorable thing to come out of the Trayvon Martin saga. The allegations that George Zimmerman shot and killed Martin in his own neighborhood when the teenager was armed with nothing but a bag of Skittles is bad enough. Zimmerman then went on a questionable campaign to raise money for his legal defense, propping himself up as the poster boy for Florida's \"stand your ground\" law that he says justifies the slaying. He ended up raising hundreds of thousands of dollars . Then , Zimmerman started selling his autograph to fans who donated money to his fund which he says still isn't enough to cover his costs, because who doesn't want the autograph of a accused killer. With months left to go before a verdict is delivered in the controversial case, the awfulness surely won't stop there.\n\nIt remains unclear if Sgt. King made the Trayvon targets himself or got them somewhere else. A quick Google search shows that there's plenty of inspiration Trayvon Martin shooting targets. They're all over the Internet."

      "text": "'This Is the Worst Police-Shooting Video Ever'\n\nThe officer who killed Sonya Massey didn't see what I see.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nL et me tell you what I see and hear in the video of Sonya Massey's killing: a nervous woman, head tilted down toward her phone, as if hoping someone-maybe a family member-has replied to her messages. A shaky voice wanting to hear words of reassurance.\n\n\"You didn't see anybody?\" she asks the two law-enforcement officers who were sent to her house after she had called 911 to report what she thought was an intruder.\n\n\"We checked the whole area,\" one of the officers tells her.\n\n\"Okay,\" she says in a whisper.\n\nWhen one of the officers, Deputy Sean Grayson, speaks again, he sounds suspicious: \"What took you so long to answer the door?\" He doesn't assume that she must be afraid, which is why she dialed 911 in the first place. Instead, he sounds like he's interrogating her. In another story, she might be the damsel in distress, but Black women are hardly ever seen that way.\n\nStill, she addresses him respectfully, to indicate that she understands his position of authority: \"Oh, I was trying to put on some clothes, sir, I'm sorry,\" she says. She is wearing a silky-looking cream-colored robe, so long that it brushes the ground; a T-shirt over pajama pants with a flamingo-pink string; and a headscarf like so many Black women wear while sleeping to protect our hair.\n\nGrayson's partner asks if there's anything else they can do for her. When she doesn't reply, Grayson repeats the question, enunciating it as if speaking to a toddler: \"Is. There. Anything. Else. I. Can. Do. For. You?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" she says, surely aware of the officer's annoyance.\n\nHer steady politeness reminded me of the way that many Black children are taught early on to interact with police officers: Always answer \"Yes, sir\" or \"No, sir.\" Assume that they'll have negative assumptions about you, assumptions that you may need to defuse to protect yourself from getting hurt.\n\nRead: The problem with police-shooting videos\n\nThen Grayson asks about her mental state. Massey's family has said that she had mental-health issues, and it's clear the officer has concluded that something is wrong with her. She replies that she has taken her medicine. She is still polite, but now she just wants to go back inside her home. Maybe something has become clear to her, as well: that these officers are not going to help her. \"I love y'all. Thank y'all,\" she says as she tries to close her front door.\n\nSince the killings in 2020 of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, and the racial-justice protests that followed, I've become somewhat desensitized to police violence. I got tired of reading beautiful prose capturing the last moments of someone who should never have died. These things happen, I have occasionally told myself. But watching this video, I felt outraged all over again by the barbarous misuse of police power and by the senseless loss of innocent lives.\n\nWas it the intimacy of the video? Was it the image of Massey standing on her porch, as the light emanating from her living room highlighted her slender frame? I saw a small woman in her nightclothes having a tense exchange with an officer who was bigger. And stronger. And armed.\n\nWas it the fact that, at night, I often FaceTime my aunt, who is also named Sonia, though she spells it with an i instead of a y ? If it is after 9 p.m., I can almost guarantee that her pixie cut will be hidden under a silk scarf just like Massey's, wrapped around her head like a bandage.\n\nThen the video skips ahead: The officers have entered her home. They're telling Massey to show them her ID. Why?\n\nI see the folded clothes on the top of her sofa, the scattered pillows, the reusable shopping bag with items spilling out. In the kitchen there's a blender, a plant, two plastic bottles. The door has come off one of the kitchen cabinets, and you can see everything stacked inside.\n\nWesley Lowery: Why there was no racial reckoning\n\nMe seeing this feels like a violation. But the scene also feels familiar. I know firsthand that dirty dishes in a sink, clothes tossed throughout an apartment, or piles of junk can be the outward signs of deep personal struggles.\n\nIn Massey's kitchen, a pot of water boils on the stove. Grayson orders her to take it off the flame. As the body camera follows her, I notice a black rolling chair that would make more sense in an office. On another chair, pumpkin-orange fabric pours out of a cardboard box. Massey puts on her oven mitts before lifting the pot. It seems to occur to the officers only now that the water-meant for cooking pasta, maybe, or rice-must be hot.\n\nOne of the officers backs away. Massey seems confused; she asks where he's going. He tells her he doesn't want to get hit by boiling water.\n\nThen she says: \"I rebuke you in the name of Jesus.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"I rebuke you in the name of Jesus.\"\n\nTo the officers, this seems bizarre-understandably. But I've heard the phrase before, mainly because I have family members and friends who call on Jesus for all sorts of different reasons. I asked my brother-in-law, who's a pastor, what it technically means. In the church, he said, to rebuke is to cast out a demon, or keep a demon from using a person to do something bad. The phrase can be said casually, though, in response to someone's misbehavior. When Massey says it, her voice is louder and clearer than it has been before, but she doesn't sound angry. It's the tone of voice that you might use while saying: For goodness' sake, this is really getting ridiculous.\n\n\"You better fucking not,\" Grayson responds, the rage rolling off his tongue. \"I'll shoot you in your fucking face.\"\n\nMassey crouches down behind the kitchen counter, terrified, apologizing. I can't tell what happens to the pot. She puts it down, maybe. Later, the water will spill across the floor. Does it scald her? We don't know, because the officer does exactly what he said he was going to do. He shoots her in the face.\n\nGrayson didn't see Massey as the mother of two teenagers , or a \"daddy's girl\"-as her father described her-or a woman who simply needed help. Her humanity was invisible to him. It didn't matter that a few minutes earlier she'd called him \"sir,\" even though he was six years younger than she was. She said she loved the police. It didn't save her.\n\nAfter her body drops to the ground, the other officer says he'll go get a medical kit to see if he can help her. \"Nah,\" Grayson says, \"she's done. You can go get it, but that's a headshot.\" I hear him try to justify the shooting: He says he wasn't about to take a pot of boiling water to his face, even though Massey was already at ground level when he pulled the trigger.\n\nGrayson goes to retrieve the medical kit after all, though he says, \"I mean there's not much we can do.\" We realize then that she's still breathing: \"She's still gasping a bit,\" the partner says, and he presses something against her head to try to stop the bleeding. I imagine the strength it must have taken for her body to hang onto life in those moments. Was she able to hear Grayson, a public servant whom she had put her faith in, dismiss her so quickly? By the time he comes back, it's too late.\n\n\"T his is the worst police-shooting video ever ,\" Ben Crump, the lawyer representing Massey's family, said at a news conference. He knows what he's talking about: He has represented the families of Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and others, over more than 20 years. We have the record of what happened only because it was captured by Grayson's partner: Grayson himself never turned on his body camera. Sonya Massey's tax dollars had contributed to the salary of the officer who killed her. That's the insanity of being Black in this country.\n\nRead: Stop calling Breonna Taylor's killing a 'tragedy'\n\nUnlike the victims of other police killings, Massey doesn't have a movement behind her. The public response to the video has been relatively muted. Maybe that's in part because, this time, the sheriff's department was quick to fire the officer. Grayson now faces charges including first-degree murder, to which he has pleaded not guilty. Surely it's also because others have become desensitized like I had, feeling that we had witnessed so much violence that the only way to keep going was to distance ourselves from it. And maybe it's because she died during a time of bigger news.\n\nThe same week the footage of Massey's killing was released, we saw Kamala Harris take the mantle of the Democratic Party. I know I can't be the only one struggling with this cognitive dissonance. This, too, is what it means to be Black in America: One Black woman has the chance to win the most powerful position in the world, while at the same time, another Black woman, even at her most vulnerable, wearing her nightclothes and headscarf, is perceived as a threat-and shot to death in her kitchen."

      "text": "Why Clinton Is Connecting With Black Voters-and Sanders Isn't\n\nThe mothers of slain black men and women are stumping for Clinton at grassroots events for African Americans, while her rival relies on huge rallies.\n\nBENNETTSVILLE, S.C.-Everyone agrees that African Americans are the pivotal demographic in Saturday's South Carolina Democratic primary. But the Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns are working to court that group in sharply divergent ways. It's the difference between huge rallies and small gatherings. Upstate versus Pee Dee. Anecdote versus abstraction. Their approaches are as different as night and day-or, one might say, black and white.\n\nOver the last few months, Sanders has incorporated a great deal about race into his stump speech. His discussion of racism in America is abstract-it deals with arrest rates and incarceration figures, wealth gaps and unemployment rates. Though Clinton is often described as a policy wonk and derided for her (very real) failures as a retail politician, she has cleverly chosen to focus more on concrete and personal stories as a means of addressing race, a strategy that was on display in the Palmetto State this week.\n\nOn Monday evening, Clinton was on the other side of the country in Hollywood, at a pair of glitzy fundraisers . But 75 or so people were backed into the Marian Wright Edelman Public Library in Bennettsville for a campaign event, where the mothers of Trayvon Martin, Sandra Bland, Dontre Hamilton, Jordan Davis , and Eric Garner were making the case for Clinton. A community room overflowed with people-standing room only, with people standing in the hall, craning their necks to get in, as the mothers took turns telling their wrenching tales of loss.\n\nThe stories, though by now familiar from media accounts and surveillance videos, were freshly horrifying, told in person by the victims' mothers. Each woman related how her son had been killed, and then how Clinton had reached out to her. They told stories about phone calls, personal letters, and half-hour meetings that stretched on for hours.\n\n\"Hillary took it upon herself to listen to me when none of the leaders decided to lay in the street with us, march in the street with us, pour our hearts out and ask for help. Hillary heard my cry,\" said Maria Hamilton, whose son Dontre was shot and killed by a Milwaukee police officer in 2014. \"When Hillary called me in March, and her staffer told me I didn't have to rally people in the street to shut her rally down, that she would talk to me, it changed my life.\"\n\n\"We don't need any more members in this club. The membership is too high for this club,\" said Gwen Carr, whose son Eric Garner was choked to death by a New York City police officer in 2014. \"She has proved to us, one by one, that we do matter in her campaign. We are endorsing her because she endorsed us.\"\n\nEveryone in attendance seemed to know one another, and they were all enthusiastically ready for Hillary. The local state representative emceed the event, and she hailed her Alpha Kappa Alpha sisters for working to register new voters at local high schools. The police chief and sheriff (both black) attended. It felt like going to church: Particularly emotional moments elicited a chorus of \"That's right\"s and \"Amen\" and \"Mmhmm\"s from a crowd that hung on every word.\n\nSeveral hours earlier, I dropped by an event at Friendship Baptist Church in Aiken, all the way across the state, near Augusta, Georgia. Ben Crump, the attorney who represented the families of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and Tamir Rice, was there, along with Billy Murphy, the attorney who represented Freddie Gray's family (and who famously played himself on The Wire ). So was activist Gregg Greer. State Representative Bill Clyburn, whose more famous cousin Jim had endorsed Clinton a few days earlier, stopped by. The event wasn't quite so packed-there weren't more than 25 or 30 people, though it was also midday on a Monday. Almost everyone in attendance qualified for Social Security.\n\nThe Bennettsville and Aiken meetings were part of a coordinated statewide push. There were 10 such events, featuring either the lawyers or the mothers, across South Carolina over the last three days, each of them at a church or community center. They're designed to be smaller events. (Clinton joined the mothers Tuesday night in Columbia.)\n\nCompare that with Sanders's approach. The Vermont senator came to South Carolina Saturday night after losing to Clinton in Nevada. Sunday morning, he stopped by a black church in Columbia, then headed to Greenville for a rally. It was a massive event -there were more than 5,000 people at the Bon Secours Wellness Arena. But few of them were African American-certainly a smaller proportion than the 55 percent of the Democratic primary vote that blacks comprised in 2008. Geographically speaking, that's no surprise. Greenville is the center of South Carolina's Upstate, which is less than 20 percent black . But after the Sunday rally, Sanders left to campaign elsewhere. He came back for a Tuesday-night town hall in Columbia and held a press conference Wednesday morning before jetting out again. Sanders appears to have decided to focus more energy on states holding March 1 nominating contests.\n\nClinton holds a huge lead with black voters in South Carolina in polls ahead of Saturday's Democratic primary-as much as 47 points, in an NBC/ Wall Street Journal poll . The difference in Sanders's and Clinton's approaches to black voters is in part a reaction to those results-if Sanders had more of a chance to win them, he'd likely spend more time on it-but it also helps explain the gap.\n\nIt isn't that Sanders isn't talking about race issues. Despite the overwhelmingly Caucasian crowd, he talked at length about racial disparities in Greenville. Sanders was introduced by a local black politician, former NAACP President Ben Jealous, and the actor Danny Glover. He railed against police brutality, mass incarceration of black men, unequal prosecutions for drug use, and more.\n\nThere's little doubt that Sanders cares about these civil-rights questions, nor that his supporters do. His fans are passionate about stopping racism. \"The fact that he's a white man who admits that white privilege exists and wants to get rid of white privilege-that's huge,\" Jonathan Bussey, a young white man, told me as he waited for Sanders to speak.\n\nYou're just more likely to meet someone like Bussey at a Sanders event than you are a young black man. The African Americans who attend the Greenville Sanders rally tended to say they there for the same reasons that whites are there: Because they feel that the economy is rigged, the health-care system is insufficient, and Bernie is the most honest candidate and the one who was most concerned with helping the little guy.\n\nRalph Morton, whose gray hair matched his gray suit, told me he thought pundits and the Clinton campaign were counting black votes before they were cast, predicting a replay of the 2008 primary, where her support eroded quickly and she lost. \"I think the same thing might happen to her again,\" he said. \"It's just like Jeb Bush thought he was going to be a shoo-in because of past support. He got toasted.\"\n\nDoes that parallel really make sense? The key difference between 2008 and 2016, of course, is Barack Obama. While there were persistent media questions about whether Obama was \"black enough\" for black voters , voters answered them resoundingly in the affirmative. Obama proved adept at codeswitching , changing his register and vocabulary and jokes to connect with African Americans and eventually winning them over.\n\nWhat Barack could do, Bernie can't so easily pull off. Sanders speaks in generalities and attacks systemic injustices, while Clinton focuses on the pain of individual lives. By befriending women like Hamilton and Carr, she is able to connect her policies to real stories. By convincing them she cares about them, she produces a squadron of surrogates with powerful stories to take into black communities.\n\n\"Nobody made-I don't think they could have made us, I don't think they could have persuaded any of these mothers to vote for Hillary Clinton against their own will,\" Sybrina Fulton, Trayvon Martin's mother, said in Bennettsville. \"This was a conscious decision we made.\" (There was evidently some sensitivity about that impression. Geneva Reed-Veal, Sandra Bland's mother, closed the event with a rousing call to vote, and then added, \"I'm with her. All my sisters are with her. And please tell the people we are not being exploited!\")\n\nThat might not come through as clearly in debates, but it was warmly appreciated at the South Carolina events. Attendees said over and over that they were supporting Clinton in large because of her long familiarity with the black community. They said they felt she knew them and their people-not just the statistics, but the people. Sanders speaks to racism; Clinton speaks to black people.\n\nThese attendees uniformly respected and appreciated Sanders. His problem in winning them is the same as his problem across the country: unfamiliarity. The more people get to know Sanders, the more they tend to like him-he has some of the highest favorable ratings in American politics-but many people still don't know who he is. It's a point Billy Murphy hammered home in Aiken.\n\n\"I like Bernie Sanders. The problem is I just met him!\" Murphy said, peering owlishly over the rimless reading glasses he likes to wear low on his nose. \"I haven't lived with Bernie Sanders like I've lived with the Clinton family. I know substantially more about Hillary Clinton and she knows substantially more about communities of color.\"\n\nAnd then Murphy turned the knife, demonstrating why he's so effective in front of a jury.\n\n\"Bernie posted a very interesting picture about how he was marching with the civil-rights movement, but we didn't hear much from Bernie after that,\" he said. \"I'm sure he has his heart in the right place.\"\n\nThat sentiment is a toned-down version of the comments from Representative John Lewis that caused a ruckus earlier this month. \"I never saw him, I never met him,\" Lewis said . \"I'm a chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee for three years, from 1963 to 1966. I was involved in the sit-ins, the Freedom Rides, the March on Washington, the march from Selma to Montgomery, and directed their voter-education project for six years. But I met Hillary Clinton. I met President Clinton.\"\n\nTheir argument isn't that Sanders doesn't care. It's just that they don't think he has the hands-on experience. The point is to remind black voters that the Clintons have been there for them for decades. Clinton may not be able to turn out 5,000 voters for a single event, but her deep ties to the black community give her a huge base of surrogates who can go out to small, grassroots events where they can appeal directly to African Americans.\n\n\"The president trusted her- our beloved Barack Obama -with one of the most important jobs in her administration,\" Murphy said, in case anyone had forgotten that the president is black. And later, he got a hearty, knowing response for what sounded like an implication that Republican opposition to Obama is racist: \"I've never seen a Congress whose avowed purpose was preventing the president of the United States from achieving his goals.\"\n\nLater on, Crump harkened back to Clinton's work establishing legal aid in Arkansas, and said she understood problems like direct filing, when teenagers are moved to adult courts. \"We know who that affects most when they start talking about direct filing,\" Crump said. \"They ain't direct filing little Billy, they're direct filing little Junebug and Leroy and Shaniqua. It ain't a new fight for her.\"\n\nIt's hard to imagine either Clinton or Sanders coming off as well at these events as these surrogates do. Clinton has been mocked for drawling when she campaigns south of the Mason-Dixon Line. When Sanders dropped by a black church on Sunday, delivering his normal spiel, he was met with polite indifference. Perhaps his bigger problem is that the worshippers were indifferent to his black surrogate, Ben Jealous, too .\n\nNone of this is to say that the voters who showed for the events didn't have hesitations about Clinton. In Aiken, Shirley Abney wondered where the candidate was. \"I am disappointed she has not been here herself,\" Abney said. \"She's sent some good people, but she needs to be here herself.\" (A nervous young white staffer who was coordinating the event quickly chimed in that Clinton was coming to South Carolina Tuesday.)\n\nThere's also still ambivalence about Bill Clinton, whose comments about then-Senator Barack Obama alienated many African American voters in 2008, en route to handing Obama a Palmetto State win. \"Let's make sure that we don't run away from her because we're looking at what Bill's campaign did,\" Reed-Veal warned in Bennettsville.\n\nThe Clinton White House legacy has also been tarnished, especially among the new generation of criminal-justice reformers, by the tough-on-crime law he signed into law. When one of the two younger men in the audience in Aiken asked about three-strikes laws, Murphy was quick to say that Bill Clinton had asked for forgiveness for the law and Hillary Clinton had said, \"Never again.\" But several people in the audience were ready to excuse the law as a product of its era. \"It was a different time,\" they said, pointing to the fear of crime in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nThat reflects the one cleavage in the black vote in South Carolina: between young and old. The crowd in Aiken was especially elderly; the crowd in Bennettsville was more evenly distributed, but it leaned older, too. Clinton retains an edge among younger African Americans in the state, but it's much smaller than her overall lead, as The Wall Street Journal reports . One reason may be that younger black voters don't have the same memories of the Clinton years, good and bad: There's none of the rosy recollection of 1990s prosperity, and they don't have memories of the crack epidemic that help them rationalize or excuse the crime bill.\n\nNotably, Eric Garner's daughter Erica has endorsed Sanders, participating in a powerful four-minute video on his behalf . I asked Carr what accounted for the family split. She chuckled. \"Everyone picks their own candidate. They got their own mind,\" she said in a thick Brooklyn accent. \"You just got to look at the candidate's track record.\""

      "text": "How Did It Come to This?\n\nMemphis authorities reacted swiftly to Tyre Nichols's killing. Now comes the hard part.\n\nOn Sunday morning, the Reverend Earle Fisher was trying to keep his sermon toned down. He's the pastor at Abyssinian Baptist, but he was guest-preaching at the more buttoned-down Trinity Christian Methodist Episcopal. The thing is that low-energy Earle Fisher still outpaces most ministers at their most fervid, and this was no typical Sunday.\n\nFisher, one of Memphis's most prominent criminal-justice activists, was preaching just two days after the release of video footage of the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols by five police officers. In conversation, Fisher speaks calmly and with precise control, but in the pulpit, he was animated as he connected a short passage in the Gospel of Mark where Jesus heals a blind man to the present day with the help of thunderous crescendos and subito pianos.\n\nFirst, he critiqued the apparently benevolent bystanders who brought the man to Jesus. \"The crowd is not asking some very appropriate social, political, and critical questions,\" Fisher said. They ask Jesus to \"heal some symptoms but not challenge the system ... The crowd does not ask, 'Why are there so many sick people?'\"\n\nBut Fisher added, \"The text is also teaching us that you've got to recognize progress when prompted.\" Despite being miraculously healed, the blind man's first reaction is to say that his sight is dim. Only then does Jesus restore his vision fully.\n\nDavid A. Graham: The murders in Memphis aren't stopping\n\n\"A system of impatience and impulsivity and insensitivity has its grips on us even when we are walking with God and God is working on us and through us,\" Fisher said. \"We know that this man is still stained by the system of social injustice, because he's trying to focus on the negative. He did not recognize progress when prompted.\"\n\nPunctuating the point with his hands, Fisher reached a conclusion: \"We might not be all we want to be\"- clap, clap, clap -\"we might not be all we need to, but I thank God we ain't what we used to be.\"\n\nFisher speaks for many in the Memphis community. They celebrate the quick moves to fire the officers who beat Nichols, to charge them with murder, and to disband the specialized team of which they were a part. Nichols's death is part of a long-running pattern, and they worry about whether policing in Memphis can and will change more fundamentally. Ben Crump, the nationally renowned civil-rights lawyer representing the Nichols family, has called the official response a \"blueprint\" for other cities dealing with police killings. But Memphians don't want a blueprint for future responses. They want the killings to stop.\n\n\"That was the most brutal murder that we've ever seen in our lifetimes by the police,\" the activist LJ Abraham told me. \"It's going to force a lot of things, not just in Memphis but across the country, to change when it comes to policing-that's my hope. I can't say that it will, but that's my hope.\"\n\nDavid A. Graham: Memphis's policing strategy was bound to end in tragedy\n\nAs Abraham points out, Memphis's challenge is the nation's. The United States has made slow but noticeable progress in recent years on punishing officers who brutalize citizens, but whether any progress has been made on preventing such incidents is not yet clear. Individual prosecutions can serve as a deterrent, but many police departments-including Memphis's-have problems that run deeper than the \"a few bad apples\" cliché .\n\nI spent a lot of time in 2021 and 2022 reporting on policing in Memphis . The city presented a somewhat exaggerated version of the dynamic facing many American cities: Since the rise of Black Lives Matter, activists had been pressing for reform of the troubled police department, yet starting in 2020, Memphis also saw a sharp rise in violent crime, including murder. The result was a city that was both underpoliced and overpoliced. Memphians, especially Black ones, complained of rampant crime and unchecked gang violence, and they didn't want to defund the police. But they also reported that officers were focused on rinky-dink arrests and pretextual stops instead of violent crime, and feared that they or their family members would be brutalized by police-a fear that Nichols's death chillingly validates.\n\nThe city's leadership seemed to have no good ideas about solving the problem. Mayor Jim Strickland, a cautious, business-friendly Clinton Democrat, had run on a tough-on-crime platform and promised to grow the police force. In 2021, he handpicked C. J. Davis, the chief of police in Durham, North Carolina, to become the first Black woman to lead the Memphis Police Department. One of Davis's first moves was to launch the SCORPION unit, a specialized team that focused on policing high-crime areas. But crime continued to rise, and recruitment for the department was slow, despite lower entrance requirements. Neither Strickland nor Davis, nor anyone else from the mayor's office or police department, would speak with me to explain or defend their record.\n\nThe way that Memphis, Shelby County, and Tennessee officials have responded to Nichols's death really has been unusual. Davis quickly fired five officers involved and spoke passionately about her horror at the footage . Another two officers have now been suspended, along with two sheriff's deputies; three firefighters who attended to Nichols at the scene have also been fired . The state bureau of investigation quickly conducted a probe, and District Attorney Steve Mulroy charged the five fired officers with second-degree murder. The city pledged to release footage promptly and then did so. Davis dissolved the SCORPION team, to which the five officers belonged. That swift, decisive response is a big contrast from the way Memphis and other cities have handled such incidents in the past.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Inhumanity in Memphis\n\nThose quick and decisive moves may have driven national coverage of the story, but they also helped soothe the pain and anger in Memphis. Last Friday, shortly after the videos were released, protesters blocked an interstate-highway bridge over the Mississippi River, but the march remained calm. Demonstrations continued over the following days, but they stayed peaceful. The peaceful protests, like the swift official response, are testaments to the city's seasoned, disciplined activist community. In my reporting over the past couple of years , I found that advocates had little real effect on policy in Memphis, especially amid rising violent crime, but I may have underestimated them. They were here before Ben Crump and Al Sharpton came to town, and they'll be here when those men leave. Their organizing work is manifest in the city's quick action, and marchers on Saturday were triumphant if a bit surprised.\n\n\"This ain't gonna be a repeat of 2020,\" Amber Sherman, a community organizer, vowed at a protest. She said protesters would maintain pressure on officials to institute major changes.\n\nYet the immediate response is also the easy part-especially with an incident as nauseating and apparently clear-cut as this one. Last Friday, Strickland said he was waiting for an external review to determine whether Nichols's death was a failure of training or culture. But many observers have already made up their mind on that question.\n\nJuliette Kayyem: Why Memphis is different\n\n\"There was no fear that the cameras or anything would cost them,\" Rosalyn Nichols, a minister and the president of Memphis Interfaith Coalition for Action and Hope (and no relation to Tyre), told me. \"For me as a citizen, looking at that, it says that something inside of policing gave them some idea that this was not going to blow back on them. That's got to be deep inside of you. That's not something that one day five of them just decided to do.\"\n\nThe five officers charged are all Black, which some skeptics have argued shows that race was not a factor. But that doesn't convince many people in Memphis, where the composition of the police force (58 percent Black) roughly reflects that of the population (64 percent Black), and where police violence has long been a presence anyway. A system that allows Black residents to be disproportionately brutalized is a racist system, no matter the race of the officers, they say. \"It ain't the color; it's the culture,\" Bishop Marvin Frank Thomas Sr. said at Trinity CME on Sunday morning.\n\nBuddy Chapman is no bleeding-heart liberal activist. He led the Memphis police from 1976 to 1983, and is now the executive director of the nonprofit CrimeStoppers . But Chapman is furious about Nichols's death. \"How on earth could any police officer think it's okay to jerk a guy out of his car and beat the shit out of him? How come they would think that? Where did we fall down?\" he asked me. He, too, sees something wrong in the department's culture, scoffing at the bellicose name of the SCORPION unit. (As Fisher pointed out in his sermon, you don't have to think too hard to realize that a scorpion is a nocturnal predator.) \"Police will never fully address crime if their method is to be meaner than the criminals they face,\" Chapman told me.\n\nThat isn't to say that training and procedures aren't a problem. Strickland and Davis have focused their energy on hiring more officers (with minimal success) and have lowered requirements to join. Of the men charged in Nichols's death , only one had been in the department for more than five years-not much experience for officers in what was supposed to be a marquee crime-fighting initiative. Asked about training and selection for the unit, a police spokesperson replied only, \"All MPD specialized units are comprised of officers who are current MPD officers.\"\n\nRead: How Memphis policing strategy went so wrong\n\nEspecially with units, such as SCORPION, that use a zero-tolerance approach, \"you gotta have officers who know how not to get carried away with these powers,\" Chapman told me. As he watched the videos the city released, he waited for a commanding officer to speak up on the radio or show up on the scene. It never happened. \"They picked the wrong people, and they didn't supervise them closely.\"\n\nNews that the unit would be disbanded broke in the midst of a rally on Saturday in downtown Memphis, near the main police station and 201 Poplar, the notorious county jail. A march leader read the press release into a megaphone, and the crowd whooped. But someone immediately started shouting that the city would just wait until things cooled off and rebrand the team, a suspicion widely shared in the city. Another said that getting rid of SCORPION wasn't enough and that the city needed to disband its Organized Crime Unit altogether.\n\nIn recent years, MPD's approach to protests like this one has been to contain rather than confront, a change for a department with a long history of illegally surveilling its critics. Police were out in numbers during Saturday's demonstration, but they stayed in their cars and kept a healthy distance. They also didn't attempt to prevent marchers from blocking the bridge on Friday. But Hunter Demster, an organizer with Decarcerate Memphis, told me he had been pulled over on the way to Saturday's protest, which he didn't think was a coincidence.\n\nAs the demonstration wrapped up, someone produced a trumpet and began playing \"Lift Every Voice and Sing.\" I found JB Smiley Jr., the vice chair of the Memphis City Council, in the crowd. When I'd interviewed Smiley two years ago, he'd sounded like a moderate reformer , dubious of Memphis's massive spending on public safety and the mayor's attempt to attract officers by loosening a requirement that they live in the city. Now he struck a more militant note, and told me that something had changed with Nichols's death. \"I don't really like to look at things in terms of problems. I look at things in terms of opportunity,\" he said. \"I think you have an opportunity to make wholesale change.\"\n\nWas Chief Davis up to that challenge? I asked. \"Absolutely,\" he said. \"She will be forced to change. This council will force her. The people will force her.\"\n\nClint Smith: Tyre Nichols wanted to capture the sunset\n\nNot everyone is so optimistic. Strickland, the mayor, is a lame duck, leaving office next year because of term limits, and a temperamentally improbable change agent, though policing will likely be a top issue in the race to replace him. (His office did not reply to my request for an interview.)\n\nThat puts much of the focus on Davis. (The police department did not respond to my request to interview her, either.) Everyone agrees that she is good at communicating to the public, though often without specificity or concrete commitments to reform. What many observers from across the spectrum also believe, though they are not always willing to say so on the record, is that Davis's identity was a big factor in her hiring. (Before her stint in Durham, she was deputy chief in Atlanta.)\n\n\"[Strickland] hired her with the intention of saying, 'Oh, look, we hired the first Black female police chief in the city of Memphis in history,' but he also knew that she was going to be a puppet,\" Abraham, the activist, told me.\n\nCritics say that hiring Davis allowed Memphis to appear progressive without having to adopt any particularly fresh approaches to policing-and now that she's in the job, her identity helps protect her, and by extension the police, from criticism. \"Bringing a Black woman in as a police chief, even if you're doing it for the right reasons, can also cause a bit of a chilling effect on criticism and activism,\" Jillian Johnson, a member of Durham's city council, told me. \"People want to give her the benefit of the doubt.\"\n\nIn Durham, Davis won mostly positive marks just by improving on her disastrous predecessor, who had been fired after a series of scandals. Johnson, an outspoken leftist, said that Davis was eventually willing to embark on reforms, but only when pushed by the very progressive city leadership. As long as Strickland is in office, Davis is unlikely to get that kind of pressure in Memphis. \"C. J. Davis has all the right rhetoric,\" Demster told me. \"She says all the right things, and I believe that she may even mean it to a degree. But she has no power under Mayor Strickland.\"\n\nSue Rahr: The myth propelling America's violent police culture\n\nDavis's record, meanwhile, shows her doubling down on approaches with dubious records. Until this month, the city was eager to talk about SCORPION as one of her successes. She got the unit up and running just months after arriving in 2021. Three weeks in, the department boasted about the number of arrests it had made, though perhaps it should have been a warning sign that barely a third were for felonies. The idea seemed to have been borrowed from earlier in Davis's career, in Atlanta, where she'd led a similar team, called REDDOG. (Again with the names.) But as the Daily Memphian has reported, the scandal-ridden REDDOG received many of the same criticisms as SCORPION.\n\n\"Nothing changes until people at the top change,\" Josh Spickler, the executive director of Just City, a criminal-justice nonprofit, told me. \"I don't think there's anyone who would argue Jim Strickland or C. J. Davis are ready to significantly overhaul policing in Memphis, Tennessee.\"\n\nWhile I was in Memphis, I visited the spots where Nichols had been stopped and then beaten. They're almost 15 miles from downtown, well out in the suburbs. If the SCORPION team was looking for a high-crime area, according to the department's own mapping , they were in the wrong place. The intersection where Nichols was stopped is lonely, with two churches, a middle school, and a trash-choked creek, and the weather was gray and misty, fitting the mood. I followed Nichols's path running down Ross Road. (\"Everyone says, Well, he shouldn't have run from the police ,\" Chapman told me. \"I think if I'd been able to get up and make a run for it, I would have too!\")\n\nI passed by developments of neat, though worn, tract houses and turned into a brick subdivision; he'd been close to his mother's house when officers caught up with him. The corner where Nichols had been beaten was mostly deserted. A teddy bear, a Mylar heart balloon, and a few bouquets sat at the foot of a street sign. Someone had removed the Castlegate Lane sign prominently visible in one video the city released. A few journalists milled around, and a drone buzzed above.\n\nDarin Abston Jr. sat on the curb in a plain black caftan, singing \"Man in the Mirror.\" He told me he'd once been a regular protester, but he'd lost faith in activism and found it in God. \"We've been protesting for years. What did we get? 'We got our rights.' So?\" he said, gesturing to the pile of flowers, as if to ask what those rights had done to protect Tyre Nichols. \"Forgive the cops. Forgive them. We're not going to see a change in government. Lean not on your own understanding. Lean on God.\"\n\nJust a few hours after the horrifying video of Nichols's death had been released, I was hearing the case for giving up on earthly justice. The deserted scene amplified the hopelessness. But as I sat on the curb, cars arrived in a slow but constant stream. Their license plates showed they'd come from Memphis or from across the river in Arkansas or from just over the border in Mississippi. Many of the drivers were middle-aged Black women. Some rolled down a window to ask if this was the spot, and three said, by way of explanation for their presence, \"I have a son.\" Others simply slowed down, wiped a tear away, then turned around and drove off. But they did not seem likely to forget."

      "text": "Why There Was No Racial Reckoning\n\nSystemic problems will not be solved by representational victories.\n\nMEMPHIS, Tenn.-If the summer of 2020 was, for many Americans, a breaking point , then the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery , Breonna Taylor , and George Floyd presented the nation's leadership class with a crossroads. Would they radically rethink American policing, or would they retreat to the safety of piecemeal reform, earnestly applying Band-Aids over bullet wounds? Two and a half years later, Tyre Nichols is dead, and the choice they made is clear.\n\nIt's not that nothing was done. Some departments vowed to make more data available, and others launched exploratory efforts to let specialists respond to mental-health emergencies . Activists in a handful of cities succeeded in securing cuts to their police budgets. Some cities proposed ending armed traffic enforcement.\n\nBut there was no Great Reckoning in American policing. No sweeping act of atonement. No radical reordering. Not even, at scale, the \"reimagining\" championed by the moderates. In many cases, reactionary backlash has outpaced the changes that prompted it. Society's moral vacuum had been laid open before us. Rather than plug it, the most powerful among us watched as we were sucked further into the abyss.\n\nO n January 7 , the Memphis Police Department announced that during a traffic stop for \"reckless driving\" the night prior, \"a confrontation occurred, and the suspect fled the scene on foot.\" When officers caught up with the suspect, the department claimed, \"another confrontation occurred\" before the man was finally taken into custody. Complaining of \"shortness of breath,\" the 29-year-old was brought to a nearby hospital. Three days later, Tyre Nichols was dead, and a grotesque spectacle of Black death began.\n\nDavid A. Graham: How did it come to this?\n\nMemphis Police Chief Cerelyn \"C. J.\" Davis would later say that she immediately recognized the urgency of the situation. Within days, five officers were fired, and a federal probe was launched. Officials allowed Nichols's family and their lawyers to watch the videos of what had happened, which they described afterward as \"far worse than Rodney King.\" Nichols, they said, had been savaged like \"a human piñata.\" The officers were charged with second-degree murder. Television journalists, some of whom had been granted an early viewing of the videos, counted down to the public release as if it were a sporting event. What we were about to witness, they warned, was disturbing.\n\nAt 7 p.m. ET on Friday, January 27, the Memphis Police Department released four video clips. Two, from body cameras, depict behavior both concerning and commonplace. Officers immediately escalate, shouting contradictory commands without considering Nichols's attempts to comply. They deploy violence-pepper spray, a baton, a stun gun-far exceeding any threat posed to them or the public.\n\nA third video captured the crime. The officers catch Nichols in Brandywine, a sprawling subdivision where brick houses sit clustered around cul-de-sacs. They tackle him to the ground. They pepper-spray his eyes. They strike him with fists and a baton. Two officers hold Nichols down as a third unleashes winding kicks to his head. Writhing in pain, Nichols screams for his mother. A handcuffed Nichols is held upright as an officer delivers punches to his face. A dazed and dying Nichols is propped against a car as officers gather around him and coordinate their stories.\n\nThis all happened in one of the spots where Memphis has spent millions on surveillance. Just a few steps away, a camera was affixed on a light pole. Its flashing blue light would have been impossible to miss, had any of the officers ever looked up.\n\nP ublic commentary quickly converged around three points. The first was that Nichols's death was as disgusting a display of police violence as could be remembered. Second: The race of the offending officers-all five initially charged with murder were Black-was in some way significant. Third, ongoing attempts to rid policing of wanton violence have clearly failed.\n\nMuch has been made of the whiteness of the officers involved in prior such incidents. Now the seemingly new dimension offered by the involvement of Black officers required explanation. To some commentators , the officers' skin tone validated what they had been insisting all along: that America's policing problems are not about race. On a single morning after the videos' release, National Review featured three articles on its homepage declaring that Nichols's death was not about racism. Even to some on the left , the fact that mass protests had not erupted could be explained at least in part by the officers' race.\n\nBased on my experience covering policing and unrest, I'd proffer a more straightforward explanation: the timely release of information and forthright steps to hold the officers accountable. Civil unrest arrives most often in response to cryptic, protracted sagas.\n\nLos Angeles burned only after the officers who brutalized Rodney King were acquitted, the final insult in a year-long saga. Ferguson became the site of mass protests when police refused to explain why there was a dead teenager lying in the street, and again when, after three months, residents learned that the officer who shot him would walk free. City officials in Baltimore remained tight-lipped after the rough ride that resulted in Freddie Gray's death; more than two weeks later, police had still not offered a coherent explanation. Parts of the city burned. By the time George Floyd was killed, Minneapolis and the nation were fed up with more than five fruitless years of protests about policing. After spending months of 2020 holed up in their homes, everyone was desperate to come outside, activists and arsonists alike.\n\nPolice and prosecutors across the country-who routinely put on public display guns, drugs, and money seized as evidence in criminal cases-typically insist that releasing basic details about incidents in which officers kill people will irrevocably damage their investigations. They hem and haw about why they can't release videos, fire killer cops, or secure criminal indictments. Officials in Memphis managed all of it in just 20 days.\n\nRead: The problem with police shooting videos\n\nYet as much as the Memphis Police Department is an example of a newfound transparency that has taken root in the decade since Ferguson, the city has also provided a reminder of the limitations of reform.\n\nHere is a department with a Black woman police chief, a majority-Black workforce, body cameras, de-escalation training, and a duty-to-intervene policy. And Tyre Nichols is still dead: beaten by Black officers in violent scenes captured on the officers' body cameras after they themselves escalated the interaction. No officers intervened. For all of her clarity and grace, Chief Davis is a breathing reminder that systemic problems will not be solved by representational victories. The solution to police violence is no more the hiring of Black cops than the solution to mass incarceration is gender diversity among prison guards.\n\nM emphis is a city that drips with history. You can almost hear Isaac Hayes behind a piano at Stax as you walk Beale Street. And you can almost see Ernest Withers , twin-reflex camera around his neck, setting up the perfect shot, and Ida B. Wells furiously clacking at her typewriter as she prepares the next edition of her newspaper The Free Speech and Headlight . There's Martin Luther King Jr. leading the marching sanitation workers-his final campaign.\n\nAs I landed in Memphis last week, thick balls of ice began falling from the sky, the start of a days-long freeze that paralyzed the city. Still, the usual cast of characters braved the cold to pay their respects. Family members of George Floyd, Eric Garner, and Stephon Clark made the trip. The Reverend Al Sharpton took a private plane. The Nichols family's lead attorney, Ben Crump, drove several hours after getting stranded at the Atlanta airport. Vice President Kamala Harris represented the White House at Nichols's funeral-a short, solemn service in which everyone sang from a familiar songbook. \"The only thing keeping me going right now is that I really, truly believe that my son was sent here on an assignment from God,\" Nichols's mother, RowVaughn Wells, told the assembled mourners. \"I guess his assignment is done.\"\n\nAfter nearly a decade of writing about police violence, I no longer travel to every city that has just experienced a brutal killing. But it had been almost three years since a case like this had forced its way to the front of the nation's consciousness, even for a moment. It felt important to be in Memphis and witness, with my own eyes, this chapter of our never-ending story. And so I sat, in a chilly overflow room set up in Mississippi Boulevard Christian Church, looking up at a television monitor as Tiffany Rachal-whose oldest son, Jalen Randle, was killed by police in Houston last year and who was one of many mothers of the movement in attendance-sang the gospel staple \"Total Praise.\"\n\nIn Memphis, Davis herself commissioned the team that killed Nichols: the Street Crimes Operation to Restore Peace in Our Neighborhoods. The task force of 40 officers would be deposited in the city's most violent areas and told, as Davis put it, to \"be tough on tough people.\" Referred to as the SCORPION unit, the team was part of the city's response to a record-high 342 murders in 2021. As The New York Times reported , Mayor Jim Strickland bragged in his 2022 State of the City address about the hundreds of arrests made by the unit. Meanwhile, Black Memphis was being terrorized .\n\nSuch units are known for \"weak supervision, a high degree of independence, no accountability, [an internal] feedback loop,\" and they are \"encouraged to be aggressive,\" says Walter Katz, a vice president at the criminal-justice philanthropy Arnold Ventures, who has worked in police oversight since the 1990s. \"They have this mandate to stop street crime, and then the mandate tends to be far broader than the actual problem.\"\n\nThe expansion of these units has mirrored the rise of \"hot-spot policing,\" in which departments analze which neighborhoods have the most frequent crime and then send resources and man power. But each department chooses its remedy from a long menu of options. Hot-spot policing is a principle. What matters is the practice. Police could deploy officers determined to build trust in these \"hot spots.\" Instead, they tend to dispatch men in tactical gear driving unmarked Dodge Chargers, instructing them to make stops until they've got guns and drugs to put out on the table.\n\nSince Nichols's death, Memphis has disbanded SCORPION and announced a review of other specialty task forces. But these teams-described by police public relations as \"elite,\" known in the streets as \"jump-out boys\"-exist in cities across America and in some cases have been in place for decades. Many are havens for troubled officers.\n\n\"In every city in America, they have got one of these organized-crime units that trample on the constitutional rights of Black and brown communities,\" Crump, whose work on these cases has earned him the nickname \"Black America's Attorney General,\" told me after Nichols's funeral. \"I have never heard of an organized-crime unit going to brutalize our white brothers and sisters in their neighborhood. Show us that video.\"\n\nAs Black America pleaded for safety, elected officials in Memphis and across the country provided them instead with police. If the dream is a world in which a 29-year-old Black man can safely complete a drive home unmolested by those who would do him harm, civilian or police, the nightmare in which we reside is one in which Tyre Nichols is pulled from his car and pummeled to death just minutes from his family's house.\n\nM oments after first watching the video footage of Tyre Nichols being beaten to death, I turned to The Evidence of Things Not Seen , James Baldwin's 1985 essay about what was then the country's most perplexing true-crime story.\n\nThe terror in Atlanta stretched 22 months from 1979 to 1981 and resulted in more than two dozen corpses-all of them Black, most of them children. Nearly everyone assumed that the slayings were the work of a single perpetrator. Many, perhaps especially in Black Atlanta, took as a given that the killer was white, probably a Klan member. Then officials announced the arrest of a Black man named Wayne Williams, who was charged with two of the killings but, authorities tenuously insisted, could be tied to the rest as well. This news unleashed, as Baldwin writes, \"the instinctive attempt to calculate the meaning of the new dimension suddenly given to an old dilemma.\"\n\nEve Fairbanks: White supremacy is a script\n\nSpeculation swirled about whether the murders were an act of self-hatred. It's true, Baldwin concedes, that there are self-hating Black Americans, especially among police forces. But inasmuch as race was a factor here, Baldwin observes, it was in the way Black Atlantans had been left abused and abandoned by their nation. Descendants of those enslaved in America had been forced into crowded ghettos and kept out of quality schools; degraded by a criminal legal system that sought to scapegoat them for society's ills; denied jobs and wages, the opportunity and means for the socioeconomic advancement also known as the American dream.\n\nBaldwin understood then what many still fail to see now: Racism can reside not just in the heart of a killer but also within the skeleton of the system that produces him. \"The moral vacuum of any society,\" Baldwin wrote two years before his death, \"immediately creates an actual social chaos.\"\n\nMy copy of Evidence lived for years on my father's bookshelf before being clandestinely expatriated to my own. It has a fading black-and-white spine, and its cover features a close-up of Baldwin's face cropped so tightly that all you see is his right eye. The foreword to the paperback, issued in 1996, was written by Derrick Bell, who was Harvard Law's first Black tenured professor.\n\n\"James Baldwin was not a lawyer, yet his commentary on the Atlanta trial is enlightened by his astute assumption that racism in American law cannot be understood by reading statutes and legal decisions removed from the context of the political, economic, and social concerns that gave rise to them,\" Bell writes. \"Deeply embedded racial beliefs and presumptions doomed the Atlanta children to an environment where all manner of predicaments and perils haunted their days and threatened their lives.\"\n\nBell began his legal career in the 1950s as a civil-rights attorney and later worked under Thurgood Marshall, but his best-known legacy is the early inspiration for what became known as \"critical race theory,\" or CRT-a discipline that applies a critical lens to legal statutes and precedents, considering not just the words on the page but the context in which they were drafted.\n\n\"From the perspective of critical race theory, some positions have historically been oppressed, distorted, ignored, silenced, destroyed, appropriated, commodified, and marginalized-and all of this, not accidentally. Conversely, the law simultaneously and systematically privileges subjects who are white,\" Bell said during a 1995 speech at the University of Illinois in which he said CRT's aim is \"to empower and include traditionally excluded views and see all-inclusiveness as the ideal because of our belief in collective wisdom.\"\n\nIn the decade or so since his death, Bell's work has been subject to a steady stream of histrionics. The term critical race theory is now applied to any teaching on race that conservatives believe will upset white Americans. Critics claim that critical race theory is a form of \"racial essentialism,\" although it is, in fact, the opposite. CRT seeks to understand how intersecting identities factor into someone's experience with our legal edicts and societal norms. It does not suppose that individuals can be defined solely by those identities. The aim is a country in which humans equally created are actually treated as such; that's only achievable by understanding how the social concept of race continues to shape the American experience.\n\nSome see an act of police violence involving Black officers and are quick to dismiss racism as a factor. A critical race theorist would argue that it is impossible to understand a killing by an institution that descends, in part, from slave patrols without considering the racist bias ingrained over time.\n\nNone of this controversy would have surprised Bell. After decades of scholarship, he developed a theory called \"interest convergence,\" which posits that America's white majority takes strides toward racial equality only when white people see doing so as in their own best interest. Ultimately, Bell concluded, racism is a permanent feature of our society, unvanquished not because white Americans are inherently incapable of doing so, but because they are persistently unwilling to.\n\nO n the eve of Tyre Nichols's funeral, his family gathered at the Mason Temple Sanctuary, in the pulpit where, 55 years ago, Martin Luther King Jr. gave his final speech. Nichols's parents and siblings fanned out along the stage, flanked by local ministers and activists, many holding signs featuring one of the final photos of Nichols, which depicted him bruised and bloated in a hospital bed.\n\nSharpton introduced Amber Sherman, a 22-year-old activist among those leading the local protests. She outlined the family's demands. They want accountability for all of the officers involved that night, she said. They want to improve police-data transparency, end the use of armed officers for traffic enforcement, abandon pretextual stops, and disband all specialty task forces.\n\nWhen the floor was opened for questions, a Black activist who had been seated near the front of the sanctuary spoke up. He told Sharpton that he was a decorated Vietnam veteran and a member of the New Black Panther Party, a small militant group that has appropriated the name of the 1970s organization. Clearly, he said, all of the chanting and marching had failed to liberate Black men and women from the perils that haunt their days and threaten their lives. \"My experiences teach me, if you want to stop somebody from striking you, you've got to strike back,\" he said, before looking up at Sharpton and asking, \"Do you think it's time?\"\n\nSharpton demurred. \"I'll let you speak for yourself,\" he responded as the press corps in the pews and activists on the stage let out a chuckle. Then Nichols's older brother, Jamal Dupree, wearing a white-and-black starter jacket and a red flat-brim, approached the microphones.\n\n\"My brother was the most peaceful person I've ever met in my life. He never lifted a finger to nobody, never raised his voice to nobody,\" he told the man. \"If my brother was here today, and he had to say something, he would tell us to do this peacefully.\"\n\n\"Trust me. Me personally, sir? I would love to get busy,\" Dupree continued. \"But I'm stepping for my brother, not for myself.\"\n\nI locked eyes with Sharpton and raised a finger to let him know I had a question.\n\n\"What will be different this time?\" I asked after he called on me. Sharpton has been an activist for more than half a century, and for as long as I've been alive, he has specifically championed Black families whose loved ones have been killed by police. The year I was born, in 1990, he marched for Phillip Pannell in Teaneck, New Jersey, the town to which my family moved the summer before kindergarten. During my grade-school years, he'd been across the Hudson, demanding justice for Abner Louima and Amadou Diallo. As I finished high school in suburban Cleveland, he was back east in Queens, chanting the name Sean Bell.\n\nSince the mid-2010s, I've followed him and other activists as they've hopscotched across the country, answering questions at gatherings like this one-the only real difference between one case and another being, seemingly, the name on the cardboard signs. What if, as Derrick Bell theorized, American racism is truly intractable?\n\nIt was a layup of a question for an activist as seasoned as Sharpton. But it felt right for the venue. The probing and layered inquiries happen behind the scenes. Press conferences are theater in which we all play a part. And besides, it had been a while, and I wanted to watch him work. Sharpton typically begins small and then goes big. He starts in the contemporary then traces his way through history.\n\nAt the federal level, he said, this must prompt the passage of legislation ending qualified immunity-the provision that shields police officers from civil liability. At the state level, Nichols's death must result in the passage of a law to make it a crime for a cop to stand by and watch another officer brutalize a civilian.\n\n\"They never even asked him for his license and registration; they grabbed him out of the car,\" Sharpton riffed. \"Until they understand it's going to cost them personally, it won't stop.\"\n\nSharpton likes to draw a distinction between lifelong activists like himself and social-justice celebrities who vanish between the hashtags, gone just as suddenly as they came. Say what you will about Jheri curls, gold chains, and Tawana Brawley: No other person this side of King has as consistently decried the unchecked police abuse of Black Americans, and he knows it.\n\nHe is right when he says that movements take time. It was nine years from the Montgomery bus boycott to the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Today's discussions of ending armed traffic enforcement and shutting down specialty task forces would have been unthinkable a decade ago. Where might we be a decade from now? Faith, the Book of Hebrews instructs, is the substance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not seen.\n\n\"How long is it going to take?\" Sharpton asked, looking back down at me from his perch in the pulpit. \"Well, however long it takes, we gon be there.\""

      "text": "Inside the Meltdown at CNN\n\nCEO Chris Licht felt he was on a mission to restore the network's reputation for serious journalism. How did it all go wrong?\n\nListen to more stories on curio\n\nUpdated at 11:34 a.m. ET on June 7, 2023.\n\n\"H ow are we gonna cover Trump? That's not something I stay up at night thinking about,\" Chris Licht told me. \"It's very simple.\"\n\nIt was the fall of 2022. This was the first of many on-the-record interviews that Licht had agreed to give me, and I wanted to know how CNN's new leader planned to deal with another Donald Trump candidacy. Until recently Licht had been producing a successful late-night comedy show. Now, just a few months into his job running one of the world's preeminent news organizations, he claimed to have a \"simple\" answer to the question that might very well come to define his legacy.\n\n\"The media has absolutely, I believe, learned its lesson,\" Licht said.\n\nSensing my surprise, he grinned.\n\n\"I really do,\" Licht said. \"I think they know that he's playing them-at least, the people in my organization. We've had discussions about this. We know that we're getting played, so we're gonna resist it.\"\n\nS even months later , in Manchester, New Hampshire, I came across Licht wearing the expression of a man who had just survived a car wreck. Normally brash and self-assured, Licht was pale, his shoulders slumped. He scanned the room with anxious eyes. Spotting me, he summoned a breezy chord. \"Well,\" Licht said, \" that wasn't boring!\"\n\nWe were standing in the lobby of the Dana Center, on the campus of Saint Anselm College. Licht, the 51-year-old chair and CEO of CNN Worldwide, had spent the past hour and a half inside a trailer behind the building, a control room on wheels from which he'd orchestrated a CNN town hall with Trump . Licht had known the risks inherent to this occasion: Trump had spent the past six years insulting and threatening CNN, singling out the network and its journalists as \"fake news\" and \"the enemy of the people,\" rhetoric that had led to death threats, blacklists, and ultimately a severing of diplomatic ties between Trump and CNN leadership.\n\nBut that had been under the old regime. When he took the helm of CNN, in May 2022, Licht had promised a reset with Republican voters -and with their leader. He had swaggered into the job, telling his employees that the network had lost its way under former President Jeff Zucker, that their hostile approach to Trump had alienated a broader viewership that craved sober, fact-driven coverage. These assertions thrust Licht into a two-front war: fighting to win back Republicans who had written off the network while also fighting to win over his own journalists, many of whom believed that their new boss was scapegoating them to appease his new boss, David Zaslav, who'd hired Licht with a decree to move CNN toward the ideological center.\n\nOne year into the job, Licht was losing both battles. Ratings, in decline since Trump left office, had dropped to new lows . Employee morale was even worse. A feeling of dread saturated the company. Licht had accepted the position with ambitions to rehabilitate the entire news industry, telling his peers that Trump had broken the mainstream media and that his goal was to do nothing less than \"save journalism.\" But Licht had lost the confidence of his own newsroom. Because of this, he had come to view the prime-time event with Trump as the moment that would vindicate his pursuit of Republican viewers while proving to his employees that he possessed a revolutionary vision for their network and the broader news media.\n\nTrump had other ideas.\n\nFor 70 minutes in Manchester, the former president overpowered CNN's moderator, Kaitlan Collins, with a continuous blast of distortion, hyperbole, and lies . The audience of Trump devotees delighted in his aggression toward Collins, cheering him on so loudly and so purposefully that what began as a journalistic forum devolved into a WWE match before the first voter asked a question. Vince McMahon himself could not have written a juicier script: Trump was the heroic brawler-loathed by the establishment, loved by the masses-trying to reclaim a title wrongly taken from him, while Collins, standing in for the villainous elites who dared to question the protagonist's virtue, was cast as the heel. \"She's not very nice,\" Trump told the studio audience, pointing toward Collins while she stood just offstage during the first commercial break.\n\nTrump could be excused for thinking this was exactly what Licht wanted. The famously transactional ex-president had wondered aloud to his top aides, during their negotiations with CNN executives, what the network stood to gain from this production; when CNN made the decision to stock the auditorium with Republicans, the only thing Trump could figure was that Licht wanted a prime-time spectacle to resuscitate the network's moribund ratings. The two men spoke only briefly backstage. \"Have fun,\" Licht told him. Trump obliged. He demeaned the woman, E. Jean Carroll, whom a jury had one day earlier found him liable for sexually abusing. He repeated disproved fictions about election fraud and suggested that he would separate families at the southern border again if given the chance. He insulted Collins, calling her \"a nasty person\" as the crowd hissed in agreement. At one point, when she and Trump assumed their marks onstage after another commercial break, Collins politely reminded him not to step past the giant red CNN logo in front of them. Trump responded by gesturing as though he might stomp on it. The crowd roared in approval.\n\nListen: An interview with Tim Alberta about his time with Chris Licht\n\nLicht had not wanted this . Sure, he was chasing ratings; in nearly 20 years as a showrunner, ratings had been his currency. But Licht had come to Manchester with bigger ambitions than lifting CNN out of the viewership basement for a single evening in May. He believed that Trump owed his initial political ascent in part to the media's habit of marginalizing conservative views and Republican voters. That needed to change ahead of 2024. Licht wasn't scared to bring a bunch of MAGA enthusiasts onto his set-he had remarked to his deputies, in the days before the town hall, about the \"extra Trumpy\" makeup of the crowd CNN was expecting-and he damn sure wasn't scared of Trump. The way to deal with a bully like Trump, Licht told his journalists, was to confront him with facts.\n\nCollins tried to do just that. She was, however, no match for the environment she'd been thrust into. Squaring off one-on-one against the country's most accomplished trickster is difficult enough, but this was 300-on-one. The result was a campaign infomercial: Trump the populist champion, slaying his old nemesis and asserting to televised fanfare his claim to the presidency.\n\n\"Does CNN count that as an in-kind campaign donation?\" the longtime broadcaster Dan Rather tweeted.\n\nRather's comment was gentle compared with the torrent of criticism aimed at CNN. \"Ready to call it: This was a terrible idea,\" the conservative writer Ramesh Ponnuru tweeted, just nine minutes into the event. \"CNN should be ashamed of themselves,\" tweeted Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. \"This is an absolute joke,\" tweeted former Republican Representative Adam Kinzinger. \"Chris Licht is rapidly becoming the Elon Musk of CNN,\" tweeted The Bulwark 's Charlie Sykes.\n\nWhen Licht found me in the lobby, commenting on how not boring the night had been, it wasn't clear how much of the blowback he'd already seen. What was clear was that Licht knew this was bad-very, very bad. Republicans were angry at CNN. Democrats were angry at CNN. Journalists were angry at CNN. The only one who wasn't angry, it seemed, was Trump, most likely because he'd succeeded in disgracing the network on its own airwaves.\n\nI felt for Licht. Having spent long stretches of the past year in conversation with him as he attempted to build \"the new CNN,\" I often found myself agreeing with his principles of journalism. Some media figures had trashed Licht for hosting the town hall in the first place, arguing that nothing good could come from \"platforming\" a man who'd tried to sabotage the peaceful transition of power. Licht disagreed -and so did I. Trump was the runaway favorite for the GOP nomination and a decent bet to occupy the White House in two years. The media had every obligation to scrutinize him, interview him, and, yes, platform him.\n\nAs I'd settled into my seat in the Saint Anselm auditorium, however, I had been startled by my surroundings. This was no ordinary collection of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents, as CNN had claimed it would be. Most of them were diehards, fanboys, political zealots who were likelier to show up at a rally with a MAGA flag than come to a coffee shop with a policy question. These folks hadn't turned out to participate in some good-faith civic ritual. They were there to celebrate Trump's continued assault on the media.\n\nLicht's theory of CNN-what had gone wrong, how to fix it, and why doing so could lift the entire industry-made a lot of sense. The execution of that theory? Another story. Every move he made, big programming decisions and small tactical maneuvers alike, seemed to backfire. By most metrics, the network under Licht's leadership had reached its historic nadir. In my conversations with nearly 100 employees at CNN, it was clear that Licht needed a win-a big win-to keep the place from falling apart. The Trump town hall was supposed to be that win. It had to be that win. And yet, once again, the execution had failed.\n\nPulling me into a darkened corridor just outside the auditorium, Licht tried to compose himself. He and I had spent many hours discussing what he described as \"the mission\" of CNN. I asked Licht whether the town hall had advanced that mission. He bit his lip.\n\n\"Too early to say,\" Licht replied.\n\nListen to Tim Alberta discuss this article on Radio Atlanti c:\n\nSubscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | Google Podcasts | Pocket Casts\n\nD uring our first interview, over breakfast last fall, Licht made a point of assuring me: David Zaslav had his back.\n\nLicht was off to a slow start-understandably so. CNN was still staggering from the forced resignation of Zucker, a beloved figure who had been defenestrated for sleeping with his second in command , and the firing of Chris Cuomo, the prime-time star who, in addition to shattering ethical standards by advising his politician brother, had a #MeToo problem. (Zucker declined to comment for this article; Cuomo has denied allegations of sexual misconduct.) Meanwhile, the ownership change that preceded Licht's arrival-AT&T spun off WarnerMedia, which then merged with Discovery Inc. to create Warner Bros. Discovery-had been messier than expected. Thanks to shaky balance sheets, followed by an inflation crisis, Warner Bros. Discovery saw its stock price drop by half within months of its launch. Days before Licht assumed control of CNN, its new parent company announced the termination of CNN+ , a streaming platform that had been hailed as the future of the company.\n\nThere was never going to be much goodwill between Warner Bros. Discovery and the journalists at CNN. In November 2021, not long after the corporate takeover was announced, John Malone, a right-wing billionaire who stood to become a major shareholder on the new Warner Bros. Discovery board, said that CNN could learn a few things from the reporters at Fox News. \"I would like to see CNN evolve back to the kind of journalism that it started with, and actually have journalists, which would be unique and refreshing,\" Malone told CNBC. After Zucker was sacked, Zaslav, the CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, exacerbated these tensions by choosing Licht without interviewing any of CNN's internal candidates. Zaslav told numerous people that he needed an outsider to revamp CNN's journalistic practices because Republican politicians had told him they were no longer willing to come on the network-a rationale that worried staffers there.\n\nThe CNN rank and file were nonetheless excited by the arrival of Licht, who had earned the reputation of a boy-genius producer from his work on Morning Joe and The Late Show With Stephen Colbert . But things went sideways fast. A few weeks into his tenure, Licht instructed his producers to downplay the first hearing of the January 6 committee-an event that MSNBC treated like a prime-time special, earning monster ratings that infuriated the CNN staff. Licht expressed regret to some top editorial personnel the day after the hearing. Still, the incident proved unnerving. Journalists at the network already had reason to question the motives of Malone and Zaslav; now they were wary of Licht, too. When the new CEO began making public confessions of CNN's past sins-which sometimes came across like an endorsement of Trump's attacks on the network-the wariness gave way to wrath. Top talent began to turn on Licht. Rumors of a spoiled honeymoon spread through the industry. By the time Licht announced forthcoming layoffs to his employees-there would be more than 300 in total-in an email sent two days before our October breakfast, CNN was spiraling.\n\nDrinking from a glass of iced coffee, Licht shrugged it all off: the internal leaks, the external media swarm, the printed columns and whispered anecdotes accusing him of remaking CNN into Fox News Lite. \"This is too important for me to be worried about what someone's calling me or suggesting I'm trying to be,\" Licht said. \"This is so mission-driven and so important. I genuinely am-I get mad, I get frustrated, but it doesn't, like, affect me. Does that make sense?\"\n\nIt didn't make sense. Matt Dornic offered to translate. Dornic, who was accompanying us in his capacity as CNN's senior vice president of communications-and, I would learn, as a mainstay of Licht's small entourage-explained that what upsets the new boss isn't harsh coverage of him personally, but rather bad press about CNN's journalists. Dornic cited recent reports about how Jake Tapper's experimental show in the 9 p.m. hour-the slot vacated by Cuomo, which had yet to be permanently filled-was drawing anemic numbers . Licht pointed a finger at Dornic.\n\n\"What drives me nuts,\" he said, \"is that has the potential to throw my group off the mission.\"\n\nI asked Licht to explain that mission to me, as plainly as possible.\n\n\"Journalism. Being trusted. Everyone has an agenda, trying to shape events or shape thought. There has to be a source of absolute truth,\" he told me. \"There's good actors, there's bad actors, there's a lot of shit in the world. There has to be something that you're able to look at and go, 'They have no agenda other than the truth.'\"\n\nJournalism was Licht's first love. Raised in Connecticut, the son of a doctor and a physician assistant, he anchored make-believe newscasts in his basement as a grade-schooler. He studied broadcasting at Syracuse University then moved to Los Angeles, where, after a right-place, right-time chance to cover the O. J. Simpson trial, he got hooked on producing news. With a boyish tousle of blond hair and that bottomless supply of self-confidence, Licht talked his way into bigger and more consequential jobs, eventually finding himself back on the East Coast.\n\nIt was Licht's relationship with Joe Scarborough, the onetime Florida congressman turned television personality, that opened the biggest doors. First on MSNBC's Scarborough Country , a prime-time success that featured sharp conservative punditry on all things political and cultural, and then on Morning Joe , Licht distinguished himself as a top-notch executive producer, someone known to run through walls (and run over people) to make great television. Mike Barnicle, a Morning Joe contributor, nicknamed Licht \"Captain Intense.\" But the intensity caught up with him. Licht suffered a brain hemorrhage at 38 and began to reassess his life and career. A few years later, Licht left MSNBC to run the morning show at CBS, and then left the news business altogether, joining Stephen Colbert as the showrunner of The Late Show .\n\nLicht had a superlative arrangement with Colbert: more money, fewer headaches, better hours. Only one job, he told me, could have justified leaving that life and returning to the grind of journalism. And then the offer came: Zaslav, who had been courting Licht informally long before the WarnerMedia-Discovery merger was complete, asked him in early 2022 to lead the new CNN.\n\nLicht knew \"immediately\" that he had to accept. Yet he was not oblivious to the challenges that awaited. His wife, Jenny Blanco, had worked for CNN as a producer. He knew some of the premier on-air talent. Both Colbert and Scarborough warned him not to take the job, and Licht understood their reservations. He had watched, over the previous five years, as the network became more polarizing. When I asked Licht what he'd thought about CNN-as a viewer, and as a seasoned journalist himself-while working on Colbert's show, he hesitated, searching for the words.\n\n\"I thought, I'm having a tough time discerning between 'How much are we getting played as an audience by Trump?' and how much of it's actually ... \" He trailed off.\n\nLicht said Trump had done \"really bad shit\" as president that reporters sometimes missed because they were obsessing over more sensational stories. Trump had goaded the media with \"outrage porn,\" provoking journalists to respond with such indignation, so often, that audiences began to tune out. \"When everything is an 11\" on a scale of 10, Licht said, \"it means that when there's something really awful happening, we're kind of numb to it. That was a strategy. And I felt like the media was falling for that strategy.\"\n\nLicht recalled how, early in the Trump administration, a particular reporter hadn't been allowed into a press gaggle because of a feud with the White House. During a subsequent meeting with his fellow board members at Syracuse's Newhouse school of journalism, one of them suggested taking out a full-page ad in The New York Times denouncing this affront to the First Amendment. \"And I'm like, 'Guys, keep your powder dry. This is nothing. It's gonna get much worse,'\" Licht said.\n\n\"I felt that there was such a mission-\" He stopped himself.\n\n\"The mission was to go after this guy-\" He stopped again.\n\n\"Right or wrong. I'm not saying he's a good guy. He's definitely not,\" Licht said of Trump. \"But, like, that was the mission ... Sometimes something should be an 11; sometimes it should be a two; sometimes it should be a zero. Everything can't be an 11 because it happens to come from someone you have a visceral hatred for.\"\n\nI told Licht that while I agreed with his observation-that Trump had baited reporters into putting on a jersey and entering the game, acting as opposing players instead of serving as commentators or even referees-there was an alternative view. Trump had forced us , by trying to annihilate the country's institutions of self-government, to play a more active role than many journalists were comfortable with. This wasn't a matter of advocating for capital- D Democratic policies; it was a matter of advocating for small- d democratic principles. The conflating of the two had proved highly problematic, however, and the puzzle of how to properly cover Trump continued to torment much of the media.\n\nLicht didn't understand all the fuss. \"If something's a lie, you call it a lie. You know what you're dealing with now,\" he said. \"I think he changed the rules of the game, and the media was a little caught off guard and put a jersey on and got into the game as a way of dealing with it. And at least [at] my organization, I think we understand that jersey cannot go back on. Because guess what? It didn't work. Being in the game with the jersey on didn't change anyone's mind.\"\n\nThe new boss told people inside CNN that Tapper's 4 o'clock show, The Lead , was the model: tough, respectful, inquisitive reporting that challenged every conceivable view and facilitated open dialogue.\n\nLicht emphasized certain exceptions to this approach. He would not give airtime to bad actors who spread disinformation. His network would host people who like rain as well as people who don't like rain. But, he said, CNN would not host people who deny that it's raining when it is. This was no small caveat: More than half of Republicans in Congress had voted to throw out the electoral votes of Arizona and Pennsylvania based on lies. Meanwhile, plenty of Republicans who weren't election deniers didn't want to come on CNN anyway. Sensing this predicament, Licht had traveled to Capitol Hill early in his tenure, meeting with Republican leaders and promising them a fair shake under his leadership.\n\nWhat Licht viewed as a diplomatic visit, his skeptics portrayed as an apology tour. The narrative taking hold in elite media circles-that CNN's new boss was a scheming, ruthless Roger Ailes wannabe-went into overdrive. Licht was amused at first. But he soon lost his sense of humor. He called Robert Reich and rebuked him after the former labor secretary wrote a Substack post criticizing CNN. He vowed to friends that he would \"destroy\" Kurt Bardella, a Democratic strategist, for a disparaging Los Angeles Times column . Licht seethed about what he saw as a coordinated attack from liberals who feared long-overdue journalistic scrutiny of their ideals.\n\n\"You have a certain segment of society that has had an unfettered megaphone to the leading journalistic organization in the world,\" he said. \"And at the slightest hint that that organization may not be just taking things that are fed to them from that segment of the population, it must be that a fascist is running the network and he wants to move it to the right ... The fact that I want to give space to the [argument] that this thing everyone agrees with might be not right doesn't make me a fascist right-winger who's trying to steal Fox viewers.\"\n\nLicht was no fascist. But he was trying to steal viewers from Fox News-and from MSNBC, for that matter. To succeed, Licht said, CNN would need to produce more than just great journalism. Reporting the news in an aggressive, nonpartisan manner would be central to the network's attempt to win back audiences. But television is, at its essence, entertainment. Viewers would always turn on CNN in times of crisis, Licht told me. What he needed to find out was how many would turn on CNN for fun.\n\nFrom the March 2023 issue: Megan Garber on how everything became entertainment\n\nL icht frowned and folded his arms, irritation curdling his voice.\n\n\"I'm going to tell Don, the biggest mistake is commenting after every single story for the sake of commenting after every single story,\" he said, talking to no one and everyone all at once. \"Don't tell me, 'Oh, that's horrible.' We know it's horrible. If you've got a specific insight into something, if you can add something, tell us. But don't comment on every single fucking story.\"\n\nLicht had wedged a rolling office chair in between the first and second rows of Control Room B, a darkened space that featured scores of monitors being manipulated by two dozen people in hooded sweatshirts and headsets. Everyone looked tense. They were 96 hours from Election Day 2022, when they would launch CNN This Morning , Licht's first big swing as the network's head honcho, and the show looked terrible.\n\n\"I want more movement. Lots of movement,\" he told Eric Hall, the new program's executive producer, who sat in the center of the first row. \"What do I hate the most?\"\n\nHall and a younger producer named Zachary Slater responded in unison: \"Boxes.\"\n\nLicht nodded. \"Boxes,\" he said, referring to the Brady Bunch look on cable-news screens. \"I don't want it to be frenetic, but please make sure there's movement. We need to see these people.\"\n\nMaking good TV is difficult under even the best of conditions. These were not the best of conditions. Eager to put his imprint on CNN, Licht had started with what he knew best-mornings-and hounded his team to get the program ready for Election Day. Rehearsals had been rushed. The co-hosts-Don Lemon, Poppy Harlow, and Kaitlan Collins-were struggling to gel, in part because they had practiced so little together. (On this day, Collins was reporting in Georgia.) Licht had created this trio, created this new show, in hopes of injecting some flavor into CNN's lineup. He thought partnering Lemon, the opinionated, gay, Black southerner, with a pair of hard-hitting female news reporters could be the \"fun\" viewers needed. But Licht, I sensed, was not having fun.\n\nWhen the rehearsal went to break, a collective exhale gusted through the room. Licht leaned back, took out his phone, and started scanning a Variety story about his decision to eliminate the CNN documentary unit in the layoffs. After he uttered a few choice phrases-but before we could discuss the article-the show started back up, with the cameras centered on Lemon. He had changed into a white jacket, the collar made of fur, with a turtleneck underneath.\n\n\"What the fuck is he wearing?\" Licht blurted out. Nervous chuckles echoed around us.\n\nThe shot began zooming out, slowly at first to incorporate the guests, and then rotating around the glass table in the middle of the set. \"Good. I love that,\" Licht told Hall. \"Just slow it down, make it steady.\"\n\nA little while later, the younger producer spoke into Lemon's earpiece: \"Don, uhh, we're not too crazy about the jacket in here.\" Lemon looked miffed. Licht fought back a smirk. \"Why are you guys so mean to Don?\" he asked.\n\nThe joke wasn't lost on anyone. Clearly, Licht had dwindling patience for Lemon-his outfits, his ad-libbing, his opinions. None of this should have come as a surprise. Lemon was one of the most polarizing figures in media, someone with undeniable talent and unregulated instincts. Given Licht's down-the-middle mantra, people inside the network were mystified by his decision to hitch the success of the new morning show to CNN's chief provocateur. Some believed that Licht had been ordered by Zaslav to remove Lemon from his 10 p.m. slot (Licht denied this). Others sensed that Licht, who had already gotten rid of other \"off mission\" staffers, including the media reporter Brian Stelter and the White House correspondent John Harwood, would have axed Lemon too, if not for his being one of the lone Black voices on a very white network. Whatever the particulars, the careers of these two men were now intertwined.\n\nAs the show emerged from another break, Lemon, sans jacket, took his place in front of an enormous studio display. At the center were the words An Inconvenient Truth . Licht asked Hall what this segment was about. Hall replied that Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, had been saying crazy, hateful things for a long time, but corporate America had never abandoned him; only now, after his anti-Semitic rantings, were companies like Adidas dropping him. Lemon was going to ask: Why did those sponsors stick with Ye after his offensive remarks about slavery and other topics, but choose to bail now over his anti-Semitism?\n\nLicht looked skeptical. \"Where would you envision this running?\" he said.\n\n\"Probably the back half of the show,\" Hall replied.\n\n\"Do you think if I'm on my way to work, at 7:40 in the morning, I have time to absorb this?\" Licht asked.\n\nJust then, the segment began-and Lemon straightaway butchered the opening line. Hall let out an exasperated grunt. \"How does that happen?\"\n\nLicht grimaced. \"Read the fucking prompter,\" he said.\n\nAfter steering the segment by whispering instructions to Hall-\"full ... move left ... back out ...\"-Licht glanced over at Ryan Kadro, a top executive who'd worked with Licht at CBS and knew him better than anyone else in this room. Kadro was shaking his head. \"Way too long,\" he said.\n\n\"Way too long-and it's fucking morning time,\" Licht said, motioning toward the screen, which had displayed a graphic image of a tortured slave next to Lemon during his monologue. \"This is morning television.\"\n\nThe rehearsal wrapped, and Licht quickly made his way onto the set, cornering Lemon at the anchor desk. Licht gave his candid feedback-some things had worked, but the Ye segment had not. He wanted less commentary. Above all, he wanted Lemon-and the others-to keep things light in the mornings. Lemon looked hesitant. \"I don't want to be preachy in the morning, but I do want to hold people accountable,\" he said. Licht nodded and said he understood. Then he repeated himself: The Ye idea had missed the mark.\n\nWhen Licht left, I sat down with Lemon and Harlow-as well as Dornic, the omnipresent communications executive. Sensing some lingering tension from the earlier exchange, I asked Lemon whether his approach to news meshed with Licht's. Specifically, I mentioned our \"outrage porn\" conversation. Lemon squinted at me.\n\n\"Some people may want to qualify it as 'outrage porn.' But there was a lot to be outraged for these last few years,\" he said. \"There was a tweet or a statement or an action or something that was outrageous a few times a day for five, six years ... What we were doing is, we were fighting for democracy. We were fighting to set the record straight on us being attacked and called 'fake' ... That may have put us back on our heels and made us a bit more aggressive with calling it out, but it doesn't mean that it was 'outrage porn.'\"\n\nHarlow saw things somewhat differently-perhaps because of her straight-news background-but Lemon wasn't having any of it.\n\n\"A lot of people are Monday-morning-quarterbacking about what happened\" at CNN, Lemon told me. \"You have to remember the time that we were in. Every single day, we were being attacked by the former administration. And that's not hyperbole ... We had bombs sent to this very network.\"\n\nIn fact, Harlow was live on the air when the bomb was detected. She had to evacuate to the street, where she continued broadcasting . It was a traumatic ordeal for all of CNN-and that was Lemon's point. He had been swamped with threats during Trump's presidency, followed down the street by menacing figures, given a 24-hour security detail at certain points. Not that it was all about him. What of the unceasing vitriol against women and minorities, public officials and private citizens? It was all outrageous. Was he supposed to pretend to not be outraged?\n\nDornic jumped in. \"I don't think that's what Chris is even saying-\" He paused.\n\n\"This is not about you versus Chris,\" Dornic continued. \"I think his perspective is: Under a normal administration, those would have been 11s. But you had to recalibrate, because if you make the outrageous thing about women an 11, then what happens when he actually does something completely insane and undermines democracy?\"\n\nHarlow, now cast in the role of peacemaker, told Lemon that this seemed like a legitimate point. Just recently, she said, she had told her children the story of the boy who cried wolf. She did worry about Trump's destruction of norms, but she also worried about a lack of self-awareness displayed by some in her profession. Lemon looked ready to contest that point. Then, perhaps in deference to Harlow, he decided to drop it.\n\nAs we continued chatting, the bond between Lemon and Harlow was evident. She said her husband had advised her to switch roles only if it would mean becoming partners with Lemon; Lemon said he wouldn't have moved to the mornings alongside anyone else. Less clear was where Collins fit into this mix. Barely in her 30s, Collins had in a few years' time zoomed from entertainment writer at The Daily Caller to chief White House correspondent at CNN. She had serious reporting chops and a deep roster of sources. Everyone at the network could see that Collins was the future of the brand-a next-generation star who could be synonymous with CNN for decades to come. So why take away her prized reporting post and sit her behind a desk with two co-anchors?\n\nNo one really knew. Licht spoke of chemistry and character, of dynamic personalities and geographic diversity. (Lemon is from Louisiana, Harlow from Minnesota, and Collins from Alabama, making them symbolic of a forgotten America that Licht was determined to reach.) But this was mostly game theory. The truth is, Licht didn't know if it would work. What he did know was that CNN was falling farther behind in the ratings, and that without a daring move, something that could rouse a lethargic network, the discontent would grow louder. Licht remembered what Joe Scarborough used to tell him: \"Scared money never wins.\"\n\nLicht was ready to gamble. He asked Lemon to take the lead, trusted Harlow to be the stabilizer, and hoped Collins could adjust in a hurry. Licht's formative experience in television had come from watching Scarborough learn to check his ego and build an inclusive, engaging, highly entertaining program. He hoped Lemon could do the same.\n\n\"I feel like the senior of the group,\" Lemon told us, sitting on the set. He instantly sensed that this was unwise to say out loud. \"Yeah, yeah,\" said Harlow, giving him a look. \"But lift us up.\" Lemon grabbed her hand: \"I'm going to lift you up. I'm not going to try to bigfoot you.\"\n\nShe smiled politely. \"There's none of that on this show.\"\n\nI t was 6:07 a.m. and sweat dripped from Licht's nose.\n\nHe pumped his arms and legs on a machine inside a workout studio two blocks from the Hudson River. Joe Maysonet, a former boxer who wore polka-dot pajama pants, a green oxford shirt, and a peach-colored beanie, stood with his arms crossed, chirping at his client: \"Did I say stop? No, I did not!\"\n\nThree years ago, Licht weighed 226 pounds. Worried that he was losing control of his lifestyle, he went all in. No more breakfast. No drinking during the week. No more carbs or sweets. (\"I'm a fucking machine,\" Licht told me one day, when I asked why he was skipping a meal.) He also found Maysonet, whose gym, J Train, caters to New York's elite-actors, athletes, business tycoons. On this morning, in March 2023, the CNN boss was down to 178 pounds.\n\nLicht jumped off the machine. At Maysonet's instruction, he squatted down to grab a long metal pole lying flat on the ground. \"Zucker couldn't do this shit,\" Licht said through clenched teeth, hoisting the pole with a grunt.\n\nWorking in the shadow of Jeff Zucker, a hugely popular figure who had overseen the highest-rated, most profitable years in CNN's history, was never going to be easy. But Licht had made it harder than it needed to be. Among the first things he did, after taking over, was turn Zucker's old office on the 17th floor-across from the bullpen, right near key studios and control rooms-into a conference room. Then he decamped to the 22nd floor, setting up in a secluded space that most staffers didn't know how to find. It became symbolic of Licht's relationship to his workforce: He was detached, aloof, inaccessible in every way.\n\nThe comparisons with Zucker were inevitable, and Licht hated them. Whereas the old boss was gregarious and warm, giving nicknames to employees and remembering their kids' birthdays, Licht came across as taciturn, seemingly going out of his way to avoid human relationships. At a holiday dinner for his D.C.-based talent, Licht went around the private room at Café Milano, shook hands and spoke briefly with each of the journalists, then sat down and spent much of the dinner looking at his phone. Not only did he say nothing to address the group-as they all expected he would-but Licht barely interacted with the people seated near him. It became so awkward that guests began texting one another, wondering if there was some crisis unfolding with an international bureau. When a pair of them caught a glimpse of Licht's phone, they could see that he was reading a critical story about him in Puck .\n\nThe negative press had been building-and Licht, whatever his insistence to the contrary, had become consumed by it. Leaks from inside his own house especially angered him. Licht knew that many people remained loyal to his predecessor; some of his top executives, as well as on-air personalities, spoke with Zucker regularly. That hadn't particularly bothered him at first. Over time, however, it became obvious that those conversations were finding their way into media stories scrutinizing his leadership of CNN. Licht told friends he was convinced that Zucker-whose legacy he was undermining daily with rhetorical recriminations about past damage to CNN's brand-was retaliating by pushing hit pieces on him. In particular, Licht felt certain that Zucker was using Puck 's Dylan Byers, an ex-CNN employee who was pummeling Licht multiple times each week in his newsletter, to foment narratives of a mutiny at the network.\n\nLicht and Zucker knew each other, having worked together at NBCUniversal. Zucker told friends that he'd found it unusual-but hardly threatening-when, a few years earlier, with buzz building around a potential WarnerMedia-Discovery merger, Licht began attending David Zaslav's annual Labor Day party, an exclusive gathering in the Hamptons. Licht wasn't exactly the type of VIP who attended these events. When the merger began to appear inevitable, in the fall of 2021, Zucker got a call from Zaslav. He assured Zucker that his position atop CNN was secure. Then he asked his opinion of Licht. Zucker would later recall to friends that, at that moment, the endgame was clear. Within a few months, Zucker was out, Licht was in, and a cold war was under way. Attempts were made to broker a peace. In August 2022, Jay Sures, an agent who represents some of CNN's top talent, arranged a meeting at Zucker's vacation home. It was cordial enough, but suspicions ran deep between the two men. Both soon began peddling competing versions of what had gone down.\n\nHowever self-serving his criticisms of Zucker, Licht had legitimate reasons to be wary of his predecessor's approach. CNN had produced some terrific reporting during the Trump years, but it had also embarrassed itself, and the industry as a whole, on more than a few occasions. The use of paid contributors such as Jeffrey Lord and Corey Lewandowski, the latter of whom appeared on air while still being paid by the Trump campaign , served no defensible journalistic purpose. The incurious tone of the network's COVID-19 coverage-its steady deference to government officials, paired with its derision toward those who held heterodox opinions on school closings and other restrictions-did a disservice to viewers. All the while, Zucker's buddy-buddy rapport with the talent bred a lack of accountability that ultimately created rogues. Chris Cuomo smashed ethical norms and repeatedly lied to management about it. Jim Acosta routinely made himself the story while covering Trump's White House, specializing in lectures and snarky commentary instead of questions and source reporting. (One viral exchange with Trump, in which Acosta refused to surrender the microphone to a press aide, then stood to interrupt a colleague's question, came to epitomize the late stages of the Zucker era.) Licht had inherited a culture of loose rules and lax standards. For this, justifiably, he blamed Zucker.\n\nLicht could not, however, blame Zucker for what had become his biggest problem: Don Lemon.\n\nIn the middle of February, several weeks before I joined Licht for his morning workout, Lemon set social media ablaze-and infuriated Harlow and Collins, his co-hosts-by asserting that 51-year-old Nikki Haley \"isn't in her prime.\" A woman is only in her prime, Lemon explained, \"in her 20s, 30s, and maybe her 40s.\" This was just the latest in a string of offenses. For months, Lemon had been making the control room cringe with half-baked opinions, irritating Harlow and Collins by forcing his way into every segment, and angering Licht by adding the sort of superfluous commentary the boss had explicitly warned against. Tensions were already high when, one day in December, Collins started to interrupt Lemon during a news report. Lemon continued speaking and held up a finger to shush her-\"stand by, one second,\" he said-and then, after the segment, berated her in front of the crew. Their relationship would never recover. By the time Lemon made the \"prime\" remark, Licht was confronting the reality that his morning show might be a bust.\n\nThere was no neat solution to the Lemon problem. Top executives urged Licht to fire him; Licht, knowing it would be seen as a response to the Haley episode, worried about setting a harsh precedent. Lemon pitched an attempt at damage control-a prime-time special on misogyny, which he would host with a roundtable of women-and Licht rejected it. Then, a staffer close to Licht told me, Lemon began telling allies that Al Sharpton, Ben Crump, and other Black leaders would rally to his defense if he were fired, making his dismissal a referendum on CNN's whiteness. (A spokesperson for Lemon denied this and accused Licht's team of spreading rumors about him to distract from Licht's failures at CNN.)\n\nThe burden of this-of everything -made Licht's workouts at J Train indispensable. Licht called Maysonet his \"therapist\" and \"coach\" and \"one-man focus group.\" He was among the few people Licht trusted. This gym was Licht's sanctuary; nothing and no one was allowed to disrupt him here. Except Zaslav. To the annoyance of his trainer, Licht told me, Zaslav liked to call him at 6:30 a.m. Sometimes those calls came when Zaslav was on the West Coast, meaning it was 3:30 a.m. for him. When Licht told me this, he twisted his face into a pained expression.\n\nAssuming a side-plank position, Licht told me that Maysonet \"is super fucking liberal\" and not sold on his plans for CNN. Maysonet pressed his foot into Licht's shoulder. \"Rachel Maddow, now that's my chick,\" he said.\n\nLicht rolled his eyes. Maysonet kept goading him. \"By the way, you see my boy Jamie Raskin on MSNBC the other day?\" he asked, referring to the Democratic representative from Maryland. Maysonet began shuffling his feet like a prizefighter. \"Wiping the floor with your Republican boys!\"\n\n\"They're not my boys,\" Licht groaned, collapsing onto his back.\n\nMaysonet motioned for Licht to flip onto his other side. Then he turned to me, his voice abruptly becoming serious. \"I'll tell you what I do like about his vision,\" Maysonet said. \"He wants to create a conversation where we can talk to each other again. We can debate anything, but not if we're not talking to each other.\"\n\nI asked him to elaborate. Maysonet explained that after countless hours of conversation with Licht over the past few years-through the murder of George Floyd, the spread of COVID-19, the election of Joe Biden, the siege of the Capitol-he came away convinced that his client was uniquely capable of facilitating a national dialogue on some of the country's toughest, most divisive issues. Perhaps Licht had spent too much time promoting the return of Republicans to CNN, and not enough time advertising that forum for conversation. \"I think that's the part people don't know about him, and that's the part that could make CNN thrive,\" Maysonet said.\n\nLicht, now half-standing, hands on his knees, started to clarify that this was precisely what he'd attempted to do with his morning show. Maysonet pretended not to hear him, instructing Licht to go across the room and fetch a large, weighted sleigh. A minute later, as his client pushed the hulking object across the room, growling with every forward lurch, Maysonet mentioned some news from the sports world: The Brooklyn Nets, who had built their franchise around three all-star players, had just traded away the last of them, a catastrophic end to a once-promising experiment.\n\n\"All that talent,\" Maysonet said, \"but no chemistry.\"\n\nA studio audience of Licht's employees looked on as Audie Cornish, CNN's top audio journalist, probed her boss with questions that he didn't seem keen on answering.\n\nThe purpose of this springtime company town hall was for Licht to quell concerns and rally the troops, laying out his plan for the new CNN. Addressing a few dozen staffers who sat in black stackable chairs-and thousands more watching from their cubicles, couches, and reporting outposts around the world-Licht stressed the opportunity at hand. Americans were starving, he argued, for a network without perceived partisan loyalties; for a source of authoritative, follow-the-facts reporting; for a place that could foster a \"national conversation.\" CNN could be all of that. But first, Licht suggested, people had to fall in line. They needed to recognize that \"the brand has taken a hit over the past few years\" and unite around his editorial strategy as \"one team.\"\n\nWhat made unity so elusive was that CNN's newsroom had splintered into at least three factions. Some of Licht's journalists were dead set against him, believing his approach was a recipe for false equivalency. Others were lukewarm, open to a change in direction yet confounded by his ill-defined denunciations of the work they'd done in recent years. Even those who were fully on board-people who had hailed Licht's theoretical objective for the network-expressed bewilderment at his lack of specifics. He had talked a big game when he came aboard 10 months earlier, but since then-and especially after CNN's botched coverage of the first January 6 hearing-had largely kept out of sight, leaving producers and hosts to reimagine their programs off interpretations of Licht's innuendo. His move to the 22nd floor had become a serious liability. CNN staffers didn't just wonder where the boss was; they wanted to know what , exactly, he was doing. There was still no permanent host for the lucrative 9 p.m. hour. Licht's signature initiative-Lemon and the morning show-had become an industry punch line.\n\nEvery employee I spoke with was asking some variation of the same question: Did Licht have any idea what he was doing?\n\nCornish seemed determined to find out. In a Q&A session that grew slightly uncomfortable, she quizzed Licht on these issues and more: the \"culture and morale\" of the company, the confusion over his plans, the \"tough decisions\" pertaining to certain employees who hadn't gotten with his program. Licht began to look and sound restless. At one point, highlighting his recent guidance to refrain from bashing Fox News-and his wooing of Republicans to come on air-Cornish asked Licht about the perception that CNN was tacking deliberately to the right.\n\nHe fought a smirk. The network's coverage of the Fox News story to date had been textbook, he said, presenting the damning facts of what had emerged from the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit-namely, that Fox had knowingly misled its audience-and sparing viewers the hysterical analysis found on CNN's chief rival, MSNBC. As for platforming Republicans, \"I think it's incredibly important, if we're going to understand the country,\" Licht said. \"I actually want to hear from these Republicans. And to do that, it has to actually be a place where they know they're going to get a tough interview, but it's going to be respectful.\"\n\nAfter underscoring the \"fears\" people had internally-that CNN was enabling bad actors with a both-sides approach to journalism-Cornish asked him about the company's reputation. She, like so many of her colleagues, wanted to know what Licht meant by that nebulous word: brand .\n\n\"What I believe has happened in the past, to put it bluntly, is that sometimes the tone of our coverage has undercut the work of our journalism. And we're just trying to eliminate that and win that trust back,\" Licht said. \"Trust is that you're getting to the truth without fear or favor. We have seen the data that shows there's been a marked erosion of trust-\"\n\nCornish cut him off. \"Because of tenor and tone?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Licht said.\n\nIn the hallway a few minutes later, as we waited for an elevator, Licht asked what I thought of his performance. I told him that he looked on edge-like he was struggling to remain diplomatic in the face of questions that annoyed him.\n\n\"Yeah. At one point, I wanted to just say, 'We're not going to turn into BuzzFeed , okay?'\" Licht said. \"But that probably wouldn't have helped.\"\n\nProbably not. Settling into a conference room-his assistant ordered us Sweetgreen salads for lunch-I asked Licht whether he understood the anxiety that permeated his organization.\n\n\"I think wherever there's uncertainty, there's anxiety,\" he said. \"These are journalists, so there really isn't anything you can say that will ease anxiety. You have to show them. So the whole purpose of today really is like, 'Hey, there is a plan. This is what we're going to be doing. This is how it's going to involve you. This is the sense of purpose. This is the strategy.'\"\n\nThe company, he said, had been reeling ever since the firing of Chris Cuomo, which had set in motion the ousting of Jeff Zucker. \"This uncertainty and anxiety, you don't want it to become the new normal,\" Licht told me. \"And it has, to a certain extent.\"\n\nMuch of this angst at CNN, Licht argued, stemmed from skepticism about whether his vision would succeed in bringing back viewers. He acknowledged that it very well might not-or, at least, that it might take a long time. Licht was visibly bothered whenever someone brought up the network's bad ratings. But, he assured me, David Zaslav cared more about other metrics. Success would be measured differently at CNN than it had been in the past. \"This is a reputational asset for the company. It is not a profit-growth driver,\" Licht said.\n\nI asked him to define \"reputational asset\" in the context of an enormous, publicly traded, for-profit corporation.\n\n\"CNN, for Warner Bros. Discovery, is a reputational asset ,\" he said, emphasizing the phrase. \"My boss believes that a strong CNN is good for the world and important to the portfolio.\"\n\nEven if it's not making nearly the money it once did?\n\n\"So I'm told,\" he said.\n\nThis sentiment struck me as particularly guileless coming from a newsman. Whatever Zaslav's worldview, steering CNN toward the center was a business decision. In an age of fragmented media, Zaslav was convinced by Licht, among others, that broadening the network's appeal to reach an exhausted majority of news consumers was good for the bottom line (and, perhaps as a bonus, good for America). It's unclear whether Zaslav still believes that model is viable. There had been doubts from day one as to whether Warner Bros. Discovery planned to keep CNN; plenty of industry insiders believed Zaslav's plan was to stabilize the network, cut costs to stop the bleeding of revenue, then flip it for a gain.\n\nIn any event, the health of CNN's business was but one source of anxiety. I told Licht-based on my conversations with his employees, as well as the questioning from Cornish earlier in the day-that there seemed to be even greater insecurity about the journalistic ethos itself. When he'd warned Cornish about taking a \"condescending tone\" toward Republicans, surely it sounded to some reporters like he wanted them to coddle the crazy right-wingers who would use their platform to destabilize the country's democratic institutions.\n\nLicht looked annoyed. \"We are not an advocacy network. And if you want to work for an advocacy network, there are other places to go,\" he told me. \"You can find any flavor of advocacy in a news organization that suits your need. We are providing something different. And when the shit hits the fan in this world, you're not gonna have time for that advocacy anymore. You need an unbiased source of truth.\"\n\nI told him that some journalists, myself included, believe that truth itself needs to be advocated for.\n\n\"No one is suggesting in any way that we shy away from the truth,\" he replied.\n\n\"Do you believe in absolute truth?\" I asked.\n\n\"That's a weird question,\" he said, rumpling his brow.\n\nIt wasn't that weird. He had used the phrase in one of our prior interviews, but, it seemed, hadn't given much thought to its usage in the context of modern media. \"Absolute truth. Hmmm,\" he said, stroking his chin. Finally, he shrugged. \"It's that analogy again, right? Some people like rain; some people don't like rain. You can't tell me it's not raining [when] it's raining.\"\n\nIf only it were that simple. A few weeks earlier, The New York Times had descended into open conflict after a group of contributors and staffers signed a letter condemning the paper's alleged \"editorial bias\" in its coverage of the transgender community. Another letter, signed by a number of prominent Times reporters, rebuked what they saw as an effort to silence legitimate journalistic inquiry. Both parties, I told Licht, believed that they were standing for the truth.\n\nHe leaned across the table. \"Your beliefs can be different, but there's only one truth,\" he said. \"And we have to be able to ask questions and have conversations that help people understand what's happening ... We have completely lost the ability to have difficult conversations without being demonized or labeled. It's okay to ask questions, to have difficult conversations. You can strongly believe in something at your core, but that doesn't affect the truth.\"\n\nLicht emphasized that although he would show employees grace for certain missteps, he had no tolerance for efforts to chill reporting on controversial topics. He noted that Zucker, fearing the COVID-19 \"lab-leak theory\" was a xenophobic gambit that endangered Asian Americans, had essentially banned discussion of the topic on the air. This was not dissimilar, Licht suggested, to the surgeon general of the United States telling citizens at the beginning of the pandemic that wearing masks wouldn't help them-not because it was a fact, but because the government wanted to prevent a run on the masks needed for first responders.\n\n\"They didn't tell us the truth about something, because they were worried about an outcome,\" Licht said.\n\nHe leaned back in his chair. \"So, yes, I believe in absolute truth.\"\n\nL ater that day , while riding the Acela from New York to Washington, Licht expanded on his media polemic. Specifically, he wanted to keep talking about COVID-19. Like Trump's presidency, Licht told me, the pandemic had exposed the degree to which his network had lost touch with the country.\n\n\"In the beginning it was a trusted source-this crazy thing, no one understands it, help us make sense of it. What's going on?\" he said. \"And I think then it got to a place where, 'Oh wow, we gotta keep getting those ratings. We gotta keep getting the sense of urgency.'\"\n\nHe slapped his palms on the table between us, mimicking the feverish pace of an imaginary broadcaster. \"COVID, COVID, COVID! Look at the case numbers! Look at this! Look at this!\" Licht said. \"No context. And, you know, the kind of shaming . And then people walked outside and they go, 'This is not my life. This is not my reality. You guys are just saying this because you need the ratings, you need the clicks. I don't trust you.'\"\n\nWere they wrong?\n\n\"They were not,\" he said.\n\nFor a man widely perceived to be carrying out the orders of his bosses on the board of Warner Bros. Discovery, Licht held some awfully strong views of his own. Certainly, he was under pressure to conform CNN to the whims of Zaslav; Licht told top staffers that he was continually fighting to \"protect\" them from editorial interference at the corporate level. Licht had heard the talk about his being a glorified errand boy. Perhaps because it contained some trace of truth, he seemed determined in our conversations to map out his own distinct worldview.\n\nLicht insisted that his media critiques were not ideological; that he was rebuking not a liberal slant on the news, per se, but rather a bias toward elite cultural sensibility, a reporting covenant in which affluent urban-dwelling journalists avoid speaking hard truths that would alienate members of their tribe. When we returned to the question of covering transgender issues-specifically, the science around prepubescent hormone treatments and life-altering surgeries-he suggested that the media was less interested in finding answers and more worried about not offending perceived allies.\n\n\"We've got to ask tough questions without being shouted down for having the temerity to even ask,\" Licht said. \"There is a truth in there, and it may not serve one side or the other. But let's get to the truth. Some of this is right, some of this is wrong; some of this is wrong, some of this is right.\"\n\nHe paused. \"And I will add, this is where words matter. You immediately force some people to tune out when you use, like, 'person capable of giving birth.' People tune out and you lose that trust.\" He took another pause. \"Do not virtue signal. Tell the truth. Ask questions getting at the truth-not collecting facts for one side or collecting facts for another side. Ask the tough questions. It's an incredibly sensitive, divisive issue of which there is a Venn diagram that this country can agree on, if we get there with facts.\"\n\nLicht argued that the media's blind spots owe to a lack of diversity-and not the lack of diversity that he sees newsrooms obsessing over. He wants to recruit reporters who are deeply religious and reporters who grew up on food stamps and reporters who own guns. Licht recalled a recent dustup with his own diversity, equity, and inclusion staff after making some spicy remarks at a conference. \"I said, 'A Black person, a brown person, and an Asian woman that all graduated the same year from Harvard is not diversity,'\" he told me.\n\nA minute later-after noting how sharing that anecdote could get him in trouble, and pausing to consider what he would say next-Licht added: \"I think 'Defund the police' would've been covered differently if newsrooms were filled with people who had lived in public housing.\" I asked him why. \"They have a different relationship with their need with the police,\" he said.\n\nLicht glanced over at his assistant. \"Now I'm in trouble,\" he said.\n\nI wondered if he wanted to get in trouble-if he savored barreling through the boundaries of mannerly media conversation. It had become apparent, from my reporting, that Licht's circle was small and getting smaller. He obviously felt that he couldn't trust some of the people around him-folks who were loyal to Zucker, or leaking to undermine him, or both. That distrust begot a certain foreboding-yet also a certain liberation. Whereas he was guarded with CNN employees, our many hours of conversations began to feel like therapy sessions for Licht, safe spaces in which he vented grievances and admitted fears and chased an elusive breakthrough.\n\nI had heard from former colleagues how, in the early days of Morning Joe , when the C-suites at NBC treated his start-up show like a joke, Licht had adopted a me-against-the-world mentality, hunkering down and swearing to make the 30 Rock establishment pay for its contempt. It occurred to me that Licht was doing the same thing now. The difference, of course, was that he no longer represented the ragtag rebel alliance. He was the chair and CEO of CNN Worldwide. He was the empire.\n\nAs we cruised past Wilmington, Delaware, I asked Licht if there were people at CNN who wanted him to fail.\n\n\"I'm sure,\" he said, nodding, visibly weighing what to say next. He opted to play it safe. \"But it's certainly a very small part, a very small pocket of the organization. So I don't spend a lot of time thinking about it.\"\n\nThen his voice changed. Suddenly, Licht was animated. \"But I would say that for anyone who does want me to fail-what are you going for? Who would you want in this seat? You want a journalist? You want someone who has a direct line to the corporation and can make a phone call and go, 'Hey, what the fuck?' Do you want someone who's done the job? Who's done a lot of the jobs? Who understands exactly what it takes to do what I'm asking? Someone who believes that our future is based on executing great journalism? Maybe they don't like my style or whatever, but I'm not quite sure what you're going for-if you want me to fail.\"\n\nLicht looked out the window. \"So I don't spend a lot of time thinking about it,\" he repeated.\n\nFocusing on his \"style\" seemed like a cop-out. I told Licht that in my conversations with his employees, they had three main beefs. The first was that he relentlessly attacked the previous iteration of CNN without ever really specifying-as he'd been doing in our interviews-what he disliked about the coverage or what he would have done differently. Licht countered this criticism by explaining that he didn't want to call out particular journalists, especially \"when they were being rewarded for that behavior by the boss before me.\"\n\nLicht told me that bad behavior had been addressed with certain individuals directly. Without identifying Jim Acosta by name, Licht said: \"There was one person I had dinner with who was very much perceived as [having] the wrong tone, the old way of doing it. People just assumed they didn't fit in my world. And I had dinner with that person, and I said, 'Can I assume that this was fog of war? That sometimes we do things during war that isn't who we are?' And he said, 'You absolutely can assume that. What do you need from me?' We haven't had an issue.\"\n\nThis brought us to the second beef with Licht: His approach seemed consistently inconsistent. Acosta was spared while Brian Stelter got axed; John Harwood was pushed out because he didn't fit the \"brand,\" but Don Lemon was given a huge new contract and a promotion to anchor Licht's morning show. After disrespecting his colleague and making asinine comments on the air, Lemon still had his job-for the time being-confounding even those CNN employees who considered him a friend.\n\nBehavior and branding aside, Lemon's morning show was bad . Hence the third beef Licht's employees had with him: Wasn't he supposed to be a producer extraordinaire? A television genius? How was it that so much of the content he put on the air was so unwatchable? I reminded him of what Joe Maysonet, his trainer, had said about the Brooklyn Nets: Big stars and big egos had ruined the team's chemistry, leaving management no choice but to trade them away and start over. I asked Licht if, four months into the morning show, he was nearing that point.\n\n\"Jury's out,\" he replied.\n\nAnd then I asked Licht if, looking back, there were things he wished he had done differently. He said yes-\"100 percent\"-but seemed reluctant to say more. When I pressed, Licht conceded that his biggest mistake had been blazing into the place, determined to prove he was in charge, bellowing, in his own synopsis, \"I'm gonna be a much different leader than Jeff,\" rather than learning the place, including what Zucker had gotten right.\n\n\"I was intent on trying to draw a line of difference between the old regime and the new regime,\" Licht said. \"I should have just sort of slowly come in, without making these grand pronouncements of how different I was going to be.\"\n\nThose grand pronouncements had alienated Licht from much of his workforce. He now realized as much. But, he promised me, there was time to turn it all around. His mission was accelerating. Big moves were in the works. Soon, he said, the world was going to get a look at the new CNN.\n\n\"C hris was absolutely , positively, without question the right choice for CNN,\" the teacher told his students, motioning toward the man seated in front of them. \"There is nothing more important in America today than trust. I'm praying that Chris is successful. I want him to have this job for 10 years. Because anything less than 10 years will not give him the opportunity to make the most important changes to the most important news source on the face of the Earth. I have every faith that he will succeed, and every fear for this country if he doesn't.\"\n\nHe turned to face Licht. The teacher's eyes were watery. His voice was choked with emotion. \"My hopes and dreams are embodied in you,\" he said.\n\nThis was quite an introduction, especially considering the man who gave it: Frank Luntz.\n\nFor 30 years, Luntz, the pollster and focus-group guru, had been the maestro of messaging for a Republican Party that systematically attempted to delegitimize the news media. Luntz had no particular regrets about this. Though he broke from his party over its subjugation to Donald Trump, he still believed the press had done as much damage to the country as any politician in his lifetime, which explained his exuberance over the selection of Licht to run CNN. Since meeting him more than a decade ago, back in the Morning Joe days, Luntz had become certain that Licht was especially well equipped to frame the sort of smart, fair, nuanced discussions the voting public deserved. With Zucker out of the picture, Luntz went into lobbying mode, pleading with Licht to pursue the job, unaware that it had already been offered and accepted.\n\nLicht had never gotten a fair shake, Luntz told the group of University of Southern California students sitting in a semicircle in his D.C. apartment. The critics had come for him within weeks of his taking the job.\n\n\"Days!\" Licht said, cutting him off. Luntz nodded in agreement. Licht told him that was just fine. His boss, David Zaslav, thought in terms of years, not months. Licht had a plan to see CNN through to the other side of its identity crisis-and Zaslav possessed the patience to let that plan work. Luntz winced. He noted that NFL owners were famous for saying this very thing about their coaches-that there was a vision in place, that it would take time-before firing them. He told Licht he was praying that would not happen.\n\nThat CNN's chieftain would enjoy such enthusiastic support from a famed Republican operator-and that Licht would pay this early-spring visit to Luntz's home, a place where House Speaker Kevin McCarthy keeps a bedroom -likely confirms the left's worst fears about him. (When I asked Licht if he is a conservative, he replied, \"I would never put myself into a category. I think it depends on what we're talking about.\") In truth, Licht wasn't here for Luntz. The night before, when the old friends had run into each other at an event honoring Ted Turner, Luntz had sprung an idea. He was teaching a class to visiting USC students and would be hosting them at his apartment the next day; what if Licht made a surprise appearance to answer their questions about the media?\n\nMost executives would never entertain such a haphazard scheduling request. To his credit, Licht-now very much in the barrel at CNN, rumors about job security shadowing his every move-did so and then some. The next day, he showed up at Luntz's apartment and spent an hour with the group of 16 students. It struck me, yet again, as exactly the type of open interaction he'd been avoiding with his own employees. With the students, Licht was blunt and authentic to a fault; once, during a word-association game, when a young woman called CNN \"liberal,\" Licht made no effort to mask his irritation, quizzing her for specifics until she admitted defeat, confessing that her answer was more about perception than reality.\n\nOne of her classmates raised his hand. He asked Licht how CNN could recover from being the face of \"fake news.\" Licht replied that the network needed to \"double down\" on a facts-only approach. \"It's so easy to ruin a reputation-and it just takes a lot of time to win it back,\" he said. Licht told the students that his organization had little margin for error: Every story on the CNN website, every chyron on the airwaves, every comment on his reporters' social-media accounts was going to be scrutinized. \"It all matters,\" he said. \"Because the second you give ammunition to the other side, they exploit it.\"\n\nAnd then Licht said something I'd never heard before. \"I don't want people to think of CNN, Fox, and MSNBC in the same sentence,\" he said.\n\nLicht told students that MSNBC was using the all-outrage, all-the-time model that CNN had invented; \"one show in particular,\" he noted, seemed to use a BREAKING NEWS banner on virtually every segment. (He was referring to Nicolle Wallace's program at 4 p.m., a competitor to Jake Tapper's show in that time slot.) That tactic produces a bump in ratings, Licht said-but he called it irresponsible on the part of his former employer.\n\nHe was-justifiably, but still surprisingly-much harder on Fox News. After all, Licht had repeatedly warned his staff not to \"get over their skis\" while covering Rupert Murdoch's network. He stressed that they were \"not in the business of freaking out over everything Laura Ingraham says,\" because \"it's not news.\" What we were witnessing now, Licht said, was news. Tucker Carlson had been trashing Trump in text messages while providing him cover in prime time. Ingraham and Sean Hannity had dismissed the election-fraud crusade in private while selling it to the base . In fact, the evidence that had emerged from the Dominion lawsuit showed that \"a major media organization was knowingly misleading people, and it had actual real-world consequences,\" Licht said.\n\nUsing this example, Licht sought to differentiate CNN from both networks-slamming Fox News for being a duplicitous propaganda outfit, and rebuking MSNBC for trafficking in hysteria. \"If every day we were hammering Fox, it all sounds like noise,\" Licht told the students. \"But if you're watching CNN right now, you're going, 'Wow, this is actually important, because they never talk about Fox.'\"\n\nRight on cue, one of Luntz's students asked Licht about the trap of false equivalency. She seemed less interested in litigating the respective crimes of Fox News and MSNBC-though that played into her question-and more concerned with Licht's overall attitude toward the news. There is, she reminded him, \"one truth\" on some fundamental questions facing the country. Trump had lost the 2020 election; Barack Obama had been born in the United States; we know how many deaths have been caused by COVID.\n\nLicht pounced. \"Wait a second. We don't know how many deaths there were from COVID,\" he said.\n\nShe frowned at him.\n\n\"No, really, we don't,\" Licht said. As the son of a doctor, he believed there were \"legitimate conversations\" to be had about the death toll attached to COVID-19. Perhaps some patients had been admitted to hospitals with life-threatening illnesses before the pandemic began, then died with a positive diagnosis, Licht postulated. \"Where we run into trouble is when you say, 'No. Come on. We're not even having that conversation,'\" he told the students. \"That goes to trust as much as anything else. If you're solid on your facts, then you should be able to entertain that discussion.\"\n\nLicht conceded that mollifying the right with a both-sides approach was \"the biggest concern in my own organization.\" But he wasn't backing down. It had been unfair, he said, to paint everyone who had questions about the accuracy of death counts as \"COVID deniers.\" It was dishonest to frame the final pandemic-era bailout as \"You're either for this rescue bill, or you hate poor people.\" He gave them his favorite analogy: We can debate whether we like rain or we don't like rain, as long as we acknowledge when it's raining outside.\n\nThe final question was straightforward. A young woman asked Licht how, given his harsh critiques of CNN's past performance, the network planned to cover Trump this time around.\n\n\"I get asked that question all the time,\" Licht said, looking bemused. \"I will give you a very counterintuitive answer, which is: I am so not concerned about that.\" He explained that Trump was now a recycled commodity; that his \"superpower\" of dominating the news cycle was a thing of the past. If anything, Licht added, he would love to get Trump on the air alongside his ace reporter Kaitlan Collins.\n\nThe students appeared startled by his nonchalance.\n\n\"You cover him like any other candidate,\" Licht told them.\n\nT he next time I saw Licht was two months later in Manchester.\n\nThe CNN newsroom had been stunned by the news of the May 10 town hall. Internally, questions about whether the network would platform Trump in the run-up to the 2024 campaign had felt very much unanswered. Almost no one-not even CNN's leading talent, people who had long-standing relationships with Trump and his top aides-knew about the negotiations to host a town hall. When it was announced, Licht made a forceful argument to his employees about the merits of a live event. The campaign was under way; Trump was the front-runner and needed to be covered. Rather than giving him unfiltered access to their viewers via rallies, Licht said, CNN could control the presentation of Trump with its production decisions, its questioning, its live fact-checking. To varying degrees, his skeptics told me, they bought in.\n\nBut anxieties grew as the town hall approached. Employees found it strange that none of the CNN anchors who'd interviewed Trump-Anderson Cooper, Jake Tapper, Erin Burnett, Wolf Blitzer, Chris Wallace-was invited to play a role in preparing for the event, whether by shaping questions, suggesting best practices, or simply advising Collins. Trump speculated on social media about the town hall turning into a disaster, prompting fears among executives that he might stage a stunt by walking off the set, which in turn prompted fears among staffers about what, exactly, the network would do to keep Trump on the set. In the final days before the event, concerns about the audience makeup spiked as Licht's description of the crowd-\"extra Trumpy\"-wound its way through Slack channels and text-message threads.\n\nAll of these concerns, it turned out, were warranted. Preparation was clearly an issue. Collins did an admirable job but was steamrolled by Trump in key moments; her questions, which came almost entirely from the candidate's ideological left, served to effectively rally the room around him. Not that the room needed rallying: The crowd was overwhelmingly pro-Trump, and because CNN wanted an organic environment, it placed few restrictions on engagement. The ensuing rounds of whole-audience applause-I counted at least nine-disrupted Collins's rhythm as an interviewer. So did the ill-timed bouts of laughter, such as when Trump mocked E. Jean Carroll, and the jeering that accompanied Collins's mention of the Access Hollywood tape. By the end of the event, it was essentially indistinguishable from a MAGA rally. People throughout the room shouted, \"I love you!\" during commercial breaks and chanted \"Four more years!\" when the program ended.\n\nAs attendees emptied into the lobby, it felt as though fans were celebrating the home team's victory over a hated rival. People I talked with lauded Trump and loathed CNN in equal proportion. Christopher Ager, the state party chair, captured their sentiments best: \"We knew that CNN had new leadership. It seemed like they had a different tone, like they were going to be fair to Trump, fair to Republicans. But I didn't see that tonight,\" he said. \"This was the old CNN.\"\n\nTwo hundred fifty miles away, on the set in New York, CNN staffers were perplexed. The initial plan had called for Scott Jennings, a Republican who is less than enamored of Trump, to join his familiar grouping of pundits on the postgame show. CNN had flown Jennings to New York for the occasion. However, hours before the town hall, a switch was announced internally: Byron Donalds would be substituted for Jennings (who wound up coming on the air with another panel much later that night). Donalds, a Republican congressman from Florida, is an election denier-someone who, to use Licht's language, says it's not raining in the middle of a downpour. It was enough of a problem for some CNN staffers that Trump, the original election denier, was flouting Licht's oft-repeated standard. But why was Donalds on CNN's postgame panel?\n\nThis wasn't the only peculiar personnel move. Sarah Matthews, a Trump-administration official who'd turned critical of her former boss, had been slated to appear on the pregame show. But she was abruptly nixed in favor of Hogan Gidley, a former White House staffer who remained devoted to Trump.\n\nLive television is a volatile thing. People and sets and scripts are always being changed for all kinds of reasons. Still, CNN employees had reason to be suspicious. They wondered if some sort of deal had been cut with Trump's team, promising the placement of approved panelists in exchange for his participation in the town hall. At the least, even absent some official agreement, it seemed obvious that CNN leaders had been contorting the coverage to keep Trump happy-perhaps to prevent him from walking offstage. At one point during the pregame show, when the words SEXUAL ABUSE appeared on the CNN chyron, one of Licht's lieutenants phoned the control room. His instructions stunned everyone who overheard them: The chyron needed to come down immediately.\n\nWhen the town hall ended, two postgame panels kicked off concurrently, giving network executives the flexibility to switch between reporting and analysis. One panel, anchored by Tapper, was a roundtable of journalists picking apart Trump's lies. The other, led by Cooper, featured partisan pundits-including Donalds-debating one another. According to the mission that Licht had articulated for me, Tapper's panel should have starred that night. But it didn't. Licht made the call to elevate Cooper's panel (a fact first reported by Puck ). This decision may or may not have come from the very top: In the days after the town hall, Zaslav told multiple people that Tapper's Trump-bashing panel reminded him of Zucker's CNN. Yet even that MAGA-friendly version wasn't good enough for Donalds. After criticizing the network on-air, the congressman stepped off the set and then, in full view of the crew as well as his fellow panelists, grabbed his phone and started blasting CNN on Twitter.\n\nLicht was still coming to terms with the ferocity of the backlash later that night when CNN's popular Reliable Sources newsletter landed in his inbox. He read the opening line in disbelief: \"It's hard to see how America was served by the spectacle of lies that aired on CNN Wednesday evening,\" Licht's own media reporter, Oliver Darcy, wrote .\n\nLicht could handle being ridiculed by his media rivals. But being publicly scolded by someone on his own payroll-on the biggest night of his career-felt like a new level of betrayal. Licht, who just hours earlier had expressed ambivalence to me about how the event played, went into war mode.\n\nThe next morning, he began the 9 o'clock editorial call with a telling choice of words: \"I absolutely, unequivocally believe America was served very well by what we did last night.\"\n\nL ots of CNN employees on that morning call disagreed with Licht. They thought his execution of the event had been dreadful; they believed his tactical decisions had essentially ceded control of the town hall to Trump, put Collins in an impossible position, and embarrassed everyone involved with the production. These opinions were widely held-and almost entirely irrelevant. Everyone at CNN had long ago come to realize that Licht was playing for an audience of one. It didn't matter what they thought, or what other journalists thought, or even what viewers thought. What mattered was what David Zaslav thought.\n\nI was looking forward to finding out. For months, Zaslav's head of communications, Nathaniel Brown, had been shielding his boss from participating in this story. He first told me that Zaslav would speak to me only without attribution, and any quotes I wanted to use would be subject to their approval. When I refused-telling Brown that quote approval was out of the question, and that I would meet Zaslav only if he allowed on-the-record questioning-he reluctantly agreed to my terms, but then tried running out the clock, repeatedly making Zaslav unavailable for an interview. Finally, after false starts and a painstaking back-and-forth, the interview was set. I would meet Zaslav on Wednesday, May 17-one week after the Trump town hall-at his office in New York.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, less than 24 hours before that meeting, Brown called me. \"We're going to keep this on background only, nothing for attribution,\" he said. This was a brazen renege on our agreement, and Brown knew it. He claimed that it was out of his hands. But, Brown tried reassuring me, \"with everything going on,\" Zaslav thought \"he could be most helpful to you by explaining some things on background.\"\n\nI wasn't entirely surprised. Over the previous year, people who knew Zaslav-and who had observed his relationship with Licht-had depicted him as a control freak, a micromanager, a relentless operator who helicoptered over his embattled CNN leader. Zaslav's constant meddling in editorial decisions struck network veterans as odd and inappropriate; even stranger was his apparent marionetting of Licht. In this sense, some of Licht's longtime friends and co-workers told me, they pitied him. He was the one getting mauled while the man behind the curtain suffered nary a scratch. I declined Brown's offer. I told him this was Zaslav's last chance to make the case for Licht's leadership-and his own. If he wanted to explain things, he could do so on the record, as we had agreed. Zaslav refused.\n\nThe night before the publication of this story, Zaslav sent a statement through Brown saying \"while we know that it will take time to complete the important work that's underway, we have great confidence in the progress that Chris and the team are making and share their conviction in the strategy.\" Brown also offered his own statement alongside it, saying that he'd only canceled our on-record interview because \"it became clear over a period of months between the initial request and the planned meeting that the premise of that meeting had changed.\" (It had not; in an email two days before the scheduled meeting, Brown had written that they would see me Wednesday for an \"on record\" conversation.)\n\nThe day after that canceled meeting, I sat down with Licht for the final time, at a restaurant overlooking Hudson Yards. I told him about the perception that Zaslav doesn't let him do his job. Licht looked temporarily frozen.\n\n\"I don't feel that at all,\" he said. \"I feel like I have someone who's a great partner, who has my back and knows a lot about this business.\"\n\n\"Do you feel like you've been able to be yourself on this job?\" I asked.\n\n\"Where does that question come from? What are you getting at? Like, myself ?\" he asked, looking incredulous. Licht chewed on his lip for a moment. \"I think it's very different-a CEO job is just very different. Every word you say is parsed. Every way you look at someone is parsed. It's just different. So I try to be as much of my authentic self as possible within the natural confines of the job.\"\n\nI explained where the question was coming from. People at CNN think he's \"performative,\" I told Licht, as though he's projecting this persona of a bulletproof badass because that's what Zaslav wants to see. His staffers also think he's become so bent on selling this image that it's crushed his ability to build real, meaningful relationships with key people there who want him to succeed.\n\nCNN employees had asked me, again and again, to probe for some humility in their leader. If nothing else, they wanted some morsel of self-awareness. They hoped to see that he knew how poorly his tenure was playing out, and why. But Licht would not bite. At one point, I asked him whether he regretted moving his office to the 22nd floor. Licht sat in silence for more than a minute-cracking his neck, glancing around, appearing at one point as though he might not answer the question at all.\n\nFinally, he exhaled heavily. \"I didn't mean for it to become a thing. And it became a thing. So, sure.\"\n\n\"Only because it became a thing?\" I asked.\n\n\" Sure ,\" he replied.\n\nLicht wasn't going to give me-or, more accurately, his employees-the satisfaction of admitting this error. He certainly wasn't going to acknowledge everything else that had gone wrong. Even with CNN falling behind Newsmax in the ratings two nights after the town hall, Licht was unperturbed. Even with his employees in open revolt-a week after Darcy's newsletter, Christiane Amanpour, perhaps the most accomplished journalist in CNN's history, chided Licht in a speech at Columbia's journalism school -he was staying the course.\n\nI asked Licht whether there was anything he regretted about the event. The \"extra Trumpy\" makeup of the crowd? (No, Licht said, because it was representative of the Republican base.) Devoting the first question to his election lies? (No, Licht said, because nothing else, not even the E. Jean Carroll verdict, was as newsworthy as Trump's assault on the ballot box.) Allowing the audience to cheer at will? (No, Licht said, because instructing them to hold their applause, as debate moderators regularly do, would have altered the reality of the event.) The lone point he ceded was that the crowd should have been introduced to viewers at home-with a show of hands, perhaps, to demonstrate how many had voted for Trump previously, or were planning to support him in 2024.\n\nHe gave no ground on anything else-not even the presence of Representative Donalds on the postgame show. Licht told me it probably didn't make sense to seat a congressman on the pundits' panel, but said he otherwise had no regrets, even after I pointed out that Donalds was an election denier who used his place on that panel to question the legitimacy of Joe Biden's victory in 2020.\n\nHad CNN struck a deal with Trump's team, I asked, that required seating guests like Donalds and Gidley?\n\n\"Absolutely not,\" Licht replied. \"I can unequivocally say there was no agreement, no deal. Nothing.\"\n\nI shared with him a more popular theory of what had gone down. Lots of CNN employees believed there'd been no formal agreement, but rather an understanding: If Trump showed good faith in coming on CNN, the network needed to show good faith in booking some unusually pro-Trump voices for the pregame and postgame shows. I noted to Licht that many of his people believed this would have been agreed to without his knowledge, because he was focused on the bigger picture of producing the town hall. Was it possible, I asked, that his lieutenants might have reached that understanding with Trump's team?\n\n\"Nnnno,\" he said, dragging out the word, buying himself some time. \"But I can-I mean, anything's possible. But I would imagine it's more along the lines of 'If we are completely one-sided in our analysis, then that doesn't serve the audience.'\" He paused. \"Like, [one] of the biggest misconceptions about that town hall is that I did it for ratings. It's a rented audience\"-that is, most viewers were not CNN regulars-\"so I didn't do it for ratings. I certainly didn't do it for a profit, because it cost us money. And I certainly didn't do it to build a relationship with Trump. So that would by definition preclude a lot of the conspiracy-theory dealmaking.\"\n\nMaybe it was a conspiracy theory. But over the past year, so many things that Licht's employees had predicted-speculation he'd dismissed as wrong or shortsighted or unhinged-had proved true. Lemon was a disaster on the morning show. (Licht finally fired him in April.) Collins wasn't better co-anchoring in New York than starring at the White House. (Licht gave her the 9 o'clock hour beginning this summer.) Licht had been fixated on the negative press about him. (He confronted Dylan Byers at a party in March, Licht admitted to me, and raged at the reporter about his coverage.) Zaslav did turn out to be comically intrusive. (In one incident, a day after the New York Post reported that Licht might soon be fired, Zaslav dropped into a CNN managerial meeting and declared to Licht's underlings, \"This is our rendezvous with destiny!\")\n\nLicht had told me that he and Zaslav figured the \"gut renovation\" of CNN would require two years of work. But there was reason to believe that timeline was accelerating: Not long after our final interview, Warner Bros. Discovery announced the installation of CNN's new chief operating officer, David Leavy, a Zaslav confidant whose hiring fueled talk of an imminent power struggle-and potentially, the beginning of the end for Licht.\n\nIn fairness, Jeff Zucker's first few years at CNN were also brutal. There were layoffs and programming flops, and viewership was in decline. It wasn't until Zucker found a rhythm with what CNN staff called his \"swarm strategy,\" which threw reporting resources at the hottest trending stories-disappearing planes, the \"Poop Cruise,\" and, ultimately, Trump's candidacy-that CNN became a ratings behemoth. Licht's poor start did not preclude a comeback. There was, he and his stalwarts told me, still time for him to be successful.\n\nAnd yet, little in Licht's first-year record indicated that success was on the way. His biggest achievement-luring Charles Barkley and Gayle King to co-host a show-was hardly going to revive CNN's prime-time lineup. The program, \"King Charles,\" would air only once a week, leaving Licht still in search of the win he needed to juice CNN's ratings-and perhaps save his job.\n\nNear the end of our interview, I asked Licht to put himself in my shoes. If he were me, could he possibly write a positive profile of CNN's leader?\n\nHe spent a long time in silence. \"Absolutely,\" Licht finally said.\n\nIf the answer was \"absolutely,\" I asked, why did he need so long to think about it?\n\n\"I wanted to be very sure,\" he replied.\n\nThis was not the same man I'd met a year earlier. Once certain that he could tame Trump single-handedly, Licht still tried to act the part of an indomitable CEO. Yet he was now stalked by self-doubt. That much was understandable: Licht lived on an island, surrounded by people who disliked him, or doubted his vision for the company, or questioned his competency, or were outright rooting for his ruin. He had hoped the Trump town hall would make believers out of his critics. Instead, it turned his few remaining believers into critics. I had never witnessed a lower tide of confidence inside any company than in the week following the town hall at CNN. Some staffers held off-site meetings openly discussing the merits of quitting en masse. Many began reaching out to rival media organizations about job openings. More than a few called Jeff Zucker, their former boss, desperate for his counsel.\n\nAs we sipped our coffee, Licht tried to sound unflappable.\n\n\"I don't need people to be loyal to Chris Licht. I need people to be loyal to CNN,\" he said.\n\nThe only person whose loyalty he needed, I pointed out, was Zaslav.\n\nLicht nodded slowly, saying nothing. Then, just as he started to speak, his wrist began buzzing and flashing. Licht glanced down at his smartwatch. Zaslav was calling him. He looked up at me. Seeing that I'd noticed, Licht allowed a laugh-a genuine laugh-then stood up from the table and answered his phone.\n\nThis article was featured in One Story to Read Today, a newsletter in which our editors recommend a single must-read from The Atlantic , Monday through Friday.

The power that is American policing has conceded nothing.\n\nPhotographs by Joshua Rashaad McFadden\n\nUpdated at 4:45 p.m. on June 12, 2020.\n\nMINNEAPOLIS-Miski Noor watched just the first minute of the video of George Floyd's killing before closing the tab and walking the two blocks to join the protests already forming at the scene. The days since have been filled with a maddening sense of déjà vu.\n\nNoor had joined the Movement for Black Lives in 2014, after the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. The 34-year-old activist's first protest was that December, a demonstration that shut down the Mall of America during the peak of the holiday shopping season.\n\nNoor soon became intimately familiar with the gruesome cycle: The police killed someone. Activists protested. Small reforms were won. The police killed someone else...\n\nIn Minnesota, St. Paul police killed Philip Quinn, a Native American man in the midst of a mental-health crisis, in September 2015. One week later, a Kanabec County Sheriff's deputy killed Robert Christen , a white former fullback for the Wisconsin Badgers who was enduring a mental-health crisis of his own. * Two months after that, in November 2015, Minneapolis police killed Jamar Clark, a 24-year-old unarmed black man. Hundreds poured into the streets.\n\nIn response to Clark's killing, protesters launched what would stretch into an 18-day occupation of one of the city's police precincts. One night, a group of armed white supremacists showed up. One of the racists opened fire , wounding five of the anti-racist activists. Serving as a spokesperson for the protesters, Noor questioned why police hadn't done anything to prevent the attack-after all, the activists had reported the threats they'd been receiving to law enforcement.\n\nThe next day, police 400 miles east, in Chicago, released a grainy dashcam video depicting a white officer opening fire upon a 17-year-old black boy. The officer shot Laquan McDonald 16 times. People across the nation took to the streets.\n\nThe cycle continued .\n\nIn July 2016, we all watched Philando Castile die on camera, shot five times at point-blank range by a police officer during a traffic stop in suburban Minneapolis. A week later Mica Grimm, one of the leaders of the local Black Lives Matter chapter, traveled to the White House, where the then-mayor and then-police chief of St. Paul dressed her down in front of President Barack Obama -declaring the protests about Castile's death \"a disgrace.\"\n\nExactly one year later, in the same city, came the death of Justine Damond, a 40-year-old yoga teacher who had called police to the alley behind her house because she thought she heard a woman's screams. A police cruiser arrived, but when Damond approached, the officer got startled and shot her .\n\nIt would take two more years, but in April 2019, the local prosecutor finally secured a conviction of a police officer. But instead of a victory for the protesters, it was a cruel irony. The convicted officer was a Somali American, a black man, who was sent to prison for 12 and a half years after shooting and killing a white woman.\n\nThe following January, the most powerful newspaper in America endorsed the presidential campaign of Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, who in eight years as a county prosecutor had never once brought charges against a police officer for misconduct. After losing, Klobuchar offered herself up as a potential running mate for Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee.\n\nThat she'd even be considered for either post-despite new reporting that suggests she put an innocent black teenager behind bars for life-underscored how unseriously much of mainstream politics still seemed to be taking the movement. In the years since Ferguson, the Minneapolis activists had helped elect progressive-reform types to both of the Twin Cities' governments, and secured significant new police-oversight and accountability measures. But the pace of change remained infuriatingly slow.\n\nThen, on Memorial Day 2020, came the cycle's latest deadly churn: The police killed George \"Perry\" Floyd.\n\nOnce again, Noor felt a disorienting heaviness as thousands of fed-up people stormed the streets-first in Minneapolis, then across the country, and ultimately in cities around the world. The activists in the city where Floyd died are tired of meetings and town halls and promises. Enough , they've declared in word and deed.\n\nJustin Ellis: Minneapolis had this coming\n\n\"We have an elder here who said years ago that despair is a malfunctioning emotion,\" Noor told me when we connected by phone between protests a few days after Floyd's death. \"Despair is what happens when grief doesn't have somewhere to go.\"\n\nS eventeen-year-old Darnella Frazier was on her way out the door to a Memorial Day bonfire on the other side of town when her 9-year-old cousin made a request: Would Frazier walk her to a nearby store? Of course, Frazier replied.\n\nShe and her cousin were on their way back home, at the corner of 38th and Chicago, just south of downtown, when Frazier spotted a distraught man sprawled on the pavement. A pile of police officers was holding him down. At least one of the cops seemed to be on top of the man's neck.\n\nFrazier pulled out her cellphone and hit Record.\n\nWithin hours, the whole world had seen the video: Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin driving his knee into the neck of 46-year-old George Floyd, not only until Floyd died but for minutes after his life had been extinguished. What came next was a national crisis.\n\nWhen I first sat down to begin writing this story, parts of many American cities were on fire and police officers in dozens of places were committing indiscriminate acts of violence-unleashing tear gas, rubber bullets, and worse-against the citizenry they had sworn an oath to serve and protect. Elected officials were pleading for peace as parts of their cities burned and the nation, watching in real time on television, asked \"Why?\"\n\nI've spent much of the past decade reporting on the Movement for Black Lives, which holds as one of its chief aims a complete upending of American policing. That reporting has meant dozens if not hundreds of nights at street protests both peaceful and violent, helping to lead a Pulitzer Prize-winning team that created a national database of fatal police shootings, and writing a book-length chronicle of the movement's birth.\n\nFor years, thousands of protesters have taken to the streets to demand a wholesale reimagining of the criminal-justice system. They have stated clearly that they believe American policing is inherently flawed. Black people in America, they argue, are chronically overpoliced and underserved. They are stopped and frisked while walking to the bodega and harassed while cooking out on their porches and patios. But when they are murdered? American police almost never deliver them justice .\n\n\"We shouldn't fear the police,\" Alvin Manago, 55, who was Floyd's roommate for the past four years, and still hasn't been able to bring himself to begin packing up the slain man's belongings, told me through tears as we stood next to the colossal memorial that has sprung up at the scene of the killing. \"Like when I was a little kid-'Oh, the police is here, they're going to help us.' That's what I want us to believe and feel again.\"\n\nThough they sometimes diverge on tactical questions, the activists who make up the core of the movement desire to create, for the first time in our nation's history, a reality in which black people aren't routinely robbed of their livelihoods and lives by armed government agents. The aftermath of Floyd's death has left many activists as encouraged as they've ever been that true change is on the horizon. Still, if the aim is a full recalibration of the American justice system, the task ahead remains monumental.\n\nPublic discussion about fixing the criminal-justice system often accepts as a premise that the path forward involves \"reforming\" thousands of individual state and local law-enforcement agencies and prison systems. But what if it doesn't? What if the activists are right, and the solution is to dismantle American criminal justice and build something better? What might that look like?\n\nThe nation's response to police killing after police killing has been to fire and criminally charge a handful of individual officers, mandate bias training that remains a relatively unproven remedy, and require body cameras that ultimately do little other than provide additional video evidence of the pervasiveness of police violence. (That is, when they are turned on at all .) The country collectively cares so little, five years after my former Washington Post colleagues embarrassed the FBI for its lack of federal data collection, that the agency still does not compile an accurate count of people killed by the police.\n\nIn May 2015, The New York Times Magazine wrote one of the definitive early profiles of the Ferguson activists. Its headline bore a straightforward message: \"Our Demand Is Simple: Stop Killing Us.\"\n\nThe killings continue unabated .\n\n\"I would never condone violence, ever,\" says Elijah Norris-Holliday, a 24-year-old activist in the Twin Cities who has been organizing peaceful daytime protests and who was so distraught after seeing the video of Floyd's death that he didn't sleep for days. \"But sometimes, when people feel like their voices are being ignored over and over and over, violence is the only other answer. They have to burn their own community down to get people to listen to them. We're at a breaking point.\"\n\nToday's young black activists have been beaten and arrested and harassed by local police officers. They've been doxxed by racist online trolls. They've had FBI agents show up at their homes . Some of the streets' strongest voices and most potent symbols-Erica Garner, Darren Seals, Edward Crawford, Muhiyidin Moye-are now dead themselves.\n\n\"When civility leads to death, revolting is the only logical reaction,\" Colin Kaepernick tweeted , as massive protests-both violent and nonviolent-spread across the country in response to Floyd's death.\n\nKaepernick was banished from his job as an NFL quarterback and called a \"son of a bitch\" by President Donald Trump because he silently kneeled during the pregame national anthem. His act of peaceful protest-deeply unpopular with white Americans-was prompted by the July 2016 police shooting of Castile, the aftermath of which was broadcast live on Facebook by Castile's distraught girlfriend. \"The cries for peace will rain down,\" Kaepernick continued in his tweet last week. \"and when they do, they will land on deaf ears, because your violence has brought this resistance.\"\n\nFor some, Kaepernick's words may feel shocking. Yet they are the same words that echo through hundreds of years of black American activism, inescapable to anyone who bothers to pay attention. James Baldwin's explicit allusion in the title of his 1963 masterwork, The Fire Next Time , is to coming riots in the streets. The Harlem Renaissance leader Langston Hughes cautioned ominously in the 1940s that \"sweet and docile\" black Americans may one day \"change their minds.\" The poem is literally titled \"Warning!\"\n\nTa-Nehisi Coates: The case for reparations\n\nDecades earlier, there'd been the determined journalism of Ida B. Wells, whose Memphis newspaper was burned to the ground by white supremacists. Wells is best remembered for her crusading work in the 1890s, which not only documented the frequency of southern lynchings but also provided what we'd now consider data analysis in order to disprove the racist lie that lynchings were happening because black men had a particular lust for and inclination to rape white women. Less well known is that Wells also dispatched herself to the scene of cases of police violence, providing essential scrutiny of an equally American strand of homicidal impunity.\n\n\"Those who profess to favor freedom, and yet depreciate agitation, are men who want crops without plowing up the ground. They want the rain without thunder and lightning,\" the former slave Frederick Douglass proclaimed in 1857. \"They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters.\"\n\n\"This struggle may be a moral one; or it may be a physical one; or it may be both moral and physical; but it must be a struggle,\" Douglass continued, before arriving at a more widely quoted sentence: \"Power concedes nothing without a demand.\"\n\nThe power that is American policing has conceded nothing. Black men and women are still dying across the country as police unions continue to codify policies designed solely to shield their officers from accountability-such as rules ensuring that officers who kill can't even be interviewed by investigators about it until their victims have been dead for days.\n\nIn the days since one of their own killed George Floyd, many American police officers have shamelessly brutalized the protesters whose chief demand is that the police stop brutalizing people.\n\nBlack Americans have grown so accustomed to pulling out cellphone cameras-who would believe us otherwise?-that we no longer risk having to rely on a single shaky video. Everyone pulls their phone out-which is why we can watch George Floyd die in full panoramic view .\n\nI n the days since the streets began burning, many have appealed to former President Barack Obama for intervention. Yet to suggest that Obama could silence the enraged screams of the streets is to fundamentally misunderstand the origins of the protests of recent years: They were, in part, a direct response to the perception among young black activists that his administration had failed to address persistent racial inequalities with adequate urgency.\n\n\"I voted for Barack Obama twice and still got teargassed,\" the Ferguson activist Tef Poe said in 2014, after consecutive days of protests in which police deployed violence indiscriminately against demonstrators.\n\nObama did as much as, if not more than, any other American president to push for policing reform-yet as the former chief spokesperson for and political figurehead of the country whose police officers are carrying out the extrajudicial killings of black people, not even he can claim absolute moral credibility on these matters. Beyond that, though, is the reality that American policing as currently constructed is a matter of state and local government, and is not within the power of a president to single-handedly change. The symbolism of the first black presidency was potent. But the Obama-era reforms, ultimately, did not reduce the number of police killings.\n\nRosa Brooks: Stop training police like they're joining the military\n\nThe Obama Justice Department launched an unprecedented number of \"patterns and practices\" investigations to force reform in local police departments, but those investigations were launched in response to only the most egregious viral videos and most questionable police killings. The department's Civil Rights Division, limited in both resources and statutory authority, could not reform 18,000 American police departments.\n\n\"The inability of the Civil Rights Division to take on anything but willful misconduct, as much as I love Obama and (Former Attorney General Loretta) Lynch and everyone else-we failed on that one,\" Roy Austin, a former deputy assistant attorney general for civil rights and a key Obama adviser on policing, conceded to me.\n\nNot one activist I've spoken with over the years has suggested that Obama does not get it. But, on an issue rife with impassioned activism, they note the former president's cool calculation-his studied avoidance of any comment or action that could backfire. (Recall, for instance, the outcry when he weighed in on the 2009 arrest of Henry Louis Gates Jr.) Activists in Missouri observe that Obama never visited Ferguson, while allies of the former president note that his doing so could have prompted accusations that he was putting his foot on the scale of the investigation his Justice Department had launched into the police there; they also note that he dispatched then-Attorney General Eric Holder in his place. Obama has signaled for years that he does not see it as his ministry to lead protest chants.\n\n\"Obama has always said to me, 'I was into community service, not community activism,'\" the Reverend Al Sharpton, an adviser to both the Obama White House and George Floyd's family, told me, by way of explaining the former president's hesitation to insert himself more directly into these matters.\n\nBut in this arena too, Floyd's death has spurred change. Those who have spoken with Obama in recent days say the former president is eager to use his platform to address American policing. Members of the Floyd family told me that they were impressed with the directness with which the former president tackled the subject in a recent online town hall, and some longtime activists are \"increasingly satisfied\" with Obama's willingness to jump into the fray, Sharpton told me. After years of reluctance, the nation may be witnessing the birth of Obama the activist.\n\n\"We have seen in the last several weeks, the last few months, the kinds of epic changes and events in our country that are as profound as anything that I've seen in my lifetime,\" Obama said during his address on June 3.\n\nE ven more frequent than public appeals to Obama are calls for a \"new Martin Luther King Jr.\"-someone who could \"heal\" the nation by persuading the thousands who believe their government is criminally apathetic to their humanity to join hands and sing \"We Shall Overcome.\"\n\nThese yearnings for a new Martin Luther King Jr. presume such a figure would have sufficient standing among white Americans-a group that collectively despised the original MLK while he lived-that he could succeed as a national unifier in a way the actual activist never did. This is such an outlandish assumption that one of the country's most prominent young black comedians \" joked \" that white Americans are obsessed with finding the next Martin Luther King only so they can make sure to kill him, too.\n\nSuch suggestions also require the absolute confidence that, were King alive today, he would continue to advocate for precisely the same tactics in response to today's injustices as he did in response to those of the 1950s and '60s-a conclusion that presumes unknowable things about what a man who has been dead since 1968 would believe today. For all we know, King might by now have become so fed up by this nation's persistent failure to address the injustices he made it his life's work to expose that he too would be picking up a rock. Even saints have their limits. The real King, the one who lived and died fighting American white supremacy, openly declared that American police \"make a mockery of the law.\"\n\n\"While he did not want to see violent protests, he understood violent protests,\" Martin Luther King III, the civil-rights leader's son, told me last week. \"Someone had their foot on the neck of George Floyd, and society has had its foot on the neck of black people. And black people and others now are saying that's not going to happen anymore.\" Yet when the living Martin Luther King quoted one of his father's most famous statements-\"A riot is the language of the unheard\"-his Twitter mentions promptly filled with comments from white people eager to explain to him what his own namesake would have wanted at a time like this.\n\n\"When I saw the video, I cried, and I wanted to destroy everything in my house. That's the truth,\" Yolanda Renee King, 12, the sole grandchild of the slain civil-rights leader, said during a private moment with the Floyd family on the day of his Minneapolis funeral service. \"We have been mistreated for 401 years! This is enough! I'm tired of this!\"\n\nM artin Luther King III and other activists I've spoken with in recent days share a unanimous belief that this time is different. Years into the movement, the potential for true progress may finally be at hand, in no small part because the same cycle of unabated violence that has infuriated black activists is finally, due to the unrelenting stream of video evidence, forcing many white Americans to wake up.\n\nFor decades, police violence and impunity had been problems that, polling suggests , only black people could see. The street uprisings of recent years-in Ferguson and Baltimore, Baton Rouge and Chicago-were propelled by black rage; although they had allies, those who flooded the streets in response to those incidents of police violence were primarily black men, women, and children. Now white eyes have been opened too.\n\nA Monmouth University poll taken a few days after Floyd's death found that 71 percent of white respondents deemed racism and discrimination \"a big problem\" in the United States-up 26 points from 2015. Nearly 80 percent of Americans-and 75 percent of white Americans-told pollsters that the protesters' anger was either \"fully\" or \"partially\" justified. Forty-nine percent of white respondents said police are more likely to use excessive force against a black culprit than a white one, nearly double the 25 percent who acknowledged that fact in 2016.\n\n\"People finally see it. White people too,\" Floyd's younger brother Philonise told me as we talked in the lobby of the Minneapolis hotel where we were both staying. \"My brother is going to change the world.\"\n\nWhen the day came for the first of Floyd's funerals-his family held three services, in Minneapolis, where he died; in Fayetteville, North Carolina, where he'd been born; and in Houston, where he'd spent most of his life-I stood silently, flush against the back wall of the hotel meeting room where they had gathered until it was time to depart. Gianna, Floyd's 6-year-old daughter, twirled in front of me in her white lace dress. Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, the black man killed by New York police in 2014 , briefed Floyd's family members about how difficult the coming hours would be.\n\nAs we walked to the limos that had lined up outside the hotel, I asked Carr how many funerals like this she'd been to. She paused before softly responding: \"You know, it doesn't matter. This one will be different. Because this one was just like Eric.\" Garner, like Floyd, had spent his final moments crying \"I can't breathe.\"\n\nAfter a short, largely silent drive, we all filed down the center aisle of the sanctuary at North Central University. The crowd, probably about 100 people, rose to its feet and sang \"Total Praise,\" a gospel staple. To attend a funeral in the midst of a global health pandemic was an act of protest in and of itself. Most attendees wore masks to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. About half were dressed in dark suits and dresses. The others wore T-shirts and hoodies that declared \"I can't breathe\" and demanded \"Justice for George Floyd.\"\n\nTo the left of the stage sat the dignitaries. Martin Luther King III in the front row, Senator Klobuchar-who now says she regrets never charging any police officers-and Representative Ilhan Omar in the second. A few rows behind them was Clyde Bellecourt, 84, a White Earth Ojibwe who in 1968 co-founded the American Indian Movement, one of the most influential movements in the nation advocating for Native peoples. The movement had been launched in direct response to police violence against Native people in Minnesota-the available data show Native people are killed by police at the highest rate of any racial group -and Bellecourt had brought with him an eagle feather to present to the Floyd family, which is the Ojibwe tradition's highest honor. I asked him what he thought of the video of Floyd's death. \"It's nothing I haven't seen before,\" he told me. \"Me and my people-\" He paused. \"We've seen a lot.\"\n\nRead: History will judge the complicit\n\nTo the right of the stage sat the celebrity mourners. In the first row, the rapper Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, the Hollywood producer Will Packer, and the comedians Tiffany Haddish and Kevin Hart. Just behind them sat the rapper Clifford \"T. I.\" Harris Jr., his wife, Tameka \"Tiny\" Harris, nestled into his shoulder. They, like so many, had been horrified by the video of Floyd's death, and their attendance served as an acknowledgment that neither their money nor their fame insulates them from the possibility of a similar fate. Behind them sat the Reverend Jesse Jackson, noticeably slowed, two and a half years after announcing his Parkinson's diagnosis. \"They would have lied on George if it wasn't for the camera,\" he told me.\n\nI found a seat about five rows back from the pulpit, across the aisle from the former NBA player Stephen Jackson, a close friend of Floyd's who called him \"twin.\"\n\n\"I tell people all of the time, the difference between me and my brother Floyd is I had opportunity,\" the former basketball player had explained at a protest earlier in the week. \"So many of my brothers are so talented, and sitting in the ghettos and the hoods right now because they don't have opportunity. And y'all wonder why we angry. We're not just dying. It hasn't been fair to us.\"\n\nStephen Jackson sat silently throughout the funeral service. He leaned low in his chair, his eyes hidden behind sunglasses and much of his face tucked beneath the collar of a hoodie. But when the attorney Ben Crump vowed from the lectern that he would stop at nothing to procure justice for Floyd, Jackson sprang to his feet, spurring the entire room into thunderous applause.\n\nT he days since George Floyd's death have been busy for Miski Noor. There have been protests to plan, and meetings to hold, and interviews to grant. But, Noor told me, the response across the city, country, and world has been inspiring.\n\nThe crowds filling the streets have been a racially diverse mix, and it seems that a fair percentage of those who have demonstrated are now willing to discuss more than body cameras and bias training. The coming days, weeks, and months, Noor and other organizers believe, will finally see a robust discussion about defunding and dismantling police departments, and ultimately abolishing American policing as it is currently constructed. Less than two weeks after Floyd's death, officials in Minneapolis announced their intention to disband the city's police department.\n\n\"We want justice for George Floyd, but we know justice isn't enough,\" Noor said. \"That's why we're demanding bigger and bolder things. Now is the time to defund the police and actually invest in our communities.\n\n\"These systems were created to hunt, to maim, and to kill black people, and the police have always been an uncontrollable source of violence that terrorizes our communities without accountability,\" Noor added. \"Black communities have been and are living in persistent fear of being killed by state authorities.\"\n\nMany reformers, especially black reformers, have long viewed incremental policy changes as a way to reduce police abuse and killings in the short term while they work toward their true goal: fully remaking the entire criminal-justice system.\n\n\"We're trying to grapple with one of the foundational sins of the country,\" says Phil Goff, the executive director of the Center for Policing Equity, who has spent recent years working with police departments to implement vital reforms, expansive oversight, and new data-collection programs.\n\nThe movement to reimagine the criminal-justice system has not been defined by individual policy proposals, or even specific acts of injustice. The core ideology advanced by the black people in the streets is that the justice system-in fact, the entire American experiment-was from its inception designed to perpetuate racial inequality. The primary aim is to construct a world in which black Americans can live lives free of police harassment and violence, and are ensured justice when they are victimized-in other words, a world in which black people have access to the same protections that most white Americans already enjoy.\n\nBut in response to the mounting documentation of systemic bias-in nearly every study of the justice system, from traffic stops to prosecutions to sentencing to fatal police shootings to the application of the death penalty -\"law and order\" politicians of both parties and the leaders of local police unions continue to insist that the protesters are making it all up. These opponents, who hold a near-singular power to obstruct even piecemeal change, insist not only that the justice system is fair and equitable as is, but that all of this discontent is being fomented by opportunists and race-baiters who just like to say mean things about cops. \"I don't think that the law-enforcement system is systemically racist,\" Attorney General Bill Barr said this week . \"Painting law enforcement with a broad brush of systemic racism is really a disservice to the men and women who put on the badge, the uniform every day,\" added Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf. One of the most-read pieces on The Wall Street Journal 's website since Floyd's death is a column headlined \"The Myth of Systemic Police Racism,\" written by a conservative commentator who has devoted much of her career to defending American policing from calls for change.\n\n\"One of the reasons, sadly, that we are seeing this violence and this rioting is that you have a lot of demagogues that want to use this incident of clear abuse by one police officer and they want to use it to paint every police officer as corrupt and racist,\" Texas Senator Ted Cruz declared on Fox News as protests broke out across the country. The escalating violence was not the result of an unrepentantly racist system, Cruz said, but rather \"everyone that is stirring up racial division,\" meaning the anti-racist activists.\n\nRacism is not to blame, the thinking popular among at least some conservatives goes. It's the people fighting racism who are the problem. If everyone could just stop talking about all of this stuff, we could go \"back\" to being a peaceful, united country. No one seems to be able to answer when, precisely, in our history that previous moment of peace, justice, and racial harmony occurred.\n\n* This article previously misspelled Robert Christen's name and misstated the affiliation of the officer who killed him."

      "text": "Civil Rights Lawyer Ben Crump on His 'Spicy' New Crime Novels\n\nSenior National Reporter\n\nCivil rights attorney Ben Crump has worked on hundreds of police brutality cases-representing the families of Trayvon Martin , George Floyd , Breonna Taylor , Michael Brown , Tyre Nichols , Ahmaud Arbery , Daunte Wright , and Jacob Blake , winning multimillion-dollar settlements, and earning the nickname of \"Black America's attorney general.\"\n\nNow the ubiquitous, media-savvy 54-year-old attorney is embarking on a new career: crime novelist. Never one to downplay his ambition, Crump told The Daily Beast on Wednesday that he will create a \"whole new genre\" through his seven-figure, two-book deal with Bantam Books.\n\n\"There were no Black superhero lawyers out there in all these legal thriller books that have been written,\" Crump said. \"And God said, 'Well, the reason there is not is because that's your calling.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Traditionally, you have the legal thrillers that focus on the 'who did it.' Well, what I am introducing is the 'why did it,'\" he added in a phone interview. \"And that is going to be a riveting thing when you break down society through an entertaining cast of characters to not only understand how the injustice happened but why it is happening and how we overcame it.\"\n\n\"These books will be what I call the four Es: entertaining, education, engaging, and empowering,\" he further explained.\n\nAnd sexy.\n\nCrump says the legal drama isn't the only thing bringing the heat in his books. They will also celebrate Black love, in the words of the deal announcement, and delve into main character Beau Lee Cooper's relationship with his wife.\n\n\"It's very spicy,\" he said.\n\nIn a description that should sound familiar to anyone who has followed Crump's three-decade career, Cooper is a Black civil rights attorney from Texas who \"tackles heart-wrenching cases of corruption and injustice,\" according to the announcement. The narratives will also examine the sometimes-tense interactions between Cooper and his legal partners over cases, his children about what is going on in social media, and his relationship with his mother.\n\nWhile there are undeniable similarities between Crump and Cooper, he said the thrillers are biomythography-a melange of history, biography, and myth.\n\nThe books go \"from case to case and some of them will bring a lot of similarities from cases we have all heard of,\" he said. \"Readers will find it interesting that this superhero, larger-than-life lawyer, Beau Lee Cooper, is very relatable. He is a family man. He is a common person who walks with kings but never loses the common touch and never forgets where he came from.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Crump has branched out beyond the courtroom. The 2022 Netflix documentary Civil: Ben Crump followed him for a year, and he also produced a short film about the landmark 1982 civil case in Chattanooga, where five Black women fought to hold the Ku Klux Klan accountable after a shooting.\n\nYou could be forgiven for wondering when Crump had time to crank out a couple of novels. He explained that whenever he had a free moment-often on a flight-he was taking notes, working with editors, and doing research to shape Cooper's world.\n\nIn fact, he said, he's actually finished four manuscripts, although only two have been bought by Bantam. The goal, he said, is to inspire readers to learn more about the criminal justice system and those trying to change it.\n\n\"I am trying to write about a better world. We are fighting to say, 'This is the world I am trying to give my daughter,'\" Crump explained. \"I want her to know that there are heroes that look like her, come from her community, have her life experiences, and that they have just as much majesty as the [characters] in the Marvel Universe.\"\n\nSenior National Reporter\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Ben Crump Is Now Probing the In-Custody Death of Ex-NFL Player Glenn Foster Jr. in Alabama\n\nSenior National Reporter\n\nThe family of Glenn Foster Jr. , the former defensive lineman for the New Orleans Saints who died Monday in Alabama police custody , has been demanding answers about his death. Now they've retained the highest-profile civil rights attorney in America to get them.\n\n\"They want answers,\" civil attorney Benjamin Crump told The Daily Beast. \"They are obviously devastated.\"\n\nFoster, 31, died this week in the custody of the Pickens County, Alabama, Sheriff's department after his family said he was denied medical care. On Friday, Crump-who has represented the families of George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery-said he was brought on to probe the Black ex-NFL player and businessman's death after they believe he \"may have been suffering from a manic episode in the days leading up to, during, and following his arrest.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"According to his family, Foster Jr. has a history of mental health challenges, which they communicated to the Reform Police Department's Chief,\" a Friday press release announcing Crump's retention said, referring to another police department involved in his arrest.\n\nJail records show Foster was booked into the Pickens County jail on Saturday morning on three charges of reckless endangerment, as well charges of resisting arrest and attempting to elude. Reform Police Chief Richard Black previously told The Daily Beast the arrest occurred after an officer spotted the ex-athlete driving 92 mph in a 45 mph zone in a black Jeep Wrangler. Black claimed that when the officer followed Foster, he accelerated to \"very high rates of speed\" and eventually wound up driving on the wrong side of the road.\n\nThe incident prompted an arrest-though the details of his in-custody stay and what led to his eventual transfer to a medical facility are not clear. Foster's father, Glenn, said in an interview with CNN that his son was bipolar and in \"mental distress\" before his arrest and eventual time in jail-and that they communicated the ex-athlete's condition to authorities.\n\nOn Dec. 5, Foster was set to be released from jail but was re-booked after allegedly fighting with another inmate and two officers. The next day, a judge ordered that he be given medical attention.\n\n\"When the family arrived to post bail for Foster Jr. and take him to a mental health evaluation, they were told he had been in an altercation with another inmate and was now under the jurisdiction of the Sheriff's office, which delayed his treatment,\" Crump's press release said. \"The family was denied visitation with Foster Jr.\"\n\nCrump told The Daily Beast the real question in the case is what happened during Foster's transportation to the medical facility to which a judge had ordered him for treatment following a Dec. 6 hearing. \"They said he got in the car and he's fine, and then he gets to the facility and he's unconscious,\" Crump said, referring to information he said the family has received from the Pickens County Sheriff's Office.\n\n\"They want answers,\" Crump said, speaking about Foster's family. \"They absolutely believe that the sheriff did not treat him as if he was experiencing a mental health crisis. He was more resolved to try to treat him like a criminal, versus a citizen who was having a medical crisis.\"\n\nPickens County Sheriff Todd Hall did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Alabama State Bureau of Investigation, which is also looking into Foster's death, previously told The Daily Beast that Foster was pronounced dead at a medical facility in Northport, Alabama, but declined to elaborate. The Sheriff's office has declined to comment, deferring to the state agency.\n\nCrump has made a name for himself by seeking justice for families who have lost loved ones to police brutality, and was once dubbed by Rev. Al Sharpton as \"Black America's attorney general.\"\n\nCrump told The Daily Beast that Foster's mysterious death has left \"behind a broken-hearted family that is demanding answers.\"\n\n\"The portrayal of him as a large man, a former NFL football player, is a classic part of the playbook in explaining and justifying the death of a Black man by police,\" Crump continued, adding, \"There is no reason why he was alive in police custody and sixteen minutes later he was dead.\"\n\n\"We will not rest until we get answers and justice for Glenn Foster Jr. and his distraught family.\"\n\nSenior National Reporter\n\nGot a tip?

Ben Crump, the lawyer representing the Floyd family, said in an interview on the Today show that authorities have told his clients that the three officers will be charged. \"We heard that they expect to charge those officers...We understand they will be charged.

While the county autopsy reports that Floyd died of cardiac arrest and had underlying health issues, the independent report states that the 46-year-old was in good health and died of strangulation from pressure to his back and neck. Crump said on Tuesday he predicts that charges against Derek Chauvin, the Minneapolis police officer who pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes, will see upgraded charges to first-degree murder. \"I think it's very likely the charges are going to be upgraded...Why is it when a white police kills a black person in America, we act like it's such a difficult thing to charge them with what we would be charged with,\" he said.\n\nSenior National Reporter\n\nGot a tip?

He was two minutes form the house when they stopped him. He was less than 80 yards away.\"\n\nCrump did not hold back in painting a picture of horrific abuse.\n\n\"What we saw, regrettably, it reminded us of Rodney King ,\" he said outside Mt. Olive Cathedral C.M.E. Church.\n\nThe last words on the video?\n\n\"He calls for his mom,\" said Crump. \"Three times: 'Mom.'\"\n\nFamily previously shared a photo of Nichols' injuries and blamed his death on a brutal police beating. A Memphis city council member briefed on the video footage had already told a local Fox affiliate it was expected to be \"disgusting,\" \"damaging\" and \"not good even slightly.\"\n\n\"He was defenseless the entire time. He was a human piñata,\" family attorney Antonio Romanucci added on Monday. \"It was an unadulterated, unabashed, nonstop beating of this young boy for three minutes. That's what was saw in that video. Not only was it violent, it was savage.\"\n\nNichols' was the latest death in police custody following a year that saw rising numbers of such incidents, despite massive nationwide protests against racism and police brutality in 2020-and passage of limited policing reforms across the country.\n\nOn Friday, five Memphis Police Department officers were fired after the local department concluded its own internal investigation into how Nichols could have died from injuries sustained during his arrest on Jan. 7.\n\nThe investigation found that five officers, who are Black, \"violated multiple department policies, including excessive use of force, duty to intervene, and duty to render aid,\" according to a release by the City of Memphis.\n\nA federal investigation has also been launched by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Justice department.\n\nThe cops have been identified as: Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Emmitt Martin II, Desmond Mills Jr. and Justin Smith. All were hired within the last six years, and none have been charged with a crime.\n\n\"The citizens of Memphis, and more importantly, the family of Mr. Nichols deserve to know the complete account of the events leading up to his death and what may have contributed to it,\" Essica Cage-Rosario, president of the Memphis Police Association, said in a statement to Buzzfeed News.\n\nDespite the announcement of the firing, however, public details of the brutal events that led up to Nichols' death remain few and far between.\n\nAccording to an MPD release , Nichols was pulled over for suspected reckless driving. Police described the stop as leading to a \"confrontation\", and then another \"confrontation\" as officers arrested Nichols after he ran away from police.\n\nAfterward, Nichols complained of shortness of breath, and was hospitalized.\n\nHe died three days later.\n\nAt the press conference on Monday, attorneys and the family called for justice, but also for patience while the public waits for the video's release-and remembered Nichols as a \"good young man.\"\n\n\"Our son ran because he was scared for his life,\" Rodney Wells, Nichols' stepfather added. \"And when you see the video, you will see why he was scared for his life.\"\n\nGot a tip?

Instead, the judge ruled that Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, is legally responsible for her death because he fired his gun to fend off intruders, after plainclothes police officers broke down the couple's front door and barged in just after midnight. Taylor was a Black 26-year-old emergency medical technician and aspiring nurse. Since then, only one officer has been found guilty of playing a role in Taylor's death, admitting to falsifying a no-knock warrant that claimed police had evidence of drug dealings taking place in Taylor's home. No drugs were ever found and the two cops who fatally shot Taylor have never been charged. This lack of accountability is part of a \"systematic pattern of disrespect\" of Black women, says civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represents Breonna Taylor's family. Crump also discusses the latest developments in the cases against police officers accused of excessive force in the widely publicized deaths of Tyre Nichols in Tennessee and Roger Fortson in Florida.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org. I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nWe turn now to the police killing of Breonna Taylor in Kentucky, where a federal judge has dealt a major blow to calls for justice, after throwing out felony charges against two former Louisville police officers for their roles in her fatal shooting in her own home over four years ago. Officers Joshua Jaynes and Kyle Meany, who are white, were charged in 2022 with falsifying a warrant that led to the police raid on Taylor's apartment in March 2020. The two officers were not present during the fatal shooting. The federal judge instead has ruled that Breonna Taylor's boyfriend Kenneth Walker is legally responsible for her death, after he fired his gun, thinking that the men were intruders in the home when seven plainclothes police officers serving a no-knock warrant broke down the door, barged in, just after midnight on March 13, 2020.\n\nTwenty-six-year-old Breonna Taylor was an emergency medical technician and aspiring nurse.\n\nIn 2022, the Justice Department filed civil rights charges against four officers involved in Taylor's death. Kelly Goodlett was the only one to plead guilty in 2022, admitting she had helped a fellow officer lie to convince a judge to sign off on the no-knock warrant, falsely claiming they had evidence of drug dealings taking place in Taylor's home. No drugs were ever found.\n\nMeanwhile, former Louisville officer Brett Hankison faces a third trial in October. He was acquitted in 2022 of three state counts of wanton endangerment for shooting into Breonna Taylor's neighbor's apartment during the raid. And last year a jury was deadlocked over whether to convict him on use of excessive force and violating Taylor's rights, her partner's and her neighbors'.\n\nThe two officers who actually fatally shot Taylor, Jonathan Mattingly and Myles Cosgrove, have never been charged.\n\nBreonna Taylor's death in a hail of police gunfire in 2020, which came just two months before the police murder of George Floyd in Minnesota, sparked protests across the country and world.\n\nFor more, we're joined by Ben Crump, civil rights attorney.\n\nBen, welcome back to Democracy Now! Can you explain what this judge's ruling means?\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : That it continues the systematic pattern of disrespect to Black women and the fact that there is little to no justice when Black women are unjustly killed by those who are supposed to protect and serve them. The family is devastated. Us social justice, civil rights attorneys are just dumbfounded by this ruling.\n\nYou have officers who lie on a probable cause affidavit to get a no-knock warrant to bust into a woman's apartment. That Black woman, Breonna Taylor, is killed as a result of your unnecessary, unjustifiable and unconstitutional affront to the Fourth Amendment against unlawful search and seizure. And yet the judge says, \"Well, there's nothing they did to cause her death.\"\n\nBut yet we want to blame her boyfriend, a Black man named Kenny Walker, who is legally in the apartment, who has a lawful right to be a registered gun owner, who tries to defend his home, his woman, himself. And that is what you're going to say is the cause of her death, because they were trying to defend themselves against people they thought were burglarizing their home. It flies in the face of justice and all common sense.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I mean, Kenny was very clear in saying he did not understand that these men were police officers, that they didn't identify themselves. They were breaking down his door.\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : Yeah. You know, Amy, it's the intellectual justification of discrimination. These officers knew that they were lying before, on the probable cause affidavit, and then, as officer Goodlett has pled and testified, they were trying to conspire and lie in the aftermath of killing Breonna Taylor. Now, everybody else in America sees that. This federal judge, apparently, is doing what the United States government has done, whether it's Pamela Turner's case, a Black woman killed in Houston, Texas - we're fighting Sonya Massey now in Illinois. It's this - Sandra Bland. It's this epidemic of Black women being killed by police, and police getting away with murder.\n\nAnd we have to scream at the top of our lungs to continue to say their name and not let them get away with this. The Justice Department is going to appeal this matter. And what we're going to continue to do is to rally for justice, both in the courtrooms and outside the courtrooms, for these Black women, like Breonna Taylor, like Pamela Turner, like Atatiana Jefferson, like Sonya Massey. I mean, how many more?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Ben Crump, I also wanted to ask you about the news that a second former Memphis police officer has pleaded guilty in the police killing of Tyre Nichols, the 29-year-old Black father who died after a brutal police beating. The former officer, Emmitt Martin, pleaded guilty to federal civil rights violations and could face up to 40 years in prison. Go back to the story of Tyre Nichols. Tell us what happened and what this means.\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : Well, obviously, Tyre Nichols was one of the worst police videos of brutality that we've ever witnessed. Tyre Nichols was about two blocks from his home. He didn't break any laws. But there was a SCORPION unit, this special tactic unit at the Memphis Police Department that was allowed to harass and violate the constitutional rights of Black people in a certain section of Memphis, Tennessee, under the guise that they were deterring crime. And so, it was a pattern and practice that they could just unjustly use excessive force to intimidate Black citizens in that part of the city. And they said they wanted to do it because they wanted to lower the crime. And as I and Reverend Al Sharpton said, well, if you're not doing this in the white part of town, how do you prevent crime there? Well, that's the same tactics you should employ in the Black side of town.\n\nIn this violent, brutal beating of Tyre Nichols by these five officers, I mean, he was barely conscious. And they kept holding him up, and they're punching him some more like he was a rag doll, like he was a human piñata. I mean, they were kicking him, hitting him with batons. And they literally beat him to death. And if it was not for the camera on the night pole, they would have probably gotten away with it. But that camera showed us everything, Amy. And our stomachs were literally in knots, watching them beat a human being to death.\n\nAnd at this point, all of them have been charged, both in the state and federal levels, for their crimes that caused the death of Tyre Nichols. The second officer has pled guilty and can face up to 40 years in prison in the federal case.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Ben Crump, I mean, it's horrifying that I have one case after another to ask you about, but I want to ask about this third case that you're working on, in Florida. A sheriff's deputy has been charged with manslaughter in connection with the killing of 23-year-old Air Force member Roger Fortson, who was shot to death also in his own home. Police body-camera footage from the May 3rd killing shows Roger Fortson answering the door of his own apartment and immediately being fatally shot by an Okaloosa County officer who was responding to a domestic disturbance report that turned out to be false. The officer shot Fortson almost immediately as he opened the door. This is a clip of the horrifying video.\n\nEDDIE DURAN : Sheriff's Office. Open the door! Step out. [gunfire] Drop the gun! Drop the gun!\n\nROGER FORTSON : It's over there.\n\nEDDIE DURAN : Drop the gun!\n\nROGER FORTSON : I don't have it.\n\nEDDIE DURAN : 312, shots fired. Suspect down. Do not move! 312, get EMS my location.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : On Thursday, former Okaloosa County deputy Eddie Duran was charged with manslaughter with a firearm in connection with the fatal shooting of Senior Airman Roger Fortson, which is first-degree felony punishable by up to 30 years in prison, Ben.\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : Yeah, Amy, it's still heartbreaking that this 23-year-old senior airman, this American hero who fought to protect the constitutional rights, was killed in such an unjustified manner when he simply opened his door. It was, we believe, the apartment complex getting it wrong, but then this officer getting it wrong, because the officer did not give Roger any time to comply with his orders.\n\nRoger, who was a law-abiding registered gun owner, again, like Kenny Walker, Breonna's boyfriend - when Black men have guns, they are not seen as law-abiding citizens. They are seen as criminals that you must take down for whatever reason by law enforcement.\n\nBut he had his gun in a down position. The officer immediately told him to step back. Roger stepped back. Roger was following all the instructions of this officer, who shot him multiple times. And even while he was on the ground dying, Amy, he was still trying to follow the instructions and the orders of this officer.\n\nAnd so, it was appropriate that this officer was charged with manslaughter for use of a firearm. And it's so very rare in the state of Florida that this happens. It's only been four officers in the last 35 years that have been charged for killing citizens. All of them happen to be African American citizens that were killed in these four charges. And there's only been one conviction in 35 years. And so, we have to stay vigilant that Roger Fortson gets justice.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to thank you very much, Ben, for joining us. Ben Crump is a civil rights attorney. He's the attorney for the families of Fortson, Roger Fortson, and Tyre Nichols and Breonna Taylor.\n\nNext up, we'll be joined by New York City Councilmember Yusef Salaam, one of the exonerated Central Park Five, who just addressed the Democratic National Convention last week in Chicago. Back in 30 seconds.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

And then she had the audacity to say, Gina, \"Self-defense. It was self-defense.\" But, Tamara, it wasn't her house. It was Botham's house. And so, we have to continue to stand up, speak up and fight for our children and our loved ones, because if we don't fight for our children and our loved ones, we can't expect nobody else to fight for our children and loved ones.\n\nAnd finally, finally, I think about the Shabazz Center and the objectives of trying to make sure we educate the future generations with the history that has been contributed, Rob, by our ancestors. And I am ever reminded - ever reminded - that we have to fight racism and discrimination, Dominique, wherever it rears its ugly head. And so, you know, all of those high-profile police cases we fight, there are other battles that are just as important, whether it's medical racism with Henrietta Lacks, whether it's the $100 million lawsuit filed on behalf of Malcolm X's daughters, because we can never let them think that we will forget about Malcolm X. We will continue to fight every day.\n\nAnd we have to fight those who would try to rob our children and all children of learning about Black history, like our governor in Florida, Ron DeSantis, who is trying to prohibit the teaching of Advanced Placement African American studies. And so, I am on record, Attorney O'Neill, if he does not capitulate and allow the teaching of Black history, we're going to sue him. We are going to sue him, because, as Dr. Carter G. Woodson said, also known as the \"father of Black history,\" if a race does not have a history, if it has no traditions that are respected and taught to the young people, then it becomes a negligible factor in the thought of the world and becomes in danger of being exterminated. And we refuse to let Governor DeSantis exterminate Black history in Florida. We refuse to let anybody exterminate Black history in any state in the United States of America, because Black history is American history. And not only do Black children need to know about Black history, but white children especially need to know about Black history. And so, we will fight, because our children need to know that our history made this country what it is today.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was civil rights attorney Ben Crump speaking on February 21st on the 58th anniversary of the assassination of Malcolm X at the Audubon Ballroom, now the Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

The 36-year-old mother of two was shot dead in her own home on July 6 after she called 911 for help. \"This is the worst police shooting video that I've seen. It is so senseless,\" says Ben Crump, a civil rights attorney representing the family. \"[Massey] needed a helping hand. She did not need a bullet to the face.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org. I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.\n\nA warning to our listeners and viewers: We're about to discuss graphic details of police violence.\n\nThe family of Sonya Massey is demanding justice after the unarmed 36-year-old Black woman was shot dead in her own home in Illinois when she called 911 for help. Police initially claimed she died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, but police bodycam footage has just been released and has proved that all to be a lie.\n\nFormer Sangamon County sheriff's deputy Sean Grayson, who's white, has been fired and charged with first-degree murder for fatally shooting Sonya Massey. Grayson did not activate his bodycam until after he killed her, but the other officer's body camera was activated when they arrived at her house. It shows the two men speaking with Sonya before one notes her stove is on and says, \"We don't need a fire while we're here.\" When Massey goes to turn off the stove, where a pot of water is boiling, a deputy tells her to \"step away from your hot steaming water.\" Massey can be heard saying, \"I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,\" and Grayson takes his gun out and responds, quote, \"You better f-ing not, or I swear to God I'll f-ing shoot you in the f-ing face.\" As Sonya Massey appears to duck and twice says, \"I'm sorry,\" the video shows Grayson moving toward her and fire three times, ultimately shooting her in the face. This is a clip of the exchange leading up to the shooting.\n\nSEAN GRAYSON : What is your last name? [inaudible] What's your last name? You're not in trouble. I just need to ask -\n\nSONYA MASSEY : Massey.\n\nSEAN GRAYSON : Huh?\n\nSONYA MASSEY : Massey.\n\nSEAN GRAYSON : What - do you have an ID? That would make things so much easier.\n\nSONYA MASSEY : Jesus.\n\nSEAN GRAYSON : I just need to get - just a driver's license will do, and then I'll get out of your hair.\n\nSONYA MASSEY : I'm going to show y'all my paperwork.\n\nDEPUTY : What -\n\nSEAN GRAYSON : I will read your paperwork.\n\nDEPUTY : What paperwork?\n\nSONYA MASSEY : OK. I've got some paperwork from -\n\nSEAN GRAYSON : We'll just get your ID real quick.\n\nDEPUTY : Well, let's get your ID first. And then -\n\nSEAN GRAYSON : One task at a time here.\n\nSONYA MASSEY : OK. Let me find it.\n\nSEAN GRAYSON : Here, grab your ID for me.\n\nSONYA MASSEY : Uh-huh, OK.\n\nSEAN GRAYSON : Your ID. One task at a time. So, let's do an ID, and then you can dig around for your paperwork.\n\nSONYA MASSEY : I don't know where my ID is.\n\nDEPUTY : Is it in that stack right there maybe?\n\nSONYA MASSEY : One second.\n\nSEAN GRAYSON : Just check on the burner.\n\nSONYA MASSEY : Underneath this.\n\nSEAN GRAYSON : We don't need a fire while we're here.\n\nSONYA MASSEY : All right. [inaudible] OK?\n\nSEAN GRAYSON : OK.\n\nSONYA MASSEY : Where are you moving?\n\nSEAN GRAYSON : Huh?\n\nSONYA MASSEY : Where are you going?\n\nSEAN GRAYSON : Away from your hot, steaming water.\n\nSONYA MASSEY : Huh? Away from my hot, steaming water?\n\nSEAN GRAYSON : Yeah.\n\nSONYA MASSEY : Oh, I rebuke you in the name of Jesus.\n\nSEAN GRAYSON : Huh?\n\nSONYA MASSEY : Rebuke you in the name of Jesus.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, after that, Sean Grayson shoots Sonya Massey. Bodycam footage later records him telling his partner not to render aid to her. Records show Grayson has worked at six different law enforcement agencies in Illinois since 2020. All of this comes as Massey's family says police first tried to cover up her killing. The Guardian newspaper obtained audio of a call from the scene in which a deputy told the dispatcher Massey's wound was self-inflicted. The family said it was also given misleading information, given by police, that she was shot by a neighbor. This is Massey's father, James Wilburn, at a news conference.\n\nJAMES WILBURN : I was under the impression that a prowler had broke in and killed my baby. Never did they say that it was a deputy-involved shooting, until my brother read it on the internet. And he shared with me, he said, \"Brother, what was Sonya's address?\" And I told him, and he said to me, \"This says this was a deputy-involved shooting.\" I said, \"Deputy-involved shooting? What are you talking about?\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Sonya Massey was the mother of two, a 15-year-old daughter and a 17-year-old son. Her killing by police has prompted protests, and both President Biden and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris issued statements saying Massey's family deserves justice. Vice President Harris said, quote, \"Sonya Massey deserved to be safe ... Doug and I send strength and prayers to Sonya's family and friends, and we join them in grieving her senseless death,\" unquote. Harris also called for Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.\n\nFor more, we're joined by Ben Crump, civil rights attorney representing the family of Sonya Massey.\n\nCan you explain exactly what took place? You've been out there, Ben. You're representing the family at this point. And talk about the cover-up, as well.\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : Well, obviously, it's tragic beyond proportions, Amy. This is the worst police shooting video that I've seen. I mean, it is so senseless. And the video is disturbing, but the audio is equally disturbing. When you look at that video and you see him move around the counter, even though he's trying to allege the reason he shot her was because he feared that she was going to throw hot water in his face from the pot - the very pot that he sent her to get - and then he moves around the counter, I think, from an objective observation, looks like to get a better shot. And then he has no remorse, no remorse whatsoever. When his partner says, \"I'm going to go get my CPR kit,\" he says, \"No, it's a headshot. Don't worry about that. It's not going to make a difference. She's gone.\" And then, at one point in the video, he says, \"Just let her f-ing\" - and he doesn't finish his statement, but a logical person can conclude he said, \"Just let her die.\" And so, it's troubling on every level. She needed a helping hand, Amy. She did not need a bullet to the face.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Ben Crump, equally disturbing is the fact that the authorities had first even withheld the actual information of what happened here. Could you talk about that and how you were able to uncover what really occurred?\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : Well, the family said when they initially got to her home, they kept asking, \"What happened? Who did this?\" And they asked questions, saying, \"Well, did she have a history with the neighbor? We're trying to find out.\" You know, the family is saying they told them it's under investigation, never told them that it was a police-involved shooting. In fact, one of the relatives said that a nurse at the hospital said they said this was self-inflicted. We saw some radio scanner back-and-forth where they talked about whether it was self-inflicted or not.\n\nSo, we don't know what the narrative was initially, but we've asked for a thorough investigation of that, as well, what led up to the killing, the killing itself, and then the aftermath of the killing with the sheriff's department, because we don't believe Deputy Grayson should have never been hired in the first place. He was convicted of two DUIs. We understand that he was discharged from the Army. And he had six jobs in four-year span, different law enforcement agencies. We have reason to believe that he may have been terminated from some of those law enforcement agency jobs. And so, the question is: Why did he even have a job as a sheriff's deputy? The judge said at the bond hearing, after watching the video that was released yesterday, that he believed Officer Grayson was a threat to public safety.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Crump is representing former Northwestern football players in one of the lawsuits. Republican presidential contender and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has doubled down on the Florida Board of Education's new rules that require educators to teach students that enslaved Black people \"developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.\" Crump, who says he may sue the state over the changes, notes, \"It has the potential to cause serious psychological trauma to African American students, and we will not stand for it.\" Meanwhile, Crump has called the cases at Northwestern the beginning of the \"me too\" movement for college sports.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Ben, I wanted to ask you - Juan, did you have another question on the Malcolm X assassination?\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: No, no. Go ahead, Amy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : All right, let me introduce the clip, and this is in Florida. I want to switch topics and ask you about the Republican presidential contender, your governor, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who's doubled down on the Florida Board of Education's new rules that require educators to teach students that enslaved Black people, quote, \"developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.\" On Friday, Governor DeSantis defended the curriculum.\n\nGOV . RON DESANTIS : I think that they're probably going to show some of the folks that eventually parlayed, you know, being a blacksmith into doing things later in life. But the reality is, all of that is rooted in whatever is factual. They listed everything out. And if you have any questions about it, just ask the Department of Education. You can talk about those folks. But, I mean, these were scholars who put that together. It was not anything that was done politically.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The NAACP has called Florida's new curriculum a, quote, \"sanitized and dishonest telling of the history of slavery in America.\" And, Ben Crump, the last time you were in New York at the Audubon Ballroom, you were threatening to sue DeSantis and the state of Florida. He's talking about what he calls, really, the upside of slavery.\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : Yeah, Amy, it's deplorable. It is sickening. It is astonishing that in 2023 we can have a person who is the second in contention for the Republican nomination telling his supporters and his state that he governs that it is going to be mandated now that students in Florida, starting from middle school on, will have to be taught that slavery had positive benefits. And it is asinine on every level. It has the potential to cause serious psychological trauma to African American students.\n\nAnd we will not stand for it. We will explore every possible legal remedy in the court of law. I know activists, civil rights leaders, ministers, business leaders all throughout the Black community who will fight in the court of public opinion against this heresy. It is - I mean, it is akin to trying to teach the next generation, the young people, that slavery was not that bad. And if we don't teach our children true history and they don't learn from the sins of the past, then it is very likely that we will repeat those horrors. And we will not allow that to happen.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Ben Crump, we only have about a minute left, but I wanted to ask you also about another mushrooming scandal at Northwestern, in the Northwestern University athletic program. You represent Lloyd Yates, a former quarterback and wide receiver with the Northwestern football team. Could you talk about the importance of what's happening there?\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : Yes. Lloyd Yates, a courageous young man who was the quarterback for the Northwestern University football team, whose coach, Fitzgerald, has been fired amidst this hazing scandal, was the first named plaintiff to file a lawsuit, the first person not to stay behind anonymity but put his name and face out there, launching what I believe, Juan, to be the \"me too\" moment for college sports, that we hopefully will eradicate this physical, psychological and, in Lloyd's case and many others at Northwestern, sexual hazing. And it's no way they can justify this. It needs to be condemned and not condoned in any manner. And we believe, just like with the sexual abuse scandals at Michigan State and Ohio State, that Northwestern needs to step up and set a precedent for what will not be tolerated.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, we thank you so much for joining us, was in New York yesterday, today in Miami, Florida.\n\nThat does it for our show.

Surveillance video shows seven sheriff's deputies and three hospital workers violently pinned Otieno to the floor and piled on him for more than 11 minutes, suffocating him. New video released Wednesday reveals at least one officer had also repeatedly punched Otieno earlier that day. A grand jury has indicted the 10 men involved on second-degree murder charges. Otieno was having a mental health crisis, which Crump says is too often a death sentence for Black people in police encounters. \"What happened to Irvo isn't an isolated incident in America,\" says Crump.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : A warning to our audience: This story contains images and descriptions of police violence.\n\nWe begin today's show looking at the death of Irvo Otieno, a 28-year-old Black man and aspiring musician who was killed March 6th inside a hospital in Virginia, where he had been taken to receive mental health treatment. Shocking video released this week shows seven sheriff's deputies and three hospital workers violently pinned Irvo Otieno to the hospital floor and piled on him for more than 11 minutes, suffocating him. Earlier this week, a Virginia grand jury indicted the 10 men involved on second-degree murder charges.\n\nOtieno's death occurred at Central State Hospital, a psychiatric facility in Dinwiddie County, Virginia. New video released Wednesday reveals at least one officer had also repeatedly punched Irvo earlier that day when a group of them rushed into his cell, his jail cell. When the officers carried Otieno out of the cell, he was no longer moving. They put his limp body in a van to transport him to the hospital, where he died after being pinned to the ground by the seven sheriff's deputies and three hospital workers.\n\nIrvo Otieno was an aspiring musician who suffered from mental health challenges. He had been taken from his home and locked up three days before he was killed, after a neighbor called police to report he had walked onto their property and had taken some lights and was banging on the front door.\n\nThis is Irvo Otieno's mother, Caroline Ouko, who moved to Virginia with her family from Kenya in the '90s.\n\nCAROLINE OUKO : Even though Irvo was going through mental illness, what I saw today - what I saw today was heartbreaking, America. It was disturbing. It was traumatic. My son was tortured, to put it right. I saw the torture. There is no way that Henrico County sheriff deputies were on him, seven people, seven officers, on one man. And all this started when my son went to hospital on the 3rd. And that evening, he was taken to jail, raced from the back of the jail into the hospital. Those three days at Henrico County Jail were horror. I've seen it on video, and I think there's some more. But I'm here to mourn. And I'm mourning the life of this young man, my son. Mental illness should not be your ticket to death.\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : Amen.\n\nCAROLINE OUKO : There was a chance to rescue him. There was a chance to stop what was going on. And I don't understand how all systems failed him. I don't understand why one single system could not hold up and say, \"Stop. We stop here.\" My son was treated like a dog, worse than a dog. I saw it with my own eyes on the video.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was Caroline Ouko, the mother of Irvo Otieno, who was killed by seven sheriff's deputies and three hospital workers inside a mental health facility in Virginia March 6th.\n\nWe go now to civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Irvo's family.\n\nBen, welcome back to Democracy Now! This horrific story continues to unfold because more and more video has been released. Tell us what happened on March 6th, especially with the latest video that's hours before what we had seen, and what the family is calling for right now. How did this happen to Irvo?\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : Thank you for having me, Amy.\n\nAnd there is more video to be released that is equally disturbing that has not been released to the public, that the family and our legal team have been able to review.\n\nOn March 6th, Irvo Otieno was having a mental health crisis, Amy. And regrettably, like so many other Black people in America who have mental health issues, they aren't treated like medical issues. They're treated like criminal issues. And many times, when they are confronted by the police, these mental health issues leads to them being sentenced to death, like we saw in this disturbing video of Irvo.\n\nI mean, he was in a mental hospital, for God's sakes. Isn't it foreseeable that people who have mental health issues and are in crisis, and they're in the hospital, that they're going to have situations where they have crisis? And so, they should be able to deal with them without the person being killed.\n\nAnd when you look at the video, he was handcuffed at his wrists. He had leg irons on his ankles. And so, he posed no threat to anyone, not himself, not to the officers or hospital staff. You look at the video, his body seemed lifeless when they dragged him to the car, and certainly when they dragged him into the room where we witnessed him being face down and seven sheriff's deputies from Henrico County and three security guards from the medical facility all piled on top of him, all put the brunt of their weight on him, put their knees on his back, on his neck, not for a few minutes but for almost 12 minutes. And as the prosecutor said, Amy, when she charged them with second-degree murder, they literally smothered him to death. And that is tragic, when you think about he committed no crime. He was there because he had -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Let me just play, Ben -\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : - mental health issues.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Let me play the Dinwiddie County Commonwealth's Attorney Ann Cabell Baskervill speaking during one of the first hearings last week for the seven deputies charged in the death of Irvo Otieno.\n\nANN CABELL BASKERVILL : He was held down on the ground, prone on the ground, for 12 minutes by all seven of our defendants charged here, including this one, so much so that they smothered him, and they smothered him to the death. ... It is the defendant's position that the victim in this case was agitated and combative towards - they have all used. There is video footage of exactly what happened, and he was not agitated and combative.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I mean, this is key, Ben. The Dinwiddie County Commonwealth's attorney said he was not combative.\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : Yeah, and on the video, Amy - the one good thing about video - and thank God for the advent of technology, because for decades Black people would say that the police are brutalizing us, that they're engaged in excessive force, and people would always believe the police word. They would take the police narrative. But now with video, you can see for yourself what happened. And there is no video that we have seen that shows Irvo being combative or posing a threat to anybody. They're saying, \"Take our word for it.\" And even irrespective, Amy, if he did something at some point during his crisis, we clearly see on the video that has been released to the public that never was Irvo posing a threat.\n\nI mean, when you think about it, I got so many calls from all across America, across the world, saying, \"Why?\" This is so unnecessary. He's handcuffed and shackled. If they just leave him in the room and wait for him to get proper medical attention, then who's at harm? Why do you have to put him face down? Why do you have to put knees in his back? Why do you have to smother him to death? It is - it's just so unnecessary, as many of these deaths. And three years after George Floyd, why would police or law enforcement officials be putting their knees anywhere on a restrained person who is face down?\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Absolutely, Ben Crump. And if you could explain - I mean, what's especially shocking and horrifying about this incident is, of course, that it takes place in a hospital, and that, too, in a mental hospital, where, presumably, the medical staff is accustomed to dealing with people, even - in this case, he's not even combative. But even if he were, what would justify, in a facility like this, the police, together with medical staff, actively, in fact, murdering one of their patients?\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : There is nothing that would justify it. In fact, what is equally troubling is that you have so many people standing around, and nobody intervenes. We remember on Tyre Nichols' tragic killing in Memphis, Tennessee, that was one of the preeminent issues that none of those police officers intervened while they were watching a young man be beat to death, be tortured. And so, you see those similar issues here in Richmond, Virginia, where nobody intervened, not the medical staff, not any of the security, anybody there. They simply watched.\n\nAnd can you imagine setting your stopwatch for 12 minutes, and just think about how much time goes into 12 minutes, how many seconds, and the fact that Irvo can't breathe? They're saying that, well, he was still moving when they had him on the ground. Our experts opine, absolutely, you would be moving, too, if you're face down, restrained, and you've got 10 people on top of you for 12 minutes. If you're struggling, you're trying to move so you can get air. And that's what was denied to Irvo, his opportunity to breathe. And that's what is very disturbing, that the medical personnel, who are trained on how to preserve life, could not recognize that Irvo needed somebody to intervene to give him the benefit of the doubt, the benefit of their professionalism, and, mostly, the benefit of humanity.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Ben, could you talk about this specific hospital where he was held and where this incident occurred? It has a -\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : Yeah.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Go ahead.\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : Yeah, it has - as my co-counsel Mark Krudys and I have been researching with our legal team, this certainly isn't the first incident where patients who have been, I guess, dealing with mental health crises have been abused, in the sense that other Black people have alleged that police used excessive force against them. And, you know, they come up with all kind of things to try to justify the cause of death, but I believe, as other families have alleged, their family members were killed because of an overdose of excessive force.\n\nAnd so, we have to use this as an opportunity to deal with the issues of mental health in America. We need legislation. We need policies to try to prevent any more Irvos. You know, President Biden, a couple days ago, had the television cast of Ted Lasso , the award-winning show, at the White House to talk about the importance of mental health. Well, it is my fervent hope that they would have engaged with Black people who have mental health issues, to say that we need to treat those important, as well, and not as criminal issues, because we saw it in Pam Turner in Houston, Texas, a Black woman having a mental health crisis, and the police end up shooting her in the face, in the chest and in the stomach, while she's laying on the ground on her back. And that video is horrific. And then we see Gershun Freeman in Memphis, Tennessee, Shelby County Jail, who is beat to death while he's naked in the jail having a mental health crisis.\n\nAnd so, what happened to Irvo isn't an isolated incident in America. When you're Black in America and you have a mental health crisis, too often the determining factor of whether you live or die becomes the color of your skin and the status of your mental health. And that should not be the case.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Ben, I want to go back to Irvo's mother, Caroline Ouko.\n\nCAROLINE OUKO : This young man you see here had a big heart. Irvo was the guy that his classmates drew to when they needed someone to talk to. He was a listener. He would take time to listen to them. And then he would take time to process and then lean back in. My son was a leader; he was not a follower. He also brought a different perspective to the table. If there was a discussion, he was not afraid to go the other way when everybody else is following. This is my baby. He cared for people. He cared that people were treated right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : It is so horrifying to meet, all too often, young Black men after their death, with their mothers or sisters or partners describing who they were. Ben Crump, as we wrap up, the pile-on was more than 11 minutes. In the case of Derek Chauvin murdering George Floyd, it was nine-and-a-half minutes. At this point, what are you demanding?\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : We're demanding -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And also, can you talk about the fact that the defense attorneys have called for holding Irvo's body - it could be weeks - something that the judge ruled against yesterday?\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : Yeah, you know, it is god-awful that this family is having to grieve the death of an unnecessary, unjustifiable and unconstitutional killing of their loved one, but it is insult on top of injury to say that they are going to be prevented for possibly weeks at having the funeral services for Irvo because these defense attorneys are arguing that they have a right to do an autopsy or some independent autopsy from their choosing. Well, you know, it's disturbing. They have video. I mean, there's no question what killed him. The medical examiner has done the autopsy. They will have the benefit of having all the slides and the reports from that autopsy. But to try to hold up his funeral is disturbing, especially for this family. Can you imagine your loved one being killed by the people who are supposed to protect and serve him, but then they are trying to say you can't have the funeral for another month?\n\nI mean, we can't allow that to happen. And I pray that the judge will not allow that to happen, because what we need is, just like the police chief said in Memphis, Tennessee, when you see a tragedy like this, an injustice like this, a crime committed like this, on video, the community needs to see us moving swiftly. We need to move swiftly towards justice, because justice delayed is justice denied.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Ben Crump, we want to thank you very much for being with us. I believe the judge did rule against the defense request to hold the body of Irvo, saying a corpse \"is not a T-shirt\" or something else that can be easily stored. Ben Crump, civil rights attorney representing the family of Irvo Otieno.\n\nComing up, we speak to the Iraqi journalist Ghaith Abdul-Ahad, author of the new book, A Stranger in Your Own City: Travels in the Middle East's Long War .

Eboni Pouncy and her friend were asleep in the back of the friend's apartment when they were woken up by two officers who began shooting through a window. The officers were responding to an alleged break-in after Pouncy's friend broke a window to enter her apartment when she forgot her key. Newly released body-camera footage shows the shooting barrage. \"It is clearly excessive. I mean, they shot over two dozen rounds,\" says Crump, who asks why police officers \"shoot first and ask questions later\" when they encounter law-abiding African Americans who are armed. He compares the case to the police killing of Breonna Taylor in her apartment in 2020.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh, as we bring you Part 2 of our conversation with civil rights attorney Ben Crump. In Part 1 , we talked about Crump's attempts on behalf of the Malcolm X family to get information released by the federal government and the New York Police Department on this 59th anniversary of the assassination of Malcolm X.\n\nToday, we want to talk about the night of February 3rd, a totally different case. Eboni Pouncy and her friend were entering her friend's apartment in Houston, Texas, after they forgot their house key. Suddenly, Houston police officers shot Eboni five times through a window when they arrived. They say they thought they were responding to an alleged break-in. Newly released body-camera footage shows the shooting. You can hear the barrage of bullets.\n\nPOLICE OFFICER : Go down. Go down. Go down. Shots fired. Shots fired. OK, go down. Go down.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Eboni Pouncy spoke to ABC News about being shot.\n\nEBONI POUNCY : I have a baby, a beautiful baby girl. She knows that I'm not able to do the things I was able to do before. And I'm not able to be as attentive with my baby. She's only 1. So, that's probably the hardest part. ... I started seeing holes in the walls as I was standing there. And then I realized it was something coming through the apartment. I thought it was something outside, but it was something coming from outside to inside. ... I see blood, not necessarily wounds. I see blood everywhere.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : For more, we're joined by Eboni Pouncy's attorney, civil rights lawyer Ben Crump.\n\nBen, if you can tell us the story, from what you have gathered? The video footage is astounding of these officers coming up to an apartment, even if they thought there was a break-in. The women had to break the window to get in, because they didn't have their key. But the speed with which they opened fire, not even seeing what they're shooting.\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : Yeah, Amy, it's very troubling. It's clearly excessive. I mean, they shot over two dozen rounds. You had the one officer empty her clip, then reload and empty the clip again, all from outside the apartment inside the apartment. And you're right. If there were hostages, if it really was a burglary, you would have shot and potentially killed them, as well. Five bullets hit Eboni Pouncy, this young Black woman, and it is a miracle that she is still alive after being shot in her left chest, her left side of her stomach, her thigh, her leg, all the way down to her feet. I mean, these bullets were just coming at her from every direction. And you saw that both of the officers were shooting from outside the apartment inside the apartment. Every expert we've talked to has said that this is very troubling, that this is a bad shoot. They identified themselves when they first knocked at the door. But Eboni and her friend was in the back of the apartment, and they didn't hear them.\n\nEboni, who is a law-abiding citizen, never been arrested, had every right to the Second Amendment as any other American citizen. And, you know, we can assume right now in America that the majority of citizens have availed themselves to the Second Amendment and have a right to have a gun and protect their home and their castle. Well, that applies to Black people, too. So it is very troubling that every time a Black person, a law-abiding citizen, has a gun, a police officer assumes that they are a criminal, and that they shoot first and ask questions later. It was the situation, we believe, with Atatiana Jefferson, who they shot into her apartment while she was babysitting her nephew, and killed her. And it reminds a lot of people of Breonna Taylor being killed with all those bullet holes mutilating her body, after they kicked in her front door at 1:00 in the morning, and her boyfriend Kenneth, a law-abiding citizen, had his gun, trying to protect his home.\n\nBut this situation in Houston, Texas, with the tragic shooting of Eboni Pouncy, who had to be reinstated to the hospital to remove one of the bullets that was lodged in her body just yesterday, is troubling on every level. And when you listen and watch those bodycam videos, you say, \"My god, when will they learn?\"\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : And, Ben Crump, what's happened to the police officers who shot Eboni?\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : They have been placed on administrative leave. And that's all we know. They have not received any form of discipline, as we have been made aware of, despite this very graphic, very, very graphic, disturbing bodycam video showing them shooting at least 24 times into the apartment. They believe it may have been as many times as 30 rounds.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And let's be clear, they were in this apartment complex for something totally different, and someone said, \"Go check out what's happening there.\" One of the highly disturbing things is you see that the shades are almost totally drawn. And so, when they're shooting, they can hardly see what is inside. Explain then what happens. Explain - they're two girlfriends, and the one who has the apartment, she goes out with her hands up. I mean, what happens after they shoot Eboni?\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : Yeah, after Eboni has been shot, the other occupant comes out with her hands up. And she is literally saying to them, you know, \"We live here. Don't shoot. Please don't shoot. We live here.\"\n\nAnd remember, when they start the shooting, they give no verbal commands. They say, \"Drop the gun,\" and as they're saying that, they are shooting. And so, whatever verbal commands they gave, they did not give them time to acquiesce to the commands. They literally say, as they're shooting, \"Drop the gun.\"\n\nAnd Eboni, as you've heard her say in the interviews, did not know what was going on. They thought that they were being robbed, that they were being burglarized. And just like in Breonna Taylor's case, they're asleep in the back of their apartment. Police are around the house making noise. They don't know if it's a burglar or not.\n\nWhy can't the police give verbal commands, give Black people time to respond, so they know if it's truly a criminal situation or not, before they shoot first and ask questions later? And where's the NRA ? Where are the gun rights advocates when innocent Black people are shot by police officers? Why aren't they coming to say that, \"Hold on, this was a law-abiding citizen who had the right to the Second Amendment also\"?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And to be clear, you're saying that Eboni - they were at the back of the apartment. They hear commotion. And Eboni has a gun. And they come forward to see what the heck is going on: Is someone breaking into their apartment?\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : Exactly. And in the state of Texas, you can have a gun for your protection. They've passed so many laws to give citizens the right to bear arms and protect themselves. So, Eboni was doing what every other citizen in the state of Texas had the right to do. But because she was a woman of color, seems like her having a gun presented a problem to the Harris County sheriff's deputies.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, Ben Crump, we want to thank you so much for being with us, civil rights attorney, representing Eboni Pouncy, who was shot five times by Houston police in her own friend's apartment. To see Part 1 of our discussion with Ben about the assassination of Malcolm X and why the federal government and New York City police are not revealing all the information they have about this assassination 59 years ago, go to democracynow.org.

Potter claims she reached for her Taser and drew a pistol by mistake. \"Black people should not be killed in America over misdemeanor, pretextual traffic stops,\" says Benjamin Crump, attorney for Wright's family.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to go on to another case and then another one. I want to ask you about the Minnesota manslaughter trial of former Brooklyn Center police officer Kimberly Potter. Local media reports Potter is expected to take the stand in her own defense today, on the eighth day of testimony. The white woman is charged with first-degree and second-degree manslaughter in the killing of 20-year-old Black motorist Daunte Wright during a minor traffic stop in April. Bodycam video showed Potter pointing her 9-millimeter pistol at Wright, repeatedly shouting \"Taser!\" before firing a single bullet into Wright's chest. Potter claims she drew the pistol by mistake. She's a [26-year] police veteran who was training other officers when she shot Wright.\n\nJust before Daunte was killed, he called his mother to say he was being pulled over, allegedly because an air freshener was obscuring his rearview mirror and for an expired registration tag. Katie Bryant, Wright's mom, testified about this phone call in Kim Potter's trial last week. She was the prosecution's first witness.\n\nKATIE BRYANT : He just sounded really nervous. But I reassured him that it would be OK.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The call ended. Katie Bryant later made a video call. A woman, likely Daunte Wright's partner, Alayna Albrecht-Payton, who was in the car at the time of his killing, answered the phone.\n\nKATIE BRYANT : She said that they shot him. And she faced the phone towards the driver's seat, and my son was laying there. He was unresponsive, and he looked dead.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : In the end, they ended up handcuffing Daunte Wright's partner. The prosecution rested its case Thursday. One of its witnesses, Minnesota state investigator Sam McGinnis, testified this week that Potter failed to test her Taser as required on the day she fatally shot Wright. He also laid out the differences between a Glock pistol and a Taser.\n\nSAM McGINNIS: The Taser is yellow; the firearm is black. The Taser has a stocky body to it compared to the Glock handgun. The grip of the Taser is shorter and wider than the Glock.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Meanwhile, Wednesday, use-of-force expert Seth Stoughton testified for the prosecution that Potter acted unreasonably in shooting Wright. He said, quote, \"The use of deadly force was not appropriate. The evidence suggests a reasonable officer in Officer Potter's position could not have believed it was proportional to the threat at the time,\" he said. Stoughton is a professor at University of South Carolina School of Law who also testified for the prosecution at Chauvin's trial. Ben Crump, your response to Kim Potter's trial so far? What do you expect the outcome to be? You're Daunte Wright's family's attorney.\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : We expect that there will be accountability for another unjustified death of another young Black man. When you think about this excuse that it was an innocent mistake, it wasn't innocent at all for her and the police officers to yet again have a pretextual stop of a minority in Minneapolis. We know that these pretextual stops, whether you say it's an air freshener obscuring the view of the driver, whether you say it's an expired registration - during the pandemic, where they have been given memos that they should not be stopping motorists for expired license plates because they were closed - which leads to them engaging in the most use of force.\n\nShe should be found guilty for two reasons, because they were violations of policy irrespective of her plea that it was an innocent mistake. Number one, you never should have violated your policy and used a Taser for a traffic stop. And they tried to offer this justification that, oh, she feared it was a life-or-death situation. But when we look at the video, we must remember, never was anybody in a life-or-death situation based on what we can see with our eyes. And everything that Daunte Wright was accused of was a misdemeanor. So, Black people should not be killed in America over misdemeanor pretextual traffic stops. Secondly, when she employed the Taser, she aimed it at his chest. That again was a violation of the policies of the Brooklyn Center Police Department. So she should be convicted on manslaughter, because she was reckless, she was flagrant, and she was reckless in following the policies that she had been trained on for 26 years. She was the training officer teaching rookie cops on how to interact with citizens. And there cannot be a different standard for when they interact with white citizens versus Black citizens.\n\nWe just had the guilty verdict and the plea in Derek Chauvin's case, and I expect we should get a guilty verdict in Kim Potter's case. But I will say this: These are great victories in the interest of justice, but at what cost? George Floyd and Daunte Wright should be living today, enjoying the holidays with their families. These young Black fathers have been taken from their children unjustly and unconstitutionally and unnecessarily.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And I just wanted to clarify, as you said, Kim Potter is a 26-year veteran, not 26-year-old police veteran, and she was training two other officers on the scene. It so much reminds me of the Philando Castile case, because you have a man who is stopped - I mean, remember, in this case, when we talk about air freshener hanging from the mirror, it's those little Christmas tree-like air fresheners. That's the kind of thing that we're talking about, that so many people have. But Philando Castile, who's shot, and his girlfriend, his partner, films him dying, and she ultimately is arrested, just as the partner of Daunte Wright is arrested. They spend more time arresting her than helping him.\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : Yeah. And that's the tragic circumstance. It seems to be that Black lives don't matter in the moments when they are trying to justify killing another Black person. And you just see them start to conspire to try to cover up something they know is wrong. We have to continue to shine a light on this, because it's happening far too often. Even in the aftermath of George Floyd, we continue to see these unjust killings all over America of unarmed Black people.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

But, first and foremost, I must ask the elders, anyone 70 and above, I need your permission so that I can do libation. All you have to do is say \"yes.\" Yes. Do I have your permission, elders? Elders? OK.\n\nFirst libation goes to the most high, one force, one source, the generous, the compassionate, the one who oversees us. Our first libation goes to the most high, called by many names, but in the end, when we shed our skin, there's one force, one source, most high. Ase , ase , ase .\n\nSecond libation goes to the guardians of the four corners and the five elements of earth, water, fire, air, ether, that the most high has for us to sustain us on our journey until the end. Ase , ase , ase .\n\nNext libation goes to the atrocity, the holocaust, the African holocaust across the Atlantic, 13 million. Some decided to take their lives. Some were killed, raped, mutilated. We owe them our honor and our allegiance. They have crossed the ocean by skeletons. Some ended up in New York. Some ended up in South America. Some ended up all over the world. But they are the reason why we are here, our ancestors. We pay ase and libations to them. Ase , ase , ase .\n\nNext libation goes to the civil rights leaders, martyrs and participants, who paved the way for us, for us, so that we have freedom to do, to be, our education system, how we look, so we can regain our culture and our language. We pay allegiance to the civil rights leaders and martyrs. Ase , ase , ase .\n\nThere are many who use their gifts of art and music to express their culture. We honor them. Ase , ase , ase .\n\nBefore the enslavement trade, there was architects, astronomers, surgeons. We were great people. And we need to honor our past so that we can come forward and regurgitate that in our consciousness. And if you need help, call on the ancestors who are in your field. We honor them. Ase , ase , ase .\n\nWe honor Malcolm X, his family, his grandfather, his grandmother, his father, his mother, his siblings. We honor them. Ase , ase , ase .

Good evening.\n\nAUDIENCE : Good evening!\n\nILYASAH SHABAZZ : Malaak, LeAsah, Gamilah, if you'd like to join me, Nadia, Aryah. Greetings. Thank you so much for coming here this evening. Welcome to the Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center. This is the house that Betty built.\n\nGamilah, you guys, come over.\n\nMALAAK SHABAZZ : This is the house that Betty built.\n\nILYASAH SHABAZZ : Oh goodness.\n\nMALAAK SHABAZZ : Let's get real on that, everybody.\n\nILYASAH SHABAZZ : OK. Thank you for joining -\n\nMALAAK SHABAZZ : I just want to - I just want to say that, as the youngest daughter. My mama built this house. Can I say that? I'm just saying.\n\nILYASAH SHABAZZ : So, you know what it's like when you have six daughters. Well, you know, let me just say that on February 21st, 1965, my mother came here with her daughters. She was pregnant with the twins. Malaak is one of the twins. And, you know, we always give homage to our mother, because we knew who Daddy was. We knew who the real Malcolm was. My mother made sure of that. And if you ask us about our father, we can tell you all kinds of stories about his morals, his character, his values, and so forth. Malaak can tell you stories, and Malaak never even laid eyes on him. But that's a testament to what my mother did for her daughters.\n\nMALAAK SHABAZZ : Excuse me.\n\nILYASAH SHABAZZ : No, Malaak. Not right now.\n\nMALAAK SHABAZZ : No, no, no, no, no. Let me say -\n\nILYASAH SHABAZZ : Thank you for joining - Malaak, you want to go ahead?\n\nMALAAK SHABAZZ : Let me - let me just say this.\n\nILYASAH SHABAZZ : OK. That's the youngest.\n\nMALAAK SHABAZZ : When people say I didn't know my father, they're disrespecting my mother as an educator. I know him better than you. I know from the educator, the person who did know Malcolm, who raised us, who taught you. So, I know more than you. So, when I'm - when you say I am the youngest and I was a baby and I wasn't born, I know more than you do.\n\nILYASAH SHABAZZ : Oh!\n\nMALAAK SHABAZZ : Don't disrespect - because if you say that, then you disrespect Dr. Betty Shabazz, when you can't.\n\nILYASAH SHABAZZ : That's right.\n\nMALAAK SHABAZZ : If you were a student at Medgar Evers.\n\nILYASAH SHABAZZ : And one of the things that we really love on this mural here, and it speaks volumes to our mother, is when - you know, first of all, this mural art, this mural is - was commissioned by Daniel Galvez. He's the artist. And my mother selected specific parts of my father's life that she felt was important and worthy of sharing. And one of the things that always touches us is that there's the image of my mother pointing at the continent, telling Attallah, Qubilah and me where daddy was. She said, \"You have to put a bassinet,\" because she didn't want her fourth baby, Gamilah, who's right here, to feel left out. So, my mother was just amazing woman. So, thank you for joining me and my family. LeAsah, who's named after me, my father's sister's daughter.\n\nLEASAH LITTLE - BROWN : Granddaughter.\n\nILYASAH SHABAZZ : Granddaughter. And we're always like, \"Why didn't you just name her Ilyasah? Why did it have to be LeAsah?\" But we're so grateful that you could join us, the Shabazz family, this evening, and our beautiful community, as we commemorate the life and times of El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz. My name is Dr. Ilyasah Shabazz. I am one of six daughters. And we are all honored to carry forth the legacy of our beloved parents. As the chairperson of the Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Education Center, we thank you. I'd like to first thank the African Healing Circle and Reverend Dr. Mother Khoshhali for so beautifully invoking the spirit of our ancestors and for setting the tone and intention of this evening. I'd also like to thank my five beautiful sisters - Attallah, Qubilah, Gamilah, Malikah and Malaak - and the entire Shabazz family for continuing what our parents started.\n\nOn February 21st, 1965, my mother, sisters and I witnessed the assassination of her husband, our father, right here in this space. He was 39 years old. My pregnant mother placed her entire body over my three sisters and me to protect us from gunfire and to make sure we would not see the terror before our eyes. Despite having to witness her husband's assassination, Sister Betty never gave in to bitterness or despair, even though as a young wife and mother she had every right. But, rather, this inspiring widow kept her husband's essence, his love, values and humanity integral in our household. She did not want her six daughters to suffer from the sudden loss of our father's physical presence and love. And though he was physically absent, my mother made sure her husband remained present in our household conversations for as long as I can remember. She safeguarded her husband's true legacy for the benefit of a functionally thriving generation to roll up their sleeves collectively and do the necessary work with love, sincerity, excellence and reconciliation.\n\nAnd so, today marks the 58th anniversary of our father's assassination in this very room. He was preparing to give an important speech outlining the objectives of his newly formed multiethnic political coalition, the Organization of Afro-American Unity. His wife, Sister Betty, was also a profound visionary and educator. And it is why the legacy of her husband continues right here at the Shabazz Center. This is the home that Betty built. And each year since my father's martyrdom, we've come together to honor his life, and we are so grateful. I say with pride that this space, which was once a site of tragedy, is now a site of action and community building.\n\nThe Shabazz Center is a cultural and educational institution that harnesses and memorializes the legacies of Malcolm X and Betty Shabazz to incubate social, racial and global justice movements. Thank you to our wonderful board of trustees. Can those that are here, can you take a stand? It looks like Jodie Patterson, Ken Norton and Akemi Kochiyama. That's Yuri Kochiyama's granddaughter.\n\nGAMILAH LUMUMBA SHABAZZ : Where?\n\nILYASAH SHABAZZ : Right there. Akemi, could you stand back up again? I'd also like to thank our staff. Najha Zigbi-Johnson, where are you, darling? Oh, there she is. Thank you for all of your great work. My beautiful sister Sharisse Stancil-Ashford, Julian Caldwell. Are you here, Julian? Oh, there you are, in the back. OK. Doctor - oh, and, of course, our new executive director, Dr. Ann-Marie Weathers. Where are you? OK. Beautiful, beautiful, absolutely gorgeous. I should tell you to come down here and let everyone see your beautiful dress. The Shabazz Center is grateful to have each and every one of you.\n\nNow, without further ado, I am excited to turn the program over to our wonderful emcee, who will guide us through this evening's program, my beautiful brother and friend - I know you all are here to see Sister Angela Davis. But before we do that, all - we're so happy for her to be here - we're going to show you our beautiful friend, my brother and friend, Marc Lamont Hill. He is an academic, author and activist, an award-winning journalist. He is the Steve Charles professor of media, cities and solutions at Temple University. And we're so grateful that he found time to come here, because we know how busy he is. He is the host of UpFront on Al Jazeera English. Previously, he hosted the syndicated television show Our World with Black Enterprise . He served as BET News correspondent and is now - and is a former political commentator for CNN and Fox News. Please join me in welcoming to the stage Mr. Marc Lamont Hill.\n\nMARC LAMONT HILL : Peace, everybody.\n\nAUDIENCE : Peace!\n\nMARC LAMONT HILL : It is - I can't even tell y'all how much of an honor it is to be in this room at this special - for this special occasion and to see so many beautiful Black people in this place to honor the life and the legacy of one of the most extraordinary human beings this world has ever produced.\n\nI will be your emcee. I know you're all here to see Angela. I am, too. So, I ain't gonna stay long. But I am honored to serve as your emcee through this powerful evening of wisdom teachings, of remembrances, of music and of poetry. And right now I'm going to bring up our first performer. It's my dear sister. She embodies so many forms of art in one. She's the author of several poetry collections, published under her own Moore Black Press. Now, I'm going to tell you she's born and raised in Detroit, because you can't be around anybody from Detroit for more than 30 seconds before they tell you they're from Detroit. \"I'm from Detroit!\" That's usually how it comes up. And she spits fire into every microphone, every place she goes, every live event, every recording, every TV show, including Showtime at the Apollo , where she won five times in a row. You know it's hard up here to win at the Apollo. Y'all saw her on Def Poetry Jam. She's the founder of Black Women Rock! And she is the winner of multiple awards. Her work has been featured in many publications and at the National Museum of African American History and Culture. And I'm going to say just one more thing about my sister. Every time you see jessica Care moore, she's loving us. She's supporting us. She's raising us up. Whether it's a big stage or a back space, she's working. She's struggling for us. If you give her the invitation, she's showing up, and she's showing out. So show some love to my dear sister.\n\njessica Care moore: Thank you, Marc! I love you. Where are you going? Good to see you.\n\nGreetings from Detroit. What up, though? It's an honor. I love you, Dr. Davis. We've shared some spaces in the last six months. Thank you so much for having me, to the Shabazz Center, to the Shabazz family. Thank you to the daughters. It is an honor to be here. If not for Malcolm's voice and message, I wouldn't be the poet that I am. I don't think any poet that is a poet that says they're a Black poet would ever be a Black poet if they didn't love and study Malcolm X's teachings. I'm from Detroit, so you know we love Malcolm in Detroit. My first band was Detroit Red. I'm just saying.\n\nBut I'm going to read one poem. And I thought so hard about what I should read in this space. And I know this is the poem that I need to read for Tyre Nichols and for Trayvon Martin and for Sandra Bland and for our brother Malcolm, and for all of us who are assassinated one way or another in this place called America. And yeah, I thought \"We Want Our Bodies Back.\" This is what I need to say.\n\nIf black women could be cut down. No. Removed, gently, from American terrorism Who would break our fall? Which direction would we travel to feel safe?\n\nwild is the wind\n\nIf we could turn in this skin, these sharpened bones. this brain full of power & history. who would we resemble?\n\ninvisible doesn't come in black.\n\nhow many nervous breakdowns how many funeral black dresses how many fibroids how many nooses how many of our bodies must be raped? cut into pieces. burned inside garbage bags. Buried\n\n?\n\nhow many of us blossom a beautiful tree of life & pray our pride isn't cut down the middle/reduced to trunks or a close friend doesn't die climbing their limbs attempting to simply grow outside the gritty soil they were planted.\n\ni put a spell on you\n\nHolly Hobbie ovens girl scout cookies & barbie dolls don't prepare our revolutionary daughters born with capes & wings to have a pig's knee pushed into their backs girls raised by wolves taught to disappear to be quiet to not talk about it how much black breath is allowed space in the state of TEXAS ?\n\na place that has sucked the life out of countless miscounted. uncounted brown. poor. women. die here.\n\nI got life\n\nSandra Bland got the death penalty for a traffic stop. Her body was 28 years young.\n\nHow to make sense of our bodies? bodies burnt by cigarettes bodies smoked out their own neighborhoods bodies with abandoned lungs and hearts bodies mistaken for women when they are still    girls\n\nHow do we construct a survival guide, a poem for our daughters' bodies without throwing up our breakfast? How do our mothers' bodies not implode after telling our sons to comply, to not speak up, to keep their heads down, to allow their bodies to be dragged by racist police\n\n?\n\nJim Crow ain't never flown with this much wingspan Eagles running for safety now. For the reach is deep & southern & midwest shadows the east lands in the west\n\nTexas-you will always be Mexico in denial.\n\nPoet Ron Allen asked for his body back in 1996 and we are still waiting.\n\nWe want our bodies back We want our bodies back We want our bodies back We want them returned to mothers without blood without brains exposed without humiliation without bruises without glass without fire\n\nwe want our bodies back\n\nwe want our cities back we want our culture back we want our land back our streets back our freedom our justice we want our bodies back we want our bodies back we want them wrapped in white silk we want them paraded around the white house. we want those flags you stand up for at baseball games at half mast we want national holidays to honor our bodies, our knees, our prayers, our ears, our genitals, our eyes, our fingers, our feet.\n\nwe want 21-gun salutes when we enter a damn room\n\nwe want our bodies back\n\nwe want them anointed in oils we want them worn around your neck we want them remembered we want them worshipped on sunday. we want our magic you try to bottle we want our essence you attempt to steal we want our elegance our sex our walk our cool our recipes our intelligence our science our stars our history\n\nI want my Moroccan nose I want my holy water breasts I want my Maasai legs/I want my alien arms I want my ivory coast mouth/I want our breath back I want our time back/I want your foot off our girls' backs\n\nI want all your badges back\n\nI want you to evaporate into dust like swatted moths\n\ndon't cut me down from the noose let my legs dangle for the devil what a spectacular magic show\n\nWhy you turn the cameras off?

Thank you.\n\nREV . OTIS MOSS III : Greetings on behalf of the family, the village of Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago, Illinois. To you, Dr. Shabazz, and your entire family, we say thank you. Thank you for holding, in a sacred way, the legacy of your mother and of your father. We at Trinity United Church of Christ, where we are unashamedly Black, we lift up the incredible work and witness of your family. So we offer this prayer for this celebration and for this commemoration, and may we go at this moment to God in prayer.\n\nGracious and most merciful God, in whom we live, move and have our being, we are grateful for our ancestor. We are grateful for the legacy. We are grateful for the liberation teaching of our beloved brother, Malcolm X, and our beloved sister, Betty Shabazz. We ask at this moment that your spirit will rest heavy, that the spirit of liberation will move forth from our hearts, that we'll be able to teach generations that are yet to be born not only to stand together at the intersection, but also recognize that each and every one of us have the imprint of the sacred upon us, and that we may gather together to transform not only this community that we occupy, but the entire diaspora. We are grateful, and may you bless the work of the Shabazz Center, and may we gather hand in hand to do the work of liberation, as you have placed in our hearts. We thank you. We honor you this day, and we gather in celebration. May we get into some holy mischief together, so that we may see change and transformation in this world. We offer this prayer this day. And the people of God who love God may say, \"Amen.\" Thank you, and God bless you.\n\nMARC LAMONT HILL : Now, that was a prayer right there. I always love when people of faith want to use their faith to help us get free. That was the Reverend Otis Moss III , pastor of Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago and a dynamic young voice for community empowerment and social justice activism.\n\nNow, a great deal of Dr. Ilyasah's work developing intergenerational leadership involves speaking to, really, scores of educational institutions around the country. In fact, several of them are turned - are tuned in right now watching this program. The Hotchkiss School, Choate Rosemary Hall and the Omaha, Nebraska, Hall of Fame are tuned in right now. Show them some love, please.\n\nNow, we also have a - I mean, there's a bunch of amazing people in the audience, but among them are folks from Historic Hampton House. Y'all saw the movie One Night in Miami ? Y'all know what I'm talking about? Yes, and we also have a delegation from the Taft School. Show them some love, too. Ah, I see where y'all at. OK. So, right now, to share her own reflections, because it's so important we hear from this voice, we have a Taft senior leader. Her name is Ana Coyanda-Parkzes. Please bring her up and give her a round of applause. Ah, she right there.\n\nANA COYANDA - PARKZES : Thank you. Thank you so much for that introduction. And before I get started, I just want to say thank you on behalf of all of my classmates sitting in the back right there. We are all so excited to be here tonight and so grateful.\n\nSo, as just stated, my name is Ana, and I want to start off with a question for you all. How many of you - just raise your hands - have heard of the name David George? Oh, OK, let's try again. How about Thomas Peters? Just go ahead, raise your hands. Ever heard of him? OK, how about Paul Revere? OK, OK. Just checking if everyone's awake. OK, we're here. Everyone knows who Paul Revere is. All right. But how about Harry Washington? Harry Washington? Oh, OK, some know who Harry Washington is. OK, good. Good. So, don't forget these names. Don't forget these names I'm telling you right now. I'm going to quiz you on them later. All right? All right.\n\nSo, I want to be here tonight to talk about the African diaspora. \"Diaspora,\" that's an interesting word. So, let's break it down. The word \"diaspora\" is derived from the Greek term diaspeiro , which means scattered or spread about. So, when we think of the African diaspora, what does that look like? Well, let's take a look around this room. How many of you in here were born in an African country? Raise your hand. OK, OK, I see a couple of hands up raised. OK, awesome. Now you can put your hands down. Now, how many of you are second-generation African Americans, so your parents were born in Africa, but you were born in the States? So, that's me. I'm going to raise my hand. All right. How many of you have ancestry in the Caribbean? Oh, a lot of them. OK, a lot of the Caribbean representation. And how many of you have parents or uncles or brothers or sisters who were all born in the U.S., and you're African American and were also born in the U.S.? Go ahead, raise your hands. A lot of hands. All right. All right.\n\nSo, what am I looking for here when I'm asking you to raise your hands? I'm looking for representation, because as you raise those hands, you represent a different product of the African diaspora. And I ask various questions, because the African diaspora is a collection of people from various backgrounds who all share African ancestry. They are African people scattered. And that truly is who we are, is it not?\n\nLearning our African history under an American system is important, because it teaches us everything we were told to forget. It washes away every cultural insecurity and makes way for new and unfamiliar, but deserved, sense of pride and confidence. Learning our history leads us to the legacies of our ancestors. And because history repeats itself, what better way to arm ourselves for the future than with the knowledge of those who did it first?\n\nTonight, we're here because we are honoring the legacy of Malcolm X, a man who spoke of Africa as if it were gold rolling off of his tongue. He spoke of us as the land that birthed humanity. He spoke of us, the African diaspora, as the beginning, the center, the heart.\n\nRight now I want every single person here to put their hand on their heart. Go ahead, right here. There we go. Right now I want everyone to do this, because in this moment you are all claiming the African diaspora as the tribe you belong to. You are claiming the history that brings us all here together.\n\nHistory is written by the victors. And what follows that skewed recollection of events is lies or half-truths, half-truths that were designed to separate us from success and achievement. We are taught that our history begins with oppression to hold us hostage to those racist institutions in a world of modern resources. And when our ancestors do succeed, their victories are banned from our textbooks. It is why we fail to recognize the name Harry Washington but can draft an entire essay on George Washington. So, to combat those years of commitment to keeping us silent, we, as a new generation, as a variety of generations all in here tonight, must share the stories of how we got here, so that we can uncover the victories that history wants us to forget. We must uncover the stories that could suffocate the residue of colonization lingering in our textbooks that start the Africa chapter with the transatlantic slave trade, because those stories, they're ours. And by sharing those stories, we transform ourselves from a national minority into a global majority.\n\nSo, now I want to ask again. How many people remember when I talked about David George and Thomas Peters? Yeah? OK, good. I'm proud. So, in the late 1700s, a British man named John Murray, who was the earl of Dunmore and governor of Virginia, issued a proclamation to all enslaved African people in American colonies. We recognize that as Lord Dunmore's Proclamation, which promised that any enslaved person who chose to fight for the British side would be gifted freedom. It is in our history textbooks, because it is one of the most impactful statements in American history - and because John Murray is a white person, so, naturally, anything that comes out of his mouth will be documented. It is how my great-great-great-grandmother Iris Jones could travel to Nova Scotia, and eventually back to Sierra Leone, where she could get married and continue her family line, so that I have the blessing of knowing my African heritage.\n\nIt is also how David George, an enslaved African American born in Virginia, could also escape to Nova Scotia, and eventually Sierra Leone, where he founded the First Baptist Church in the colony, how he could found the first Black congregation in the United States, or how Thomas Peters, a man who was born in West Africa and captured to be brought to the U.S., could become a founder of this new colony that would become the nation of Sierra Leone, how he could escape from New York to join the Black Pioneers, migrate to Nova Scotia, and then eventually to West Africa. Here, they were given land and opportunity. Here, they named that land Freetown, the modern capital of Sierra Leone and the town where my father was born. Here, Thomas Peters became the founding - one of the founding fathers of an entire country. Here, our ancestors won. They escaped for their freedom and built a country in retaliation to the life they were nearly forced to live.\n\nWe have stories to tell because our ancestors could not. We have cousins across oceans that we may never know about, because what we believe, what is in our textbooks, about our divisions as Black people. We are an African diaspora across continents. And our story is connected in every downfall and epiphany and side quest, whether we are quizzed on it in class or not. We need to stop wasting our time by pretending that only if our kitchen smells of jollof rice have to love rice, or if our last names are hard to pronounce, or if we know which country we belong to, that we can consider ourselves African. We are an African diaspora. We are Africa scattered.\n\nSo, now you all know me as Ana, but what I'll share with you tonight is my middle name. It is Olufunmilayo. It means \"God has blessed us.\" But I learned this meaning in elementary school after I told my mother that I had been bullied for it. I come from a small, predominantly white town in Connecticut, where our African diaspora is scarcely represented. And as a child, I grew up hating the parts of me that I am telling you all to love here tonight. So I share this with you now to show you what growth looks like.\n\nWhat is important now is that we acknowledge each other as kinfolk, as members of the same tribe. What is important now is that we claim who we are. So, as we go forward from tonight, asking ourselves, \"How do we improve our connectivity as a society?\" remember what you've heard from me tonight, because while this is not new information, it still needs to be repeated.\n\nSo, now I'm going to ask you again: How many people in here know of a man named David George? All right, everyone was listening! Awesome. You see, I told you I'd quiz you. How many know of Thomas Peters? There we go. Good.\n\nNow everyone put your hand on your heart again, because I'm leaving you all with a challenge. I challenge you to claim your role as a member of the African diaspora. And with those hands, I challenge you to pledge that you will liberate yourself from the colonized perception of our African identity, so that we can be independent and united in our African ancestry. Thank you so much for allowing me to be here tonight.\n\nMARC LAMONT HILL : All right, family, it is now time for the Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Vanguard Awards. These are important awards. The Shabazz family initiated the awards about 15 years ago. They wanted to recognize individuals in their line of work who embodied the qualities of excellence and who were trying and working and doing the work of uplifting humanity.\n\nAnd so, the first person we want to give an award to, I'm very excited about this person, because this is my friend. They're all my friends, but I - and comrades and sisters and brothers, but this is one of the most amazing people. Our first awardee is the host of the weeknight show The ReidOut on MSNBC , holding people accountable. They be trying to talk their way out the debate. She's like, \"No, no, no, no, no, no, no.\" Once she pull out this paper and start looking at her notes, it's a wrap. You might as well just...\n\nBorn in Brooklyn of Congolese and Guyanese parents, she graduated from Harvard University. You heard that, Tucker Carlson? She graduated from Harvard University - he's still mad about that - paying her own bills and tuition to get through. She was a talk radio co-host on Radio One in Florida. She was managing editor of The Griot , a political columnist for the Miami Herald and the editor of her political blog, The Reid Report . After several host positions at MSNBC , she was selected to her current weeknight 7 p.m. time slot. If y'all didn't know that, y'all better know that. Every day 7 p.m., watch it, DVR it. Do what you got to do, because we got to keep people like her on the air, making her cable's first Black woman primetime anchor. It is with tremendous pleasure that we bestow the Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Vanguard Award to Joy-Ann Reid!\n\nJOY - ANN REID : Thank you.\n\nILYASAH SHABAZZ : Let's come over here.\n\nJOY REID : Thank you. Thank you. Wow, this is such an honor. Hello, everyone. Good evening. Well, this is a tremendous honor. I want to thank the Shabazz Center. It's just - it's a complete honor, particularly on this day in this space. It's such an honor to be here. It's an honor to at any time be in the same space as Ms. Angela Davis. It's just a bit overwhelming to be in the same space with you. And I also want to thank Marc, my friend. Thank you for the wonderful introduction. Thank you, Dr. Ilyasah Shabazz and all of the sisters, the wonderful family, the Shabazz family. You are all wonderful, and I'm just honored to be in your presence. Thank you for allowing me to be here. My friends are here. Adrienne is here. This is my brother. Ben Crump and I go back, way, way back, to Florida. We have fought many a battle. He fights the battles; I just talk about them on TV or on the radio. I'll say this very quickly. I don't want to be long.\n\nYou know, one of the things that I have learned in my very long career - I won't say how long - career in media, is that literally the most powerful and dangerous thing in the world is love. It's the most powerful thing in the world. And I can prove it to you. I'm going to prove it to you. The proof that love is the most powerful thing is that people are expending tremendous energy right now trying to force people who look like me, people in the diaspora, to despise ourselves and love our enslavers, to love the people who created slavery and to despise ourselves. And this is literally their top political priority, more than healthcare or making sure that people can eat and afford their rent. Their number one priority is making sure that communities who have been disparately impacted negatively by economics, etc., despise ourselves and love those who created oppression against us.\n\nAnd the thing that I've always loved, that my mom loved, my mom loved Malcolm X, because she said, \"That's a man.\" That's one thing she loved. \"But that's a man who loved us.\" And the thing that he did that made him so dangerous is that he would not stop, no matter what the threat was, no matter who demanded. He would never stop loving us and insisting that we were lovable, that our history was more than enslavement, that we were something to love, that Africa was not something to be ashamed of, but something to love. And the fierceness - my favorite photos are the photos of him with his daughters. His love for his children, for his wife, for Dr. Betty, was so transcendent that when he was taken from his children and from his wife at not even 40 years of age, that love was so strong that Dr. Betty took it forward to build this, and built this out of love, love for her family, for her husband's legacy, and for us.\n\nSo, what I just want to charge all of you with is, never let anyone cause you to despise your history. The history of enslavement was people who, despite being told to despise themselves and love their so-called masters, continued to love themselves, their children, to love their dance that they brought from Africa, to love the food that they brought from where they were taken and snatched from, to love the style that they continued to have. The most dressed-up, fabulous, wonderful people that you see in the early 20th century are Black people. That is Black people carrying formality and style and fierceness and poetry and music into the future that they weren't supposed to have. So, never let go of the one thing that they cannot take from you, even if they kill you. And that is love. God bless you all. Thank you very much.\n\nMARC LAMONT HILL : Every night at seven, I'm trying to tell you, the doors at a church are open.\n\nOur next awardee, now, this is a another brilliant, brilliant, brilliant sister. Her name is Tamara Payne. Give her a round of applause. She served as the principal researcher and the co-author on The Dead Are Rising: The Life of Malcolm X . If you haven't picked that book up, you absolutely need to pick the book up. A lot of us call ourselves Malcolm X scholars. You can't be a Malcolm X scholar without reading this text. Her father, the noted investigative journalist Les Payne, worked on the book for 28 years. Twenty-eight years, that's careful work. And she had the honor of completing this work, their work, after his passing in 2018. In the book, the Paynes explore deeper truths about Brother Malcolm's assassination, which helped to cause the reopening of an investigation into the case by the Manhattan district attorney. The book won the Pulitzer Prize in biography, the National Book Award for Nonfiction and, most importantly, an NAACP - celebrate the Black stuff - Image Award for Outstanding Literary Work. We are honored to present the Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Vanguard Award to Tamara Payne.\n\nILYASAH SHABAZZ : Come on over here and get your award first.\n\nTAMARA PAYNE : Thank you. My goodness, this is an honor to be here tonight in the presence of the family of Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz. My friend and Dr. Ilyasah Shabazz, Gamilah, Malaak, my father loved - had so much love and respect for you guys. He really did. I'll try to make this short. I also want to say I'm honored here to be here in front of Dr. Angela Davis, who my father had a wonderful interview with you at Abyssinian, and I have a gift for you. So, thank you for that interview.\n\nAnd thank you, family, for honoring me, this work with my father. It was a labor of love of my dad. And I don't mean that in a pejorative sense; I mean this in a passionate love in family. I am here also with my family, my mother and my brother, Jamal, my mother Violet. I have to say that when we do any of this work, none of this is done alone. Even when my dad was doing this, he had me and us. And after he was gone, it was me and my family. So, we were able to get this published, because it was so important. We worked so hard on this. And I also want to make a quick introduction to my uncle Ray, who is my father's baby brother, who is also here in the audience and could be with us today. So, thank you.\n\nIt is an honor tonight to be in the presence of everybody here in this room. My father used to come, too, and he used to bring me also to this ship, to the Shabazz Center, often while we were working on this work. He used to get the energy. He used to love to commune with the community. But also it was a way of showing support to the family. He really, really had love and respect for you guys. And he always wanted to make sure that he, in his work, could do right by you guys and supporting you.\n\nHe did not want to write a book about Malcolm, because he felt we had everything we needed to know. He wanted - as a journalist, he wanted to find something new, and he found that after he had discussions with Malcolm's brothers Wilfred and Filbert Little. And what he learned was that there is a story of Malcolm in his family as a child, of one of several children of Earl and Louise Little. And what we learn is, you know, what it was like to be in the family, who was - Earl and Louise were organizers for the Marcus Garvey and the United Negro Improvement Association. And this organization, as we found in our work, was also - influenced and impacted the Nation of Islam, the Moorish Science Temple and so many other organizations, and that that was one of the wonderful things of finding out this, just how this work that Marcus Garvey was doing, how he's so important to all of us, and continues to be, and also how it's a community.\n\nMy father was - just he wanted something new, and that's where he started. He wanted to put Malcolm in the context of his family and the world he navigated. So that meant looking at Marcus Garvey and the UNIA . It also meant looking at the history of lynching, the history of slavery, the impact of the Jim Crow South and Reconstruction, and how we come out - how we came out of that. And then what - also uncovering other stories along the way.\n\nAnd I hope, if you haven't read our book, that you will - we will be selling it in the downstairs after the program - and read more about some of the other events that we have uncovered that were important in Malcolm's life, and also to our understanding of ourselves. Malcolm wanted us to love ourselves and know who we were and where we came from in our history, but he also was very strategic about us knowing where we were going and how we were going to be - how we were going to get there. And he wanted us to be able to - for example, when he talked about self-defense, he also gave us the language to make sure that we did not accept the language that people like to throw on us, that violence, that we were using violence to defend ourselves. But he said, \"We have every right as human beings in demanding that we recognize our human rights, and that everybody else recognize our human rights.\" And starting with that, that's where our work continues to be. We are in that point right now, and we're just now catching up with Malcolm on that.\n\nAnd so, where he would be right now, I don't know. But I do know, as journalists, we wanted to find out what happened and what we could uncover. And I feel that this information that we found was very important in helping us understand what happened to Malcolm and what happened to us.\n\nSo, I am very honored to receive this on behalf of my father and myself and the work that we did. He was very passionate in telling the story. There's very beautiful writing in this, and I really fought hard to make sure that his voice was preserved in this. And it is an honor to have been able to work with my father, practice his craft of journalism and handed down to me over these 30 years. And the work continues. I am honored to receive this award and honoring the legacy of Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz. Thank you.\n\nMARC LAMONT HILL : The death of her son, Eric Garner, in 2014 at the hands of the NYPD , it launched Gwen Carr into action. His final words, \"I can't breathe,\" became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement, the Movement for Black Lives, and police reform - and further - across the country. After retiring from a career with the MTA in 2015, Ms. Carr has devoted her life to activism. She is a member of Mothers of the Movement and has testified before the House Judiciary Committee of the U.S. Congress. She was a consoling voice to the family of George Floyd, whose last words were also \"I can't breathe.\" Tonight, we present the Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Vanguard Award to Gwen Carr.\n\nANN - MARIE WEATHERS : Unfortunately, Mrs. Gwen Carr was not able to be here tonight. As you know, her work is tireless and endless. So, we accept this on her behalf.\n\nMARC LAMONT HILL : For 27 years, the progressive news broadcast Democracy Now! has produced fearless - and I really do mean fearless - independent, grassroots political journalism on a global scale. It brings us the stories and voices that are regularly excluded from mainstream media. The show's host and executive producer, Amy Goodman, has won numerous journalism awards. She's the author of six New York Times best-sellers. She also has a weekly syndicated column, which is also now a podcast. From the ordinary people standing up to establishment power, to the movements of leaders reshaping our world, we know about them because of her brilliance. And I got to just say this. There is a lot of spaces that say that they cover our issues, but very few really cover our issues in the way and on the terms they need to be covered. And some of us, when we're catching hell, her program is the only platform that has given us voice. So, please, please - we are thrilled to present the Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Vanguard Award to Amy Goodman!\n\nILYASAH SHABAZZ : I love this woman.\n\nMALAAK SHABAZZ : Wait a minute. So do I. I watch the show. Democracy Now! I watch Democracy Now! every day. You kidding me? She does Democracy Now! Watch the show.\n\nILYASAH SHABAZZ : Congratulations.\n\nMALAAK SHABAZZ : Excuse me. Wow! I watch your show every day.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, wow right back at you. What an honor it is to be here today, as I sat here looking at the Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center, MEC , the Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Mecca. That's what we come to here in Harlem, this sanctuary of dissent.\n\nIt is both astounding, both horrific to think about what happened here 58 years ago, to be with the daughters and family of Malcolm X, who were here at that time. And yet what has been built from that moment. You talked about Yuri Kochiyama's granddaughter being here. We flew to the Oakland area to sit with Yuri in her room as she showed us postcards from Malcolm, as she talked about what it meant for her to be right here 58 years ago, to be able to have a sanctuary of dissent, which is what all the media should be. That's what will save this country. That's what will save the world.\n\nIt is our job in the media to go to where the silence is. And you know, so often it is not quiet. It is raucous. It is Malcolm X speaking on a corner. It is people organizing at every level, but it doesn't quite hit the corporate media radar screen. But the fact of the matter is that those, like Malcolm X, who cared about global justice, about racial justice, those of us in the world who care about economic justice, environmental justice, gender justice, are not a fringe minority, not even a silent majority, but the silenced majority, silenced by the corporate media, which is why we have to take the media back\n\nYou know, the other day, after yet another young man was gunned down by police, we were going to talk to Ben Crump on television, on Democracy Now! But we saw he was on CNN , and we thought, \"OK, this isn't going to happen.\" But not only didn't it - did it happen, but he took the computer and set it right down so that we would talk to him as he shared the screen with Tyre's parents, and his mom said, \"Remember this beautiful soul.\" She couldn't believe she was saying the words, \"Remember,\" her young man, a young father. It is so important we provide a forum for people to speak for themselves, only telling their stories when they can no longer do it or if they're in jeopardy if they do so.\n\nWhat an honor it is to be here with all of you. You know, Democracy Now! comes out of Pacifica Radio, which was founded after World War II by a war resister who said, \"There's got to be a media outlet that's not run by corporations that profit from war, but run by journalists and artists.\" As George Gerbner, the late dean of the Annenberg School of Communication, said, \"not run by corporations that have nothing to tell and everything to sell, that are raising our children today.\" And so, Pacifica was born, the wonderful, beloved, precious WBAI here in New York; in the Bay Area, KPFA ; KPFK in Los Angeles; WPFW in Washington; and KPFT in Houston.\n\n1970, that station, in the Petro Metro, in Houston, KPFT , went on the air. Within a few weeks. It was blown to smithereens by the Ku Klux Klan. They strapped dynamite to the base of the transmitter. When they got back on their feet a few weeks later, rebuilt the transmitter, the Klan strapped 15 times the dynamite to the base of the transmitter and blew it up again, in the middle of Arlo Guthrie singing \"Alice's Restaurant,\" which I actually think is a good song. But months later, they get back on their feet again, January 1971. Arlo comes back to finish his song. All the media is there. And it never went off the air again, mainly.\n\nI can't remember if it was the grand dragon or the exalted cyclops, because I often confuse their titles, but he said it was his proudest act. And I think that's because he understood how dangerous Pacifica is, how dangerous independent media is, how dangerous a place like the Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Media and Education Center is, dangerous because when you hear people speaking from their own experiences, whether it's a teenage girl at standing rock, or whether it is a young man in the oil fields of Nigeria taking on the multinational corporations that are pulling power from his country and disempowering so many there, whether it is a child in Palestine or an aunt in Afghanistan, when they speak, you may say, \"That sounds like my mother, my aunt, my baba.\" You may say, \"It sounds like my uncle, who I can't stand.\" But when you hear someone speaking from their own experience, it breaks down the bigotry and the caricatures that fuel the hate groups. It makes it much less likely that you'll want to destroy them. I think the media can be the greatest force for peace on Earth. Instead, all too often it is wielded as a weapon of war. And that's why we have to take the media back.\n\nI just want to end by saying, when Bernard White and I did Wake-Up Call on WBAI in the morning, each memorial of Malcolm X on this day each year, or on his birthday, on May 19th, we would play the speeches of Malcolm, and we would call Dr. Betty Shabazz. And I remember one morning we said, \"We're so sorry. We hope we're not waking you up.\" And she said, \"What are you talking about? Malcolm's words are echoing throughout the house, because I'm blaring, I'm blasting WBAI right now.\" Let's keep multiplying that.\n\nYou know, I see the media as a huge kitchen table that stretches across the globe, where we all debate and discuss the most important issues of the day - war and peace, life and death. And anything less than that is a disservice to a democratic society. It is critical that we expand the media, that we break the sound barrier. Democracy now!\n\nILYASAH SHABAZZ : And now I'd like to introduce you to my business partner and friend. We've worked together to develop an education curriculum to provide transformational tools that will facilitate individual, communal and societal healing and liberation. It is our wish that each student would not only see their life as a continuation of Malcolm's work and legacy, but that he and she will also commit to creating a more just and equitable society. Ladies and gentlemen, help me welcome Brother Assad Koshul to the stage.\n\nASSAD KOSHUL : Thank you. A'oodhu Billahi min al-Shaytan ir-rajeem. Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Rabbi Sharli Sadri wa yassirli amri wahlul uqdatan mil-lisaani yafqahu qawli. Inshallah , it's an honor to be here.

Get it on Google Play, download on the Apple Store.\n\nASSAD KOSHUL : So, again, it's an honor to be here, and it's an overwhelmingly, humbling experience to be here. So we will just - we are timeboxed. We're down to four minutes and 55 seconds. So we will do one lesson. This is lesson number four of a body of knowledge of more than 200 lessons.\n\nThis is the overview. Malcolm X was living with his foster parents, Gohannases. And Malcolm's mother admonished him, \"Do not eat pork.\" Malcolm went fishing and hunting with the Gohannases, Mr. Gohannas. And Malcolm observes that when a rabbit escapes the hunting dog, the rabbit runs in a pattern. This is what Malcolm observes. This is page 20 and 21, a direct lift from The Autobiography . We do the overview.\n\nThen we ask probing questions every single lesson. Who are the characters? And what are the themes? There's a theme sheet with 31 themes, which I'll display. Just due to time constraint, I didn't put it up first. Then we ask these questions of the participant. What does Malcolm's attachment to nature heighten - how does Malcolm's attachment to nature heighten his observation power? How do rabbits escape a hunting dog, and what pattern do they follow? What strategy does Malcolm arrive at to be a better hunter of rabbits? Keep in mind, he's a foster child. He's not even in high school yet. He's been ripped away from his parents. Well, his father's been murdered, and he's been ripped away from his mother and his family.\n\nSo, then we give some of the themes. Malcolm learned a lot being in nature, and he developed a strategy. And he says - this is a direct lift from the book. He learned that - improve on a strategy. Anytime you find someone more successful than you are, then you're both engaged in the same business, you know they're doing something you're not. So here he is a foster child, away from his parents, in nature, observing hunting rabbits. And he is developing skills of pattern recognition. Now, that is greatness. He is developing skills. Where other people see disjointed events, he's seeing patterns. He's not seeing complexity.\n\nSo, the human right theme. Everyone is capable of learning if the learning environment is stimulated with identifiable strategies. So, then, what we do - and I'm moving through this very quickly - we bring up the theme sheet. We have the four main runways: belief, self, family and society. And underneath them, we have 31 different themes. And as part of the proper instructional design, we ask the learner: What themes do you see? In this, the two main themes are character evolution and leadership. Malcolm is developing his intellectual capacity and leadership skills beginning even at this age. So we want the learner not to just describe the event to us. We want the learner to peel back the layers and say, \"What of these themes do I see?\" For example, we have 20 lessons on husband-wife relations. You want to be a better husband? You can learn it from Malcolm. So, the curriculum is, alhamdulillah , very vast.\n\nThen we bring up the theme sheet. And in this, the one human rights theme is the ideal linkage of an active citizenry. Then, we do situational analysis on all of the lessons. I'm down to 90 seconds. What happened? Malcolm went hunting with his foster father. He improved the hunting strategy of the group. He observed the hunting strategy being used and strategically positioned himself to do better. He saw that the rabbit will run in a circle. So he positioned himself at 80% of the circle. Whereas the foster father and his hunting buddies were positioning themselves at the rabbit's hole. So he got the rabbit before he went back to the hole. That's what he did. That's how smart he was, as a young teen - he was not even a teenager yet.\n\nWhy is it important? He improved upon an existing strategy. He understood how if someone is consistently better than you at something, you know they're doing something you aren't. And why is it unique? From a young age, Malcolm was encouraged by his mother to observe lessons in nature, to understand patterns and strategy that would benefit his life's journey.\n\nThen we go into character. You know, how is identity highlighted in this lesson? How is confidence highlighted in this lesson? This is all for all 200 lessons. Then we have these reflective questions. I'll leave them here. The first two are not relevant to this lesson, but these are the seven standard reflective questions on all lessons.\n\nSo, this is the curriculum. It's completely done. The only thing is the Google Android is - oops, OK, that's the timer. OK, shallah . OK, I'm not going to disrespect the audience. It was an honor to be here. Inshallah , we'll talk some other time. As-salamu alaykum .\n\nMARC LAMONT HILL : Sorry, I'm working two jobs right now. But this is - this is 10-month-old Malcolm, my son. It's his first commemoration. And he is going to help me give the next Vanguard Award to another wonderful brother. This award recipient specializes in civil rights and catastrophic personal injury cases, including wrongful death suits. He has represented the families of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, Tyre Nichols. For those outside of the spotlight, his firm also advocates for people affected by the Flint water crisis, plaintiffs in the Johnson & Johnson baby powder lawsuit, and the heirs of Henrietta Lacks, whose immortal cells continue to be used in medical research without her knowledge, permission or compensation.\n\nA whole lot of people think to get a law degree means to get rich and to make a whole lot of money and to be all in the videos, but, no, not this brother. He understood that the more you have, the greater your duty is to your people. And he has used every - you can't eat it, though, buddy. The more - and he has worked hard to fight for our liberation and to fight for freedom and to fight for justice and to make these names and these voices heard, not so that we can prosecute people who kill us, but so that we can get to a world where we are no longer victims of violence and subjected to premature death. Give it up for this year's Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Vanguard Award winner to the trial lawyer for justice attorney Benjamin Crump. I love you, buddy.\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : I love you, too, man.\n\nILYASAH SHABAZZ : I got so excited! Where's my sisters? Come on, girls. Come on. You have to move a little faster.\n\nMALAAK SHABAZZ : I have arthritis.\n\nILYASAH SHABAZZ : I know, sweetie. I know.\n\nMALAAK SHABAZZ : I have arthritis.\n\nILYASAH SHABAZZ : Malaak [inaudible] had a little accident.\n\nMALAAK SHABAZZ : Yeah, I'm having - I'm in recovery.\n\nILYASAH SHABAZZ : LeAsah, you should be up here, too. OK.\n\nMALAAK SHABAZZ : I have arthritis.\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : Thank you, Malaak.\n\nI know we've heard a lot of keynote speeches tonight, and we only really want to hear from the queen, Angela Davis. And I'm humbled, Ms. Davis, because as a first-year law student, I read the trial of California v. Angela Davis . Yeah. And the best opening argument ever presented, better than any other attorney that I have ever had the pleasure to study, was the opening argument by you, Angela Davis, in defense of yourself. And I applaud you. We can never, ever thank you for being an example for this generation that followed you. And as I stand on this hallowed ground, I thank the Shabazz Center and the daughters and family of Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz.\n\nI accept this award as greater motivation to wake up every day and go in courtrooms all across America and fight against the legalized genocide of colored people. And that's why we have to continue to fight them every time. I mean, for every George Floyd, there is a hundred Black men and Black women, Amy Goodman, who nobody says their name, but we have to fight for them, just like they were Tyre Nichols, just like they were Breonna Taylor, just like they were Trayvon Martin, just like they were Eric Garner, just like they were Tamir Rice, just like they were Sandra Bland, just like they were Pamela Turner, and all those other names that we have come to know. But all of our people matter. Each and every one of them matter! Each and every one of them matter.\n\nAnd I often think, Ilyasah and Malaak, Qubilah, I think, \"What would have come of Malcolm, had they not, 58 years ago, on this day, assassinated one of the greatest thought leaders that was ever produced in the 21st century?\" How much more Malcolm had to give the world? And I often think about that, Dr. Davis, when I think about Trayvon: What would have come of 17-year-old Trayvon, had he not been shot in the heart by some wannabe cop? What would have become, Marc, Breonna Taylor, this queen who was just two semesters from getting her college degree, being a nurse, but she was executed with nine bullets in her home while she was practically naked? What would have become of Botham Jean, young Black man who was in his own apartment, minding his own business, when this white policewoman came and shot him while he was eating ice cream and watching TV? And then she had the audacity to say, Gina, \"Self-defense. It was self-defense.\" But, Tamara, it wasn't her house. It was Botham's house. And so, we have to continue to stand up, speak up and fight for our children and our loved ones, because if we don't fight for our children and our loved ones, we can't expect nobody else to fight for our children and loved ones.\n\nAnd finally, finally, I think about the Shabazz Center and the objectives of trying to make sure we educate the future generations with the history that has been contributed, Rob, by our ancestors. And I am ever reminded - ever reminded - that we have to fight racism and discrimination, Dominique, wherever it rears its ugly head. And so, you know, all of those high-profile police cases we fight, there are other battles that are just as important, whether it's medical racism with Henrietta Lacks, whether it's the $100 million lawsuit filed on behalf of Malcolm X's daughters, because we can never let them think that we will forget about Malcolm X. We will continue to fight every day.\n\nAnd we have to fight those who would try to rob our children and all children of learning about Black history, like our governor in Florida, Ron DeSantis, who is trying to prohibit the teaching of Advanced Placement African American studies. And so, I am on record, Attorney O'Neill, if he does not capitulate and allow the teaching of Black history, we're going to sue him. We are going to sue him, because, as Dr. Carter G. Woodson said, also known as the \"father of Black history,\" if a race does not have a history, if it has no traditions that are respected and taught to the young people, then it becomes a negligible factor in the thought of the world and becomes in danger of being exterminated. And we refuse to let Governor DeSantis exterminate Black history in Florida. We refuse to let anybody exterminate Black history in any state in the United States of America, because Black history is American history. And not only do Black children need to know about Black history, but white children especially need to know about Black history. And so, we will fight, because our children need to know that our history made this country what it is today.\n\nMARC LAMONT HILL : Woo! Woo! Wow! You see why these people got these awards. These are brilliant people. But it's not just their words. It's their minds and their spirits. They're wonderful people. I want to remind us that not only is this space a tribute to the legacy of our dear brother Malcolm, it is also a testament to the commitment and hard work of his wife, Dr. Betty Shabazz. Here to pay tribute to Suster Betty is her friend and colleague from Medgar Evers College reading a selection from Apple Brown Betty . Here now is Dr. Safiya Bandele.\n\nSAFIYA BANDELE : Thank you, and greetings, greetings. And, Attorney Crump, you have my everlasting love, because some years ago at the United Nations, some Black women had brought - had talked about the case of all the Black women at some state had been murdered. Nobody cared about them. You said you cared, that when you had a press conference, people came. But the press conference for those 10 murdered Black women, nobody came. So I thank you for lifting that up.\n\nAnd I'm glad that we are in the house that Betty built, Malaak! This is the house that Betty built. And when we talk about, you know, erasure, we have to always make sure that she's front and center. So, yeah, I'm going to stay to my four-and-a-half minutes, Ilyasah. And I want to - and I want to start by recognizing my colleagues. You know, for 21 years, Betty was at Medgar Evers, and so we had an up-front, close personal relationship. I know for a fact that she loved me. I know for a fact that I loved her. And my colleagues, you know, we walked the halls, sat in meetings with her. So I just want to share a few recollections, and I'll ask them to stand when I'm done.\n\nMy friend, Thomas Oliver, says that \"Dr. Betty Shabazz served with me in the president's cabinet. We became great friends and colleagues and supported each other. Whenever she would be speaking at CBOs' fundraisers, and she and I would attend them, she might be on the dais, and she would say, 'There's one of my bosses at Medgar Evers College, Dean Thomas Oliver.'\" Of course, he was a dean, but he was not her boss. I don't think she had a boss at Medgar Evers, right?\n\nAnd then, Cheryl Williams says, \"Dr. Betty gave me practical money management advice, something my parents couldn't provide. I was a younger Medgar Evers College colleague who wasn't thinking about building a financial future. Her recommendations were numerous and invaluable. They provided me with a painless way to save. I credit Dr. Betty with my - in large part, with my having been in a position to buy a house, a Brooklyn brownstone at that.\"\n\nDoris Withers says that \"During the time Betty and I were on the president's cabinet, she consistently raised thousands of dollars every year for student scholarships and awards, which she then presented to them at the commencement ceremony.\"\n\nSo, we have lots of memories, and Ilyasah is preparing to do something with all of the Medgar memories. But I want to just read from this book, Apple Brown Betty . You can buy a used copy. Just Google it. Apple Brown Betty , poetry and prose from Medgar Evers college. And this was one of our brilliant scholars. She was the first holder of the Dr. Betty Shabazz distinguished professorship here. Her name is Andree-Nicola McLaughlin. And so, I want to read something of what she wrote about Medgar. She said:\n\nWhy did the Creator choose for us, at Medgar and in central Brooklyn, to know this woman, Betty Shabazz, to be in her company on a regular and protracted basis, to interact with the wife, the trusted soul mate, the compañera of the great Malcolm, who Betty often referred to as \"the brother\"? Did the Creator want us to know the resolute candor, the creative intellect, the parental devotion, the nurturing wisdom, the compelling humor, the steel will, and even the honest vulnerability of Dr. Betty Shabazz - in other words, the human side of greatness?\n\nDid the Creator put Dr. Shabazz here during the Medgar Evers years, during the time of flux and changes in leadership, for her to be a symbol of stability, staying the course and serving as the public manifestation of an enduring commitment to the education and possibilities of the Black working class, Malcolm's people? Maybe the Creator brought Dr. Shabazz to us for 21 years because Medgar provided the safety, the security and the peace of mind that she was to find there and in central Brooklyn.\n\nWas the Creator measuring the authenticity of our appetite for true understanding of ancient African civilization, the international power structure, African American history and culture, Black identity and spiritual development, about which Malcolm X taught and about which Dr. Betty Shabazz could elaborate his meaning? Or did the Creator intend for our predominantly female Black Medgar Evers College student body, many of whom are single mothers, to find inspiration in the example of Dr. Shabazz, who in the wake of tragedy found the strength to earn her bachelor's, master's - her bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees while raising not one, not two, but six daughters?\n\nAnd she was a frequent presence in the Center for Women's Development when we did Sister Circles. And the women were talking about the struggles and how difficult it was, and then she would speak up about - yes, she was in the circle of sisters, they were sharing - about being that. She was that kind of down-to-earth person.\n\nSo, yeah, we think that she was at Medgar because the Creator had a master plan. And she never surrendered her mantle. She was prevailing in the eye of the storm. She was the Dinah Washington song, \"Me and the One I Love.\" She was Langston Hughes' vision, \"I Dream a World.\" She was Alice Walker's collected stories, You Can't Keep a Good Woman Down . And throughout, she was Gwendolyn Brooks' poetic \"Sermon on the Warpland,\" which you know, which ends with \"Conduct your blooming in the noise and whip of the whirlwind.\" And that's what she did. And that's what we must do. Thank you.\n\nILYASAH SHABAZZ : That was beautiful. I wish I could call Sister Halima up here, but I know we don't have time for that, because I'm known to let - bring everybody up. But, wow, that was beautiful. Thank you so much, Dr. Safiya Bandele.\n\nWell, guess where we are on the program. We have finally arrived. First I'm going to acknowledge Dominique Sharpton, my sisters, and the other Sharpton sister over here, our godsister. I'm going to acknowledge Percy Sutton's granddaughter, our other sister in the house, Keisha Sutton. You know, he owned the Apollo, WBLS , Inner City Broadcasting. He was also my father's attorney. And, of course, we have here Ms. Gina Belafonte, Harry Belafonte's daughter. There was someone else. Oh, guess who else is here. In the Malcolm X movie, there was a brother who started off the chant, \"I am Malcolm X. I am Malcolm X,\" and his name was Nelson Mandela. And we have his appointed grandson here, Ndaba Mandela. OK, and who am I forgetting? And did you know that my baby sister Malaak is here? Oh!\n\nWell, here we are, you guys. Our keynote speaker is an American icon, a political activist, philosopher, academic and author. We love her so much. We were so honored when we knew she was coming. She is a professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and the author of 11 books on class, gender, race and the U.S. prison system. She's spoken truth to power for decades, defying state-sponsored attempts to surveil her, silence her, prosecute her and imprison her. She continues to put her pen to paper and her body on the line in the feminist, antiwar, Occupy and the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaigns. Thank you, young lady, for writing this script. In 2020 - because we love her, we wanted to tell you everything. She was listed as the 1971 Woman of the Year in Time magazine. Thank you, Isisara Bey, for writing this script. In Time magazine's 100 Women of the Year edition, which selected iconic women over the 100 years since women's suffrage in the United States, in 2020, she was included on _Time_'s list of the 100 most influential people in the world. More than that, we know and honor her as a courageous truth teller and revolutionary who has devoted her life to the people in more ways than we can ever know.\n\nIt is fitting that she will stand in this space where my father lost his life. And we are so grateful. It is even more fitting that she will stand in this space that my mother created. We can never fully repay you for all that you have done and continue to do. So let us stand now and celebrate this dynamic woman with the utmost love and New York respect. It is my privilege to bring to Dr. Angela Davis!\n\nMALAAK SHABAZZ : Really?\n\nGAMILAH SHABAZZ : I have goosebumps. I have goosebumps.\n\nMALAAK SHABAZZ : Yeah, but I want my own solo.\n\nGAMILAH SHABAZZ : OK.\n\nMALAAK SHABAZZ : I want my solo. OK.\n\nILYASAH SHABAZZ : Yes. OK, move down a little. OK.\n\nGAMILAH SHABAZZ : This?\n\nILYASAH SHABAZZ : Thank you. Oh my goodness. Everybody's so excited. We're all so excited. We're just happy.\n\nMALAAK SHABAZZ : Wait a minute.\n\nILYASAH SHABAZZ : Oh my goodness.\n\nMALAAK SHABAZZ : Got to get the -\n\nILYASAH SHABAZZ : OK.\n\nMALAAK SHABAZZ : Because I want a copy. Gotta get the locks up in there. Oh no, no, no. Just me and you. OK. Thank you.\n\nANGELA DAVIS : You know, I don't know about all of you, but I feel very full. I feel like we've already heard multiple keynotes this evening. But I do want to thank Dr. Ilyasah Shabazz and all of the sisters.\n\nMALAAK SHABAZZ : Malaak.\n\nANGELA DAVIS : And I thank all of you for coming out this evening. This has been an amazing evening. I don't think I will ever forget February 21st, 2023.\n\nNow, I was so moved when I received the invitation to participate in this tribute to our Black shining prince, as Ossie Davis called him in that unforgettable eulogy. Malcolm X, El-Hajj Malik Shabazz, was assassinated on this day 58 years ago in this very place, now the house that Betty built, the Malcolm X and Betty Shabazz Memorial Education Center, and, as Amy said, Mecca.\n\nOssie said the following in Malcolm's eulogy. \"Last year, from Africa, he wrote these words\" - Malcolm wrote these words - \"to a friend. 'My journey,' he says, 'is almost ended, and I have a much broader scope than when I started out, which I believe will add new life and dimension to our struggle for freedom and honor and dignity in the States. I am writing these things so that you will know for a fact the tremendous sympathy and support we have among the African States for our Human Rights struggle. The main thing,'\" he wrote, \"'is that we keep a United Front wherein our most valuable time and energy will not be wasted fighting each other.'\"\n\nMalcolm's words and his trajectory as a movement leader and a movement participant are as valuable today as they were six decades ago. They resonate in powerful ways, because the change Malcolm was calling for, the change we were calling for, has not yet happened. And therefore, Malcolm's vision cannot be relegated to the past. His vision still helps us to imagine the future we want to see.\n\nNow, official United States narratives of past history always attempt to assimilate demands for radical transformation into a neat story of progress and triumph. The very fact that Black freedom struggles came to be compressed and constricted by the rubric \"civil rights movement\" - and, of course, the civil rights movement was important, but that was not the entire story of the Black freedom movement. And that, in itself, is indicative of this assimilationist tendency, the fact that we ourselves often refer to the movement for Black freedom as only a civil rights movement.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Malcolm emphasized the need to expand our vision. He told us that it was not only about civil rights, the rights that can be accorded to individuals by a single nation-state and its government. Our vision needed to be broader. It had to move, Malcolm said, across the borders of nation-states. It had to be transnational. It had to be international. The framework that Malcolm urged us to use was human rights.\n\nNow, Malcolm's trajectory, and his insistence on radical frameworks, has never been easily assimilable into a narrative of U.S. history as one in which increasing numbers of people get to participate in the circle of justice, equality and freedom. And I'm thinking about the way in which Dr. King's image has been entirely assimilated into a capitalist narrative, which is not to say that Dr. King represented those ideas, but this is the official narrative, the official representation.\n\nNow, Malcolm's vision, from the very outset, or at least from the time he made the pilgrimage to Mecca, was an international vision, including not only people in the U.S. and not only Black people, but people all over the world. And I tell you that I treasure the story that was told to me by Yuri Kochiyama about hosting a meeting in her Harlem apartment, where Malcolm met with survivors of the bombing, the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima. And there's also a photograph of Yuri leaning over Malcolm's body in this place, shortly after he was assassinated. And I often wonder: Why is it that that photograph is not circulated more widely? You know, why didn't we see Yuri represented in Spike's film?\n\nWell, you know, today is one of the final days of Black History Month, right? We get to use the 28 or 29 days of February to meditate on Black history, maybe a little bit longer since we start with Dr. King's birthday. But there are those who say we should be engaged in those meditations 365 days of the year. But this is a time when we can reflect on what we should call the long struggle for freedom, the long struggle for freedom conducted by and on behalf of Black people in the Americas, the struggle against slavery, the struggle against segregation and secondhand citizenship, and, of course, the struggle of Africans against the slave trade and colonialism and neocolonialism. This is a time to reflect deeply on the long struggle for liberation that has already spanned multiple centuries. It is also a time to reflect on how we might accelerate that struggle in order to guarantee that those who have been denied entrance into the circle of freedom might not only be admitted, but by recognizing their struggles, their collective, multigenerational vision, it might be possible to imagine future worlds. And Malcolm asked us to keep our eyes on the future, future worlds, radical democratic futures for all beings who inhabit this planet.\n\nAnd so, in the spirit of Malcolm's contributions, I want us to ponder a couple of questions. How has it actually been possible for Black people and our allies, including in the first place Indigenous people - how has it been possible to remain committed over so many centuries, over so many generations, to the struggle for freedom? That is phenomenal, that each generation has passed on that impulse to fight for freedom to the next. And oftentimes, even when we thought the flames had been extinguished, we have a Black Lives Matter movement erupting.\n\nAnd so, I think that we should acknowledge the phenomenal quality of Black culture, Black political culture, Black music, because where have we learned to cultivate that impulse for freedom? I mean, that is - that is the reason why we observe Black history. You know, Black history is not just because there are Black people in various parts of the world. It's about what Black people have offered to people all over the world. And that is the desire, the cultivation of the desire to keep on struggling for freedom. It is in the art. It is the very heart of the music. And that is why Black music is known by people all over this planet.\n\nNow, there's also the question, which we have to acknowledge: Why is it that racism has persisted for so long? And why has it become so naturalized that its proponents often believe that what we refer to as racism is the natural destiny of the world? Now, Malcolm understood the deeply ideological character of racism. And I use the term \"ideology\" to mean the way that we humans imagine ourselves in relation to the conditions of our existence. Malcolm understood that ideology, even when you define it as the source of illusory ideas about such conditions, that ideology's role is precisely to make the conditions of our lives appear to be normal. And as a matter of fact, the more normal something appears to be, the more likely it is to be produced in and through ideology.\n\nThis is the point that abolitionists make about the seeming permanence of jails and prisons, about the permanence of police, about the so-called school resource officers, about the child protective - so-called Child Protective Services that Dorothy Roberts calls the family policing system. But thanks to the way in which Malcolm taught us to engage in the kind of radical reflection on that which is ideological, we know that we can envision life beyond prisons and police. We can envision life beyond capitalism.\n\nNow, Malcolm used his remarkable oratory and his phenomenal sense of humor to trouble our sense of comfort in a world that was predicated, that is predicated, remains predicated, on white superiority. Malcolm helped us to understand how we internalize those ideological assumptions, and how their persistence depends on all of us doing the work of prisons, the work of the police, the work of capitalism, white supremacy.\n\nNow, I had the opportunity to hear Malcolm in person. And as a matter of fact, one of the things I'm most proud about, connected to my time in college, was the fact that Malcolm came in April of 1963 to speak at Brandeis University, and because there was only a handful of Black students there, I got to meet him. I was - all of the Black students got to meet him and to spend time with him. But that's another story.\n\nYou know, I wanted to point out that there are - there are signs, there is evidence, that we can challenge that which is ideologically imposed. And I'm thinking about one area that we've seen a lot of change in over a relatively short period of time. And that is the demystification of the gender binary. Yes. I mean, who would have ever thought 20 years ago that we would be acknowledging, again, the ideological character of gender, that we would be attentive to pronouns? No, who would have ever imagined that? And I think it's important to recognize it not only in terms of the advances that the trans movement has made, but also is evidence that we can dismantle other institutions whose seeming permanence is also a product of ideology.\n\nAnd even as we develop the capacity to think about the damage wrought by racism, we often take shortcuts, and we capitulate to heteropatriarchal assumptions that the targets of racism are primarily Black men, or ethnocentric assumptions that racism affects exclusively Black people. Ron DeSantis - and, Ben, thank you for asking us to reflect on what is going on with that - don't let me characterize him, but -\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER : Go on. We're family. [inaudible]\n\nANGELA DAVIS : But I just heard him - well, OK, I'll tell you that I just heard him - I think it was yesterday, maybe it was the day before - making fun of the fact that queer theory was included under the rubric of the Black studies Advanced Placement course that you were talking about. And, you know, he's pretty stupid. You know, one of the things you learn - one of the things you learn, when you really try to engage in a serious process of learning, you learn that the more you learn, the less you know. You know, you learn all - you learn that there's always so much more to learn. And this governor, this - OK.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER : We're family. Come on.\n\nANGELA DAVIS : Absolutely, absolutely. So, but, you know - and what does he say? I guess he also - they also removed Kimberlé Crenshaw, so you're not allowed to talk about intersectionality. But I was just going to say that we have to think about the intersectionality of racism. You know, it's not just about identities.\n\nAnd because this is a historical moment, when we are called upon to comprehend the structural, the systemic, the institutional character of racism, and then - OK, I'm just going to call them counterrevolutionaries, right? Because it reminds me so much of the period of Radical Reconstruction and the responses to it, and following W. E. B. Du Bois, I'm just going to call them the counterrevolutionaries, because they are trying to prevent the progressive developments from transforming our lives. And all he can think about is wokeness. I mean, he doesn't even know what wokeness means. But he thinks that Black studies will cause white children to feel bad about themselves. I think he must be talking about himself.\n\nBut in any event, the reason we are witnessing these uproars right now, from DeSantis's strategies in Florida to the actions of the College Board, is that education is integrally related to social change. And this is something Malcolm taught us, both through his words and through his actions, you know, thanks to Malcolm's decision to teach himself in prison. Vast numbers of incarcerated people do the hard work of learning, often learning how to read, as Malcolm did, but certainly learning how to use their intellects. And as a matter of fact, there's probably more intellectual greatness behind bars now than in any other place.\n\nWe're on the verge of substantial shifts in the way people think about race and racism. And those who want to prevent these shifts from happening are frantically trying to turn back the clock. At least 36 states have adopted or introduced laws that impede educational projects about race and racism. And here in New York, at the end of 2021, Republican lawmakers introduced bills that prevent public schools from providing instruction on structural racism. Even in the most progressive states - and, you know, I come from California, and most of the times I'm happy to say that I come from California, because, well, first of all, I live in Oakland, and Oakland celebrates May 19th, Oakland and Berkeley. Malcolm X's birthday is an official holiday in both of those cities. But even in the most progressive states that we see efforts to restrict and confine instruction. California is also, I think, the only state with a statewide ethnic studies curriculum. But there have been major efforts, vociferous efforts, to prevent the inclusion of Palestine and Palestinians and Palestinian Americans in the curriculum.\n\nAmidst all of the pain and suffering produced by the COVID pandemic - and we're not that far removed from that era - this new collective awareness of the structural character of racism was generated. Not that it was a new way of thinking about racism. Scholars like W. E. B. Du Bois pointed this out scores of decades ago. Malcolm talked about institutional change. But the change, as many people have recognized over the decades, is one that involves not so much of a shift in subjective attitudes, although that's definitely welcome, but it's about structural transformation. It's not about white people not liking Black people or Indigenous people or Latinx people. And that will change if there is structural change. But we can treat racism as a character defect or a character flaw and leave the entire systematic structure of racism intact. You know, they talk about racism without the racists.\n\nBut in the spirit of all of the freedom movements, that I tried to evoke at the beginning of my presentation, all of the freedom movements that have preceded us, let us vow never to forget the summer of 2020. It was only two-and-a-half years ago, and we're already treating it like - yeah, like it's a relic of history. It was two-and-a-half years ago when we were deep in the throes of the worst crisis most of us can remember, and we collectively experienced the police lynching, the police murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor and all of the others that have been referred to. This occurred in the process of also recognizing that communities that were already subject to racism were the ones who were suffering most from the COVID pandemic - a new awareness of the structural racism within the healthcare system, within the privatized healthcare system, within the capitalist healthcare system. Actually, not so much a new awareness, but a collective attentiveness to an idea that activists, scholar-activists have been insisting on since the era of Radical Reconstruction in the aftermath of slavery.\n\nAnd there have been those who have pointed out that racism is connected to capitalism, that capitalism is at its core racial capitalism, and not only here in the U.S. Capitalism was produced by colonialism and slavery. But, finally, it seemed, people seemed to get it. Racism does not emanate from the fact that white people don't like Black people or Indigenous or Latinx or Asian people. It is produced and reproduced structurally, systemically, institutionally. And this was a kind of collective aha moment. And we should never forget that.\n\nThis is why more people poured out into the streets of this country than ever before in the history. This is why people joined the mobilizations. This is why more white people joined all of the mobilizations. And people were out in the streets, even though we did not yet know then how COVID was transmitted. Millions of people poured out into the streets at the risk of their own lives. Demonstrating this new awareness became more important than the lives of individuals - the most remarkable moment in our recent history, maybe even in the history of this country. And this is why DeSantis and others are excising examination of this movement from the school curriculum.\n\nAnd so, the stage was set for us to attempt to accomplish what should have been done in the 19th century in the immediate aftermath of slavery. And it seemed that a good majority of people in this country, people of all racial and ethnic backgrounds, seemed to realize this. To overlay the political context, all of this was happening during the presidency of the person whose name shall not be pronounced during our meeting this evening. Thus the counterrevolution. Thus the attack against critical race theory, which is a serious interdisciplinary field founded on the work of those who were attempting many years ago to understand the way structural racism expressed itself through the law.\n\nSo, those of you who are interested in history will be utterly struck by all of the parallels between the reaction to Radical Reconstruction, 1867 to 1877, and what we are currently witnessing. The police murder of Tyre Nichols in the very same city in which Dr. King was assassinated punctuates the message that racism is structural. Awareness of racism is not about making white children feel guilty. It is about recognizing the deep structures of racism in all of our institutions, regardless of who the individual perpetrators might be. It is a machine. It is a system. It is a culture that is produced and reproduced.\n\nAnd now we know better how to initiate the process of ridding our world of racism. We know better than ever before. And I just have a few more words. I just - I want to say it involves standing up against heteropatriarchy. We know that it involves saying no to economic exploitation We know we cannot exclude any community that suffers from the effects of racism. And this includes Asian Americans. And this includes Arab Americans. This includes Palestinians. We know.\n\nWe know, finally, that we cannot struggle for human freedom without recognizing that we are all animals and that we must stand in support of our nonhuman coinhabitants of this planet. And thank you so much for the beautiful metaphor of the rabbit, the pattern of the rabbit escaping. But I think that we look at - we look at simple creatures like ants that are able to entirely transform a place and build these edifices, these architectural edifices, without at all harming the environment. I think we have much to learn from them, that it is possible to benefit from this Earth, even to transform it, without annihilating the very conditions of future life on this planet. Thank you very much.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "'It's part of our culture to marginalize minorities in America.' Ben Crump wants to change that\n\nThe prominent civil rights attorney represented George Floyd and Breonna Taylor's families. Now he's going after Big Pharma and big banks\n\nC ivil rights attorney Ben Crump sees a throughline from representing the family of Patrick Lyoya , who was killed by a police officer during a traffic stop in Grand Rapids, Michigan, to his racial discrimination lawsuit against Wells Fargo bank.\n\n\"America has to come to grips with the racial discrimination that exists in all the institutions of American society. We shouldn't expect policing to be any different from banking or environmental injustices. It's part of our culture to marginalize minorities in America,\" Crump, who represented George Floyd's family, told the Guardian on the same day a state report found that Minneapolis police had engaged in a pattern of racial discrimination .\n\nSince the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 sparked a movement against police brutality, Crump has become a fixture at the side of families whose loved ones were killed by law enforcement. In recent years, Crump has expanded that civil rights work to expose the root causes of racial inequality, from housing discrimination to medical racism.\n\nIn July 2021, Crump sued Johnson & Johnson on behalf of the National Council of Negro Women who alleged the pharmaceutical giant promoted talcum-based baby powder to Black women, despite links to ovarian cancer. (Johnson & Johnson denied the allegations.) A month later, the family of Henrietta Lacks , whose cancer tissue cells had been taken by doctors without her knowledge in 1951 and later used to create medical advances, hired Crump to explore litigation against pharmaceutical companies they say had made fortunes off her HeLa cells. (By October 2021, they sued a biotech company for allegedly profiting off the \"stolen\" cells.) And on 14 April of this year, Crump joined a class-action lawsuit against Wells Fargo, America's largest mortgage lender, alleging that the bank approved more loans for white borrowers than Black borrowers and gave the latter higher average interest rates.\n\n\"Part of my life's mission is to try to make sure we hold a mirror to America's face to say that we have to be better than this if we're going to make the words in the Declaration of Independence real and not just rhetoric,\" Crump said.\n\nThe Minnesota human rights commission just released that report about the Minneapolis police department, nearly two years after George Floyd's murder, engaged in a pattern of racial discrimination. What went through your mind when you heard about the report?\n\nThey provided evidence for what we have always believed based on excessive force committed against minorities, especially Black men commensurate with the demographics. The fact that you had George Floyd, Amir Locke, Jamar Clark, David Smith - these are things that jump out in your mind right from the beginning when you think about the Minneapolis police department and their interaction with Black people in Minneapolis that were killed unjustly. We got in many ways objective evidence to show that it was unjustified.\n\nYou once said that just like police brutality killed Black lives, the discrimination that's exhibited by Wells Fargo killed Black opportunities. In some ways, the same could be said around the exploitation of Black bodies for profit, as seen in the case of Henrietta Lack's family. In your eyes, how are those situations interconnected when talking about the lives of Black Americans?\n\nSome see it as an evolution of Ben Crump, but you know, I see it as a very similar, familiar fight against bias and discrimination and racism. It's the same whether our children and people in our community are being killed by police excessive force or whether people are being killed by environmental injustices or being killed, in Henrietta Lacks' case, with scientific racism experimentation, or whether they're killing our spirits with discrimination in banking, denying us access to capital to close the wealth gap. To me, it's the same fight. We just have different opponents.\n\nWith that canvas of work, what does it tell us about the ways structural racism manifests in American society?\n\nIt just speaks to the fact that it is part of all of our institutions - this notion that minorities don't matter, that it's OK to marginalize them, to treat them as less than human, as less than equal. And so we have to continue to try to expose the biases, whether they're explicit or implicit. So many of them say it's implicit, but the more you see the results of stuff like banking while Black, you say it has to be something explicit about it. That it was intentional. That it was deliberate. It's an old familiar dynamic that even if we can't describe it, we know what it is when we see it.\n\nHow does litigation as a strategy act as a means to address the structural racism that undergirds policing, lending, medical racism and other issues?\n\nI use this weapon [litigation] as an instrument for good, not as a weapon for evil. Discrimination is evil. I try my best to make sure that we use litigation as a truth-seeker, because first you have to get transparency and truth, and then you can get justice. Transparency and truth are the cornerstones for justice. And so we use litigation to help us discover transparency and be able to come to what the truth of the matter is, and then you can expose it. Sunlight is a good disinfectant, and we have to always continue to shine the light on these issues of bias and discrimination.\n\nPeople seem to condone the racist act, but they don't want to be categorized as a racist. So we do whatever we have to do to expose the truth, because what we want is not your words or your rhetoric, what we want is your action.\n\nThat's why I fight police brutality, I'm fighting Wells Fargo and banking while Black. We have to fight in the court of law and the court of public opinion. And with the court of public opinion, if we can win there, then we can prevail in the court of law.\n\nWe've seen over the past few years that killings persist, exploitation of Black bodies persists, housing discrimination, financial dis franchisement - all of that persists. How do you overcome those obstacles?\n\nIt's real simple to me. I think about my first year of law school. They talk about precedent and everything had to be based on precedent. I didn't really accept that. Because I knew that, based on precedent of the United States supreme court, we were slaves. And if we based everything on precedent, I would still be a slave today. So even though I rejected them trying to teach us that, I did understand what they were trying to tell us when they talked about precedents. They would tell us everything must be based on precedent because you wanted the laws in the future to be consistent with those in the present and those in the past.\n\nWhat I believe is that's not an absolute, but I understand what they're trying to teach us. That precedent is a good indicator of what's likely to come. I think about the precedent of Black people in America at the founding. These people were labeled three-fifths of a human being. Yet we overcame that.\n\nI think about the Dred Scott decision where the United States said there was no right that a Black person had that a white person was bound to respect. And we overcame that. I think about how we overcame all the Jim Crow laws , how we overcame the carpetbaggers during Reconstruction , how we overcame Jim Crow Jr, and how, no matter what, based on the precedent set by our ancestors, we will be able to overcome whatever obstacles that the enemies of equality throw at us next."

      "text": "Civil rights lawyer Crump: investigate Buffalo shooting as domestic terrorism\n\n'We can't sugarcoat it,' leading civil rights attorney Ben Crump says of shooting that killed 10 people\n\nA day ahead of Joe Biden's visit to Buffalo, the leading civil rights attorney Ben Crump said federal officials should define the mass shooting at a grocery store in the city on Saturday as an \"act of domestic terrorism\".\n\n\"We can't sugarcoat it, we can't try to explain it away talking about mental illness,\" Crump said of the attacked allegedly perpetrated by Payton Gendron, 18, who is in custody on one charge of first-degree murder awaiting arraignment on Thursday where additional charges are likely to be filed.\n\n\"No,\" Crump said. \"This was an act of domestic terrorism perpetrated by a young white supremacist.\"\n\nTen people were killed and three wounded in the shooting.\n\nRepresenting the family of Ruth Whitfield, an 86-year-old woman who was among those killed in the two-minute attack, Crump said leaders \"at the highest levels must be responsive to this\".\n\n\"This was an act of domestic terrorists and America responds to terrorism at every level and they have to do that here,\" Crump said as he stood before several members of the Whitfield family, some of whom wept quietly.\n\n\"Just because it was a Black grocery store doesn't make it any less than any other massacres, whether its Columbine or the Oklahoma City bombing.\"\n\nWhitfield was killed after making a daily visit to her husband, Garnell Whitfield, in a nursing home. On Monday, Garnell Whitfield had not yet been told that his wife of 68 years was dead.\n\nTheir son, the Buffalo fire commissioner, Garnell Whitfield Jr, said for his mother to be \"taken from this world by someone full of hate for no reason, it's very hard for us to handle right now\".\n\n\"And you expect us to do this over and over and over again, forgive and forget,\" he said, \"while the people we elect do their best not to protect us, consider us equal, not to love us back? What do we do with all of this pain?\"\n\nCrump has been involved in representing the families of George Floyd, Jacob Blake, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, all victims of police violence.\n\nHe called on authorities to investigate how the Buffalo gunman developed hateful beliefs, including examining if \"race replacement theory\" played a role in the attack.\n\nBut Crump also called out \"accomplices to this mass murder\", which he identified as websites, politicians and cable news pundits .\n\n\"Even though they didn't pull the trigger, they did load the gun for this young white supremacist,\" he said.\n\nCrump said federal legislators must pass a hate crimes bill before Congress - a reference to the George Floyd Justice in Policing bill, currently stalled - and that Biden must use his influence to secure such progress.\n\n\"Black America is suffering right now,\" he said. \"And we need to know that our top leader in America reacts and responds when we are hurt.\"\n\nThe US justice department has said it is investigating the Buffalo massacre as a hate crime and an act of racially motivated violent extremism. Biden and the first lady, Jill Biden, will visit Buffalo on Tuesday. The George Floyd bill is likely to be discussed, alongside the the first's family's expressions of condolence to grieving families and the community at large.\n\nAttorneys co-representing the Whitfield family said they could file lawsuits against Bushmaster, maker of the assault-style weapon used in Buffalo, following successful legal actions against the makers of weapons used in mass shootings. The attorney Ken Abbarno said \"all of the signs and red flags were there\" to monitor the suspect and stop him acquiring a gun, including threatening comments that brought police to his high school last spring and triggered a mental health evaluation.\n\nAnother attorney, Terry Connors, said he planned to help the Whitfield family get answers about how the shooting happened and how it was possible for an 18-year-old with such a history to purchase such a weapon, cross state lines and buy bullets.\n\nAccording to the Erie county sheriff, John Garcia, the suspect was visited last year by state police after he turned in a high-school project about murder-suicides. Buffalo police have said authorities are examining a 180-page manifesto Gendron appeared to have written and posted that referenced racist replacement theories.\n\nAlso on Monday, the Buffalo police commissioner, Joseph Gramaglia, revealed that Gendron did not plan to limit his rampage to one branch of Tops Friendly Markets.\n\n\"He was going to get in his car and continue to drive down Jefferson Avenue and continue doing the same thing,\" the commissioner said.\n\nGendron reportedly drove to Buffalo from his home several hours away on Friday to do \"reconnaissance\" of the area. At least one witness claims to have met him that day.\n\nLaw enforcement found another rifle and a shotgun in the suspect's car.\n\nAs details of the planning of the shooting become clearer, so do its apparent motives. A screenshot posted on Crump's Twitter account showed the alleged gunman had the number 14 stenciled on the barrel of his weapon, an apparent reference to a 14-word white supremacist phrase: \"We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.\"\n\nThe attack has also focused attention on social media livestream services.\n\n\"Live streaming this attack gives me some motivation in the way that I know that some people will be cheering for me,\" the suspect said as the attack was in progress.\n\nAmazon-owned Twitch, which hosted the suspect's livestream via the account \"jimboboiii\" to roughly 20 other users, has said it has erased the video from servers.\n\n\"The user has been indefinitely suspended from our service and we are taking all appropriate action including monitoring for any accounts rebroadcasting this content,\" a Twitch spokesperson said.\n\nClips of the attack were available on other platforms. One clip, uploaded to Streamable, was reported to have had 3m views before it was removed."

Police at first indicated that they were not even conducting a criminal investigation, though they later said they were investigating the case as a homicide after all, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel .\n\nThe hotel is one of the three main venues for the Republican national convention, which is taking place in Milwaukee from 15 to 18 July.\n\n\"I know the national media is going to be coming and covering a lot of stuff related to the convention,\" Crump said during Monday's press conference about Mitchell's killing. \"A major part of the narrative needs to be justice and ... justice in Milwaukee for D'Vontaye Mitchell.\"\n\nVideo of Mitchell's final moments showed four hotel security guards holding him down. Mitchell was experiencing a mental health crisis, according to Crump, and one of the guards appears to be kneeling on his body.\n\nIn the video, Mitchell is heard grunting and screaming for help. He was later pronounced dead by first responders who were summoned to the hotel.\n\nThe Milwaukee county medical examiner's office has since determined that Mitchell's preliminary manner of death was a homicide, the Journal Sentinel reported . The Milwaukee police department told the Journal Sentinel that they are not conducting a criminal investigation at this time.\n\nIn a statement, representatives of Hyatt said the hotel had suspended the employees involved in Mitchell's killing while it conducted an internal investigation. The hotel later said it had fired the employees, according to multiple reports .\n\n\"We extend our heartfelt condolences to Dvontaye Mitchell's family, all those who knew and loved him, and the Milwaukee community in light of this tragedy,\" the statement said. \"Hotels franchised under Hyatt's brands are required to comply with Hyatt's mandatory safety and security standards and ensure that the hotel is a safe and secure environment for guests, colleagues and the public. \"As the investigation continues, Hyatt is fully committed to supporting efforts to help ensure accountability for the circumstances that led to the death of Dvontaye Mitchell.\"\n\nLawyers representing Mitchell's family said his death was reminiscent of the killing of George Floyd , a Black man who was murdered by a Minneapolis police officer who kneeled on his neck for nine and a half minutes in 2020.

He was a great guy. He was an exceptional guy,\" Crump said.\n\nFortson's mother, Chantemekki Fortson, walked into a news conference with Crump holding a framed portrait of her son in his dress uniform. She burst into tears as Crump spoke about her son's death inside his apartment in Fort Walton Beach.\n\n\"My baby was shot up,\" she said.\n\nLater on Thursday afternoon, the Okaloosa county sheriff's office released body-camera footage to reporters that they said contradicted the family's claims. Eric Aden, the county sheriff, rejected assertions made by Crump that the deputy had gone to the wrong apartment, covered the door's peephole and did not announce himself.\n\nThe video shows the deputy arriving at a Fort Walton Beach apartment building on 3 May and speaking to a woman outside who describes hearing an argument. The deputy then goes up an elevator and walks down an outdoor hallway.\n\nThe video shows the deputy banging on the door and stepping aside, seemingly out of view of the door. Twice he shouts: \"Sheriff's office! Open the door!\"\n\nFortson opens the door and can be seen holding what appears to be a handgun pointed down toward the floor. The deputy shouts: \"Step back!\" and fires off shots. He then shouts: \"Drop the gun! Drop the gun!\"\n\n\"It's over there,\" Fortson says.\n\n\"Drop the gun!\" the deputy yells back.\n\n\"I don't have it,\" Fortson says, lying on the ground.\n\nThe deputy then calls paramedics on his radio.\n\nFollowing release of the footage, Crump issued a statement saying that the officer did not tell Fortson to drop his gun before shooting \"multiple times within a split second of the door being opened\".\n\n\"We remain adamant that the police had the wrong apartment as Roger was on the phone with his girlfriend for a substantial amount of time leading up to the shooting, and no one else was in the apartment,\" the statement said.\n\nThe sheriff's office has declined to identify the responding deputies or their races. Officials have said the Florida department of law enforcement and the local state attorney's office will investigate the shooting.\n\nCrump, a noted civil rights attorney, called the shooting \"an unjustifiable killing\" and said the sheriff's office needed to own up to it instead of creating a counter-narrative that deputies were acting in self-defense.\n\n\"He was just in his apartment, minding his business,\" Crump said of sheriff's deputies. \"They could have made sure they were at the right apartment. They had a duty to make sure they were at the right apartment before they busted in the door.\"\n\nThe Okaloosa county sheriff's office has not responded to an email or voicemail from the Associated Press seeking comment about Crump's account.\n\nIn a statement last week, the office said a deputy responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex reacted in self-defense after encountering an armed man. The office did not offer details on what kind of disturbance deputies were responding to or who called them.\n\nCrump said Fortson, originally from Atlanta, was shot six times and died at a hospital. The deputy who shot him was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nFortson had constitutional rights to have the firearm and against unreasonable searches by the police, Crump said. He led family members and other attorneys in a chant of: \"Clear Roger's name.\"\n\nCrump said Fortson had always wanted to join the US air force and enlisted after graduating high school. He was based at the special operations wing at Hurlburt Field. He was a special missions aviator, and one of his roles was to load the gunship's cannons during missions.\n\n\"He was living his dream. By doing so, he was going to make it better for his mother and siblings so they could have a better chance at the American dream,\" Crump said.\n\nFortson had been talking to his girlfriend, who hasn't yet been identified, on FaceTime when deputies burst into his apartment on 3 May, Crump added.\n\nWithout her, his family wouldn't have known what had happened, he said. The girlfriend notified his mother, who drove to Fort Walton Beach to find out that her son was dead.\n\nAt the hospital, deputies approached Chantemekki Fortson, and she told them: \"'You guys have killed my baby. Just take me to my baby, please. I just want to see my child,'\" she recounted at the news conference.\n\nIn 2018, a white former Dallas police officer fatally shot Botham Jean, who was unarmed, after mistaking his apartment for her own. Amber Guyger, the former officer, was convicted of murder and sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn 2019, a white former Fort Worth, Texas, officer fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson through a rear window of her home after responding to a non-emergency call reporting that Jefferson's front door was open. Aaron Dean, the former officer, was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison."

The judge refused the demand.\n\nIn a pre-trial interview with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Gough also said he thought there were not enough \"Bubbas or Joe six-packs\" - meaning white, older blue-collar workers - on the jury.\n\nCrump, who is representing the Arbery family, told CNN that Gough's stance was inexcusable.\n\n\"In the Black community, the church, and faith, is the foundation,\" he said. \"To not allow Ahmaud's mother and father to have their faith and spiritual leaders pray with them to keep their sanity ... Think about what you saw in that courtroom, pictures of their child, their baby, with a hole in his body.\n\n\"It was just so arrogant, it was the essence of white supremacy mentality. Almost like thinking [that] because a Black man is jogging, ordinary white citizens can stop him, and if he dares to not follow their orders they have the right to kill him. We must be better than that.\"\n\nCrump also accused defense lawyers of referring to Arbery \"like a runaway slave\". During closing arguments on Monday, attorney Laura Hogue drew gasps in the courtroom when she branded the victim as an \"erratic\" character with \"long, dirty toenails\".\n\nBryan, 52, and father and son Gregory and Travis McMichael, 65 and 35, respectively, each face five counts including murder, aggravated assault and false imprisonment. Although Travis McMichael fired the fatal shots, all three face life imprisonment if convicted."

It seeks to answer questions surrounding the assassination, and paint an accurate history of the events, Crump said.\n\n\"As a direct result of the Defendants' intentional, bad faith, willful, wanton, reckless, unreasonable and/or deliberately indifferent acts and omissions, Malcolm X was deprived of his federal constitutional rights, was robbed of his life and freedom, and sustained severe physical, emotional, and monetary damages, including conscious physical pain and suffering,\" the lawsuit states.\n\nThe suit is also intended to bring reparations to the family. There was no comment from the FBI, the CIA or the NYPD by Friday afternoon.\n\n\"This cover-up spanned decades, blocking the Shabazz family's access to the truth and their right to pursue justice,\" Crump said in a statement . \"We are making history by standing here to confront those wrongs and seeking accountability in the courts.\"\n\nMalcolm X became prominent as the national spokesperson of the Nation of Islam , an African American Muslim group that espoused Black separatism.\n\nAfter more than a decade with the group, he publicly broke with it in 1964. He moderated some of his earlier views on racial separation, angering some Nation of Islam members and drawing death threats.\n\nTalmadge Hayer, then a member of the Nation of Islam, confessed in court to being one of the three assassins. But speculation that the government may have been aware of the assassination plan and allowed it to happen has persisted for decades.\n\nShabazz was two on 21 February 1965, when she, her mother and her siblings witnessed her father being shot and killed while preparing to speak at New York's Audubon Ballroom in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed reporting"

      "text": "Louisiana woman faces 'horrifically cruel' abortion choice over fetus missing skull\n\nNancy Davis, denied abortion in home state despite fetus being diagnosed with fatal skull condition, forced to travel for procedure\n\nA pregnant Louisiana woman faced with either carrying a skull-less fetus to term - for the baby to probably die within hours - or traveling several states away to obtain an abortion has hired a prominent civil rights attorney as she weighs how to move forward.\n\nNancy Davis, 36, has retained lawyer Ben Crump as she becomes the latest to embody the gut-wrenching decisions some women are being forced to make after the US supreme court's decision in June to strip away nationwide abortion rights, according to a statement from the attorney's office.\n\nDavis's home state is among those that have outlawed abortion with very few exceptions. Davis, from Baton Rouge, said publicly that she tried to have her pregnancy aborted after a 10-week ultrasound revealed that her fetus was missing the top of its skull - a condition known as acrania, which kills babies within minutes or hours of birth.\n\nBut because acrania was not explicitly included on Louisiana's list of conditions justifying an exception from the state's abortion ban, the hospital that treated Davis turned down terminating her pregnancy, which, as of Friday, was in its 13th week.\n\nThe medical center, Woman's hospital in Baton Rouge, directed her to an abortion clinic, saying her Medicaid insurance would not cover the procedure. But Louisiana's abortion clinics have announced plans to leave the state amid legal battles over the ban's enforcement, the New Orleans news outlet Gambit reported.\n\nThe state senator who authored Louisiana's abortion ban, Katrina Jackson, insisted to Baton Rouge TV station WAFB that the hospital should have authorized the termination of Davis's pregnancy, because the statute contains exceptions for fetuses which are not viable outside a mother's womb.\n\nNonetheless, in his office's statement about working with Davis, Crump said Louisiana's abortion ban was clearly confusing to interpret and producing negative consequences, and he accused its authors of \"inflicting profound emotional and physical trauma\" on his client, along with other similarly situated women.\n\nDavis as of Sunday was planning to travel to North Carolina - which allows abortions up to 20 weeks - rather than give birth to what would be her second child, which she would lose virtually immediately.\n\n\"It's hard knowing that ... I'm carrying it to bury it,\" Davis told WAFB earlier this month.\n\nThe statement about Crump's office working with Davis stopped short of saying what their side's legal plans are, other than noting that she planned to raise money for her out-of-state abortion trip through an online GoFundMe campaign whose stated goal is $20,000.\n\nBut Davis told WAFB she hoped state lawmakers consider additional medical conditions to serve as exceptions to the abortion ban, which threatens providers with criminal prosecution and forfeiting their medical licenses.\n\n\"This is one that needs to be in that list [of exceptions],\" Davis said of acrania.\n\nThe statement from Crump's office added: \"Ms Nancy Davis was put in a horrifically cruel position.\n\n\"Ms Davis has had to endure unthinkable emotional pain and mounting physical risk.\"\n\nA Woman's hospital spokesperson declined comment when asked by CNN , citing medical privacy requirements. But the spokesperson did say unviable pregnancies were complex to navigate.\n\nOther clients of Crump have included relatives of George Floyd, who was murdered by Minneapolis police; Trayvon Martin, an unarmed teen who was shot dead by a neighborhood watch captain; and Breonna Taylor, who was killed by Kentucky police while they searched her home. Crump's office helped the families of Floyd, Martin and Taylor secure tens of millions of dollars in settlement money.\n\nWord of Davis's plight emerged almost at the same time that a Florida court blocked a pregnant 16-year-old girl from having an abortion. The court found the girl was too immature to decide whether or not she should have an abortion and therefore must instead give birth to a child.\n\nMeanwhile, earlier in the summer, a 10-year-old Ohio girl who was raped and impregnated had to travel to neighboring Indiana to terminate her pregnancy because of her state's ban on most abortions. Though some media outlets and rightwing politicians baselessly questioned whether the girl existed or was instead a liberal hoax to stoke support for abortion rights, authorities have since charged a man in connection with the girl's rape, a crime to which he has purportedly confessed.\n\nNote: This story was updated to include information from Davis's GoFundMe about her plans to travel to North Carolina."

      "text": "The death of George Floyd was an act of murder, plain and simple\n\nThe Minneapolis police department's failure to arrest the officers responsible threatens our most basic sense of justice\n\n\"G et off of his neck.\" \"Please! Please!\" \"I can't breathe.\" Police in America have far too many non-lethal ways to reliably kill black men without facing criminal charges. The weaponization of racism does not require a gun or a bullet. In this case, a police officer's knee was the weapon used to kill George Floyd . The observing officers' indifference was also a weapon used to kill Floyd, and the Minneapolis police department's failure to arrest the officers responsible is a weapon threatening to kill our most basic sense of justice.\n\nMost law enforcement agencies classify weapons and use of physical force into two broad categories: \"lethal\" and \"non-lethal\". Officers regularly convert \"non-lethal\" weapons and physical force into deadly force and hide behind the agency's classification system to avoid criminal charges.\n\nIn reality, any weapon or any use of physical force can cause death when misused. Police batons kill people. Tasers kill people. Chokeholds kill people. Kneeling on someone's neck for eight minutes kills people. You don't need to attend the police academy to know that if you obstruct someone's airway they will eventually stop breathing, and if you cannot breathe you will die.\n\nMike Freeman, the district attorney, is required by the laws of the state of Minnesota to charge the police officer who kneeled on Floyd's neck with first-degree murder. Similarly, the officers who watched their fellow officer do it, failed to intervene and stopped other citizens from trying to save Floyd's life should also be charged.\n\nThe officers served as judge, jury and executioners of George Floyd when they killed him in the street; and they should face life sentences for First-Degree Murder in a court of law. A first-degree murder charge in Minnesota requires that a person acts to \"cause the death of a human being with premeditation and with intent to effect the death of the person\".\n\nThe video evidence clearly shows that the officers acted with the intent to kill and with premeditation. Floyd told the officers he could not breathe 12 times, including within the first few seconds of the video. Floyd said: \"I'm about to die ... they're gonna kill me,\" and called out for his mother. He lost consciousness, stopped breathing and his body went limp after four minutes. Forty seconds later witnesses told officers that Floyd was unresponsive. At least 16 times they asked the officers to take his pulse.\n\nThe officers even prevented a woman who identified herself as an EMT from trying to save his life. Two minutes and 20 seconds after Floyd lost consciousness, witnesses began to say: \"They just killed him.\" The officers all knew that Floyd was unconscious, was not breathing, that his body was limp, but an officer kept his knee pressed on his windpipe, making sure he did not breathe for another four minutes, despite witnesses' relentless insistence that he was dying. If the witnesses knew he was dying, the officers knew he was dying. The officers knew that Floyd needed oxygen to live, but they never attempted CPR, never took his pulse and never tried to save his life.\n\nRacism is the eye staring down the barrel of our justice system and threatening to pull the trigger. Recall that only after a mass protest movement did the officer who killed Eric Garner in a chokehold face any consequences.\n\nFreeman cannot allow the Minneapolis police officers who killed Floyd to elude criminal charges under the weak, shameful excuse that the level of force used was \"non-lethal\", or that the officers didn't know that Floyd would die without oxygen. That argument is as dishonest as saying they didn't know what happens to a fish out of water. We can all visualize that image: the fish out of water, its mouth open and gasping for air; and we all know the fish is going to die, just like the officers knew that Floyd was going to die.\n\nWe encourage people to call Mike Freeman at (612) 348-5550 and demand that the officers involved in killing George Floyd be charged with first-degree murder.\n\nBen Crump is a civil rights attorney and founder of the national law firm Ben Crump Law.

Mustafa Hassan, who spoke at the press conference hosted by civil rights attorney Ben Crump, claims that what he saw and heard that day substantiates the theory that the FBI and the NYPD were involved in the civil rights leader's killing.\n\nFollowing the assassination, three men were charged and convicted in connection to the civil rights leader's death. Mujahid Abdul Halim, also known as Talmadge Hayer or Thomas Hagan, confessed to the killing. He has maintained that the two people convicted of the killing - Muhammad Aziz and Khalil Islam ― were not involved.\n\nHassan claimed in an affidavit signed last month that he stopped Hagan from escaping after the shooting despite what he believes was an attempt from the authorities to allow him to flee the scene.\n\n\"I would later see [Hagan] outside as he was being beaten by Malcolm's followers while a group of policemen, who suddenly showed up on the scene asking 'is he with us' while at the same time holding back Malcolm's followers from beating him,\" Hassan said at the press conference.\n\n\"They were prepared to let him go, that's my perspective,\" Hassan added.\n\nStock footage and photographs provided to HuffPost show Hassan, now 84, at the scene of Malcolm X's killing.\n\nHassan, who was also a member of Malcolm X's Organization of Afro-American Unity, said he was never approached or interviewed by the authorities and that he and his family fled the country following the assassination fearing death.\n\nThere are still a multitude of questions surrounding Malcolm X's killing.\n\nAziz was released in 1985 and Islam in 1987, but it wasn't until late 2021 that they were exonerated after a two-year long investigation conducted by the Manhattan District Attorney's office. And earlier this year, the family of the late Malcolm X filed a wrongful death lawsuit seeking $100 million in damages, and accusing the CIA, FBI and NYPD of playing a role in his assassination.\n\nCrump plans to pursue further legal action in the coming months given Hassan's claims.\n\n\"When police first ran up to the person who has just shot Malcolm X, are they trying to stop him? No. What they are saying, [is], 'Is he with us,' because they don't know if their person was assigned to shoot Malcolm or not,\" Crump said on Tuesday.\n\nOne of Malcolm X's daughters, Ilyasah Shabazz, also spoke at the press conference.\n\n\"What history has recorded is inaccurate. So we want the truth to be known, we want the history books to reflect that truth, and we would like justice to be served,\" Shabazz said.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Every Black Person Has Had A 'Starbucks Moment'\n\nGuest Writer\n\nIt's hard to fully convey what it's like to be black in America today to those who don't share the experience. In my work as a civil rights attorney and advocate, I often call out those in positions of authority for the disparate treatment of people of color. Last week, just three short days after the notorious Starbucks incident , I experienced it myself - in the most ordinary of situations. After having arrived in Houston on business, I was asked to leave the hotel where I was a registered guest.\n\nDressed in a business suit, I was sitting in the lobby with my law partner, who happens to be white. Without provocation or warning, I was approached by a security guard who asked me to leave. He said I was loitering.\n\nThe security guard did not make the same request of my white colleague, who was sitting right next to me. So my colleague asked for management to explain the disparity in how we were being treated. Eventually, a manager apologized, advising him that they had been \"having that issue a lot lately.\"\n\n\"That issue\" - meaning a person of color being in a public space.\n\nThe shameful reality is that what those two men experienced in that Philadelphia Starbucks and what I experienced in that Houston hotel are at the heart of the black experience in America today. It doesn't matter if you're wearing a suit, as I was, or everyday casual wear, as the young men in Starbucks were. You can change your clothes, but you can't change the pigmentation of your skin.\n\nParents of color have to engage in some extraordinarily difficult conversations with their children - conversations many white parents cannot imagine needing to have. Black parents must teach our kids, \"If you have a run-in with the police, make sure your hands are visible. Be respectful, say 'yes, sir' or 'yes, ma'am' and don't make any sudden movements - even if you weren't doing anything wrong.\"\n\nThe Starbucks incident, in which both men had done nothing wrong and obediently stood up to be handcuffed by police, shows they learned the lesson. They knew that one slight move could be their last.\n\nThis is the hard reality of being black in America. Implicit bias creeps through our society like an invasive weed, determining how people of color are treated and marginalizing their rights as citizens. In hundreds of everyday situations from Philadelphia to Houston to Sacramento, black people are reflexively judged to be a nuisance at best or, at worst, a threat - before they ever get a chance to make an individual impression with their character or personality.\n\nA survival code for black Americans is emerging from these incidents: Dress up at all times, so you aren't judged to have criminal intent; wear a hoodie or baggy pants at your own peril. Don't speak up for your rights as a customer or you may be thrown off a plane or out of an establishment you are patronizing. And by all means, don't carry a gun - even with a permit. The Second Amendment that the NRA fights so hard to protect does not seem to extend to black people, whom police deem to be dangerous even when they're only carrying a cell phone.\n\nBoth in that Philadelphia Starbucks and in the hotel lobby in Houston, white people who witnessed the situation spoke up to challenge the injustice. In my case, it yielded an apology from management. For the two young men at the Philadelphia Starbucks, the incident culminated with their arrest, public humiliation and, eventually, an apology from Starbucks. For far too many others, the simple fact of being black in America - whether in a car, on a public street or in their own backyard - has ended in tragic death.\n\nAmerica is in the throes of a practical and moral crisis. To move forward as a country we need to provoke a crisis of conscience from our boardrooms to our courtrooms. Apologies are insufficient. It's time to do the right thing... right from the start.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Thurgood Marshall's Mission is Still Necessary\n\nGuest Writer\n\nAs a civil rights attorney, I have dedicated my career to exposing and correcting the systematic legalization of discrimination in the United States. This commitment did not magically appear in my thoughts, but rather was instilled there by a man I once shook hands with as a pre-law student on a visit to the Supreme Court.\n\nThurgood Marshall was a man of conviction who was criticized, chastised, even ostracized for everything he believed in, stood for, and looked like. Despite all these obstacles, he not only participated in the arduous climb for civil rights, he dominated the uphill struggle. His extraordinary legacy will be recognized in an upcoming film, just as our nation marks the 50th anniversary of Marshall taking his seat as the first African-American associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe movie, Marshall , will be released in theaters on Friday , just days after the nation recognized Thurgood Marshall Day on Oct. 2. The film underscores the impact Marshall made in the lives of countless black Americans. I was honored to be asked to play a role in the movie, alongside Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, whom I represented in the tragically unjust case of the 2012 killing of their son, Trayvon Martin.\n\nThe real-life person I portray is attorney Z. Alexander Looby, a gifted civil rights lawyer. In the film I \"represent\" characters played by Ms. Fulton and Mr. Martin, who were cast as the parents of a 14-year-old boy accused of killing a police officer in Mississippi. The parallel with our real-world lives is eerie, further reinforcing my view that our timely and necessary fight against oppression is still so, more than six decades later.\n\nMost people find their career path in one of two ways - some figure out what they want to do along the way, while others have always had a deep sense of their own destiny. For me, my path was clearly laid out starting in the fourth grade, thanks to the influence of Thurgood Marshall.\n\nI was one of the first black students to attend L. Gilbert Carroll Middle School in my hometown of Lumberton, North Carolina, in the fall of 1978. School integration had finally been implemented. Though stark separation still very much existed, I was attending a new school with better books, better technology and cleaner facilities - and for that I was grateful.\n\nI soon learned that this remarkable achievement for African-Americans was the result of Thurgood Marshall's historic victory in the landmark Supreme Court case of Brown v. the Board of Education of Topeka. A talented, resolute man of color, Marshall helped light my path and instilled into me a deep sense of social obligation. I knew then that I would become an attorney and do everything within my abilities to create a better life and equal opportunity for those most marginalized and disenfranchised.\n\nThe victims and families I now represent are dragged into unwanted and sometimes deadly situations, solely because of the color of their skin and not by their own actions or misdeeds. Since my inspiration for entering this practice was Justice Marshall, you can image the deep sense of humility I felt when I was named to receive the NAACP Thurgood Marshall Award.\n\nWhen I think about my clients - the families of victims such as Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Terence Crutcher, to name only a few - I cannot help but wonder what Marshall would make of the injustices that continue to be inflicted by our country's police forces and courtrooms. Laws were created to govern every man, woman and child, yet in far too many instances minorities are disproportionately punished by the \"justice\" system.\n\nAs you head to the theater to learn more about the life of the great Thurgood Marshall, consider the changes that still need to be made, the struggles that must still be overcome.

Nicholas Biase, a spokesperson for the Department of Justice, which was also sued, declined comment.\n\nFor decades, more questions than answers have arisen over who was to blame for the death of Malcolm X, who was 39 years old when he was slain on Feb. 21, 1965, at the Audubon Ballroom on West 165th Street in Manhattan as he spoke to several hundred people. Born Malcolm Little in Omaha, Nebraska, Malcolm X later changed his name to El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz.\n\nThree men were convicted of crimes in the death but two of them were exonerated in 2021 after investigators took a fresh look at the case and concluded some evidence was shaky and authorities had held back some information.\n\nIn the lawsuit, the family said the prosecution team suppressed the government's role in the assassination.\n\nMalcolm X's wife, Betty Shabazz, the plaintiffs, \"and their entire family have suffered the pain of the unknown\" for decades, the lawsuit states.\n\n\"They did not know who murdered Malcolm X, why he was murdered, the level of NYPD, FBI and CIA orchestration, the identity of the governmental agents who conspired to ensure his demise, or who fraudulently covered-up their role,\" it states. \"The damage caused to the Shabazz family is unimaginable, immense, and irreparable.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Woman Seeks DOJ Probe After Her Son Is Hit By Cop Car, Buried In Pauper's Grave\n\nBreaking News Reporter, HuffPost\n\nCivil rights attorney Ben Crump is calling on the Department of Justice to investigate why Dexter Wade ― a Mississippi man who authorities say was hit and killed by an off-duty police officer's vehicle ― was quietly buried by the city in a pauper's grave as his mother repeatedly contacted police for help finding him.\n\n\"For six months, she didn't know where he was at,\" Crump said at a press conference Monday alongside Wade's mother, Bettersten Wade, who says she filed a missing person report with the Jackson Police Department days after her son's disappearance in March, and that she repeatedly asked police to check their morgue.\n\n\"They had my address. They had my phone number - the same thing on his medical records. How could they not, how could they not put all of that together?\" Bettersten Wade said. \"Our police department is supposed to help.\"\n\nBettersten said it wasn't until Aug. 24 that she learned that her son was dead, and that his body had been discharged by the morgue and buried in a pauper's field. His grave was given a marker reading \"No. 672.\"\n\nCrump said Dexter Wade, 37, was found without identification cards, but that the coroner's office was able to identify him through his fingerprints and a prescription medication that was found on him.\n\nThe coroner's office tried calling Bettersten Wade. When the attempt was unsuccessful, the coroner shared her number with the police department so they could reach out as well, and the coroner repeatedly checked in with police to see if they'd made contact, Crump said.\n\n\"The coroner was saying, 'Have you called her? Have you called her? Have you made contact?'\" Crump said.\n\nBoth Crump and Bettersten Wade expressed suspicion about whether police ever actually tried to call.\n\n\"She didn't see anything where she was getting contacted... by the Jackson Police Department,\" Crump said.\n\nThe police department did not immediately respond to HuffPost's request for comment.\n\nBettersten Wade alleges that police intentionally didn't reach out to her because of a lawsuit she'd previously filed against the department related to her brother's death in 2019 . Her brother, George Robinson, 62, died two days after he was beaten by police during a traffic stop. Robinson's death was ruled a homicide and an officer involved was later convicted of manslaughter , though he is now appealing his conviction.\n\nBettersten believes that because of that lawsuit, local police have a \"vendetta\" against her.\n\nThe city's mayor, who addressed Dexter Wade's death in public remarks last week, blamed a lack of communication between the police department's missing persons division and the coroner's office, but said there's no evidence of police misconduct or malicious intent.\n\n\"The accident was investigated, and it was determined that it was, in fact, an accident and that there was no malicious intent,\" said Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba, who said Dexter was fatally struck while he attempted to cross a highway.\n\nCrump said he wants Dexter's body to be exhumed so it can undergo an independent autopsy and receive a proper burial.\n\n\"We will not rest until the full truth is revealed, and those responsible for this injustice are held accountable,\" Crump said in a statement . \"Dexter's memory will not be forgotten, and his story will fuel our fight for a fair and just society where every life is valued and protected, regardless of who they are.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the DOJ told HuffPost that the department is aware of the investigation request, but that it had no further comment.\n\nA spokesperson for the city of Jackson also declined comment.\n\n\"Though our hearts and prayers remain with the Wade family, we can not comment on this situation further, due to pending litigation,\" they said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Family Of Breonna Taylor, EMT Killed By Police, Hires Attorney From Ahmaud Arbery Case\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nThe family of a Black woman who was shot to death by police officers in Louisville, Kentucky, in March has hired a prominent attorney who also represents the family of Ahmaud Arbery, a Black man fatally shot while jogging in Georgia.\n\nBreonna Taylor , a 26-year-old EMT, was shot eight times by Louisville Metro police officers on March 13 after they entered her apartment with a drug warrant looking for someone else. Her family filed suit on April 27, saying the warrant didn't include either Taylor or her boyfriend and alleging the officers entered \"without knocking ... or announcing themselves.\"\n\nTaylor's family this week hired noted civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who also represents the family of Ahmaud Arbery. Two white men were charged this week in Arbery's February killing after outrage that followed the release of a video showing the shooting.\n\nCrump, who also represented the family of Trayvon Martin , said this week that Taylor's slaying had simmered beneath the headlines for as long as the Arbery case, and he linked the lack of attention to gender bias.\n\n\"They're killing our sisters just like they're killing our brothers, but for whatever reason, we have not given our sisters the same attention,\" Crump told The Washington Post , listing the names of prominent Black men killed by police officers. \"Breonna's name should be known by everybody in America who said those other names, because she was in her own home, doing absolutely nothing wrong.\"\n\nAccording to the lawsuit filed by Taylor's family, her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, believed the apartment was being broken into during the police raid. He fired a legally owned firearm, hitting one of the officers. Officers then opened fire and killed Taylor. At least 20 shots were fired.\n\nThe Louisville Courier Journal notes no drugs were found. The lawsuit says the person police were looking for had already been arrested 10 miles from Taylor's home earlier that day. The paper reported this week that a judge had signed a warrant with a \"no-knock\" provision , meaning officers could enter without announcing themselves, although the department says officers knocked multiple times before entering.\n\nNo charges have been filed against the officers involved. Walker, 27, was arrested and charged with assault and attempted murder of a police officer, NBC News reported. He remains jailed, according to Crump.\n\nLouisville Police fatally shot #BreonnaTaylor . They had the wrong address AND their real suspect was already in custody. 2 months later, no one has been held accountable for her death... but we will change that! #JusticeForBreonnaTaylor #SayHerName pic.twitter.com/wytTAozY5l\n\n\"Breonna had posed no threat to the officers and did nothing to deserve to die at their hands,\" the suit says. \"Neither of the two had any criminal history for drugs or violence.\"\n\nTamika Palmer, Taylor's mother, told the Courier Journal on Tuesday she wasn't sure officers \"understand what they took from my family.\"\n\n\"She had a whole plan on becoming a nurse and buying a house and then starting a family,\" Palmer said of her daughter. \"Breonna had her head on straight, and she was a very decent person.\"\n\nLouisville Mayor Greg Fischer said he would demand a \"thorough investigation\" into Taylor's death.\n\n\"As always, my priority is that the truth comes out, and door justice to follow the path of truth,\" Fischer said in a statement. \"Police work can involve incredibly difficult situations. Additionally, residents have rights. These two concepts will and must be weighed by our justice system as the case proceeds.\"\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Florida Deputies Who Fatally Shot U.S. Airman Burst Into Wrong Apartment, Attorney Says\n\nMIAMI (AP) - Deputies responding to a disturbance call at a Florida apartment complex burst into the wrong unit and fatally shot a Black U.S. Air Force airman who was home alone when they saw he was armed with a gun, an attorney for the man's family said Wednesday.\n\nSenior Airman Roger Fortson , 23, who was based at the Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field, was in his off-base apartment in Fort Walton Beach when the shooting happened on May 3.\n\nCivil rights attorney Ben Crump said in a statement that Fortson was on a Facetime call with a woman at the time of the encounter.\n\nAccording to Crump, the woman, whom Crump didn't identify, said Fortson was alone in his apartment when he heard a knock at the door. He asked who was there but didn't get a response. A few minutes later, Fortson heard a louder knock but didn't see anyone when he looked through the peephole, Crump said, citing the woman's account.\n\nThe woman said Fortson was concerned and went to retrieve his gun, which Crump said was legally owned.\n\nAs Fortson walked back through his living room, deputies burst through the door, saw that Fortson was armed and shot him six times, according to Crump's statement. The woman said Fortson was on the ground, saying, \"I can't breathe,\" after he was shot, Crump said.\n\nFortson died at a hospital, officials said. The deputy involved in the shooting was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nThe woman said Fortson wasn't causing a disturbance during their Facetime call and believes that the deputies must have had the wrong apartment, Crump's statement said.\n\n\"The circumstances surrounding Roger's death raise serious questions that demand immediate answers from authorities, especially considering the alarming witness statement that the police entered the wrong apartment,\" Crump said in the statement.\n\n\"We are calling for transparency in the investigation into Roger's death and the immediate release of body cam video to the family,\" Crump said. \"His family and the public deserve to know what occurred in the moments leading up to this tragedy.\"\n\nCrump is a nationally known attorney based in Tallahassee, Florida. He has been involved in multiple high-profile law enforcement shooting cases involving Black people, including those of Ahmaud Arbery , Trayvon Martin , Breonna Taylor , Tyre Nichols and George Floyd .\n\nCrump and Fortson's family plan to speak at a news conference in Fort Walton Beach on Thursday morning.\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office said in a statement last week that a deputy responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex reacted in self-defense after encountering an armed man. The office did not offer details on what kind of disturbance deputies were responding to or who called them.\n\nThe sheriff's office also declined to immediately identify the responding deputies or their races. The office did not respond to an email or phone message on Wednesday. Officials said earlier this week that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the local State Attorney's Office will investigate the shooting.\n\nFDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is highly unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nFortson was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron as a special missions aviator, where one of his roles as a member of the squadron's AC-130J Ghostrider aircrew was to load the gunship's 30mm and 105mm cannons during missions.\n\nThe sheriff's office didn't immediately respond to an email or voicemail seeking comment Wednesday by The Associated Press.\n\nFort Walton Beach is between Panama City Beach and Pensacola in the Florida Panhandle.\n\n____\n\nAssociated Press reporter Curt Anderson contributed to this story from St. Petersburg, Florida.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Now A Female Student Athlete Is Suing As The Northwestern Hazing Scandal Widens\n\nCHICAGO (AP) - The hazing scandal at Northwestern University has widened to include a volleyball player who on Monday became the first female athlete to sue the university over allegations she was retaliated against by the coach for reporting her mistreatment.\n\n\"This shows that it isn't just men,\" said Parker Stinar, one of her attorneys. \"It isn't just football players.\"\n\nThe private school in Evanston, Illinois, is facing multiple lawsuits, including one planned for later in the day that was to be announced by civil rights attorney Ben Crump.\n\nThe scandal at the Big Ten school centers on a problem that seems to extend far beyond sports, even if it is sports that often gets the headlines. While major college sports programs have become multimillion-dollar, ritualistic hazing appears to remain a problematic tradition within them.\n\nFootball coach Pat Fitzgerald was fired after a university investigation found allegations of hazing by 11 current or former players, including \"forced participation, nudity and sexualized acts of a degrading nature,\" school President Michael Schill said. One previous lawsuit accuses Fitzgerald of enabling a culture of racism, including forcing players of color to cut their hair and behave differently to be more in line with the \"Wildcat Way.\"\n\nThe volleyball player, identified in Monday's lawsuit as Jane Doe, says she was physically harmed to the point of requiring medical attention during a hazing incident in early 2021.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Jane Doe contracted COVID-19 in February of that year, despite following the team's COVID guidelines. Despite this, she says, Northwestern volleyball coach Shane Davis and an assistant coach informed her she would need to undergo a \"punishment\" for violating the guidelines. A day later, on March 2, 2021, the coaches permitted the volleyball team's captains to pick the punishment: She was forced to run \"suicides\" in the gym while diving to the floor each time she reached a line on the court. As she did this, the suit says, volleyball coaching staff, team members and trainers watched.\n\nCampus police were made aware of the incident, as was the athletic department, the lawsuit says. Jane Doe says she was isolated from the team and Davis forced her to write an apology letter to trainers. The lawsuit also says the player met with athletic director Derrick Gragg to discuss the culture of the volleyball program but he \"did nothing in response\" to her concerns.\n\nDavis did not immediately respond Monday morning to messages seeking comment. Messages also were left with Gragg and a spokesperson for the athletic department.\n\nThe school announced in December 2021 that it had signed Davis to a multi-year contract extension. A year later, in December 2022, the player medically retired from the sport.\n\nNorthwestern spokesperson Jon Yates confirmed the unnamed student made a hazing allegation in March, 2021. Yates said after suspending the coaching staff during an investiation, which confirmed hazing took place, two volleyball games were canceled and mandatory anti-hazing training was implemented.\n\n\"Although this incident predated President Schill's and Athletic Director Gragg's tenure at the University, each is taking it seriously,\" Yates said. \"Dr. Gragg met with the student at her request last year, and as President Schill wrote in a message to the Northwestern community , the University is working to ensure we have in place appropriate accountability for our athletic department.\"\n\nThe lawsuit was submitted in Cook County, Illinois, by the Chicago-based Salvi Law Firm and names as defendants Davis and Gragg as well as the university, its current and former presidents and the board of trustees. The suit also names Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner James J. Phillips, who was Northwestern's athletic director until 2021. Phillips, who has been named as a defendant in two other lawsuits, has said he never \"condoned or tolerated inappropriate conduct\" against athletes while he was Northwestern's athletics director.\n\nCrump planned to announce another lawsuit against Northwestern over hazing allegations in its athletic programs, with the latest suit touted as containing \"damning new details\" of sexual hazing and abuse in its football program.\n\nFitzgerald, who led Northwestern for 17 seasons and was a star linebacker for the Wildcats, has maintained he had no knowledge of hazing. Fitzgerald said after being fired that he was working with his agent, Bryan Harlan and his lawyer, Dan Webb, to \"protect my rights in accordance with the law.\"\n\nThe hazing allegations have broadened beyond the school's football program as attorneys said last week that male and female athletes reported misconduct within its baseball and softball programs. They also suggested that sexual abuse and racial discrimination within the football program was so rampant that coaches knew it was happening.\n\nCrump's advisory for Monday's news conference states that the suit will identify \"one Northwestern football coach who allegedly witnessed the hazing and sexual conduct and failed to report it.\"\n\nNorthwestern has been added to a long list of American universities to face a scandal in athletics and may eventually join the trend of making large payouts following allegations of sexual abuse.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Deputy Accused of Killing Sonya Massey Was Discharged From Army for Serious Misconduct\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nSean Grayson, who is now charged with murder in the fatal shooting of Sonya Massey, was previously discharged from the U.S. Army for serious misconduct - and still hired at six police departments in Central Illinois.\n\nIn partnership with\n\nThis story was originally published by Invisible Institute, IPM Newsroom, and the Investigative Reporting Workshop\n\nSean Grayson, the former Sangamon County Sheriff's deputy now charged with murder in the fatal shooting of Sonya Massey, was previously discharged from the U.S. Army for serious misconduct, military records show.\n\nGrayson, who is white, was indicted by a grand jury in the July 6 death of Massey, who is Black. Ben Crump, the family's attorney, said the U.S. Department of Justice has also opened an investigation into the incident, but the agency said in a statement that it is \"assessing the circumstances\" and following the criminal case.\n\nDocuments obtained from the Kincaid Police Department in Illinois, where Grayson worked previously, note that Grayson was discharged from the Army in 2016 from the Fort Riley Army installation in Kansas for \"Misconduct (Serious Offense).\" Army officials confirmed Grayson was a wheeled vehicle mechanic from May 2014 to February 2016, but declined to provide further details about his discharge.\n\n\"The Privacy Act and (Department of Defense) policy prevent us from releasing information relating to the misconduct of low-level employees or characterization of service at discharge,\" Army spokesperson Bryce S. Dubee wrote in an email. Officials at Fort Riley and the Fort Riley Military Police directed reporters to file an official records request.\n\nAnthony Ghiotto, a former Air Force prosecutor who now teaches law at the University of Illinois, said there are several reasons why a service member could receive this type of discharge in lieu of a court-martial proceeding or if the member commits a civilian infraction that can't be disciplined through the military justice system.\n\nGhiotto said this kind of discharge suggests that Grayson committed an offense equivalent to something that would have led to at least a year of incarceration for a civilian.\n\n\"A good way of looking at it is, if it would be a misdemeanor in the civilian world, it's not going to be a 'serious offense,'\" he said. He added it's likely Grayson was not court-martialed.\n\nDaniel Fultz, Grayson's defense attorney, declined to comment about the nature of his discharge from the Army. Fultz told Sangamon County Circuit Court Judge Ryan Cadagin on July 17 at Grayson's arraignment that Grayson received an honorable discharge after serving three years in the Army.\n\nHowever, the DD Form 214 summarizing Grayson's tenure in the Army indicates he did not receive an honorable discharge.\n\nGrayson also didn't receive a dis honorable discharge, but Ghiotto said the DD Form 214 indicated Grayson was \"kicked out\" of the Army for serious misconduct before his regular term of enlistment was up.\n\nGrayson received a \"general\" discharge under \"honorable conditions,\" which Ghiotto said means some, but not all, of Grayson's service was honorable. That type of discharge should be a \"red flag\" to potential future employers, Ghiotto said. But he said a \"bigger red flag\" is the listing of misconduct.\n\nIt's unclear what the misconduct entailed. Offenses that can lead to a finding of misconduct can include drug abuse, sexual assault and going AWOL, or \"absent without official leave,\" Ghiotto said.\n\nThe Kansas Bureau of Investigation confirmed Grayson was not convicted of any crimes in Kansas, the state where he was stationed with and discharged from the Army. However, the bureau's records do not reflect whether Grayson was previously arrested or charged with any crimes that were later withdrawn, sent to a diversion program, or did not result in a conviction.\n\nInvisible Institute, Illinois Public Media, and the Investigative Reporting Workshop contacted law enforcement agencies in the counties surrounding Fort Riley. The Riley County Police Department said its only contact with Grayson came in 2015, when he hit a deer with his truck. The Geary County Sheriff's Office refused to search for contacts between its agency and Grayson, claiming over the phone that to do so would be illegal. The Junction City Police Department said it did not have records of any contact with him.\n\nDetails are still emerging about the July 6 shooting of Massey , a Black woman who called the Sangamon County Sheriff's Department because of a suspected intruder at her home. Body-camera footage that has since been released shows that Grayson shot Massey three times after entering her home alongside another deputy and telling her to drop a pot of boiling water she was holding. The footage shows Massey ducking with her hands up, and saying \"I'm sorry,\" before Grayson fired, and that the officer later discouraged his fellow deputy from providing medical aid.\n\n\"She's done,\" Grayson said. \"You can go get it, but that's a head shot.\"\n\nThe case has spurred national outcry and prompted President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to call for further police reform.\n\nFollowing the shooting, Grayson was charged with first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm, and official misconduct. He pleaded not guilty to all charges and is currently being held in the Menard County Jail without bond.\n\nHe was fired by the Sangamon County Sheriff's Office shortly after charges were filed. Sangamon County Sheriff Jack Campbell wrote in a statement posted online that Grayson's actions do not reflect the values or training of his office.\n\n\"Sonya Massey lost her life due to an unjustifiable and reckless decision by former Deputy Sean Grayson,\" Campbell wrote. \"Grayson had other options available that he should have used. He will now face judgment by the criminal justice system and will never again work in law enforcement.\"\n\nIn response to a request from Illinois Times, Campbell said in a statement, \"The sheriff's office had a copy of deputy Grayson's Certificate of Release or Discharge which states that Grayson was given a general honorable discharge from the military.\"\n\nHowever, Ghiotto, the U of I law professor, said the form to which Campbell referred listed the \"character\" of Grayson's service as \"under honorable conditions (general),\" which can be confusing for a lay person. But the nature of Grayson's separation from the military was an involuntary discharge, Ghiotto said.\n\nIn Campbell's statement, he also said his office \"understood that the serious misconduct referenced in these documents was a DUI. We were aware of the DUI at the time of hire.\"\n\nThe sheriff's \"understanding\" appeared to be based on an undated reference letter that Grayson submitted with his application in which Ray Benekin, Grayson's commanding officer in the Army, wrote, \"Aside from Mr. Grayson's DUI, there were no other issues that he had during his tenure in the Army.\"\n\nOther reporting has also shown that Grayson received two DUI convictions in Macoupin County in 2015 and 2016, both of which the Sangamon County Sheriff's Department has confirmed it was aware of. Ghiotto said it's extremely unlikely that a misdemeanor DUI conviction would account for the serious misconduct finding by the Army.\n\nOne of the DUIs took place while Grayson was still on active duty, and the other citation occurred after his discharge.\n\nWhen Grayson was held in Macoupin County Jail, records show he refused to submit a breath sample. After threatening to pee his pants or pee in a trashcan in his holding cell, Grayson told the officer who arrested him that he was \"too small to be making him mad,\" according to records from Macoupin County Sheriff's Office. The records also show that his Kansas license had been suspended, but did not say the reason.\n\nAn online petition calling for Campbell's resignation has garnered over 2,500 signatures, and Massey's father has said he should step down .\n\nCivil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Massey's family, said it is \"appalling\" that Grayson would have been hired despite significant misconduct while in the Army.\n\n\"It makes you wonder what else was missed or overlooked in his hiring process with the sheriff's department,\" Crump said. \"When you look at the video coupled with the fact that he's had six different law enforcement agencies in the last four years, it raises all sorts of red flags.\"\n\nRecords show that Grayson, 30, has worked for six police departments across Central Illinois since 2020.\n\nGrayson started as a part-time officer with the Pawnee Police Department, which did not reply to requests for comment. He remained employed with Pawnee PD for almost a year, and was also hired part-time with the Kincaid Police Department.\n\nKincaid Police Chief DJ Mathon said that Grayson was let go from the job after he refused to live within a 10-mile radius, as required by the Village of Kincaid. He said the department had no records of complaints or disciplinary actions against Grayson during his time there.\n\n\"I watched the video today actually,\" said Mike Lawrence, a member of the Village of Kincaid's Board of Trustees. \"It was disgusting [and] it was shocking because it was so wrong.\"\n\nLawrence confirmed he was unaware of Grayson's discharge from the Army for serious misconduct. The news of Grayson's killing of Massey wasn't a surprise, he said, because of the impression he made while he was at the Kincaid Police Department.\n\n\"I thought he was a loose cannon,\" Lawrence said. \"He was just arrogant and cocky.\"\n\nDays after leaving Kincaid, Grayson began working as a part-time officer at the Virden Police Department, where he remained for seven months and where records show he received no official complaints or discipline. The department said it had no records related to any background investigation at the time of his hiring, making it unclear if one was conducted.\n\nDavid Bounds, dispatch supervisor for the Virden department, said in a letter responding to a records request: \"We did not receive a resignation from Mr. Grayson. He just stopped covering shifts. We were advised that Mr. Grayson left our department to accept a full-time position with the Auburn Police Department. We have no disciplinary actions against Mr. Grayson.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nGrayson took his first full-time police job in July 2021, when he was hired by the Auburn Police Department. He would remain with Auburn until May 2022. Reached by phone, the department declined to comment on his employment.\n\nBut in response to a public records request, the Auburn department turned over documents indicating Grayson resigned effective May 1, 2022, to accept a full-time position with the Logan County Sheriff's Office.\n\nAmong documents supplied by Auburn was the same federal DD Form 214 that listed Grayson's discharge from the Army for serious misconduct. When asked whether that finding by the military raised any concerns among Auburn officials when Grayson was hired in July 2021, city attorney Andrew Jarmer, who didn't represent the city at the time, said, \"I have no idea.\"\n\nIn Grayson's application for employment with the Auburn department, he said he was an Army veteran. When asked the \"type of discharge\" from the military, he wrote one word: honorable.\n\nAfter Auburn, Grayson was hired by Logan County, where he remained for a year before starting as a deputy in Sangamon County in May 2023. While in Logan County, he pursued a vehicle at speeds of 110 mph, against the direct orders of his superiors and eventually hit a deer, according to records obtained by WAND-TV . His supervisors recommended \"high-stress decision making\" training for him.\n\nThe Logan County Sheriff's Office has not responded to requests for comment from Invisible Institute, Illinois Public Media, and the Investigative Reporting Workshop, and the organizations' records request is pending.\n\nGhiotto said that the Army records should have been a \"red flag\" for police departments considering hiring Grayson.\n\n\"I'm very concerned about any law enforcement office hiring somebody who is discharged for serious offense misconduct with a general discharge,\" he said. \"I wouldn't hire a research assistant if they have that on their record, let alone a police officer.\"\n\nThis story was produced in collaboration between Invisible Institute, a nonprofit public accountability journalism organization based in Chicago; the Investigative Reporting Workshop, an independent nonprofit newsroom affiliated with American University in Washington, D.C.; and Illinois Public Media.

In 2022, the department's budget was $275.7 million, or 39 percent of the city's total that year.

      "text": "Video Shows U.S. Marshals Task Force Brutalizing Teenage Boys in Mississippi\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe FBI and the Justice Department are investigating the task force after security footage emerged of a violent arrest in September.\n\nU.S. marshals arrested two boys, ages 17 and 16, in Jackson, Mississippi, on September 16 on charges related to August shootings in the nearby city of Canton. Footage of the arrest shows one officer leading a shirtless, handcuffed boy past another officer, who reaches out and hits the boy across the face, making a loud noise on impact and leaving him bleeding from his mouth or nose. According to a lawyer representing one of the teens and his mother, both boys have said that officers physically assaulted them while they were handcuffed, including by whipping them with a green extension cord, outside the camera's view. The FBI and the Justice Department are investigating the arrest.\n\nThe officers are part of the U.S. Marshals Service Gulf Coast Regional Fugitive Task Force, a federally funded unit that shot and killed a 20-year-old man in Memphis, Tennessee, while serving a warrant for a Mississippi shooting in 2019. Established in 2006, the task force operates in Alabama and Mississippi and deputizes state and local officers as marshals, offering them expanded powers to target people wanted for violent crimes. Their conferred status provides them with privileges including the ability to work across jurisdictions and make arrests without warrants. The marshals do not wear body cameras.\n\nThe September arrest was instead captured on a Ring doorbell camera. The day after, Jackson's local CBS affiliate WJTV reported on a segment of the footage in which an officer hits and yells at one boy, and the boy calls into the security camera for his mother, who was out of town at the time. The Intercept obtained more of the footage, which shows officers further berating both boys, as well as a middle-aged woman, then taking what appears to be the green extension cord with them from the scene. According to the mother of one of the boys, at least one major national network had the full video footage but has not pursued a story.\n\nThe woman in the video, who was housesitting at the time of the arrest, said officers hit her in the head and pointed guns at her before shoving her to the ground in handcuffs and verbally berating her. She is the godsister of Cawanda Harris, the mother of one of the teens, and asked not to be named by the press. Both women say that the officers never produced an arrest warrant for the boys.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\n\"The U.S. Marshals Service is aware of an incident that occurred involving members of our multi-agency Gulf Coast Regional Task Force (GCRTF) in Mississippi,\" Justice Department Office of Public Affairs spokesperson Aryele Bradford said in a statement to The Intercept. \"The U.S. Marshals Service takes any allegation of misconduct by our personnel or task force partners seriously and we are currently gathering information regarding the incident. The Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division, United States Attorney Office and the FBI have opened an investigation, and if the investigation reveals prosecutable violations of any federal criminal statutes, the Department will take appropriate action.\"\n\nLawrence Blackmon, the attorney for Harris and her son, said he believed that a warrant existed but that officers acted improperly by not producing it at the time of the arrest. Blackmon and national civil rights attorney Ben Crump are representing the Harrises. \"The issue here is not the validity of the warrant, it's the way the warrant was carried out,\" Blackmon told The Intercept.\n\nMost Read Trump Administration Texted College Professors' Personal Phones to Ask If They're Jewish Akela Lacy After Tucker Carlson Guest Attacked a Defense Advisory Board, the Pentagon Nuked Its Website Matt Sledge Pentagon Insiders on Hegseth Leak Hypocrisy: \"Full On Shit Show\" Nick Turse\n\nMainstream national media have so far demonstrated little interest in the case, potentially because of the severity of the allegations and charges against the boys. The Canton shootings in August - for which both boys have been charged, along with a 17-year-old who is the brother of one of the boys, and another 24-year-old man - resulted in the deaths of two people, including a 6-year-old boy, and injured another man. The boys are presumed innocent until proven guilty, but law enforcement agencies and media, including local outlets that covered the arrest, aren't framing them as such. Despite the fact that the boys are minors, numerous local outlets printed stories with their full names, and some included their mug shots. WLBT reported the boys' names as suspects in the August shooting, prior to their arrests. The treatment fits into a dangerous pattern in which the media portrays young Black boys as menacing adults, an approach that has shaped the coverage of arrests and high-profile police killings of Black men for decades.\n\nThe footage goes on to show the officers take Harris's godsister to the ground and handcuff her while she is lying on her stomach. Officers ask her to identify one of the boys, who is handcuffed nearby, while she tries to explain that she is housesitting. One officer slaps her on the back of her shoulder while she is facedown on the ground. Another officer tells her that they are both \"going to jail.\" A third officer repeatedly tells her to shut up. \"I think you're making me dumber,\" he says. \"Shut the fuck up, god damn.\"\n\nLater in the video, an officer leads a second shirtless boy out of the house. In the background, one officer slams the first boy to the ground. As the officer walks with the second boy, another officer strikes him across the face, making a loud noise and drawing blood as the boy cries out. Both Harris's godsister and the boy who was struck said the officer was holding a black object in his hand. It's unclear from the video footage what, if anything, the officer is holding.\n\n\"To see law enforcement or any adult do that to a child is very hurtful. You don't do that to nobody, you don't treat nobody that way,\" Harris's godsister told The Intercept. She said she wants to see the officers held responsible and prosecuted. \"Because you're supposed to be upholding the law. I mean, you're supposed to be there to serve and protect, but you come out and you harm. So I want to know how you're gonna uphold the law when you're breaking it yourself.\"\n\nOne of the boys arrested and hit in the face by a marshal said officers whipped him with a green extension cord while he was handcuffed.\n\nSeveral weeks before the arrest, the task force appeared in a strange video from Darkhorse Press, a website in Mississippi dedicated to \"a return to old-school crime reporting.\" Images of allegedly confiscated paraphernalia and footage of people being arrested for various traffic stops and drug possession play over a rock music soundtrack. Advertisements flash for local gun stores, pest control services, and propane delivery. The video describes \"Operation Washout,\" an initiative \"aimed at getting lawbreakers off the streets\" and focused on \"gang enforcement and violent crime\" in Jackson.\n\nDarkhorse Press advertises itself as a news site, but the video, which highlights one officer \"famous for his speeches to young people about staying out of trouble,\" reads more like public relations for law enforcement. Other stories on the Darkhorse site highlight crimes and arrests in Mississippi.\n\nThe Gulf Coast Regional Fugitive Task Force was the subject of a probe launched by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation in 2019 to examine that year's shooting of 20-year-old Brandon Webber in Memphis. Officers, who were attempting to serve a warrant for Webber's arrest, alleging his connection to a shooting in Mississippi, said Webber rammed their vehicles with his and brandished a weapon. The marshals shot him at least 17 times, and Webber died in his mother's driveway.\n\nAfter TBI closed its investigation and turned its findings over to Shelby County District Attorney Amy Weirich last year, Weirich said in July that her office would not prosecute members of the task force for the shooting. The Marshals Service said it would conduct an internal review.\n\nMemphis saw protests after the task force members shot and killed Webber in June 2019. Blackmon was not aware that the same regional task force now accused of assaulting his client had previously shot and killed someone.\n\nIt is unclear whether any of the officers involved in Webber's killing took part in the September arrest. \"We do not discuss or disclose information about specific members or numbers of people assigned to USMS-led task forces,\" Marshals Service spokesperson Dave Oney said in a statement to The Intercept in response to a question about the officers' identities. The Intercept has submitted a public information request to identify the officers involved in both arrests and to obtain the findings of the Marshals Service's review.\n\nThe Marshals Service leads eight congressionally funded regional fugitive task forces and 56 local task forces \"dedicated to reducing violent crime by locating and apprehending wanted criminals,\" Oney said. The agency also leads additional \"ad-hoc fugitive task forces in special cases, e.g., when an inmate escapes from prison,\" he added.\n\nMarshals Service task forces have faced increased scrutiny in recent years for the number of people they kill during arrests. A February analysis from the Marshall Project found that between 2015 and 2020, U.S. marshals, task force members, or local police assisting in a marshals arrest shot 177 people, 124 of them fatally. Seven more people died by suicide after being shot.\n\nHarris and her lawyer filed a tort claim against the officers, the first step to filing a lawsuit in Mississippi. \"My child is standing accused of something he did not do,\" Harris said of the murder charge. \"He wasn't resisting arrest. They were in handcuffs.\"\n\n\"It was traumatizing,\" said her godsister, who added that the officers left the house in shambles and broke dishes. She was afraid that they came there to kill her. \"I have a lot of issues now. I don't sleep, I jump at every loud noise. I'm scared to sleep in the dark.\"\n\nAsked what she would like to see happen to the marshals, Harris said: \"I want them fired.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Deputy Accused of Killing Sonya Massey Was Discharged From Army for Serious Misconduct\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nSean Grayson, who is now charged with murder in the fatal shooting of Sonya Massey, was previously discharged from the U.S. Army for serious misconduct - and still hired at six police departments in Central Illinois.\n\nIn partnership with\n\nThis story was originally published by Invisible Institute, IPM Newsroom, and the Investigative Reporting Workshop\n\nSean Grayson, the former Sangamon County Sheriff's deputy now charged with murder in the fatal shooting of Sonya Massey, was previously discharged from the U.S. Army for serious misconduct, military records show.\n\nGrayson, who is white, was indicted by a grand jury in the July 6 death of Massey, who is Black. Ben Crump, the family's attorney, said the U.S. Department of Justice has also opened an investigation into the incident, but the agency said in a statement that it is \"assessing the circumstances\" and following the criminal case.\n\nDocuments obtained from the Kincaid Police Department in Illinois, where Grayson worked previously, note that Grayson was discharged from the Army in 2016 from the Fort Riley Army installation in Kansas for \"Misconduct (Serious Offense).\" Army officials confirmed Grayson was a wheeled vehicle mechanic from May 2014 to February 2016, but declined to provide further details about his discharge.\n\n\"The Privacy Act and (Department of Defense) policy prevent us from releasing information relating to the misconduct of low-level employees or characterization of service at discharge,\" Army spokesperson Bryce S. Dubee wrote in an email. Officials at Fort Riley and the Fort Riley Military Police directed reporters to file an official records request.\n\nAnthony Ghiotto, a former Air Force prosecutor who now teaches law at the University of Illinois, said there are several reasons why a service member could receive this type of discharge in lieu of a court-martial proceeding or if the member commits a civilian infraction that can't be disciplined through the military justice system.\n\nGhiotto said this kind of discharge suggests that Grayson committed an offense equivalent to something that would have led to at least a year of incarceration for a civilian.\n\n\"A good way of looking at it is, if it would be a misdemeanor in the civilian world, it's not going to be a 'serious offense,'\" he said. He added it's likely Grayson was not court-martialed.\n\nDaniel Fultz, Grayson's defense attorney, declined to comment about the nature of his discharge from the Army. Fultz told Sangamon County Circuit Court Judge Ryan Cadagin on July 17 at Grayson's arraignment that Grayson received an honorable discharge after serving three years in the Army.\n\nHowever, the DD Form 214 summarizing Grayson's tenure in the Army indicates he did not receive an honorable discharge.\n\nGrayson also didn't receive a dis honorable discharge, but Ghiotto said the DD Form 214 indicated Grayson was \"kicked out\" of the Army for serious misconduct before his regular term of enlistment was up.\n\nGrayson received a \"general\" discharge under \"honorable conditions,\" which Ghiotto said means some, but not all, of Grayson's service was honorable. That type of discharge should be a \"red flag\" to potential future employers, Ghiotto said. But he said a \"bigger red flag\" is the listing of misconduct.\n\nIt's unclear what the misconduct entailed. Offenses that can lead to a finding of misconduct can include drug abuse, sexual assault and going AWOL, or \"absent without official leave,\" Ghiotto said.\n\nThe Kansas Bureau of Investigation confirmed Grayson was not convicted of any crimes in Kansas, the state where he was stationed with and discharged from the Army. However, the bureau's records do not reflect whether Grayson was previously arrested or charged with any crimes that were later withdrawn, sent to a diversion program, or did not result in a conviction.\n\nInvisible Institute, Illinois Public Media, and the Investigative Reporting Workshop contacted law enforcement agencies in the counties surrounding Fort Riley. The Riley County Police Department said its only contact with Grayson came in 2015, when he hit a deer with his truck. The Geary County Sheriff's Office refused to search for contacts between its agency and Grayson, claiming over the phone that to do so would be illegal. The Junction City Police Department said it did not have records of any contact with him.\n\nDetails are still emerging about the July 6 shooting of Massey , a Black woman who called the Sangamon County Sheriff's Department because of a suspected intruder at her home. Body-camera footage that has since been released shows that Grayson shot Massey three times after entering her home alongside another deputy and telling her to drop a pot of boiling water she was holding. The footage shows Massey ducking with her hands up, and saying \"I'm sorry,\" before Grayson fired, and that the officer later discouraged his fellow deputy from providing medical aid.\n\n\"She's done,\" Grayson said. \"You can go get it, but that's a head shot.\"\n\nThe case has spurred national outcry and prompted President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to call for further police reform.\n\nFollowing the shooting, Grayson was charged with first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm, and official misconduct. He pleaded not guilty to all charges and is currently being held in the Menard County Jail without bond.\n\nHe was fired by the Sangamon County Sheriff's Office shortly after charges were filed. Sangamon County Sheriff Jack Campbell wrote in a statement posted online that Grayson's actions do not reflect the values or training of his office.\n\n\"Sonya Massey lost her life due to an unjustifiable and reckless decision by former Deputy Sean Grayson,\" Campbell wrote. \"Grayson had other options available that he should have used. He will now face judgment by the criminal justice system and will never again work in law enforcement.\"\n\nIn response to a request from Illinois Times, Campbell said in a statement, \"The sheriff's office had a copy of deputy Grayson's Certificate of Release or Discharge which states that Grayson was given a general honorable discharge from the military.\"\n\nHowever, Ghiotto, the U of I law professor, said the form to which Campbell referred listed the \"character\" of Grayson's service as \"under honorable conditions (general),\" which can be confusing for a lay person. But the nature of Grayson's separation from the military was an involuntary discharge, Ghiotto said.\n\nIn Campbell's statement, he also said his office \"understood that the serious misconduct referenced in these documents was a DUI. We were aware of the DUI at the time of hire.\"\n\nThe sheriff's \"understanding\" appeared to be based on an undated reference letter that Grayson submitted with his application in which Ray Benekin, Grayson's commanding officer in the Army, wrote, \"Aside from Mr. Grayson's DUI, there were no other issues that he had during his tenure in the Army.\"\n\nOther reporting has also shown that Grayson received two DUI convictions in Macoupin County in 2015 and 2016, both of which the Sangamon County Sheriff's Department has confirmed it was aware of. Ghiotto said it's extremely unlikely that a misdemeanor DUI conviction would account for the serious misconduct finding by the Army.\n\nOne of the DUIs took place while Grayson was still on active duty, and the other citation occurred after his discharge.\n\nWhen Grayson was held in Macoupin County Jail, records show he refused to submit a breath sample. After threatening to pee his pants or pee in a trashcan in his holding cell, Grayson told the officer who arrested him that he was \"too small to be making him mad,\" according to records from Macoupin County Sheriff's Office. The records also show that his Kansas license had been suspended, but did not say the reason.\n\nAn online petition calling for Campbell's resignation has garnered over 2,500 signatures, and Massey's father has said he should step down .\n\nCivil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Massey's family, said it is \"appalling\" that Grayson would have been hired despite significant misconduct while in the Army.\n\n\"It makes you wonder what else was missed or overlooked in his hiring process with the sheriff's department,\" Crump said. \"When you look at the video coupled with the fact that he's had six different law enforcement agencies in the last four years, it raises all sorts of red flags.\"\n\nRecords show that Grayson, 30, has worked for six police departments across Central Illinois since 2020.\n\nGrayson started as a part-time officer with the Pawnee Police Department, which did not reply to requests for comment. He remained employed with Pawnee PD for almost a year, and was also hired part-time with the Kincaid Police Department.\n\nKincaid Police Chief DJ Mathon said that Grayson was let go from the job after he refused to live within a 10-mile radius, as required by the Village of Kincaid. He said the department had no records of complaints or disciplinary actions against Grayson during his time there.\n\n\"I watched the video today actually,\" said Mike Lawrence, a member of the Village of Kincaid's Board of Trustees. \"It was disgusting [and] it was shocking because it was so wrong.\"\n\nLawrence confirmed he was unaware of Grayson's discharge from the Army for serious misconduct. The news of Grayson's killing of Massey wasn't a surprise, he said, because of the impression he made while he was at the Kincaid Police Department.\n\n\"I thought he was a loose cannon,\" Lawrence said. \"He was just arrogant and cocky.\"\n\nDays after leaving Kincaid, Grayson began working as a part-time officer at the Virden Police Department, where he remained for seven months and where records show he received no official complaints or discipline. The department said it had no records related to any background investigation at the time of his hiring, making it unclear if one was conducted.\n\nDavid Bounds, dispatch supervisor for the Virden department, said in a letter responding to a records request: \"We did not receive a resignation from Mr. Grayson. He just stopped covering shifts. We were advised that Mr. Grayson left our department to accept a full-time position with the Auburn Police Department. We have no disciplinary actions against Mr. Grayson.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nGrayson took his first full-time police job in July 2021, when he was hired by the Auburn Police Department. He would remain with Auburn until May 2022. Reached by phone, the department declined to comment on his employment.\n\nBut in response to a public records request, the Auburn department turned over documents indicating Grayson resigned effective May 1, 2022, to accept a full-time position with the Logan County Sheriff's Office.\n\nAmong documents supplied by Auburn was the same federal DD Form 214 that listed Grayson's discharge from the Army for serious misconduct. When asked whether that finding by the military raised any concerns among Auburn officials when Grayson was hired in July 2021, city attorney Andrew Jarmer, who didn't represent the city at the time, said, \"I have no idea.\"\n\nIn Grayson's application for employment with the Auburn department, he said he was an Army veteran. When asked the \"type of discharge\" from the military, he wrote one word: honorable.\n\nAfter Auburn, Grayson was hired by Logan County, where he remained for a year before starting as a deputy in Sangamon County in May 2023. While in Logan County, he pursued a vehicle at speeds of 110 mph, against the direct orders of his superiors and eventually hit a deer, according to records obtained by WAND-TV . His supervisors recommended \"high-stress decision making\" training for him.\n\nThe Logan County Sheriff's Office has not responded to requests for comment from Invisible Institute, Illinois Public Media, and the Investigative Reporting Workshop, and the organizations' records request is pending.\n\nGhiotto said that the Army records should have been a \"red flag\" for police departments considering hiring Grayson.\n\n\"I'm very concerned about any law enforcement office hiring somebody who is discharged for serious offense misconduct with a general discharge,\" he said. \"I wouldn't hire a research assistant if they have that on their record, let alone a police officer.\"\n\nThis story was produced in collaboration between Invisible Institute, a nonprofit public accountability journalism organization based in Chicago; the Investigative Reporting Workshop, an independent nonprofit newsroom affiliated with American University in Washington, D.C.; and Illinois Public Media.

The father, skateboarder, and photographer died three days later in the hospital from injuries inflicted by the police.\n\nThe Memphis police unit, Street Crimes Operation to Restore Peace in Our Neighborhoods, or SCORPION, is part of a trend in policing in which highly armed groups of police are dispatched to \"high-crime\" areas that tend to be home to Black and brown residents.\n\nWe're independent of corporate interests - and powered by members.

Delivered to you. I'm in The specialized units have been popping up all over the country, proposed in response to reports of rising violent crime. Some of the anti-crime units have been accused of excessive force; in the killing of 26-year-old Breonna Taylor by Louisville, Kentucky, police in 2020, that force was deadly. In addition, the units, as in the case of SCORPION in Memphis, are expensive to maintain, rekindling a national debate about the funding of police departments.\n\nOriginal reporting.

In 2022, the department's budget was $275.7 million, or 39 percent of the city's total that year. Of that sum, $28.3 million was allocated to a division for special operations that includes the organized crime unit, which houses the SCORPION unit that stopped Nichols, along with air support, a canine unit, mounted patrol, traffic, and other teams.\n\nIn a May city council meeting on the department's 2023 budget outlook, Police Chief Cerelyn Davis discussed some of the department's highlights for the year, including the creation of crime-targeting units like SCORPION, which Davis said \"have been very effective.\"\n\nThe Memphis Police Department's proposed budget for 2023 is $284.75 million, an increase of just under $10 million.\n\nThe Memphis Police Department's newly formed SCORPION Unit prepare to patrol for the first time on Nov. 12, 2021.\n\nMemphis launched the SCORPION unit in October 2021 as part of Mayor Jim Strickland's strategy to fight crime and gun violence after a record number of homicides that year. Part of the organized crime division, the unit was composed of 40 officers and used crime data to determine where it would conduct enforcement activities.\n\nIn its first three months in operation, the SCORPION unit made more than 560 arrests .\n\nOn Saturday, the Memphis Police Department announced that the unit would be disbanded after \"listening intently\" to Nichols's family, community leaders, and other officers. A former Memphis cop told CBS News that the unit was composed of young officers with little experience and that training was scant and included three days of PowerPoint presentations, one day of training in suspect apprehension, and one day at a firing range.\n\nIn a statement made Thursday, Ben Crump, the attorney representing Nichols's family, specifically criticized the SCORPION unit and others like it around the country.\n\n\"'Pro-active policing' or 'saturation unit policing,' whether the officers are in unmarked cars wearing tactical vests or 'jump-out boys' in plain clothes and undercover, is defined by several common and dangerous components,\" Crump said. \"The behavior of these units can morph into 'wolf pack' misconduct that takes away a person's liberty or freedom to move, akin to a kidnapping.\"\n\nThe traffic stop that led to Nichols's death, Crump said, was \"far outside the unit's stated purpose of stemming violent crime.\"\n\nNationally, debates about police funding have become a hot-button electoral issue. The call to defund gained steam among activists and the left wing of the Democratic Party, leading to attacks from Republicans who, without evidence, painted their opponents as soft on crime. The result has been that most Democratic Party politicians outdo one another to burnish pro-police bona fides.\n\nThat trend, said Mitchell, the Working Families Party director, is based on a logic that continues to give police huge budgets - and carte blanche - to pursue policies and tactics that harm urban communities.\n\nMitchell said, \"Memphis should be a wake up call for Democrats.\"\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren't on the beat?\n\nThe kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable.

      "text": "Deputy Accused of Killing Sonya Massey Was Discharged From Army for Serious Misconduct\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nSean Grayson, who is now charged with murder in the fatal shooting of Sonya Massey, was previously discharged from the U.S. Army for serious misconduct - and still hired at six police departments in Central Illinois.\n\nIn partnership with\n\nThis story was originally published by Invisible Institute, IPM Newsroom, and the Investigative Reporting Workshop\n\nSean Grayson, the former Sangamon County Sheriff's deputy now charged with murder in the fatal shooting of Sonya Massey, was previously discharged from the U.S. Army for serious misconduct, military records show.\n\nGrayson, who is white, was indicted by a grand jury in the July 6 death of Massey, who is Black. Ben Crump, the family's attorney, said the U.S. Department of Justice has also opened an investigation into the incident, but the agency said in a statement that it is \"assessing the circumstances\" and following the criminal case.\n\nDocuments obtained from the Kincaid Police Department in Illinois, where Grayson worked previously, note that Grayson was discharged from the Army in 2016 from the Fort Riley Army installation in Kansas for \"Misconduct (Serious Offense).\" Army officials confirmed Grayson was a wheeled vehicle mechanic from May 2014 to February 2016, but declined to provide further details about his discharge.\n\n\"The Privacy Act and (Department of Defense) policy prevent us from releasing information relating to the misconduct of low-level employees or characterization of service at discharge,\" Army spokesperson Bryce S. Dubee wrote in an email. Officials at Fort Riley and the Fort Riley Military Police directed reporters to file an official records request.\n\nAnthony Ghiotto, a former Air Force prosecutor who now teaches law at the University of Illinois, said there are several reasons why a service member could receive this type of discharge in lieu of a court-martial proceeding or if the member commits a civilian infraction that can't be disciplined through the military justice system.\n\nGhiotto said this kind of discharge suggests that Grayson committed an offense equivalent to something that would have led to at least a year of incarceration for a civilian.\n\n\"A good way of looking at it is, if it would be a misdemeanor in the civilian world, it's not going to be a 'serious offense,'\" he said. He added it's likely Grayson was not court-martialed.\n\nDaniel Fultz, Grayson's defense attorney, declined to comment about the nature of his discharge from the Army. Fultz told Sangamon County Circuit Court Judge Ryan Cadagin on July 17 at Grayson's arraignment that Grayson received an honorable discharge after serving three years in the Army.\n\nHowever, the DD Form 214 summarizing Grayson's tenure in the Army indicates he did not receive an honorable discharge.\n\nGrayson also didn't receive a dis honorable discharge, but Ghiotto said the DD Form 214 indicated Grayson was \"kicked out\" of the Army for serious misconduct before his regular term of enlistment was up.\n\nGrayson received a \"general\" discharge under \"honorable conditions,\" which Ghiotto said means some, but not all, of Grayson's service was honorable. That type of discharge should be a \"red flag\" to potential future employers, Ghiotto said. But he said a \"bigger red flag\" is the listing of misconduct.\n\nIt's unclear what the misconduct entailed. Offenses that can lead to a finding of misconduct can include drug abuse, sexual assault and going AWOL, or \"absent without official leave,\" Ghiotto said.\n\nThe Kansas Bureau of Investigation confirmed Grayson was not convicted of any crimes in Kansas, the state where he was stationed with and discharged from the Army. However, the bureau's records do not reflect whether Grayson was previously arrested or charged with any crimes that were later withdrawn, sent to a diversion program, or did not result in a conviction.\n\nInvisible Institute, Illinois Public Media, and the Investigative Reporting Workshop contacted law enforcement agencies in the counties surrounding Fort Riley. The Riley County Police Department said its only contact with Grayson came in 2015, when he hit a deer with his truck. The Geary County Sheriff's Office refused to search for contacts between its agency and Grayson, claiming over the phone that to do so would be illegal. The Junction City Police Department said it did not have records of any contact with him.\n\nDetails are still emerging about the July 6 shooting of Massey , a Black woman who called the Sangamon County Sheriff's Department because of a suspected intruder at her home. Body-camera footage that has since been released shows that Grayson shot Massey three times after entering her home alongside another deputy and telling her to drop a pot of boiling water she was holding. The footage shows Massey ducking with her hands up, and saying \"I'm sorry,\" before Grayson fired, and that the officer later discouraged his fellow deputy from providing medical aid.\n\n\"She's done,\" Grayson said. \"You can go get it, but that's a head shot.\"\n\nThe case has spurred national outcry and prompted President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to call for further police reform.\n\nFollowing the shooting, Grayson was charged with first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm, and official misconduct. He pleaded not guilty to all charges and is currently being held in the Menard County Jail without bond.\n\nHe was fired by the Sangamon County Sheriff's Office shortly after charges were filed. Sangamon County Sheriff Jack Campbell wrote in a statement posted online that Grayson's actions do not reflect the values or training of his office.\n\n\"Sonya Massey lost her life due to an unjustifiable and reckless decision by former Deputy Sean Grayson,\" Campbell wrote. \"Grayson had other options available that he should have used. He will now face judgment by the criminal justice system and will never again work in law enforcement.\"\n\nIn response to a request from Illinois Times, Campbell said in a statement, \"The sheriff's office had a copy of deputy Grayson's Certificate of Release or Discharge which states that Grayson was given a general honorable discharge from the military.\"\n\nHowever, Ghiotto, the U of I law professor, said the form to which Campbell referred listed the \"character\" of Grayson's service as \"under honorable conditions (general),\" which can be confusing for a lay person. But the nature of Grayson's separation from the military was an involuntary discharge, Ghiotto said.\n\nIn Campbell's statement, he also said his office \"understood that the serious misconduct referenced in these documents was a DUI. We were aware of the DUI at the time of hire.\"\n\nThe sheriff's \"understanding\" appeared to be based on an undated reference letter that Grayson submitted with his application in which Ray Benekin, Grayson's commanding officer in the Army, wrote, \"Aside from Mr. Grayson's DUI, there were no other issues that he had during his tenure in the Army.\"\n\nOther reporting has also shown that Grayson received two DUI convictions in Macoupin County in 2015 and 2016, both of which the Sangamon County Sheriff's Department has confirmed it was aware of. Ghiotto said it's extremely unlikely that a misdemeanor DUI conviction would account for the serious misconduct finding by the Army.\n\nOne of the DUIs took place while Grayson was still on active duty, and the other citation occurred after his discharge.\n\nWhen Grayson was held in Macoupin County Jail, records show he refused to submit a breath sample. After threatening to pee his pants or pee in a trashcan in his holding cell, Grayson told the officer who arrested him that he was \"too small to be making him mad,\" according to records from Macoupin County Sheriff's Office. The records also show that his Kansas license had been suspended, but did not say the reason.\n\nAn online petition calling for Campbell's resignation has garnered over 2,500 signatures, and Massey's father has said he should step down .\n\nCivil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Massey's family, said it is \"appalling\" that Grayson would have been hired despite significant misconduct while in the Army.\n\n\"It makes you wonder what else was missed or overlooked in his hiring process with the sheriff's department,\" Crump said. \"When you look at the video coupled with the fact that he's had six different law enforcement agencies in the last four years, it raises all sorts of red flags.\"\n\nRecords show that Grayson, 30, has worked for six police departments across Central Illinois since 2020.\n\nGrayson started as a part-time officer with the Pawnee Police Department, which did not reply to requests for comment. He remained employed with Pawnee PD for almost a year, and was also hired part-time with the Kincaid Police Department.\n\nKincaid Police Chief DJ Mathon said that Grayson was let go from the job after he refused to live within a 10-mile radius, as required by the Village of Kincaid. He said the department had no records of complaints or disciplinary actions against Grayson during his time there.\n\n\"I watched the video today actually,\" said Mike Lawrence, a member of the Village of Kincaid's Board of Trustees. \"It was disgusting [and] it was shocking because it was so wrong.\"\n\nLawrence confirmed he was unaware of Grayson's discharge from the Army for serious misconduct. The news of Grayson's killing of Massey wasn't a surprise, he said, because of the impression he made while he was at the Kincaid Police Department.\n\n\"I thought he was a loose cannon,\" Lawrence said. \"He was just arrogant and cocky.\"\n\nDays after leaving Kincaid, Grayson began working as a part-time officer at the Virden Police Department, where he remained for seven months and where records show he received no official complaints or discipline. The department said it had no records related to any background investigation at the time of his hiring, making it unclear if one was conducted.\n\nDavid Bounds, dispatch supervisor for the Virden department, said in a letter responding to a records request: \"We did not receive a resignation from Mr. Grayson. He just stopped covering shifts. We were advised that Mr. Grayson left our department to accept a full-time position with the Auburn Police Department. We have no disciplinary actions against Mr. Grayson.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nGrayson took his first full-time police job in July 2021, when he was hired by the Auburn Police Department. He would remain with Auburn until May 2022. Reached by phone, the department declined to comment on his employment.\n\nBut in response to a public records request, the Auburn department turned over documents indicating Grayson resigned effective May 1, 2022, to accept a full-time position with the Logan County Sheriff's Office.\n\nAmong documents supplied by Auburn was the same federal DD Form 214 that listed Grayson's discharge from the Army for serious misconduct. When asked whether that finding by the military raised any concerns among Auburn officials when Grayson was hired in July 2021, city attorney Andrew Jarmer, who didn't represent the city at the time, said, \"I have no idea.\"\n\nIn Grayson's application for employment with the Auburn department, he said he was an Army veteran. When asked the \"type of discharge\" from the military, he wrote one word: honorable.\n\nAfter Auburn, Grayson was hired by Logan County, where he remained for a year before starting as a deputy in Sangamon County in May 2023. While in Logan County, he pursued a vehicle at speeds of 110 mph, against the direct orders of his superiors and eventually hit a deer, according to records obtained by WAND-TV . His supervisors recommended \"high-stress decision making\" training for him.\n\nThe Logan County Sheriff's Office has not responded to requests for comment from Invisible Institute, Illinois Public Media, and the Investigative Reporting Workshop, and the organizations' records request is pending.\n\nGhiotto said that the Army records should have been a \"red flag\" for police departments considering hiring Grayson.\n\n\"I'm very concerned about any law enforcement office hiring somebody who is discharged for serious offense misconduct with a general discharge,\" he said. \"I wouldn't hire a research assistant if they have that on their record, let alone a police officer.\"\n\nThis story was produced in collaboration between Invisible Institute, a nonprofit public accountability journalism organization based in Chicago; the Investigative Reporting Workshop, an independent nonprofit newsroom affiliated with American University in Washington, D.C.; and Illinois Public Media.

When asked whether that finding by the military raised any concerns among Auburn officials when Grayson was hired in July 2021, city attorney Andrew Jarmer, who didn't represent the city at the time, said, \"I have no idea.\"\n\nIn Grayson's application for employment with the Auburn department, he said he was an Army veteran. When asked the \"type of discharge\" from the military, he wrote one word: honorable.\n\nAfter Auburn, Grayson was hired by Logan County, where he remained for a year before starting as a deputy in Sangamon County in May 2023. While in Logan County, he pursued a vehicle at speeds of 110 mph, against the direct orders of his superiors and eventually hit a deer, according to records obtained by WAND-TV . His supervisors recommended \"high-stress decision making\" training for him.\n\nThe Logan County Sheriff's Office has not responded to requests for comment from Invisible Institute, Illinois Public Media, and the Investigative Reporting Workshop, and the organizations' records request is pending.\n\nGhiotto said that the Army records should have been a \"red flag\" for police departments considering hiring Grayson.\n\n\"I'm very concerned about any law enforcement office hiring somebody who is discharged for serious offense misconduct with a general discharge,\" he said. \"I wouldn't hire a research assistant if they have that on their record, let alone a police officer.\"\n\nThis story was produced in collaboration between Invisible Institute, a nonprofit public accountability journalism organization based in Chicago; the Investigative Reporting Workshop, an independent nonprofit newsroom affiliated with American University in Washington, D.C.; and Illinois Public Media.

      "text": "Deputy Accused of Killing Sonya Massey Was Discharged From Army for Serious Misconduct\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nSean Grayson, who is now charged with murder in the fatal shooting of Sonya Massey, was previously discharged from the U.S. Army for serious misconduct - and still hired at six police departments in Central Illinois.\n\nIn partnership with\n\nThis story was originally published by Invisible Institute, IPM Newsroom, and the Investigative Reporting Workshop\n\nSean Grayson, the former Sangamon County Sheriff's deputy now charged with murder in the fatal shooting of Sonya Massey, was previously discharged from the U.S. Army for serious misconduct, military records show.\n\nGrayson, who is white, was indicted by a grand jury in the July 6 death of Massey, who is Black. Ben Crump, the family's attorney, said the U.S. Department of Justice has also opened an investigation into the incident, but the agency said in a statement that it is \"assessing the circumstances\" and following the criminal case.\n\nDocuments obtained from the Kincaid Police Department in Illinois, where Grayson worked previously, note that Grayson was discharged from the Army in 2016 from the Fort Riley Army installation in Kansas for \"Misconduct (Serious Offense).\" Army officials confirmed Grayson was a wheeled vehicle mechanic from May 2014 to February 2016, but declined to provide further details about his discharge.\n\n\"The Privacy Act and (Department of Defense) policy prevent us from releasing information relating to the misconduct of low-level employees or characterization of service at discharge,\" Army spokesperson Bryce S. Dubee wrote in an email. Officials at Fort Riley and the Fort Riley Military Police directed reporters to file an official records request.\n\nAnthony Ghiotto, a former Air Force prosecutor who now teaches law at the University of Illinois, said there are several reasons why a service member could receive this type of discharge in lieu of a court-martial proceeding or if the member commits a civilian infraction that can't be disciplined through the military justice system.\n\nGhiotto said this kind of discharge suggests that Grayson committed an offense equivalent to something that would have led to at least a year of incarceration for a civilian.\n\n\"A good way of looking at it is, if it would be a misdemeanor in the civilian world, it's not going to be a 'serious offense,'\" he said. He added it's likely Grayson was not court-martialed.\n\nDaniel Fultz, Grayson's defense attorney, declined to comment about the nature of his discharge from the Army. Fultz told Sangamon County Circuit Court Judge Ryan Cadagin on July 17 at Grayson's arraignment that Grayson received an honorable discharge after serving three years in the Army.\n\nHowever, the DD Form 214 summarizing Grayson's tenure in the Army indicates he did not receive an honorable discharge.\n\nGrayson also didn't receive a dis honorable discharge, but Ghiotto said the DD Form 214 indicated Grayson was \"kicked out\" of the Army for serious misconduct before his regular term of enlistment was up.\n\nGrayson received a \"general\" discharge under \"honorable conditions,\" which Ghiotto said means some, but not all, of Grayson's service was honorable. That type of discharge should be a \"red flag\" to potential future employers, Ghiotto said. But he said a \"bigger red flag\" is the listing of misconduct.\n\nIt's unclear what the misconduct entailed. Offenses that can lead to a finding of misconduct can include drug abuse, sexual assault and going AWOL, or \"absent without official leave,\" Ghiotto said.\n\nThe Kansas Bureau of Investigation confirmed Grayson was not convicted of any crimes in Kansas, the state where he was stationed with and discharged from the Army. However, the bureau's records do not reflect whether Grayson was previously arrested or charged with any crimes that were later withdrawn, sent to a diversion program, or did not result in a conviction.\n\nInvisible Institute, Illinois Public Media, and the Investigative Reporting Workshop contacted law enforcement agencies in the counties surrounding Fort Riley. The Riley County Police Department said its only contact with Grayson came in 2015, when he hit a deer with his truck. The Geary County Sheriff's Office refused to search for contacts between its agency and Grayson, claiming over the phone that to do so would be illegal. The Junction City Police Department said it did not have records of any contact with him.\n\nDetails are still emerging about the July 6 shooting of Massey , a Black woman who called the Sangamon County Sheriff's Department because of a suspected intruder at her home. Body-camera footage that has since been released shows that Grayson shot Massey three times after entering her home alongside another deputy and telling her to drop a pot of boiling water she was holding. The footage shows Massey ducking with her hands up, and saying \"I'm sorry,\" before Grayson fired, and that the officer later discouraged his fellow deputy from providing medical aid.\n\n\"She's done,\" Grayson said. \"You can go get it, but that's a head shot.\"\n\nThe case has spurred national outcry and prompted President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to call for further police reform.\n\nFollowing the shooting, Grayson was charged with first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm, and official misconduct. He pleaded not guilty to all charges and is currently being held in the Menard County Jail without bond.\n\nHe was fired by the Sangamon County Sheriff's Office shortly after charges were filed. Sangamon County Sheriff Jack Campbell wrote in a statement posted online that Grayson's actions do not reflect the values or training of his office.\n\n\"Sonya Massey lost her life due to an unjustifiable and reckless decision by former Deputy Sean Grayson,\" Campbell wrote. \"Grayson had other options available that he should have used. He will now face judgment by the criminal justice system and will never again work in law enforcement.\"\n\nIn response to a request from Illinois Times, Campbell said in a statement, \"The sheriff's office had a copy of deputy Grayson's Certificate of Release or Discharge which states that Grayson was given a general honorable discharge from the military.\"\n\nHowever, Ghiotto, the U of I law professor, said the form to which Campbell referred listed the \"character\" of Grayson's service as \"under honorable conditions (general),\" which can be confusing for a lay person. But the nature of Grayson's separation from the military was an involuntary discharge, Ghiotto said.\n\nIn Campbell's statement, he also said his office \"understood that the serious misconduct referenced in these documents was a DUI. We were aware of the DUI at the time of hire.\"\n\nThe sheriff's \"understanding\" appeared to be based on an undated reference letter that Grayson submitted with his application in which Ray Benekin, Grayson's commanding officer in the Army, wrote, \"Aside from Mr. Grayson's DUI, there were no other issues that he had during his tenure in the Army.\"\n\nOther reporting has also shown that Grayson received two DUI convictions in Macoupin County in 2015 and 2016, both of which the Sangamon County Sheriff's Department has confirmed it was aware of. Ghiotto said it's extremely unlikely that a misdemeanor DUI conviction would account for the serious misconduct finding by the Army.\n\nOne of the DUIs took place while Grayson was still on active duty, and the other citation occurred after his discharge.\n\nWhen Grayson was held in Macoupin County Jail, records show he refused to submit a breath sample. After threatening to pee his pants or pee in a trashcan in his holding cell, Grayson told the officer who arrested him that he was \"too small to be making him mad,\" according to records from Macoupin County Sheriff's Office. The records also show that his Kansas license had been suspended, but did not say the reason.\n\nAn online petition calling for Campbell's resignation has garnered over 2,500 signatures, and Massey's father has said he should step down .\n\nCivil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Massey's family, said it is \"appalling\" that Grayson would have been hired despite significant misconduct while in the Army.\n\n\"It makes you wonder what else was missed or overlooked in his hiring process with the sheriff's department,\" Crump said. \"When you look at the video coupled with the fact that he's had six different law enforcement agencies in the last four years, it raises all sorts of red flags.\"\n\nRecords show that Grayson, 30, has worked for six police departments across Central Illinois since 2020.\n\nGrayson started as a part-time officer with the Pawnee Police Department, which did not reply to requests for comment. He remained employed with Pawnee PD for almost a year, and was also hired part-time with the Kincaid Police Department.\n\nKincaid Police Chief DJ Mathon said that Grayson was let go from the job after he refused to live within a 10-mile radius, as required by the Village of Kincaid. He said the department had no records of complaints or disciplinary actions against Grayson during his time there.\n\n\"I watched the video today actually,\" said Mike Lawrence, a member of the Village of Kincaid's Board of Trustees. \"It was disgusting [and] it was shocking because it was so wrong.\"\n\nLawrence confirmed he was unaware of Grayson's discharge from the Army for serious misconduct. The news of Grayson's killing of Massey wasn't a surprise, he said, because of the impression he made while he was at the Kincaid Police Department.\n\n\"I thought he was a loose cannon,\" Lawrence said. \"He was just arrogant and cocky.\"\n\nDays after leaving Kincaid, Grayson began working as a part-time officer at the Virden Police Department, where he remained for seven months and where records show he received no official complaints or discipline. The department said it had no records related to any background investigation at the time of his hiring, making it unclear if one was conducted.\n\nDavid Bounds, dispatch supervisor for the Virden department, said in a letter responding to a records request: \"We did not receive a resignation from Mr. Grayson. He just stopped covering shifts. We were advised that Mr. Grayson left our department to accept a full-time position with the Auburn Police Department. We have no disciplinary actions against Mr. Grayson.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you.

      "text": "The Attorney for Stephon Clark's Family Alleges Officers Who Shot Him Violated Department Policy\n\nDemonstrators protest the police killing of Stephon Clark in New York City on March 28. Erik Mcgregor/Pacific Press via ZUMA Wire\n\nBen Crump, the civil rights attorney representing the family of Stephon Clark, tells Mother Jones he believes the Sacramento police officers who shot Clark, unarmed in his grandmother's backyard, \"absolutely\" violated the department's policies on use of force, specifically one requiring them to use de-escalation tactics. One major error, he says, was when they left a position of cover behind the wall of the house and moved into the yard to engage Clark in the open.\n\nCrump made the comments while leaving a press conference after Clark's funeral Thursday morning in Sacramento.\n\n\"If they would have offered a less intrusive measure, a less lethal way of using force, Stephon Clark would be here today,\" Crump said. \"And it would have been one of the things that was within their policies.\"\n\nAsked what remaining behind the wall would have allowed officers to do differently, Crump responded: \"They could have gave commands, gave him time to comply.\" He added: \"They did not have to shoot him.\"\n\nThe Sacramento Police Department's use of force policy calls on officers to attempt to de-escalate a situation \"where it may be accomplished without increasing the risk of harm to officers or others.\" Such tactics, according to the policy, can include \"gathering information about the incident; assessing risks; gathering resources (personnel and equipment); using time, distance, cover; using crisis intervention techniques; and communicating and coordinating a response.\"\n\nCrump said he believes his investigation of the shooting will prove that the two officers who shot at Clark 20 times violated that requirement.\n\nHis analysis of officers' conduct dovetails another one detailed to Mother Jones by prominent San Francisco Bay Area civil rights attorney John Burris. Burris helped to craft the language in several of the Sacramento Police Department's policies governing officers' conduct during use of force incidents. He told me he believes the officers who shot Clark violated at least three department rules when they engaged with Clark. Among the rules violated, Burris said, was a requirement that officers \"continuously reassess the perceived threat\" to determine what level of force is appropriate. Officers could-and should-have done that from their initial position of cover behind a wall of the house, Burris said.\n\n\"If you're in a position of cover, you're in a position to assess better, you can give commands and take the time to see whether or not there's an effort to comply,\" Burris said. \"But if you don't, and you feel that you're exposed because you've broken cover, then you may react more quickly and [be] quicker [to] use deadly force than you would have if you had been in a position of cover.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "She Called the Police for Help. They Killed Her Instead.\n\nIllinois State Police\n\nUpdate: On Tuesday, Attorney Ben Crump announced that the Department of Justice will be investigating the death of Sonya Massey, who was shot and killed by a former Illinois sheriff's deputy earlier this month.\n\n\"We don't know what the scope is. We just know they've opened an investigation file on Sonya Massey,\" said Crump in a press conference . \"Obviously, with the family's guidance, if the family wants them to go deeper, we're going to advocate for them to go deeper.\"\n\nOn Monday, an Illinois county sheriff's department released body camera footage showing the fatal shooting of a Black woman who originally called 911 for help. Earlier this month, Deputy Sean Grayson shot 36-year-old Sonya Massey after she attempted to move a pot of water off of her stove at the officer's behest.\n\nThe Sangamon County Sheriff's Office has reportedly fired Grayson, who was later charged with first-degree murder last week . He's pleaded not guilty.\n\n\"She needed a helping hand,\" attorney Ben Crump said at a press conference on Monday. \"She didn't need a bullet to the face.\" On July 6, Massey reportedly called the authorities about a potential prowler around her Springfield home. Officer Grayson and another deputy arrived on the scene.\n\nWhile asking her a few questions, Grayson asked her to turn off her stove, where a pot of water was reportedly boiling. Massey gets up to turn it off and pick up the pot. The officers then step back. She asks where they're going; Grayson replies, \"Away from your hot steaming water.\"\n\nMassey then says, \"I rebuke you in the name of Jesus.\" Grayson responds that she \"better not,\" threatening to shoot her \"in her fucking face.\" She apologizes before three shots ring in the air.\n\nAs Massey laid bleeding in her kitchen, the other unnamed officer said he was going to get his medical kit from his car when Grayson said, \"Nah, she's done. You can go get it, but that's a headshot.\"\n\nFollowing the shooting, the 30-year-old deputy referred to Massey as a \"crazy fucking bitch\" to other officers who arrived on the scene. Grayson's body camera was reportedly turned off for most of the shooting.\n\nThe footage of Massey's death, captured by the other deputy's body camera, shocked the nation. Several local, state, and federal officials have condemned the officer's actions. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris both released statements calling for justice for Massey's family on Tuesday.\n\n\"Sonya Massey deserved to be safe,\" said Harris. \"After she called the police for help, she was tragically killed in her own home at the hands of a responding officer sworn to protect and serve.\"\n\nIn an interview with CNN, her father, James Wilburn, alleged that law enforcement had given them conflicting information about his daughter's death, leading him to believe that a robber had killed her. Massey's killing has devastated him.\n\n\"Sonya was a daddy's girl. She never ended a conversation-whether by text or telephone or in person-without saying, 'Daddy, I love you,\" her father, James Wilburn, told CNN's Laura Coates in an interview . \"And that's the last message I have from my daughter that's saved on my voicemail, was 'Daddy, I love you.'\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

All of these medical miracles were made possible by Henrietta Lacks, a Virginia woman whose cells were taken without her permission in the early 1950s and used for an enormous range of medical research over the decades that followed. Now more than 70 years later, her family is finally being financially compensated. On Monday, Lacks' living relatives reached a history-making settlement with Thermo Fisher Scientific, a Massachusetts-based biotech company worth more than $216 billion .\n\nWhile the contents of the settlement are confidential, the family spoke at a press conference in Baltimore on Tuesday-what would've been Lacks' 103rd birthday.\n\n\"I can think of no better present...than to give her family some measure of respect for Henrietta Lacks, some measure of dignity for Henrietta Lacks, and most of all some measure of justice for Henrietta Lacks,\" said famed civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represented the family in the lawsuit.\n\nIn 1951, Lacks, a 31-year-old Black woman and mother of five, was being treated for cervical cancer in a segregated ward at Maryland's John Hopkins hospital. During her treatment, a white male doctor took samples from her tumor without her consent. Once it was found that her cells could replicate outside of her body-the very first discovery of its kind-the cells were distributed to other researchers.\n\nLacks died eight months after her diagnosis, but her cells would continue to live on, being used in countless medical advances, including research into Covid-19 . Studies involving \"HeLa\" cells-a portmanteau of the first two letters of Lacks' name-have been noted in at least 110,000 scientific publications . For decades, her contributions were not recognized and her family wasn't compensated. Her name entered the cultural spotlight after her life was documented in Rebecca Skloot's 2010 biography , The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, and once again in 2017, with the release of a movie adaptation .\n\nIn 2021, Lacks' descendants filed a lawsuit against Thermo Fisher Scientific, accusing the company of commercializing and profiting off of her cells. The family's attorneys described their victory as a massive step forward for other people who have been similarly victimized by racist medical institutions.\n\n\"If we can get justice for Henrietta Lacks, maybe we can start to tear down the layers of medical racism that exist even to this day,\" Crump told the Baltimore Banner .\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Gerald Herbert/AP\n\nOn Sunday, Ben Crump, an attorney representing the family of Tyre Nichols, called on Congress to pass police reform legislation in the wake of Nichols' death at the hands of Memphis police earlier this month.\n\n\"Shame on us if we don't use his tragic death to finally get the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act passed,\" Crump said on CNN. The legislation , which has passed twice in the House, would limit qualified immunity for police officers, restrict the types of force police can use, and make it easier for the Justice Department to investigate police misconduct.\n\nThe five officers who brutally beat Nichols have been fired and are facing murder charges .

The path for the bill to become law has gotten harder now that Republicans control the House of Representatives.\n\nThe bill would ban chokeholds and no-knock warrants in federal drug cases, as well as create a national registry of police misconduct and force police departments to collect more data, NPR reported . The bill would also push more money toward community-based policing. It would mostly affect federal law enforcement.\n\nCrump argued that there hasn't been federal police form legislation since Lyndon Johnson was president. \"It didn't happen with Rodney King, it didn't happen with Michael Brown in Ferguson and it didn't happen with George Floyd,\" he continued. \"How many of these tragedies do we have to see on video before we say we have a problem, America?\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "It's Been Two Years Since Cops Killed Tyre Nichols. Here's What You Need to Know.\n\nRon Adar via Zuma Press\n\nJanuary 10, 2025, marks the second anniversary of the death of Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man who was restrained and fatally beaten by five now-former Memphis police officers during a traffic stop. After countless marches, talks with politicians, and pending court cases, his family are still fighting for justice for their loved one.\n\n\"This year has been unbearable,\" said his mother, RowVaughn Wells, at a vigil on Tuesday. \"I had to listen to a cop tell people that they just stopped my son for nothing, that he was not a threat. We had to hear all of this. But what made it so difficult is the fact that it finally sank in that I would never see my son again.\"\n\nReleased three weeks after his death, the video of Nichols' brutal beating shook the nation, with then-President Biden calling Wells to express his condolences. Attorney Anthony Romanucci described Nichols as \"a human piñata for those police officers.\"\n\nOne of the most high-profile cases of police brutality of 2023, the widespread coverage of his death helped shine a light on the long history of misconduct by the Memphis Police Deparment, and reignited the nation's long-held conversation about police brutality.\n\nAs we approach the two-year anniversary of Nichols' passing, here's what you need to know about the case.\n\nNichols was beaten by five members of Memphis PD's SCORPION Unit, a police task force that was hastily disbanded after footage of the attack was released to the public.\n\nIn January 0f 2023, Emmitt Martin, Desmond Mills Jr., Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, and Justin Smith were all arrested and hit with several state felony charges. A federal court indicted them eight months later.\n\nIn October 2024, a judge found Bean, Haley and Smith guilty on federal charges of witness tampering; however, they dodged the most serious charge levied against them: violating Nichols' civil rights, causing his death.\n\nAvoiding the trial, Martin and Mills both pleaded guilty and testified against their former colleagues. But these aren't the only charges they're facing.\n\nOn April 28, 2025, the ex-officers will go on trial for second-degree murder, aggravated kidnapping, aggravated assault, official misconduct, and official oppression.\n\nA public records request by The Commercial Appeal found that police department had either suspended or reprimanded four out of the five officers before they'd beaten Nichols. Records show that the officers were reprimanded for allegedly failing to report domestic violence, causing multiple car accidents with squad vehicles, and not documenting forceful arrests.\n\nThe Memphis Commercial Appeal reports that the men \"faced little-to-no consequences.\"\n\nSome of these same officers allegedly beat another man just three days before Nichols. Monterrious Harris, a 22-year-old, was grabbed, kicked and punched by four of the officers involved in the Tyre Nichols attack. And the accusations didn't stop there.\n\nAs my colleague Samantha Michaels wrote last year :\n\nAs prosecutors review cases, other victims continue to come forward. Darick Lane, 32, alleges that two of the officers who killed Nichols, Desmond Mills Jr. and Justin Smith, pulled him out of a car window in June and threatened to shoot him if he moved, according to the Washington Post . Another officer, Demetrius Haley, is meanwhile accused of beating Cordarlrius Sledge while Sledge was incarcerated in the Shelby County jail in 2015, according to another lawsuit that was dismissed on technical grounds. Sledge said he was trying to hide a cellphone when Haley and two other officers attacked him, slamming his head into a sink until he blacked out .\n\nThe beating was so brutal that a large group of prisoners on the cellblock wrote a letter to the corrections director to complain: \"We are truly asking that this matter gets looked into before someone gets hurt really bad or lose their life because of some unprofessional officers,\" they wrote.\n\nThe alleged wrongdoing was not limited to just the indicted officers. Nichols' death kickstarted a 17-month federal investigation into the Memphis Police Department. In December 2024, the Department of Justice released a jaw-dropping, 73-page report detailing the department's long pattern of misconduct, discrimination, and excessive force.\n\n\"Our investigation found that officers use force to punish and retaliate against people who do not immediately do as they say,\" the DOJ's Civil Rights Division Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke wrote in the report . Here's a quick run-down of some of the egregious actions the Memphis PD stands accused of:\n\nHigher-ups reportedly failed to hold their officers accountable and didn't conduct thorough investigations into many of these incidents. The report concludes with a serious call for reform, recommending 18 remedial measures.\n\n\"This process and these findings uncovered that our city has a lot of work to do,\" said Reagan Fondren, Acting US Attorney  for the Western District of Tennessee, in a statement . \"Memphians are rightly concerned with gun violence and violent crime. They are also rightly concerned about the collective approach that we must take to tackle these issues.\"\n\nIn response to the report, the city plans to hire former Judge Bernice Donald, Tennessee's first Black woman to hold a judgeship, to supervise the department. According to ABC 24 , Donald will lead nine-person task force to come up with a plan for reform.\n\nTyre Nichols' family is suing the city of Memphis, several current and former Memphis PD officials, and all the officers involved for $550 million. The complaint states that Memphis police lied to Nichols' mother about his arrest, claiming that he was driving under the influence.\n\nThe suit, like the Justice Department report, also claims that officials turned a \"blind eye\" to the SCORPION unit's violent policing.\n\n\"How does this horrific and unconstitutional treatment of Black men and women by law enforcement continue to happen?\" said attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Nichols' family, in a statement that likened the Memphis officers to the lynch mob that murdered Emmett Till. \"Tyre's lynch mob was dressed in department sweatshirts and vests,\" Crump wrote,\" sanctioned by the entities that supplied them.\"\n\nOn January 3, Judge Mark Norris pushed the trial to July 2026-the second such delay-citing several reasons, including that officials would prefer proceedings to start after the separate murder trial begins.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Police Unions Have Enormous War Chests to Defend Officers Like Derek Chauvin\n\nRichard Tsong-Taatarii/AP\n\nDerek Chauvin, the former officer who was fired from the Minneapolis Police Department after he kneeled on George Floyd's neck last May, faces a criminal trial that's scheduled to begin this month. The city of Minneapolis won't be paying his legal fees: Cops accused of crimes are typically on the hook for their attorney costs and other related expenses.\n\nBut that's not a problem for Chauvin. He turned to the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association, a statewide group with hundreds of thousands of dollars set aside in a legal defense fund to pay for cops' legal costs. It's available to more than 10,000 law enforcement officers around Minnesota, including the three other ex-officers involved in Floyd's death.\n\nPolice officers around the country can tap into similarly immense war chests to cover hefty expenses if they're prosecuted for killing or injuring someone-resources that critics say give them an unfair advantage and make it easier for them to avoid guilty verdicts. Officers typically receive the benefit as part of their membership in police unions. They pay monthly or annual fees and then have access to this club of sorts and its financial resources. If they kill someone on the job, they call up the association and get connected with defense attorneys who can give them advice and guide them through the courts if they're prosecuted.\n\n\"It's part of a broader system that shields officers who commit misconduct from accountability,\" says Samuel Sinyangwe, a data scientist who studies police unions for the nonprofit project Campaign Zero.\n\n\"These funds and the unions continue to push the narrative that law enforcement are the victims, not the perpetrators, no matter how much objective evidence you have,\" says Ben Crump, an attorney who represents Floyd's family and has worked on other high-profile cases alleging police brutality.\n\nMinnesota's police Legal Defense Fund is one of many such funds around the country. The biggest and oldest, under the Peace Officers Research Association of California , has tens of millions of dollars at its disposal that it offers to cops nationwide. More than 135,000 law enforcement officers in all 50 states are members of its Legal Defense Fund, which holds a whopping $39 million in reserves , up from $18 million in 2015, mostly accumulated from membership fees. And there's no cap on how much the association will pay in court-it has spent $170 million defending law enforcement officers since 2007.\n\n\"Whether the case costs $100,000 or $1,000,000 to defend, we keep our long-standing promise of never skimping when our members' lives and careers are on the line,\" the association's president, Brian Marvel, a police officer in San Diego, wrote in March. (As of December, the fund was assisting officers in 129 active criminal cases , many of them for on-duty shootings.)\n\nAnother national fund, the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund, operates like a charity, which means officers don't need to be part of a union or pay fees to benefit from its financial assistance, which totaled $319,654 for legal cases in 2019. Several cops involved in high-profile killings have sought help from the LELDF, including the Baltimore officers who were acquitted after the 2015 death of Freddie Gray; the former Atlanta officer who killed Rayshard Brooks outside a Wendy's last summer, whose attorney has asked a court to dismiss the criminal case against him; the former Forth Worth officer who fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson in 2019 while she was at home with her eight-year-old nephew, whose trial is tentatively set for later this year; and the former officer in Maryland who received a pardon from Donald Trump in December after spending a decade in prison for a brutality case related to her K-9.\n\nAttorney costs can quickly rack up because some of these court cases drag on for years: With financial resources from LELDF, Joseph Weekley , the officer who fatally shot seven-year-old Aiyana Stanley-Jones while she slept on a couch in Detroit in 2010, survived two hung juries before a prosecutor ultimately dismissed the charges against him five years later.\n\nCivilians in other types of jobs, even if they're part of unions, might have access to arbitration if they're fired, but their labor associations typically won't cover their court expenses if they're accused of a crime. Some police officers say it makes sense for their unions to build up legal defense funds, even though other types of unions don't, because their profession requires them to enter situations where they may need to use force, putting them at greater risk of being sued or prosecuted. The goal, says Jason Johnson, a former deputy police commissioner in Baltimore who is now president of the LELDF, is to ensure everyone is afforded due process. \"All we're trying to do is to prevent law enforcement officers from having to choose between being able to feed their family and children and being able to be adequately represented in court,\" he says. \"It doesn't change the calculus on holding officers accountable.\"\n\nYet it's extremely rare for cops to be convicted of crimes after shooting or killing someone-in part because of lenient use-of-force laws , and in part because prosecutors and grand juries rarely indict them. Activists argue the legal defense funds tip the scale further in their favor. As Timothy Belcher, a labor attorney in Vermont, puts it: \"It adds another layer to the story of how these cops are basically untouchable legally.\"\n\nThis arrangement can be problematic for another reason: Some of the associations running the legal defense funds also donate heavily to district attorney candidates who are then tasked with deciding whether to bring charges against officers. \"There's a conflict of interest if prosecutors take money from police unions and then face off against police-union-funded [defense] advocates in court,\" says Maxwell Szabo, an attorney who formerly worked as a spokesperson in the San Francisco DA's office.\n\nThe Peace Officers Research Association of California (PORAC), which manages the country's biggest, multimillion-dollar defense fund for police, regularly spends money supporting prosecutor candidates in their elections across California. In 2013, it gave at least $3,000 to Sacramento DA Anne Marie Schubert, who six years later decided not to press charges against the officers who shot Stephon Clark while he was standing in his grandparents' backyard with a cellphone in his hand. Given that PORAC is based in Sacramento and has a board member who works for Sacramento's Police Officers Association, it's possible the group also helped the officers pay for their defense attorneys. PORAC declined an interview request from Mother Jones .\n\nJohnson , the former Baltimore deputy police commissioner who leads the charitable LELDF, which does not support political candidates, says police unions are entitled to get involved with political campaigns that will affect their members' professions. Other unions do that, too. \"I don't see a conflict of interest,\" he says.\n\nMore recently, PORAC gave at least $724,000 to try to defeat reformist Los Angeles DA George Gascón , who campaigned last year on a platform of holding cops accountable in a county that sees more law enforcement shootings than almost anywhere else in the country. \"Gascón and his ilk look at you as criminals and not the guardians you are,\" Marvel wrote to his police colleagues in a January newsletter , adding that he hoped the newly elected prosecutor would be recalled. Though Marvel's association lost that race, it has succeeded enormously at lobbying against police reforms at the California statehouse, working alongside other law enforcement unions and associations. \"We need to make 'defund the police' a toxic phrase for elected officials,\" Marvel added in the newsletter.\n\nHis organization has the money to do it. California police unions and associations spent $2 million for lobbyists to influence state legislation in 2017-nine times more than the NRA spent on lobbyists that year, according to an analysis by Sinyangwe's Campaign Zero. And of that, PORAC contributed nearly a quarter. It spent another $1.6 million on political campaign donations from 2011 to 2017. \"They are the single largest and most influential group within the police association orbit,\" says Sinyangwe. He adds that PORAC and police unions often donate heavily to state lawmakers who they hope will oppose or water down police-reform laws, including ones dealing with use of force.\n\nAt the federal level, Marvel testified in front of the nonpartisan commission established by Trump in 2019 to study ways of improving policing in America. (The commission was later found to have violated the law because it was composed solely of law enforcement representatives and no civil rights activists, academics, or defense attorneys.) \"[T]he issue of police reform is sure to remain salient under the Biden administration. As those conversations continue, PORAC will be there, ensuring that the voices of California law enforcement officers are at the table,\" legal analysts wrote in the association's January 2021 newsletter . They added that the association opposes the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which Democrats in Congress are pushing as a way to reduce police violence.\n\nWhile members of PORAC and other police legal defense organizations are forthright about their disdain for the defund-police movement inspired by Floyd's death, most have condemned his killing. \"Officer Chauvin, he betrayed the badge,\" Brian Peters, executive director of the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association, which is paying for Chauvin's defense, told CBS's Gayle King in a recent interview . (His association declined to speak with Mother Jones .)\n\n\"A vast majority of peace officers around the nation, including PORAC, were shocked and saddened by what we saw on that video,\" Marvel wrote in July 2020, referring to the video footage of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck. PORAC's vice president wrote last summer that it was a \"gross exaggeration\" to suggest \"there is an epidemic of police brutality,\" but that \"it goes without saying that we as law enforcement officers condemn what occurred.\"\n\nBut that doesn't detract from their desire to provide a proper defense for the four officers now facing prosecution for Floyd's death. \"Every citizen has a right to due process, and it just has to play out,\" Peters told King. When asked what would be a fair outcome in Chauvin's case, he added, \"Is there a fair outcome? I don't think there is.\"\n\nChauvin faces charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and manslaughter. His attorney, Eric Nelson, is expected to argue that Floyd died because of underlying health problems and drug use, though an autopsy report concluded Floyd died in a homicide; his heart failed after Chauvin restrained him on the ground. Last Friday, the city of Minneapolis announced it would pay Floyd's family $27 million after the family filed a civil lawsuit-one of the largest pretrial settlements in US history for an alleged wrongful death at the hands of police.\n\nOn Monday, Chauvin's attorney asked the judge overseeing the criminal case to delay the trial , because he argued the settlement could bias jury members. The judge began recalling previously selected jurors to question them about it. It's unclear how many weeks or months the jury selection and other court hearings will drag on. But one thing is certain: However long the trial lasts, Chauvin will likely be able to afford it.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "\"This Was My Baby\": The Family of Black Man Killed by Cops While Experiencing Mental Crisis Speaks Out\n\nScreenshot from WTVR\n\nTwo days after Virginia deputies were charged with second-degree murder for the killing of a Black man at a state mental hospital, the victim's family made their first public appearance on Thursday, having viewed the footage of his death. On March 6, seven Henrico County officers allegedly smothered 28-year-old Irvo Otieno, who was handcuffed, shackled, and in the throes of a mental health crisis, while trying to admit him as a patient at Central State Hospital.\n\nAt a press conference on Thursday, Otieno's family joined together to express their grief and demand justice for their loved one. \"This was my baby. He cared for the people in his life,\" said Otieno's mother, Caroline Ouko, holding a smiling picture of her son. \"What I saw today was heartbreaking. It was disturbing. It was traumatic. What I saw was torture. Those three days at Henrico County jail were a horror.\"\n\nThree days prior to his death, Henrico County police had detained Otieno under an emergency custody order after \"interacting and observing\" him while investigating a suspected burglary. In Virginia, authorities are allowed to place someone under an ECO if it's believed that this person could hurt themselves or someone else as a result of mental illness. Despite his mother's pleas to take him to a hospital closer to her home, officers took Otieno to Henrico Doctors' Hospital.\n\nAfter he was taken for an evaluation, he allegedly became \"physically assaultive\" with officers. He was then charged with assault on a law enforcement officer, disorderly conduct in a hospital, and vandalism, and taken to the Henrico County Jail West.\n\n\"It was at that [hospital] that he should've gotten help,\" said the family's attorney, Mark Krudys. According to Ouko, when she insisted on seeing her son at the hospital, the doctor threw his hands up in desperation and said, \"It's the police.\"\n\n\"My son couldn't advocate for himself,\" said Ouko. \"And I was denied the opportunity to advocate for him.\" Otieno then spent three days inside Henrico County Jail West. Prosecutor Ann Baskervill said on Tuesday that video from the county jail shows three officers pepper-spraying and punching Otieno in his cell. Jail security footage also reportedly shows a naked Otieno, alone, in a small, bare cell with feces on the floor before being handcuffed and rushed by five officers. Virginia State Police have no immediate plans to release the footage, according to the Associated Press .\n\nAround 4 p.m. on March 6, Otieno was transferred to Central State Hospital for unknown reasons. According to police, Otieno allegedly became assaultive with officers, but Otieno's family says the video tells a different story. \"He, in the videos, [is] never confrontational with them. He is not posing a threat to them. He's not violent or aggressive with them. You see in the video he is restrained with handcuffs, he has leg irons on, and you see in the majority of the video that he seems to be in between lifelessness and unconsciousness. But yet you see him being restrained so brutally with a knee on his neck,\" said civil rights attorney Ben Crump , who is working with the family.\n\nAccording to Krudys, the video at Central State Hospital shows Otieno seated on a chair at one point and then lying on his stomach on the ground, however it's unclear whether or not he got there on his volition. For nearly 12 minutes, Krudys said all seven officers were on top of him, ultimately asphyxiating him. Virginia State Police weren't notified about his death until three hours after the fact, according to Baskervill.\n\nBefore his death, Otieno was an aspiring musician with a love for hip-hop music and songwriting. Leon Ochieng, Otieno's older brother, was planning a trip to Richmond, Virginia for his birthday and wanted to spend time with Otieno, who lived in the city since his family emigrated from Kenya when he was four. He expected his trip to the city to be a happy reunion, not a time of grief.\n\n\"At what point do we stop preserving life? At what point do we consider mental illness a crime? Can someone explain to me why my brother's not here right now? Can someone explain to me why my mother can't sleep, can't eat? We're broken,\" said Ochieng.\n\nThe deputies, who were released on bond this morning, are currently on paid administrative leave and will appear before a grand jury on March 21. On Thursday, three Central State Hospital staff were also charged with second-degree murder related to Otieno's death. Krudys and Crump are calling for the Department of Justice's involvement in this case, as well as more mental health resources.\n\n\"As a Black parent, what do you when your child is going through a mental health issue? What do you do when not only their mental health status, but their skin color can be a death sentence,\" said Crump.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "All Three Defendants Were Just Found Guilty of Murdering Ahmaud Arbery\n\nRichard Ellis/ZUMA\n\nA jury in Brunswick, Georgia, on Wednesday afternoon found all three defendants involved in the 2020 shooting death of Ahmaud Arbery guilty of murder. Gregory McMichael, his son Travis McMichael, and their neighbor William \"Roddie\" Bryan Jr., were all convicted on multiple homicide counts. All three face life sentences.\n\nThe jury took over 11 hours across two days to deliver a strikingly forceful set of verdicts, which varied only slightly between the defendants. Travis McMichael was found guilty of all nine counts in Arbery's death, including a charge of intentional homicide; Gregory McMichael was found not guilty on that charge, but guilty of all others, including felony murder; Finally, Bryan, who filmed the encounter, was found guilty of six charges, including felony murder, but cleared of three other counts.\n\nGroups assembled outside the courthouse immediately broke into celebratory chants of \"Ahmaud Arbery!\" Civil rights attorney Ben Crump said in a statement that \"after nearly two years of pain, suffering, and wondering if Ahmaud's killers would be held to account, the Arbery family finally has some justice.\"\n\n\"It's been a long fight, and a hard fight, but God is good,\" said Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, during a short appearance outside the court. \"I never thought this day would come.\"\n\nWithout a viral video of the crime, the conduct of local prosecutors might have ensured that a trial may not have even taken place. Likened by some to a modern-day lynching , Arbery's shooting was one of several high-profile killings of Black Americans that triggered nationwide protests for racial justice across the 2020 summer.\n\nOn Feb. 23, 2020, Arbery, a 25-year-old former high school football star, was jogging in the rural town of Satilla Shores when the three men began to pursue him in two trucks, one of which was decorated with a confederate flag vanity plate. After Arbery was boxed in by the vehicles, a struggle ensued, and Travis McMichael shot him three times, once at point-blank range.\n\nIt took 74 days for Bryan and the McMichaels to be charged and arrested. The first prosecutor to handle the case, Jackie Johnson, recused herself over her connections to Gregory McMichael, who had previously worked as an investigator in the Brunswick district attorney's office and as a police officer. Shortly after the shooting, McMichael allegedly called Johnson and left a voicemail asking for her advice, although it's not clear whether or not she responded. In September 2021, Johnson was indicted by a grand jury for allegedly \"showing favor and affection\" to McMichael and directing police officers not to arrest his son. (Her case has yet to go trial.) Johnson's replacement also advised police not to arrest the three men before recusing himself over his son's ties to Gregory McMichael, according to documents obtained by the New York Times.\n\nTwo months after the shooting, as graphic video of the killing began to spread on social media platforms, the three men were finally arrested. The harrowing footage, which Bryan filmed on a cellphone, shows Arbery being confronted by the McMichaels. Arbery begins to wrestle with Travis McMichael over a shotgun when a shot goes off and the two men leave the frame. Two more gunshots are heard, and Arbery staggers and falls while trying to flee.\n\nThe outrage over the case has already led to significant changes in Georgia law. In direct response to Arbery's killing, state legislators passed Georgia's first-ever hate crimes statute and partly repealed a \"citizen's arrest\" law that was essentially enacted during the Civil War Era to allow white Americans to catch people who had escaped from plantations.\n\nLawyers for the defendants cited the citizen's arrest law in court, claiming that their clients had suspected that Arbery was responsible for burglaries committed in the area. There is no evidence showing that Arbery was, in fact, involved in these crimes. The defendants also claimed that they were acting in self defense, even though they had initiated the encounter by pursuing Arbery with their cars.\n\nProsector Linda Dunikoski pushed back on these claims during closing arguments. \"All three of these defendants made assumptions,\" she said. \"Assumptions about what was going on that day, and they made their decision to attack Ahmaud Arbery in their driveways because he was a Black man running down the street.\"\n\nThe topic of race loomed large over the trial even before it had formally begun. In a preliminary hearing, investigators testified that Bryan had heard Travis McMichael call Arbery a racial slur as he lay dying. Prosecutors also surfaced text messages and Facebook posts written by Travis McMichael, which contained racial slurs for Asian and Black Americans. However, none of this evidence was introduced to the jury.\n\nThe trial was also haunted by fears that the almost all-white jury wouldn't serve as an impartial audience. After a weeks-long jury selection during which around 500 people were evaluated , only a single Black juror was chosen, even though the trial was held in a county with a more than 25 percent Black population. Prosecutors accused the defense attorneys of unconstitutionally striking qualified Black people from the jury, but the judge disagreed, saying that the racial bias during jury selection was constitutional, and allowed the case to proceed.\n\nThough prosecutors tended to shy away from discussing the racial aspects of the crime, defense attorneys repeatedly courted controversy by referencing race throughout the trial. A lawyer for Bryan argued that the presence of Black civil rights leaders in the courtroom-including Rev. Al Sharpton, Rev. Jesse Jackson, and Martin Luther King, III-could influence the jury. On Monday, one of Gregory McMichaels' lawyers described Arbery as having \"dirty toenails,\" a comment which elicited gasps from observers and briefly drove Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, from the courtroom.\n\nIn May 2020 , my colleague Nathalie Baptiste wrote that the Arbery case is best seen not as an aberration but yet another incident stemming from America's long racist legacy. \"Is there anything new to be said about the killing of young Black men who are engaged in everyday activities until they attract the attention of white people who feel threatened and decide to kill them?\" she wrote. \"How many times can we decry racism and beg to be seen as fully human?\"\n\nThe three men will now face a federal hate-crimes trial in February.\n\nThis is a breaking news post and will be updated with more detail.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "After the Police Kill Your Loved One, Who Can You Lean On?\n\nJon Cherry\n\nSamantha Michaels July+August 2023 Issue\n\nOn a warm Friday afternoon in February, Bianca Austin waits in her Airbnb in Gulfport, Mississippi, for a new friend to come by. \"Hey, girl!\" she says, jumping up from her chair as Katrina Mateen walks through the front door in a trenchcoat, her face framed by big sunglasses and a sparkly baseball hat. They hug like they've known each other for ages, though they only met last October, after police shot and killed Mateen's son outside a nearby Family Dollar store. His birthday was earlier this week-he would have been 16-and she and Austin spent the prior night trying to bail out some protesters.\n\n\"You get some sleep?\" asks Austin, who drove from the airport to the jail around midnight.\n\n\"I was knocked out in that car,\" Mateen replies; they'd waited outside the jail till 6 a.m.\n\n\"I know you was!\" says Austin.\n\nAustin lives in Kentucky but has come to Gulfport repeatedly to help Mateen, feeling a special kinship. It wasn't too long ago that police in Louisville shot and killed one of Austin's nieces, Breonna Taylor. \"You just see somebody in pain, and you know the pain they're going through,\" Austin says. \"You just want to embrace them and try to be there.\"\n\nAcross the United States, the police fatally shoot more than 1,000 people every year, representing nearly 5 percent of all homicides-a higher death toll than from mass shootings. Some of these cases make national news, but most don't. Even less attention is paid to the families left behind: thousands of people, disproportionately Black, Indigenous, and Latino, who must navigate not only their grief, but the stress of protests and the press, not to mention agonizing questions of how to seek accountability from the officers who killed their loved ones.\n\n\"It's a different fight when you up against a system that was supposed to serve and protect you,\" Austin says. \"There's not a handbook for tragic situations like this.\" Police who kill often receive therapy, paid leave, and lawyers-much of it publicly funded-but there's usually little to no government support for families. In that absence, Austin and her close friend Jacob Blake Sr., whose son was shot by a cop in Wisconsin, travel around the country supporting surviving family members by, as Blake puts it, \"making yourself available to them any way they want.\"\n\nThere's another protest tomorrow, in front of the Family Dollar store, and they meet up later in the evening to plan for it, joined by a handful of other organizers. Mateen mentions she has a call in a few days with the Justice Department about her son's case. Blake offers to join. \"We'll be at the Airbnb, you come over,\" he suggests. Mateen nods with relief. \"I don't know what I'm gonna hear,\" she tells me. \"They want to look out for me.\"\n\nThere's stress and sadness in the room, but at times it also feels like a family reunion. On the couch, someone laughs and playfully slaps Mateen's shoulder after she makes a funny comment. She chuckles as someone else impersonates an activist from out of town who seems more interested in building an Instagram following than helping her and her son. Austin, her auburn braids pulled up in a bun, hovers around the kitchen table as Mateen's 20-year-old daughter, Amera, a scrunchy around her wrist, eats a plate of chicken and mashed potatoes. There's a colorful king cake on the counter waiting to be devoured. Austin's fiancé rubs her shoulders.\n\nIt's a full house, something 42-year-old Austin craved after she lost Breonna in 2020-the same week her city went into lockdown for the pandemic. She laughs now with Mateen's daughter. \"I don't want people to feel alone,\" she told me earlier.\n\nBianca Austin and Jacob Blake Sr. converse over lunch at a restaurant in Louisville.\n\nJon Cherry\n\nThat desire for community has led her and Blake to build a network of mourning relatives who lean on each other after police violence. They call themselves Families United . \"It's a relatively new and beautiful way of organizing: having the families support each other,\" says Melina Abdullah, who co-founded the first Black Lives Matter chapter, in Los Angeles in 2013, and who's in the room now with Blake, Austin, and Mateen. Although police brutality has long beset communities of color, it's only within the past decade, she says, that victims' family members have teamed up like this on the front lines, offering each other the care that no one else can. Most racial justice activists \" want to provide support,\" she says, counting herself among them, but \"we don't know what it feels like to have your loved one stolen by the state.\" As Austin puts it, \"It's a different kind of grief.\"\n\nTogether, Austin and Blake hope to help families get the national attention they deserve without speaking over them: to listen to each person's needs and be a sounding board as they navigate situations that often lack a clear path forward. \"It's so hard to find help-like, what's the starting point? How do you know who's trustworthy?\" Austin says, reflecting on Breonna's death. \"Because if you don't know, you don't know. You don't know at all.\"\n\nEarly in the morning on March 13, 2020, Austin awoke to what looked like a flashlight in her eyes. \"Mom, people been trying to call you!\" her daughter said, pointing the brightly lit phone at Austin's face. Eighty-three missed calls. Disoriented and groggy, Austin held it to her ear and heard her sister Tamika Palmer say something panicky she couldn't quite make out, something that sounded like, \"B, where you at? Bre's dead.\" Austin's daughter screamed, and Austin, startled, threw the phone like it was a piece of burning coal.\n\n\"What did you just say? What's going on?\" Austin asked after dialing back.\n\n\"You need to get to the hospital now,\" her sister said.\n\nOkay , I'll meet Breonna there , Austin told herself, not processing that her 26-year-old niece could really be dead. They'd talked on the phone the night before, before dinner. Maybe she went to a club afterward and something happened; she got caught in crossfire, Austin thought. Maybe she's hurt.\n\nBreonna was in some ways Austin's mini-me. They were both aspiring nurses, and they loved to sing. When Bre was in kindergarten, she liked Austin's purple braids and asked if she could get some coloring in her own-grinning widely as she flipped her purple hair the next day when she got off the school bus. Bre wasn't the type of girl to get in trouble, working two jobs and saving up for a house. None of it made sense.\n\nAustin drove toward the hospital, but then her sister called-Bre wasn't there.\n\nConfused, Austin drove to meet her sister at home. Bre wasn't there either.\n\nSo she gathered her sister and all the other confused, crying people around her, and they drove to Bre's apartment, where yellow security tape hung in the parking lot.\n\n\"She's in there,\" a police officer told them, gesturing to the building.\n\nWhat the fuck does that mean? Austin thought.\n\nThen the coroner pulled up, and it was clear. \"I'm sorry for your loss...\" he started to say, as Palmer let out a wail and collapsed. Another officer handed Austin a business card, instructing her to call for a police report in six to eight weeks. \"That was it,\" Austin recalls.\n\nPalmer, sobbing on the ground, had a little more information: Her daughter's boyfriend, Kenny Walker, had called her the night before, hysterically screaming that some men broke into their apartment and shot Bre.\n\nAfter he hung up, without specifying who broke in or whether Bre had survived, Palmer assumed the worst but also hoped that she was wrong. Now the coroner had confirmed her fears, and making matters worse, it was starting to seem like the police weren't being honest. Palmer recalled how, when she drove to the apartment right after Kenny's call, an officer outside told her Bre was in the hospital, while she was actually bleeding out inside.\n\nSoon, the family learned that the police arrested Kenny, and their confusion grew: Had he attacked Bre, as uncharacteristic as that seemed? Or was it burglars, like he'd suggested? It wasn't until they got a lawyer two days later and went inside the apartment that they suspected something else entirely. The place looked like a war zone, with bullet holes through the patio, front door, and just about every wall, and a pool of blood at the end of the hallway.\n\nIn the coming weeks, through phone calls with Kenny, news reports, and police documents their lawyer subpoenaed, the family learned what really happened: Breonna had fallen asleep watching the movie Freedom Writers when, a little after midnight, seven plainclothes police barged through her front door with a battering ram. They were looking for drugs-her ex was a dealer. Kenny, thinking they were intruders, grabbed his gun and fired a single shot, and the officers returned with a barrage of bullets. As Breonna lay wounded, Kenny called 911, still not realizing it was the police who had attacked them. An officer would later admit to falsifying an affidavit to enter the unit; there were no drugs there.\n\nBianca Austin speaks at a rally in Kenosha, Wisconsin, to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the shooting of Jacob Blake Jr.\n\nMark Hertzberg/Zuma\n\nJacob Blake Sr. speaks during the March on Washington in August 2020.\n\nMichael A. McCoy/The New York Times/Redux\n\nIf Breonna's family had wanted to protest, they couldn't. She died the same month Louisville's mayor told residents to shelter in place. \"The city was shutting down; like, just go in your house and be quiet,\" Austin says. She struggled to find a church that would host a funeral and tried to stay strong for her siblings: Palmer was so anguished she could hardly talk. Their brother was recovering from a stroke, and their sister Tahasha Holloway was severely sick with Covid, as was an elderly relative who died that week. \"I went into defensive mode,\" Austin remembers. \"Like, 'I can't allow myself to be weak right now, I don't want to cry right now.'\" She spent hours hunched over a laptop, telling people about the shooting and dispelling rumors that Breonna was involved with drugs. \"Somebody had to be the level-headed one,\" she says.\n\n\"B literally took charge,\" Holloway, the oldest of the three sisters, says of Austin, the youngest. \"She was our speaker.\"\n\n\"But she couldn't stop,\" Holloway adds. \"She had worked herself into a real-live frenzy. You had to kind of pull her to the side: 'You need to go sit down.'\"\n\nFor a month, Austin could not sleep at night, despite the pills her doctor prescribed. If she was lucky, she'd doze off for an hour during the day, but even then she had nightmares. The hospital where she worked was inundated with Covid cases that nobody knew how to treat, and she felt like she spent most shifts flipping dead bodies. \"I go home and it's tragedy. I go to work, it's a catastrophe,\" recalls Austin. \"I was so overwhelmed.\"\n\nAs Breonna's story eventually went viral and the country learned her name, Austin was further demoralized: The media took misleading soundbites from her interviews. She felt like politicians and even some activists spoke about the killing to boost their own popularity.\n\nAnd it seemed the cops would never face consequences for what they'd done to Breonna. That September, the state attorney general announced he would not press charges against the officers who shot her. Austin, devastated, organized a press conference with her family. \"At this point, I'm just fed up...ready to crawl back in my hole,\" she recalls. \"I didn't think I had the strength to keep going and deal with the politics behind fighting the police.\"\n\nThen she saw someone at the press conference, a Black man with a linebacker's build and a face mask emblazoned with \"Justice for Jacob.\" Something about his eyes looked familiar; she thought she recognized him from TV. Ben Crump, her family's attorney and a renowned civil rights lawyer, said he was Jacob Blake Sr., the father of the 29-year-old who'd been shot by police in Wisconsin a few weeks earlier. Austin felt sympathy, then surprise. \"I'm like, 'I was literally just watching your son get shot. You're dealing with your own stuff-why are you here?'\"\n\nJacob Blake Sr. had gotten a phone call the night before, alerting him to the press conference. He drove overnight to be there.\n\nHe'd been driving a lot lately. In August 2020, he was in his silver Hyundai sedan, heading to his favorite Thai restaurant in Charlotte, North Carolina, where he lived, when someone texted him a video circulating online, of a white officer shooting his son Jacob Blake Jr. seven times. Blake Sr. immediately went home, packed his bags, and started toward Kenosha, the mountains, fields, and towns passing in a blur. \"That was the longest drive of my life, because at that time I never looked at the video past the first shot,\" he says. \"So I don't know how many times my son was shot, I don't know if he's alive, I don't know what's going on.\" When he arrived, he found Blake Jr. paralyzed from the waist down, with gunshot wounds and damage to his stomach, kidney, and liver. Protests followed, and a 17-year-old civilian, Kyle Rittenhouse, went to one and shot three people, two fatally.\n\nBlake Sr., a former college football player and bodyguard, is a big man with a booming voice, but he wears his emotions on his sleeve and is not afraid to cry. After his son's shooting, he would wake up at 2 a.m. some days and weep. But his family and friends supported him, and he never felt alone.\n\nThen in September, Crump, who was also his family's attorney, called and said Breonna Taylor's mother needed help. Blake got on the phone with Palmer. \"I said, 'Baby, you sound so tired.' And she's like, 'Yeah, we got this big press conference tomorrow and I don't know what they're gonna say.' So I said, 'I'll tell you what: I'm gonna come and stand with you tomorrow, and I'm gonna let you draw off my energy.' She said, 'You would do that for me?' I said, 'I'll be there in the morning.'\"\n\n\"It was the first time another family member came down and stood in solidarity with us,\" Austin says.\n\nAfterward, Blake went with them to lunch and sat next to Austin. They quickly bonded. \"He was the only one throwing out the F-bombs besides me,\" she says with a laugh. \"I was having a bad day, just kind of expressing myself and going off, and he was going off right along with me, telling me, 'You okay to feel the way you feeling. Don't bottle it up.' It was a relief.\"\n\nAustin confided that she didn't think she could trust anyone, that she was tired of officials and activists using her family's story to bolster their campaigns, gain followers, or just get five minutes of fame. People were even selling T-shirts with Bre's image; it felt like everybody was trying to profit. Blake \"was like, you have to trust somebody ,\" Austin says, \"and along with that, you can set boundaries.\" Her shoulders relaxed, and after lunch they hugged and exchanged numbers. He called later that night to make sure the family was okay. And he invited them to a demonstration for his son the next month near Chicago, offering to pay for their hotel. \"He makes you feel like he really do care about you, and he's gonna ride for you,\" says Holloway, Austin's sister.\n\nJacob Blake Sr. arrives at a courthouse in Minneapolis for the December 2021 trial of Kim Potter, the police officer who killed Daunte Wright.\n\nChris Tuite/imageSPACE/Zuma\n\nBianca Austin, left, walks with attorney Ben Crump and Ju'Niyah Palmer, Breonna Taylor's sister, along with Taylor's mother, Tamika Palmer, and attorney Lonita Baker ahead of a news conference in Louisville on September 25, 2020.\n\nBrandon Bell/Getty\n\nBlake's family has a long history of activism: His late father, a reverend in Evanston, Illinois, had organized against redlining in the 1960s, participated in the march from Selma, Alabama, to Montgomery, and even knew Martin Luther King Jr. Blake, 56, grew up playing with the Reverend Jesse Jackson's children and once met then-Sen. Joe Biden while hanging out in the study of his dad's friend, a state legislator. When he invited Austin to Chicago, \"it was like a no-brainer,\" she says. \"How can I tell you no when you drove overnight to be there\" for us?\n\nThey soon became close friends, surprised at how much they had in common. They're both Aries, with birthdays six days apart, and they each have a young son, ages 10 and 14. They have similar personalities, too-leaders who love to take charge, but also introverts who need time alone. And of course, they were both grieving. \"It's a trauma bond,\" Holloway says of their relationship. They talk on the phone so many times a day and spend so much time together that strangers often mistake them for a married couple.\n\nIn January 2021, they were invited to DC for Biden's presidential inauguration, where they sat together in coveted seats near the stage. It felt like a Cinderella moment to Austin, who framed her ticket when she got home; she thought Breonna would have been proud. But on the drive back, Blake's legs swelled, and by the time he arrived he couldn't walk. He was soon hospitalized for congestive heart failure, and in the hospital he got infected with C. diff , an often fatal type of bacteria. Doctors said his chances of surviving were slim.\n\nWhen his nurses told Austin he'd been intubated, she burst into tears. I can't afford to lose him , she thought. It'll break me .\n\nSlowly, Blake recovered, relearning to walk. Austin, with her medical training, helped him manage his medications and take care of himself. \"She's everything to me: my nurse, my confidant, my little sister,\" he says. \"She keeps all the t's crossed and the i's dotted.\"\n\nAs Austin grew closer to Blake, she thought about all the parents whose experiences of police brutality never made the news.\n\nSome of them approached her as she traveled to protests for Breonna and George Floyd, whose May 2020 murder by Minneapolis police sparked nationwide protests that brought more attention to Bre's case. \"It was a cry for help everywhere we went,\" she says. \"A family pulling us to the side, telling us about a tragedy that happened to them.\"\n\nThese families were struggling to get help from local governments, which rarely prosecute police. They didn't qualify for state victim funds, money that could help them cover therapy, burials, and other expenses, because officials didn't see them as victims; deaths by law enforcement often aren't considered crimes under state and federal laws. If relatives needed financial assistance, they had to sue the government for it, a stressful process that didn't guarantee results.\n\nSeveral years ago, a grieving uncle in Oakland, California, began an effort to organize families together after police violence. Cephus \"Uncle Bobby X\" Johnson, whose nephew Oscar Grant was killed by a transit cop in 2009, felt frustrated by the lack of resources. He wanted families to have more say in activist circles: At the time, says BLM's Abdullah, a professor of Pan-African studies at California State University in Los Angeles, organizers rarely worked directly with impacted relatives-they were more focused on addressing systemic injustices than assisting individuals. That started changing in 2014, when Johnson co-launched Families United 4 Justice , a network that now consists of 200-plus families who gather for retreats and protests and to lobby for policy changes. Two years later, Hillary Clinton campaigned alongside Black mothers whose children were killed by police or gun violence, including Mike Brown and Eric Garner. The Mothers of the Movement , who became known for their oratory, took the stage at the Democratic National Convention. Some of them, like now-Rep. Lucy McBath, whose son was murdered by a white man at a gas station, went into politics .\n\nIt wasn't inevitable that Austin would follow a similar path; she already felt overwhelmed by the responsibilities she'd taken on after police killed Breonna. But Blake encouraged her. \"Sis,\" Blake told her, \"you don't realize that when you speak, people listen.\" With donations from the Reverend Al Sharpton and others, the two friends formed their group to help families-whether by showing up at funerals or protests, amplifying demands on Facebook, connecting people with lawyers, or just hanging out and letting them vent. \"Some people will never get justice,\" Austin says. They need \"somebody to listen to their story and understand.\" As the pair began their work, they learned about Uncle Bobby X's group in California and realized they'd coincidentally chosen a similar name, though each outfit has a different vibe: While the former is especially known for its annual healing-centered retreats, Blake and Austin would gain a reputation for actions that are a little more in your face.\n\n\"We're not asking for a goddamn place at any goddamn table!\" Blake yelled into the megaphone at a recent protest. \"We comin' with the table and the chairs, and we set up the table!\"\n\nBlake's \"a firecracker,\" says Holloway, Austin's sister. \"He's so straight to the point.\"\n\nAustin, Blake, and others in their group stood beside George Floyd's family when ex-officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of Floyd's murder in December 2021, and they joined them in Houston, where Floyd grew up, to open a community center in his honor. After police killed 20-year-old Daunte Wright during a traffic stop in a Minnesota suburb, Austin became friends with Wright's mother, even vacationing with her after attending the officer's manslaughter trial. They both joined a group chat of other families coping with police violence, checking in with texts as simple as we love you, good morning, is everybody okay? Often, \"it's never any meat,\" says Blake of the daily messages. \"Sometimes a person just needs to know that you're there.\" More invitations came, not just from families who'd experienced police shootings, but from communities grieving other racist violence. Austin and Blake went to Buffalo, New York, after a white supremacist killed 10 Black people at a supermarket, and they marched with Ahmaud Arbery's parents in Selma.\n\nBut they especially prioritized families whose loved ones' deaths did not get as much media coverage: Cameron Lamb in Missouri. Fred Cox and Jason Walker in North Carolina. Andrew Joseph III in Florida. When police in Illinois killed 19-year-old Marcellis Stinnette , whose mother is Blake's distant relative by marriage, they attended the memorial and brainstormed ways to draw attention to his case, like a protest march on his birthday. Austin and Blake spread the word about these lesser-known killings while trying not to overshadow the families. \"They were like a breath of fresh air,\" says Lakeisha Nix, who met the pair after police in Delaware killed her brother, Lymond Moses . \"I like the way Jacob and Bianca, they don't want to tell your story for you; they want to give you a platform. They ask you, what is justice for you? That to me is the gold standard of how you support other families.\"\n\nAustin was close with her 26-year-old niece, Breonna Taylor. When Breonna was in kindergarten, she asked to dye her hair purple, like her aunt. Jon Cherry\n\nAustin and Blake seemed genuine to Nix, who worried that other activists had ulterior motives, offering help in exchange for clout. She had reason to be skeptical: The massive outrage at Floyd's murder in 2020 suddenly infused the police accountability movement with millions in donations, helping it grow, but also creating a profit incentive to approach families and use their stories. Previously, this activism hadn't been lucrative-some organizers dipped into their own paychecks-so \"families understood it's costing us something, we're not benefiting,\" says BLM's Abdullah. But soon, more families began to doubt activists' motives, and a wedge grew-sometimes fueled by opponents of the police accountability movement who told grieving relatives to watch out for selfish organizers. \"One family was told that every time we say her child's name, we get royalties,\" says Abdullah, \"like it's a record or something.\"\n\nExploitative racial justice activists remain the exception, not the rule, she says, but they can drain families anyway. \"The politicians and activists and some of the organizations are like vampires-they suck the energy out of a story and get the most they can get,\" says Blake. It can make families feel like meat, like they only matter for clicks. \"You're not fighting for families; you're fighting for attention,\" he says.\n\nIn Mississippi, Mateen vents about the same problem. She tells Austin and Blake about some out-of-state activists who raised $100,000 around her son's case, then came to town, splurged $12,000 on an Airbnb with a swimming pool and a lavish bar-and-game room, and did little to actually help her family-dropping off a \"gift\" for her surviving 9-year-old child that totally missed the mark. \"A pair of socks? I mean, I can buy him socks,\" Mateen says with frustration. \"My [dead] son ain't even got a tombstone.\"\n\n\"They try to dictate how they wanna help you instead of helping with things you already have planned,\" Austin says. As Blake did with her, Austin tries to guide Mateen through the complicated maze of choosing whom to trust.\n\nThe most important thing, Austin tells her, is for people to ask what the family needs. Each situation is different. \"We standing behind y'all,\" she says. \"We not in front.\"\n\nThe morning of the protest, Austin and Blake join Mateen in the Family Dollar parking lot as a few dozen people gather around them with handmade signs. Mateen stands with her back toward the store's entrance, where a memorial sits in the sun: fake flowers, candles, and teddy bears faded from winter weather, along with sticky notes taped to the windows with messages like \"He was only 15.\" Another sign, posted by store management, seems more tone-deaf, urging shoppers to remove their hoodies before entering.\n\nIn October 2021, Mateen, who is 41 and Black, got a call from a friend who told her to get to the Family Dollar. \"Jaheim's been shot,\" her friend said. Jaheim McMillan had been hanging out with friends. Police claimed they shot him in the head because he turned toward one of them with a gun. Some witnesses said he was unarmed and had his hands up, and that he bled out for minutes without medical care. Mateen raced to the store, parking across the street and running through traffic to her wounded child. An officer with a red beard grabbed her before she could reach Jaheim, and others surrounded her as she shouted that she needed to see him. \"Shut up and calm down,\" she recalls one telling her; she screamed as they handcuffed her.\n\nJaheim died two days later. It would be months before law enforcement released bodycam footage , which showed an officer firing eight shots at him as he tried to flee. The officer, who was cleared of wrongdoing, said Jaheim held a gun while he ran but did not have it in his possession as he lay wounded; police said they later discovered one in the parking lot.\n\nAustin and Blake learned about the shooting when their phones started blowing up from people tagging them on social media. A Mississippi organizer connected them with Mateen, who invited them to a protest and the funeral. When Austin approached to pay her respects, Mateen begged her not to leave her side. \"I don't want to overstep,\" Austin recalls saying, wondering if Mateen would prefer to have the time with loved ones. \"She said, 'Nope, I just need somebody [like you].'\"\n\n\"I felt safe, like I had people around me who knew what I was going through,\" says Mateen. \"They had compassion for my son, and they didn't even know my son.\"\n\nMost of Mateen's friends and neighbors had no experience with this mix of grief and rage. And while they sympathized and sent donations, some couldn't risk protesting. In such a small city, where so many businesses are white-owned, they worried about losing their jobs. Others feared retaliation from the cops. \"The police will literally set your ass up here,\" says Mateen. But Austin and Blake kept flying back, organizing a boycott of Family Dollar as they pressured it to release surveillance footage of the shooting.\n\nNow at today's protest, Mateen, her arm wrapped around her 9-year-old son, stands with a straight face, her eyes covered with sunglasses. She still cries most days. Her lawyers advised her not to speak at this demonstration because an investigation is underway, and there is always a chance officials might use her words against her. So at her request, Austin, Blake, and others lead the rally instead. Austin still gets nervous before speeches, but when she takes the megaphone it's like a switch is flipped, and her voice turns fiery: \"I can't stand to come out here and see a grieving mother have to deal with some bullshit !\" she says, her hand on her heart as she paces. \"This shit is real life for us! We not out here for show! We still burying and going to court for our kids, man.\"\n\n\"If we all go together and tell our stories,\" Austin says, \"it makes a better chance of somebody getting justice.\"She looks ahead and slows down, with a message not just for the police, but for other activists. \"Don't come to Gulfport and be part of the problem,\" she says, alluding to the protesters who bought the socks and, two days earlier, landed in jail after escalating a demonstration against Mateen's wishes. \"We wasted resources on bailing y'all asses out, $100,000.\" Four of Jaheim's friends, she points out, were arrested and expelled after he got shot. \"They need lawyers and a school scholarship.\"\n\nBlake soon steps forward calmly, with one hand in his pocket, and takes the megaphone. His voice rises, and he speaks in the manner of his late father's sermons as he focuses the crowd. \"Never forget that the purpose of this weekend was to celebrate a man who is not here-a baby that was stolen from us, taken away!\" he says, after a protester behind him raises a fist.\n\nThough the crowd is small, a surprising number have traveled here after losing their own loved ones to law enforcement. Among them is Sabrina Foster, whose son, Glenn Foster Jr. , a former NFL player, was found dead in a patrol car in Alabama. She drove here with Mona Hardin, whose son Ronald Greene was fatally beaten after a police chase in Louisiana. \"We have a duty to stand by each other,\" says Deanna Joseph, who came from Florida after suing her sheriff's office for the death of her teenage son, Andrew . Several mothers tell me that if it weren't for each other, they wouldn't know how to keep going. \"If we all go together and tell our stories,\" Austin says, \"it makes a better chance of somebody getting justice, somebody's case getting reopened.\"\n\nWhen the last person has spoken, Austin leads a march down Pass Road. Blake, with his bad knees and recovering heart, rides in a car up front. Some drivers honk in solidarity as they pass. Austin sings \"Happy Birthday\" over the megaphone, the others joining in as they block a lane of traffic. Jaheim would have been 16 this week.\n\nLater that night, Austin and Blake sit with friends around a table at their Airbnb, playing spades as they listen to a video of the day's protest. \"What do we want? Justice!\" a voice on the tape says. \"When do we want it?\"\n\n\"Now!\" Blake sings as he deals the cards.\n\nThe day ended peacefully, and Austin is relieved. She knows there are dangers to this work: Last summer, before she and Blake went to Akron, Ohio, to protest the police killing of Jayland Walker, she says an officer was recorded claiming that the city jail had a \"cot with their name on it.\" The cops followed through, arresting Austin and Blake for disorderly conduct, though they were not convicted. Blake also recalls how Proud Boys showed up in Kenosha, hanging out car windows and pointing assault rifles at him.\n\nBreonna, Austin says, sends signals to her sometimes that she's with them on these trips-and in Gulfport it's no different. Before they arrived, the Airbnb owner shared the security code to enter the house: 313-like March 13, the day Breonna died.\n\nThe next day, after too little sleep, Austin drives two hours across Mississippi to Taylorsville, a small town where she'll meet Mateen to protest the death of yet another Black family's son, Rasheem Carter. Blake isn't feeling well and stays home to rest.\n\nAs Austin winds along quiet country roads, she ruminates about one of the officers who shot Breonna-he recently wrote a book about it and took part in a publicity event at a restaurant, playing audio of gunfire in front of diners as they ate. His brazenness infuriates Austin. \"These people think they can do whatever they want, say whatever they want,\" she says.\n\nThen her phone rings, and it's her 1-year-old granddaughter, Kynnbre, on FaceTime. \"Yay! Did you pee-pee in the potty?\" Austin says, and the girl squeals with delight. \"I see you: You a big girl!\" Austin says, smiling as Kynnbre, whose name is a combination of Kenny and Bre, walks out of the bathroom to get some cereal and sit with her stuffed animals. Austin encourages her to practice her ABCs, and then they blow air kisses and say goodbye.\n\nAustin turns to me. \"This is a little bit of joy that we all had since Breonna been gone,\" she says. \"Everybody just love on her.\"\n\nAustin is often on the road three weeks a month. On top of that, she has a part-time gig as an ER technician, which she keeps to afford food and a roof over her kids' heads. Breonna's mother, Palmer, got a multimillion-­dollar settlement from her lawsuit, but Austin still worries about money; if she were to leave her job to devote herself to the movement, she'd miss the health insurance for her kids, the 401(k). She wishes the government would subsidize the kind of work she does on the road, so she could help more families. \"The demand for us is so high, but they don't pay anything,\" she says, adding that grassroots fundraising only goes so far, even since 2020. Last year, US Rep. Cori Bush, a Black Lives Matter activist from St. Louis, introduced a bill that would set aside $100 million for community-­based services like theirs that help families with mental health support after police violence. It didn't pass. \"Why should we make the people pay for us out here?\" Austin asks. \"This is as much a government issue as it is a people issue.\"\n\nWhen we arrive in Taylorsville, we pull into a parking lot where a small group of protesters, mostly Black, gather to march. Some hold signs, and others raise fists. Taylorsville is still considered a sundown town, dangerous after dark for Black travelers, and it's where 25-year-old Rasheem Carter was last seen alive in October. The weekend he went missing, he visited the police station, terrified, and said some white men were chasing and threatening him. The police brushed him off, and a month later his skeleton was found in pieces in the woods, the skull detached. The sheriff's department said at the time that it saw no signs of foul play.\n\nAustin sits in the car, watching the crowd grow, her body feeling heavy with the weight of everybody's pain. She knows this march, like the others, will inevitably remind her of her own losses. Protesting, as Blake put it earlier, is continuously \"ripping off the scab.\" But stopping would be harder. \"It's therapeutic,\" she says, \"to know you're not the only one going through tragedy, and there's other people going through way worse.\" She listens as the protesters, some of them children, chant \"Black power,\" and then steps out of the car to join Mateen.\n\nIt's dark by the time they drive back to Gulfport, and everyone is tired. After we arrive, we linger in the car, a door propped open as Mateen smokes a cigarette and talks about her son, occasionally crying. She says she's never spent so long sitting like this with a reporter, and Austin, in the driver's seat, encourages her.\n\nThe mood is somber until I ask about their friendship, how often they're in touch. \"Like once a week, twice a week,\" says Mateen. \"We texting or-\"\n\n\"Something,\" she and Austin both say, and they laugh.\n\n\"Even if we're just saying hi,\" says Mateen, or-\n\n\"How you doing?\" they both say in unison, and they laugh again.\n\n\"Families United has been there for me the whole way, and going nowhere,\" says Mateen, \"because I'm not letting her go.\" And they laugh again.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

NBC News has not listened to an unedited version of the audio.\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which is handling the criminal investigation into the shooting, did not immediately return requests for comment about the family's assertion that the deputy went to the wrong door. The sheriff's office has not released an incident report or any 911 records. Sheriff Eric Aden has previously said the deputy had not entered the wrong apartment.\n\nFortson, 23, was shot May 3 in the doorway of his apartment in Fort Walton Beach by a deputy from the sheriff's office who was responding to an apparent domestic dispute. Fortson's family and their attorneys have insisted the deputy went to the wrong apartment because Fortson was home alone and on a FaceTime call with his girlfriend at the time of the incident. Crump said Thursday that the two were not raising their voices and had been making plans to see each other that weekend. Crump and Fortson's family contend his killing was unjustified .\n\nCrump showed two clips from the body camera video of the deputy being led around the apartment complex by a woman. At one point, the deputy asks her, \"Which door?\" She tells him, \"I'm not sure.\" The woman also tells the deputy that she heard a disturbance that included a slap two weeks ago and says, \"I wasn't sure where it came from.\"\n\nThe woman later tells the deputy that he should go to apartment 1401, footage shows. It is unclear who the woman is, but Crump said Thursday that he believes she works in the leasing office of the complex.\n\nWhen the deputy arrives at the apartment, he first knocks without identifying himself. He then knocks two more times, identifies himself as a member of the sheriff's office and steps away from the door.\n\nThe video shows Fortson answer the door of his apartment with a gun in his right hand that is pointed downward and being shot by the deputy within seconds. After shooting, the deputy shouted for Fortson to drop the gun. Fortson legally owned the firearm, Crump said.\n\nCrump said multiple times Thursday that he believed the deputy had \"used excessive force\" and had \"executed\" Fortson.\n\n\"As his mother said, they cannot stain his reputation,\" Crump said. \"But she feels, as long as they continue to say that they went to the right apartment, they're staining his reputation. Because Roger did not have any domestic disturbance. Roger had no criminal history.\"\n\nI am a national reporter for NBC News Digital.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Breonna Taylor. Atatiana Jefferson. Daunte Wright. Adam Toledo. That's an all-too-incomplete list of people killed by cops other than Derek Chauvin. None of their loved ones have seen their murderers brought to justice. Today, however Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer, made history when he was convicted, on all counts, in the murder of George Floyd. All it took to get that conviction was: nearly 10 uninterrupted minutes of video documenting the murder in broad daylight; a victim who was already handcuffed and prone at the time of his murder; months of nationwide protests; years of organizing by Black activists; a narrative that rose above the noise of a pandemic; a Democratic state attorney general; a prosecutor willing to indict; a nationally televised trial that ran for three weeks; multiple cops testifying against one of their own; and largely incontrovertible testimony from medical experts. That's what it takes for justice. All of those factors had to line up, just so, to get one cop convicted of one murder. The Chauvin verdict sets the floor of criminal justice. It represents the very least the white justice system can do. I'm thankful there is at least a floor. I'm thankful we've finally found the bedrock of basic accountability. I'm thankful that when we finally dredged up Chauvin, it was to inflict justice upon him. Current Issue View our current issue But I'm sad that such justice comes too late for Floyd. Chauvin was a violent cop. He was accused of 18 conduct complaints before he killed Floyd. He should never have been on the street, and he wouldn't have been if people took police violence against Black people seriously. And let's not forget, Chauvin had three accomplices. Tou Thao, Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng were all there, and did nothing as Chauvin choked the life out of Floyd. Their trials for aiding and abetting the murder Chauvin committed-and has now, finally, been convicted of-are still pending. The process of getting justice for Floyd is ongoing. The process of getting justice for the rest of us hasn't even started. Bringing the cops to heel cannot happen through individual prosecutions. We need to address systemic racism in law enforcement and the permissive culture of violence against people of color. It's not an intractable problem. It can be addressed constitutionally-by overturning cases that allow the cops to ignore the Fourth Amendment. It can be addressed legislatively-by passing laws that change the police use-of-force guidelines and setting up independent third parties to investigate and prosecute problem officers, perhaps before brutal police graduate to homicidal police. It can be addressed politically-by voting for mayors who aren't in the pocket of police unions and by showing up to vote for local district attorneys who promise to treat police brutality like any other crime. It can be addressed with funding-by defunding and demilitarizing the police and funding non-police personnel to handle mental health crises and traffic duty. It can be addressed through the media-by demanding coverage that doesn't simply parrot police reports and narratives that distort and harm real lives. It can be addressed in people's hearts-by the simple act of believing Black people when we tell you what's happening to us. If the Floyd murder and the focus on the Chauvin trial inspires us to do these things, then we will not be back here in a year or two, nail-biting on Twitter while waiting to see whether a minimum of justice prevails. More on the Chauvin Verdict The Chauvin Verdict Has to Be Just the Beginning Joan Walsh Chauvin Trial Verdict: All Roads Lead to 38th & Chicago Alyssa Oursler and Anna DalCortivo But if we ignore the structural changes, the hard changes, the necessary changes, we will be back here. We will not break the cycle of violence against people of color or the polarization over whether our lives matter. It is literally already too late for Floyd to be the last unarmed Black man to be murdered by criminal police action. It is already too late for this time to be the last time the country is divided over whether a cop should be held accountable for their actions. Daunte Wright was killed a week ago. The next unarmed victim will be killed before the end of pollen season. We exist in a blizzard of police violence against communities of color, with only the occasional trial or funeral providing the occasional break to take stock of the storm. The next victim is unlikely to die in a way that white people will recognize as flagrantly unjust. The next unarmed Black man killed by police is unlikely to spend nine minutes calling out for his mother as the cops slowly choke the life out of him. Most of us die far too quickly for the white news media to see our agony. The Chauvin conviction is important, but it's not repeatable. It's a floor, not a ladder.

Current Issue View our current issue But I'm sad that such justice comes too late for Floyd. Chauvin was a violent cop. He was accused of 18 conduct complaints before he killed Floyd. He should never have been on the street, and he wouldn't have been if people took police violence against Black people seriously. And let's not forget, Chauvin had three accomplices. Tou Thao, Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng were all there, and did nothing as Chauvin choked the life out of Floyd. Their trials for aiding and abetting the murder Chauvin committed-and has now, finally, been convicted of-are still pending. The process of getting justice for Floyd is ongoing. The process of getting justice for the rest of us hasn't even started. Bringing the cops to heel cannot happen through individual prosecutions. We need to address systemic racism in law enforcement and the permissive culture of violence against people of color. It's not an intractable problem. It can be addressed constitutionally-by overturning cases that allow the cops to ignore the Fourth Amendment. It can be addressed legislatively-by passing laws that change the police use-of-force guidelines and setting up independent third parties to investigate and prosecute problem officers, perhaps before brutal police graduate to homicidal police. It can be addressed politically-by voting for mayors who aren't in the pocket of police unions and by showing up to vote for local district attorneys who promise to treat police brutality like any other crime. It can be addressed with funding-by defunding and demilitarizing the police and funding non-police personnel to handle mental health crises and traffic duty. It can be addressed through the media-by demanding coverage that doesn't simply parrot police reports and narratives that distort and harm real lives. It can be addressed in people's hearts-by the simple act of believing Black people when we tell you what's happening to us. If the Floyd murder and the focus on the Chauvin trial inspires us to do these things, then we will not be back here in a year or two, nail-biting on Twitter while waiting to see whether a minimum of justice prevails. More on the Chauvin Verdict The Chauvin Verdict Has to Be Just the Beginning Joan Walsh Chauvin Trial Verdict: All Roads Lead to 38th & Chicago Alyssa Oursler and Anna DalCortivo But if we ignore the structural changes, the hard changes, the necessary changes, we will be back here. We will not break the cycle of violence against people of color or the polarization over whether our lives matter. It is literally already too late for Floyd to be the last unarmed Black man to be murdered by criminal police action. It is already too late for this time to be the last time the country is divided over whether a cop should be held accountable for their actions. Daunte Wright was killed a week ago. The next unarmed victim will be killed before the end of pollen season. We exist in a blizzard of police violence against communities of color, with only the occasional trial or funeral providing the occasional break to take stock of the storm. The next victim is unlikely to die in a way that white people will recognize as flagrantly unjust. The next unarmed Black man killed by police is unlikely to spend nine minutes calling out for his mother as the cops slowly choke the life out of him. Most of us die far too quickly for the white news media to see our agony. The Chauvin conviction is important, but it's not repeatable. It's a floor, not a ladder. Floyd's family can finally begin the process of healing. They have received some measure of justice, and hopefully they can find peace. The rest of us have to get back to work.\n\nI'm thankful there is at least a floor. I'm thankful we've finally found the bedrock of basic accountability.

And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

When former Brooklyn Center police officer Kim Potter was convicted of manslaughter in December, days before Christmas, the plaza was filled with activists who cried and hugged and celebrated. \"Ain't no power like the power of the people,\" local activist DJ Hooker shouted into a megaphone. Potter, a white woman, shot and killed 20-year-old Daunte Wright, a Black man, during a traffic stop last April-in the midst of Derek Chauvin's murder trial. Protests and flash-bangs followed. The day of Potter's conviction-an outlier for officers who kill-the plaza was decorated with red signs bearing Wright's photograph. Activists handed out yellow signs that read: GUILTY In the thin layer of snow that graced the grass nearby, someone spelled Daunte's name. Outside the courthouse, his family spoke to the crowd through tears. On Friday, when Potter was sentenced, their tears came from inside. One by one, Wright's family members offered victim impact statements. Dressed in black, the mother of Wright's child called his death an execution. T wo weeks earlier, hundreds drove to the Government Center to protest yet another police killing. Blocks of cars waited to begin a slow crawl through downtown, the exhaust from their tailpipes reminiscent of tear gas. A handful of activists wove through them on foot, amping up the crowd. Negative temperatures made breath visible. A young boy in a Black Lives Matter hoodie stood in the middle of the street with a sign that said: AM I NEXT A cacophony of car horns interrupted the otherwise quiet night. Another poster, affixed to a car, read: HE WAS SLEEPING Two days earlier, Minneapolis police officer Mark Hanneman killed Amir Locke, a 22-year-old Black man, during a predawn no-knock raid. The no-knock warrant was approved by Judge Peter Cahill. Less than a year ago, the same Cahill sentenced Chauvin to 22.5 years in prison for murdering George Floyd. Locke was asleep on his friend's couch when police burst through the door. He was still under his blanket when Hanneman opened fire. Currently, Hanneman is on paid leave. The car caravan was one of many protests for Locke. The next day, Locke's father addressed a crowd of hundreds downtown, in again-freezing temperatures. Draped in a white blanket, one protester gripped a cardboard sign that read: Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols DON'T SHOOT A thousand-strong student walkout to the Governor's Mansion and a smaller student walkout to City Hall came next. Locke's funeral was held the day before Potter's sentencing, at the same church where Daunte Wright was laid to rest. Dressed in black, Locke's mother called his death an execution. T hat Friday, on the plaza, a small group of activists listened to Potter's sentencing via livestream. This time, there was no celebration, no shouts of relief. As Judge Regina Chu explained her decision to give Potter a sentence far below state guidelines, activists voiced their rage. The maximum sentence was 15 years in prison. Potter received 16 months behind bars , eight months of probation, and a $1,000 fine. Potter's defense was that she accidentally used her firearm while trying to use her Taser. She gave a tearful apology just before the sentence was handed down. Chu expressed great sympathy for Potter, saying she had honorably served her community and was clearly sorry. Current Issue View our current issue That sympathy, Chu admitted, was swayed by \"hundreds and hundreds of letters\" sent in support of the former cop. \"This is not a cop found guilty of murder for using his knee to pin down a person for 9.5 minutes as he gasped for air,\" Chu said to the courtroom, referencing the murder of George Floyd. She also distinguished Potter from former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor, a Black man also found guilty of manslaughter. According to Chu, Noor intentionally drew his firearm when he shot and killed a white woman, while Potter made a \"tragic mistake\" when faced with a \"split-second decision\"-an excuse that often impedes prosecution in the first place. \"In making my decision, I look to the purposes of incarceration,\" Chu said. \"There are four: retribution, incapacitation, deterrence, and rehabilitation. Three of the four would not be served in this case.\" As the judge's soft-spoken defense of Potter came through the live stream, several activists began to pace around. The judge mentioned Daunte Wright only briefly in the beginning of her address. \"It's gonna happen again,\" someone on the plaza said. Hooker, like many local activists, was disappointed by the sentence.

Darnella Frazier, the young girl who filmed Floyd's murder, testified at both. Last summer, her uncle was killed when Minneapolis police crashed into his car while in pursuit of someone else. In a press conference following Potter's conviction, attorney Ben Crump told NPR News it represented a \"profound proclamation of the progress that we've made\" in the 10 years since Trayvon Martin was killed by George Zimmerman, sparking the Black Lives Matter movement.

Protests and flash-bangs followed. The day of Potter's conviction-an outlier for officers who kill-the plaza was decorated with red signs bearing Wright's photograph. Activists handed out yellow signs that read: GUILTY In the thin layer of snow that graced the grass nearby, someone spelled Daunte's name. Outside the courthouse, his family spoke to the crowd through tears. On Friday, when Potter was sentenced, their tears came from inside. One by one, Wright's family members offered victim impact statements. Dressed in black, the mother of Wright's child called his death an execution. T wo weeks earlier, hundreds drove to the Government Center to protest yet another police killing. Blocks of cars waited to begin a slow crawl through downtown, the exhaust from their tailpipes reminiscent of tear gas. A handful of activists wove through them on foot, amping up the crowd. Negative temperatures made breath visible. A young boy in a Black Lives Matter hoodie stood in the middle of the street with a sign that said: AM I NEXT A cacophony of car horns interrupted the otherwise quiet night. Another poster, affixed to a car, read: HE WAS SLEEPING Two days earlier, Minneapolis police officer Mark Hanneman killed Amir Locke, a 22-year-old Black man, during a predawn no-knock raid. The no-knock warrant was approved by Judge Peter Cahill. Less than a year ago, the same Cahill sentenced Chauvin to 22.5 years in prison for murdering George Floyd. Locke was asleep on his friend's couch when police burst through the door. He was still under his blanket when Hanneman opened fire. Currently, Hanneman is on paid leave. The car caravan was one of many protests for Locke. The next day, Locke's father addressed a crowd of hundreds downtown, in again-freezing temperatures.

T hat Friday, on the plaza, a small group of activists listened to Potter's sentencing via livestream. This time, there was no celebration, no shouts of relief. As Judge Regina Chu explained her decision to give Potter a sentence far below state guidelines, activists voiced their rage. The maximum sentence was 15 years in prison. Potter received 16 months behind bars , eight months of probation, and a $1,000 fine. Potter's defense was that she accidentally used her firearm while trying to use her Taser. She gave a tearful apology just before the sentence was handed down. Chu expressed great sympathy for Potter, saying she had honorably served her community and was clearly sorry. Current Issue View our current issue That sympathy, Chu admitted, was swayed by \"hundreds and hundreds of letters\" sent in support of the former cop. \"This is not a cop found guilty of murder for using his knee to pin down a person for 9.5 minutes as he gasped for air,\" Chu said to the courtroom, referencing the murder of George Floyd.

T hat Friday, on the plaza, a small group of activists listened to Potter's sentencing via livestream. This time, there was no celebration, no shouts of relief. As Judge Regina Chu explained her decision to give Potter a sentence far below state guidelines, activists voiced their rage. The maximum sentence was 15 years in prison. Potter received 16 months behind bars , eight months of probation, and a $1,000 fine. Potter's defense was that she accidentally used her firearm while trying to use her Taser. She gave a tearful apology just before the sentence was handed down. Chu expressed great sympathy for Potter, saying she had honorably served her community and was clearly sorry. Current Issue View our current issue That sympathy, Chu admitted, was swayed by \"hundreds and hundreds of letters\" sent in support of the former cop. \"This is not a cop found guilty of murder for using his knee to pin down a person for 9.5 minutes as he gasped for air,\" Chu said to the courtroom, referencing the murder of George Floyd. She also distinguished Potter from former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor, a Black man also found guilty of manslaughter. According to Chu, Noor intentionally drew his firearm when he shot and killed a white woman, while Potter made a \"tragic mistake\" when faced with a \"split-second decision\"-an excuse that often impedes prosecution in the first place. \"In making my decision, I look to the purposes of incarceration,\" Chu said. \"There are four: retribution, incapacitation, deterrence, and rehabilitation. Three of the four would not be served in this case.\" As the judge's soft-spoken defense of Potter came through the live stream, several activists began to pace around. The judge mentioned Daunte Wright only briefly in the beginning of her address. \"It's gonna happen again,\" someone on the plaza said. Hooker, like many local activists, was disappointed by the sentence.

Darnella Frazier, the young girl who filmed Floyd's murder, testified at both. Last summer, her uncle was killed when Minneapolis police crashed into his car while in pursuit of someone else. In a press conference following Potter's conviction, attorney Ben Crump told NPR News it represented a \"profound proclamation of the progress that we've made\" in the 10 years since Trayvon Martin was killed by George Zimmerman, sparking the Black Lives Matter movement.

T hat Friday, on the plaza, a small group of activists listened to Potter's sentencing via livestream. This time, there was no celebration, no shouts of relief. As Judge Regina Chu explained her decision to give Potter a sentence far below state guidelines, activists voiced their rage. The maximum sentence was 15 years in prison. Potter received 16 months behind bars , eight months of probation, and a $1,000 fine. Potter's defense was that she accidentally used her firearm while trying to use her Taser. She gave a tearful apology just before the sentence was handed down. Chu expressed great sympathy for Potter, saying she had honorably served her community and was clearly sorry. Current Issue View our current issue That sympathy, Chu admitted, was swayed by \"hundreds and hundreds of letters\" sent in support of the former cop. \"This is not a cop found guilty of murder for using his knee to pin down a person for 9.5 minutes as he gasped for air,\" Chu said to the courtroom, referencing the murder of George Floyd. She also distinguished Potter from former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor, a Black man also found guilty of manslaughter. According to Chu, Noor intentionally drew his firearm when he shot and killed a white woman, while Potter made a \"tragic mistake\" when faced with a \"split-second decision\"-an excuse that often impedes prosecution in the first place. \"In making my decision, I look to the purposes of incarceration,\" Chu said. \"There are four: retribution, incapacitation, deterrence, and rehabilitation. Three of the four would not be served in this case.\" As the judge's soft-spoken defense of Potter came through the live stream, several activists began to pace around.

Al Sharpton, is \" Black America's attorney general. \"\n\nMr. Crump, the lawyer representing the family of Tyre Nichols, has been the go-to lawyer for the families of Black people killed by the police or others for more than 20 years, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd, Tamir Rice and Breonna Taylor.\n\nBut it was the killing of Trayvon Martin , an unarmed Black teenager who was fatally shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer in a suburb of Orlando, Fla., that catapulted Mr. Crump into the spotlight. Mr. Crump became a regular on cable news, bringing national attention to the case and motivating a new generation of activists.\n\n\"Trayvon Martin will forever remain in the annals of history next to Medgar Evers and Emmett Till as symbols for the fight for equal justice for all,\" he said after a jury acquitted the volunteer, George Zimmerman, in 2013.\n\nTwo years later, Mr. Crump represented the family of Michael Brown , a young Black man who was shot and killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo. The list continued to grow .\n\nIn the years since, Mr. Crump, who has a law degree from Florida State University, has embraced his roles as lawyer and activist.\n\n\"We have an opportunity here, America, to really speak to this institutionalized police culture and show that it is not just about white officers or Black officers or Hispanic officers,\" Mr. Crump said last week, after murder charges were filed against five former officers in the death of Mr. Nichols. \"It's about police officers having this biased belief that you can get away with doing certain things to Black citizens and brown citizens in America that you cannot get away with white citizens.\"\n\nHe noted how \"the simple encounter\" of a traffic stop led to murder and kidnapping charges against the police, adding that Mr. Nichols's death should lead to substantial changes in policing, including legislation requiring police officers to intervene when they see other officers using excessive force. His team called for the city to immediately disband the police unit involved in the traffic stop that led to his death.\n\n\"That is what we're going to have to do if we're going to give Tyre Nichols the proper legacy,\" Mr. Crump said.\n\nAdvertisement"

The Levin & Perconti law firm announced Monday it is partnering with civil rights attorney Ben Crump to represent the players.\n\n\"From forced participation in humiliating acts, racial bias, to punishments that inflicted severe physical discomfort, sexual abuse and psychological trauma, the lawyers have uncovered a vast array of incidents of abuse in the Northwestern football program ,\" the firm said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"More players are expected to join the legal action in the coming days. The legal action is expected to expand beyond Northwestern 's football program and will expose extreme and abusive hazing in other college athletic programs as well.\"\n\nIn January, Northwestern hired an outside law firm to conduct a six-month investigation into hazing in the program. On July 7, the school announced that accusations were largely backed up by the evidence but couldn't point to specific misconduct by a player or coach. It also said head coach Pat Fitzgerald was not aware and suspended him for two weeks without pay.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nA timeline of the football controversy at Northwestern\n\nFollowing The Daily Northwestern's reporting of specific allegations the next day, school president Michael Schill backtracked and fired Fitzgerald on July 10 \"for his failure to know and prevent significant hazing in the football program.\" Fitzgerald has retained legal counsel and is considering legal action against the school.\n\n\"Whether the coaches at Northwestern approved or participated in the harassment of these players or not, they are responsible for allowing and enabling a toxic, disgusting, and damaging culture in their programs,\" Crump said in a statement. \"Sadly, our research suggests that this kind of abuse of student-athletes may be far more common on college campuses than we know, because there is tremendous pressure to keep quiet. It's time for a reckoning to protect young athletes.\"\n\nNo players have been publicly disciplined by the school. Northwestern retained the rest of the coaching staff and promoted defensive coordinator David Braun to interim head coach for the season. Braun was hired in January.\n\n(Photo of Crump: John Lamparski / Getty Images)\n\nChris Vannini covers national college football issues and the coaching carousel for The Athletic.

Crump listens compassionately as Brown relates the 2020 murder of her cousin by a Minneapolis police officer. Crump gently offers her some advice about next steps, then rests his head in his hands. The image of Crump holding his own head, and of Crump rubbing his eyes, is repeated throughout \"Civil.\" It is the weary physical response to ongoing injustice and to a schedule that keeps the lawyer on planes and on his smartphone, pursuing lawsuits intended to make police departments and municipalities pay financially - and the media and the court of public opinion pay heed.\n\nMost viewers will likely recognize Crump as a high-profile legal representative for family members not just of Floyd but of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Breonna Taylor and Andre Hill, too, to name some of his clients' loved ones who have been killed during encounters with the police.\n\nThe director Nadia Hallgren filmed Crump over a year during 2020 and 2021, and her portrait has instances of tag-along intimacy. The phone calls to Crump's wife, Genae, and daughter, Brooklyn, as well as his check-ins with his mother, Helen, provide ballast amid the upheaval. And the biographical details about the college, law school and fraternity that shaped Crump tease his roots in Black communities.\n\nYet \"Civil\" yields fewer insights than hoped. At times, the neat documentary feels nearly as tailored as Crump's suits. (Perhaps this is what happens when verité-style filmmaking follows such a camera-ready subject?) Given Crump's vital role in momentous litigation, \"Civil\" may be crucial viewing - but it's not always revealing.\n\nCivil: Ben Crump Rated PG-13 for strong language and images of violence. Running time: 1 hour 41 minutes.

Former Northwestern athletic director and current ACC commissioner Jim Phillips will be named as a defendant in the second suit .\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nA timeline of the football controversy at Northwestern\n\nCrump, a civil rights attorney, and the Levin & Perconti law firm announced Monday that they're partnering to pursue legal action against Northwestern over hazing within the football program. On Wednesday, Crump said the number of former athletes he's retained has grown to 15 and now includes clients from the Wildcats' football, baseball and softball programs, with the majority of them coming from the football program.\n\n\"It is clear to us that a toxic culture was rampant at Northwestern University ,\" Crump said. \"This is not just relegated to the football program at Northwestern University. This goes into other athletic programs.\"\n\nHe added that the softball program \"seemed to be as toxic as the football program.\"\n\n\"It really was deplorable. These were young girls who were not even of age yet,\" Crump said. \"And they were preyed upon from Day 1, in their words.\"\n\nCrump said he does not have a timeline yet for when the lawsuit will be filed as the law firm is still speaking with former Northwestern athletes. The lawyers have spoken to over 50 former athletes so far.\n\nA Northwestern spokesperson said the university \"does not comment on pending litigation.\" In a letter to the Northwestern community Tuesday, university president Michael Schill announced two new external reviews of the athletic program. Both will be made public.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYates, a Northwestern quarterback from 2015 to 2017, said Wednesday that hazing was \"so entrenched in our culture that even some of our coaches took part in it.\" Yates declined to specify how the coaches participated.\n\n\"All we wanted to do was play ball, and we were subjected to this culture,\" added Short, a linebacker in the program from 2015 to 2016. \"And we lived in fear.\"\n\nNorthwestern began an investigation into football hazing in late 2022, following an anonymous whistleblower's complaint. On July 7, the school released a vague executive summary and suspended football coach Pat Fitzgerald for two weeks without pay , along with new guidelines in the program. Following The Daily Northwestern's publication of specific allegations the next day and growing public backlash, Schill fired Fitzgerald three days later . Fitzgerald has indicated potential legal action against the school. The school fired baseball coach Jim Foster on July 13 over abusive behavior .\n\n\"We start this case with the fundamental principle that no student-athlete should be enrolled in an athletic department conditioned on forced participation in extreme, ritualized sexual behavior. That's what happened here,\" said attorney Steve Levin, who appeared with Crump at the news conference. \"It involved scores of athletes over a long period of time, in a very public forum. ... It was passed down from class to class, from coach to coach. They just kept doing it. And no one ever stopped.\"\n\nCrump said the football coaches would have to have been \"asleep at the wheel\" to miss the hazing within the program.\n\n\"From all the football players we talk to, they're saying this culture was just rampant throughout the program,\" Crump said. \"If the coach or coaches didn't know, it would have to be malfeasance. It would have to be they were asleep at the wheel.\"\n\n(Photo: Tony Ding / AP Images)"

The airman's family has called the killing unjustified.\n\nBy Eduardo Medina\n\nUnder mounting pressure to offer a justification for the fatal police shooting of a U.S. Air Force senior airman in his own apartment last week, a Florida sheriff on Thursday released body camera footage of the deadly encounter.\n\nThe footage shows Senior Airman Roger Fortson, 23, answering the door of his apartment in the Florida Panhandle and immediately being shot by a deputy from the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office. The video also shows that Airman Fortson was holding a gun, and the authorities have maintained that the deputy \"reacted in self-defense.\"\n\nThe release of the footage came amid growing questions from the airman's family and their lawyers - including Ben Crump, who has represented the family of George Floyd - who had accused the deputy of entering the wrong apartment, of not knocking or announcing himself and of bursting through the door.\n\nSome of those accusations appeared to be undercut by the body camera video. The lawyers said they were based on information from Airman Fortson's girlfriend, who had been on a video call with him during the episode. They did not dispute that Airman Fortson was armed but said that he had every right to be as a legal gun owner in his own home.\n\nAsked if he believed the outcome would have been different if Airman Fortson was not Black, Mr. Crump said, \"That is something that America has to answer.\"\n\nThe footage released Thursday shows that the deputy, who has not been identified, had been told by a woman at the apartment complex in Fort Walton Beach, in the Florida Panhandle, that he should go to apartment No. 1401 because of an apparent domestic dispute there.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "A $27 million settlement for George Floyd's family could influence jurors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nBy Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs and John Eligon\n\nThe City of Minneapolis agreed on Friday to pay $27 million to the family of George Floyd, the Black man whose death set off months of protests after a video showed a white police officer kneeling on his neck.\n\nThe payment to settle the family's lawsuit was among the largest of its kind, and it came as the officer, Derek Chauvin , was set to go on trial this month for charges including second-degree murder. As the settlement was announced by city officials and lawyers for Mr. Floyd's family, Mr. Chauvin sat in a courtroom less than a mile away, where jurors were being selected for his trial.\n\nMayor Jacob Frey called the agreement a milestone for Minneapolis's future. Ben Crump, the civil rights lawyer who is among those representing Mr. Floyd's family, said it could set an example for other communities.\n\n\"After the eyes of the world rested on Minneapolis in its darkest hour, now the city can be a beacon of hope and light and change for cities across America and across the globe,\" he said.\n\nBut legal experts said the agreement might make it even harder to seat an impartial jury in the case against Mr. Chauvin, which was already a challenge because of the attention given to Mr. Floyd's death and the intense demonstrations that followed. In the first four days of jury selection this week, nearly all of the potential jurors said they had seen the video of his arrest, including all but one of the seven selected for the trial so far.\n\nMary Moriarty, the former chief public defender in Minneapolis, said that the timing could hardly be worse for the court case and that Mr. Chauvin's lawyers might even ask for a mistrial.\n\nShe added that the defense team might have reason to worry that jurors' views could be affected by the deal, if they saw it as an indication that Mr. Chauvin's actions were inappropriate. Mr. Chauvin's lawyer and a spokesman for the state attorney general's office, which is prosecuting the case, did not respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for Minneapolis said the settlement was \"independent and separate from the criminal trial underway.\"\n\nThe large payment was a sign of the magnitude of the response to Mr. Floyd's death, which led to protests in hundreds of cities , changes in local and state laws and a reckoning over racism and police abuse.\n\nNicholas Bogel-Burroughs reports on national news. He is from upstate New York and previously reported in Baltimore, Albany, and Isla Vista, Calif.\n\nJohn Eligon is a Kansas City-based national correspondent covering race. He previously worked as a reporter in Sports and Metro, and his work has taken him to Nelson Mandela's funeral in South Africa and the Winter Olympics in Turin.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Who Is the Floyd Family's Lawyer?\n\nIf you turn on your TV and see Benjamin Crump, it usually means that something terrible has happened. Crump is the go-to civil-rights attorney for families who have lost a loved one to police violence; he is often referred to as \"the black Gloria Allred.\" In 2012, after Trayvon Martin was killed by George Zimmerman, in a suburb of Orlando, Martin's family hired Crump, who is based in Tallahassee, to represent them. He made the rounds on cable news to talk about the case; shortly afterward, protests erupted in Florida. (Zimmerman was eventually acquitted.) Two years later, Crump took on another high-profile case, after Michael Brown was shot dead by Darren Wilson, a police officer, in Ferguson, Missouri. (More protests; Wilson was never charged.) Now Crump is representing the family of George Floyd, who was killed, three weeks ago, by Derek Chauvin, a cop in Minneapolis, who knelt on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. \"It was the knee of the entire police department that killed George Floyd,\" Crump said.\n\nCrump is fifty years old, with a round face and a bald head. He wears a gold eagle lapel pin. One of his former law-school classmates recently said that, when a family hires Crump as its lawyer, he becomes its publicist, lobbyist, and therapist, too. \"And I suspect,\" the classmate added, \"that, by the end, he becomes a family member.\" Before Floyd's funeral in Houston, Crump helped Floyd's son, Quincy Mason, put on his necktie.\n\nBut some activists aren't buying it. When Crump announced his involvement in the Floyd case, he was instantly derided on Twitter as an \"opportunist\" with a \"losing track record.\" (Stephon Adams, a supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement who lives in Birmingham, Alabama, tweeted, \"If I am ever killed by a police or by a white person PLEASE MAKE SURE MY FAMILY DOES NOT HIRE BEN CRUMP! He is just as horrible as those ambulance chasing attorneys.\")\n\nSome of this criticism seems to stem from a misunderstanding of Crump's role in criminal cases. In the event of a police killing, murder and manslaughter cases are tried by local prosecutors, not by attorneys for hire. In the Floyd case, the prosecution of Chauvin, and of the three other cops who helped him restrain Floyd, will be led by Keith Ellison, Minnesota's attorney general. While the state works on the criminal case, Crump will pursue civil action: a wrongful-death lawsuit against the city of Minneapolis.\n\nGiven how sympathetic juries tend to be toward police officers, the civil case is often the only case that can be won. Crump helped Michael Brown's family win a $1.5 million settlement from the city of Ferguson, and he helped Trayvon Martin's family settle, for an undisclosed sum, with the homeowners' association in the neighborhood where Martin was killed. If Crump loses a case, he doesn't charge anything. But if he wins he takes a third of the money awarded. He has fought more than two hundred police-violence cases, and he has won cash settlements in all of them. \"We have never not recovered for these families,\" he said. But the officers rarely end up in prison, and the murders go on. Crump could be the winningest attorney in the country who still reeks of failure.\n\nOther people say that, even if Crump did not lead those unsuccessful criminal cases, he's still partly responsible for losing them. He is known for generating buzz before a trial. (\"We can't control anything in the criminal case,\" he said. \"So all you can do is try to advocate and argue in the court of public opinion.\") This publicity can be crucial; sometimes it's the only reason a trial happens at all. Crump is one of the lawyers for the family of Ahmaud Arbery, the black jogger who was killed by two white men in Georgia, in February. It was only after a video of the shooting went viral that the two men were arrested, seventy-four days after the murder. But, when an entire nation is out for blood, prosecutors can feel pressured to overcharge defendants. (After George Zimmerman's trial, legal analysts said that if the prosecutors had pursued a charge of manslaughter, rather than the more serious one of second-degree murder, they would have been more likely to secure a conviction.)\n\nIn the past couple of weeks, the charges against the cops who killed George Floyd have been elevated. Chauvin was initially charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, but prosecutors then added a charge of second-degree murder. (The other three officers now face charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter.) The elevated charges could add up to an extra thirty years in prison, but, according to Rachel Barkow, a criminal-law professor and a vice-dean at the N.Y.U. School of Law, they could make conviction much trickier. \"It is absolutely the case that it'll be harder to win on the second-degree-murder theory than it would be on third-degree,\" she said. \"We're talking about it now, in the middle of nationwide protests and the horror of the video, but these cases go to juries, and there they become a bit more complicated.\"\n\nCrump is calling for the charges to be upped once again, to first-degree murder. This would mean proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the murder of George Floyd was premeditated. \"We think that it can be proved,\" Crump said. \"We think that there was intent. When the officer says, on the body-cam audio, 'He doesn't have a pulse, we should turn him on his side,' and Chauvin says, 'Nope, we keep him in this position,' Chauvin is literally telling them, 'I intend to cause serious bodily harm to him.' That's premeditated murder.\"\n\nIf convicted, Chauvin would get life in prison. Kami Chavis, a professor of law and the director of the criminal-justice program at Wake Forest University School of Law, in North Carolina, said that this drive for a first-degree charge likely stems from \"years of seeing black lives treated like they don't matter.\" Still, she said, \"when I look at the evidence we have at this point, I believe that second-degree murder is appropriate.\" Even the Internet mob is asking Crump to stand down. \"We are all literally begging you to keep the charges at 2nd degree so there's actually a conviction,\" @0liviaGrace_ tweeted.\n\nAsked about these critiques, Crump said, \"If this was a black person who did it, nobody would be questioning whether it's first-degree murder. So we're saying charge him to the full extent of the law.\"\n\nHow does Crump end up on so many high-profile police-violence cases? \"There aren't many options for black people when they get killed by the police,\" he explained. \"What are you gonna do? Turn to the police? They're the ones who killed you.\" A couple of months before George Floyd was murdered, Breonna Taylor, a young E.M.T. in Louisville, Kentucky, was shot at least eight times by the police during a raid at her home. The cops who killed Taylor haven't been arrested. They haven't even been fired. But Crump's working on it. \"We've already filed the lawsuit,\" he said. ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

Photo illustration by Mark Harris; Source photographs from Getty\n\nOne day in 1973, Edward Townsend, a singer-songwriter who'd had a minor hit with the 1958 ballad \"For Your Love,\" invited a friend, the R. & B. superstar Marvin Gaye, to his home in Los Angeles, to hear some new tunes. Sitting at the piano, Townsend played a four-chord progression in the key of E-flat major while singing a melody that harked back to his doo-wop days. Townsend, then forty-three, had recently been released from rehab, and the song was a plea to a higher power to help him stay sober. \"I've been really tryin' baby, tryin' to hold back this feeling for so long\" was one of the lines.\n\nGaye, who was suffering from writer's block after the huge success of \"What's Going On,\" for Motown Records, in 1971, heard his friend's song as a hymn to sex. Together, they created \"Let's Get It On.\"\n\nMotown's music-publishing company, Jobete, took fifty per cent of the song's copyright. Gaye and Townsend agreed to split their share of the composition's future earnings. Gaye recorded the song in L.A., in March, 1973, with members of the Funk Brothers, Motown's house band, who added the wah-wah guitar introduction and the song's undeniable groove, in which the second and fourth chords are anticipated-slightly in front of the beat. Gaye, in addition to his soaring vocal, played keyboard on the record. The song, Gaye's first No. 1, was one of the biggest hits of the year. It became a foundational track in the quiet storm of seventies R. & B. and soul, and has remained an evergreen-a steady earner.\n\n\"Let's Get It On\" launched a new phase in Gaye's career; four years later, his song \"Got to Give It Up\" also reached No. 1. Before his death, a filicide by Marvin Gaye, Sr., in 1984, Gaye had a final smash with \"Sexual Healing.\"\n\nTownsend's career peaked with \"Let's Get It On.\" He fell back into alcohol abuse, acquired a cocaine habit, and ended up living on the streets of Los Angeles. He eventually beat his addictions, and, near the end of his life, devoted himself to helping others on the street. He died in 2003, at the age of seventy-four.\n\nIn February, 2014, an English singer-songwriter named Amy Wadge visited the pop star Ed Sheeran at his home in Suffolk. Wadge was an old friend and a frequent collaborator. Sheeran's paternal grandfather had recently died, and his maternal grandmother was in a wheelchair, following cancer surgery. Sheeran and Wadge had a long talk that evening about enduring love.\n\nSheeran excused himself to shower before dinner with his parents, who live nearby, and Wadge picked up one of his acoustic guitars (a gift from Harry Styles) and began strumming a four-chord progression in D major. Sheeran heard it when he came out of the shower, and called out, \"We need to do something with that!\"\n\nAfter dinner, Wadge and Sheeran returned home and continued writing in Sheeran's kitchen. The first line, \"When your legs don't work like they used to,\" referred to his grandmother's condition. By midnight, \"Thinking Out Loud\" was finished. Sheeran recorded the song, in which the second and fourth chords are anticipated, just in time to include it on his second album, \"Multiply.\"\n\nAs a writer, Sheeran is known for his speed and facility. He can toss off four or five songs a day when he's recording an album. His EP \"No. 5 Collaborations Project\" led to a deal with Atlantic Records, a Warner Music label, when he was nineteen. He writes ballads as well as bangers; he also raps. He has collaborated with artists including Taylor Swift , Rita Ora, and Justin Bieber . His songs are popular partly because they are so accessible. It's as if you already know them.\n\nSheeran usually performs solo with a guitar-without costume changes, dancers, or pyrotechnics-backed only by looped tracks that he makes with a pedal as he plays. The two-year-long tour for his 2019 album, \"Divide,\" took in more than seven hundred and seventy-five million dollars, making it the second-highest-grossing tour of all time. Now, at thirty-two, he is one of the wealthiest people in the U.K.\n\n\"Thinking Out Loud,\" released in September, 2014, was one of the first songs to be streamed half a billion times on Spotify; it has since passed 2.2 billion streams. It won the 2015 Grammy for Song of the Year, and its success shot Sheeran into the thin air of the world's top hitmakers. The song also became a favorite at his concerts.\n\nIn a YouTube video of a Sheeran show in Zurich in November, 2014, the artist, playing an electric guitar, smoothly transitions from \"Thinking Out Loud\" to \"Let's Get It On\" and back to \"Thinking,\" without changing chords or the harmonic rhythm-the syncopated cadence at which chords are played. He smiles a bit mischievously. The crowd loves it.\n\nMost pop songs are made out of other pop songs. Many are constructed on three- or four-chord progressions, and have a near-identical blueprint-intro, verse, chorus, bridge, outro. Other than words and melody, not much in a composition is protected by copyright. As the Australian comedy trio Axis of Awesome demonstrates in a video that went viral, any number of pop songs can fit inside the same four chords. For this reason, the property lines of popular music are hard to draw. Inspiration, imitation, homage, and pastiche are all at play. Often, the trick is to sound new and old at the same time. But at what point do influence and interpolation become appropriation and plagiarism?\n\nIn 2019, the hitmaker Pharrell Williams spoke with the producer Rick Rubin, for a filmed conversation about creativity. Williams described his reaction to hearing a song that makes him feel something he hasn't felt before: \"I'm going to have to reverse engineer the feeling in order to get to the chord structure.\" He did just that with \" Blurred Lines ,\" his 2013 hit with Robin Thicke, for which he seemed to metabolize almost every aspect of Marvin Gaye's 1977 hit \"Got to Give It Up,\" including the crowd noises and the cowbell.\n\nBut, according to a jury in Los Angeles, Williams went too far. In 2015, it found that the composers of \"Blurred Lines\" had illegally copied Gaye's song. The songwriters were ultimately forced to pay the Gaye family $5.3 million, and to share half the song's future publishing royalties. The verdict was a victory for the copyright attorney Richard Busch. Afterward, more than two hundred producers and other people in the music business signed an amicus brief predicting that, if the verdict was upheld, they would be forced to work \"always with one foot in the recording studio and one foot in the courtroom.\" It was upheld anyway, in a 2-1 vote, in 2018. The dissenting judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Jacqueline Nguyen, described the ruling as \"a devastating blow to future musicians and composers everywhere,\" because it allowed \"the Gayes to accomplish what no one has before: copyright a musical style.\"\n\nMany people correctly predicted that the \"Blurred Lines\" ruling would trigger a wave of frivolous infringement cases. \"I can't tell you how many calls we get after the Grammys,\" Judith Finell, who was the Gaye family's expert musicologist in the \"Blurred Lines\" case, told me. \"Mostly from lawyers wanting to see if their client's claim of infringement is winnable.\"\n\nTaylor Swift, the Weeknd, and Justin Bieber are only a few of the artists who have been subject to recent allegations of infringement. The composers of Dua Lipa's 2020 hit \"Levitating\" are being sued on both coasts: In Los Angeles, the reggae band Artikal Sound System is claiming that the song copied its 2017 track \"Live Your Life.\" In the Southern District of New York, L. Russell Brown and Sandy Linzer believe that \"Levitating\" infringes on two songs they wrote, \"Wiggle and Giggle All Night,\" from 1979, and \"Don Diablo,\" from the following year.\n\nTwo influential decisions in California's Ninth Circuit in the past few years have repaired some of the \"Blurred Lines\" damage. In 2020, the appeals court confirmed a jury's verdict that Led Zeppelin's \"Stairway to Heaven\" did not infringe on \"Taurus,\" by the late-sixties rock band Spirit, because the descending A-minor figure in \"Taurus\" consisted of \"common musical elements\" that can't be copyrighted. In 2020, a district judge in Los Angeles overturned a verdict that found Katy Perry's \"Dark Horse\" had infringed on eight notes from \"Joyful Noise,\" an obscure song by the Christian artist Flame. The judge's decision was upheld on appeal.\n\nThis spring, a high-stakes copyright trial took place in New York City. The issue in Griffin v. Sheeran was whether Sheeran and Wadge had illegally copied from \"Let's Get It On\" in creating \"Thinking Out Loud.\" The larger issues were how much songwriters like Sheeran should be allowed to borrow from earlier works, and the opaque and antiquated process by which the law determines what part of a pop song the composer actually owns.\n\nMusic copyright, which became law in the United States in 1831, allows composers to establish the \"metes and bounds\" of their intellectual property, just as mechanical inventors do in obtaining patents. But a patent is granted only after examiners have determined, by way of an investigation, that an invention is truly new and useful. A music copyright is more like a virtual rubber stamp that a musician gets automatically as soon as a song is \"fixed in a tangible medium of expression.\" If the song is a hit and the musician is sued-because \"where there's a hit, there's a writ,\" as an old adage goes-it is up to the courts to figure out how original the work is.\n\nCopyright makes it commercially viable to be an artist. But painters can't claim ownership of a color, and songwriters can't monopolize notes or, for that matter, common chord progressions, modes, or rhythms. A composer is entitled to own only a particular expression or arrangement of a musical idea, not the idea itself. (The concept of an arpeggio, or of counterpoint, cannot be copyrighted.) The question is how to legally separate the two. The law, which represents the Apollonian side of human experience-the rational, analytical, and intellectual-is a leaky sieve for containing the Dionysian elements of music: the irrational, abstract, and emotional parts.\n\n\"Songwriters almost never steal melodies from one another on purpose,\" Joe Bennett, a professor of forensic musicology at Berklee College of Music, told me. \"In almost every case, the copying is inadvertent.\" Still, outright theft does happen-compare Johnny Cash's \"Folsom Prison Blues,\" from 1955, to Gordon Jenkins's 1953 song \"Crescent City Blues.\" Cash ultimately paid Jenkins seventy-five thousand dollars (which now amounts to some six hundred and sixty thousand) for lifting his melody and some of his lyrics.\n\nBennett explained that songwriters can be found liable for infringement of copyright even if the infringement was \"subconsciously accomplished.\" The phrase comes from the judge in a 1976 case, which found that George Harrison had unknowingly but unlawfully copied the Chiffons' 1963 song \"He's So Fine\" in his 1970 hit \"My Sweet Lord.\" The two melodies are virtually identical.\n\n\"Also known as 'cryptomnesia,' \" Bennett added. He defined the term as \"a forgotten memory that is mistaken for an original idea.\" Pop music is bursting with cryptomnesiacs.\n\nBefore the Internet, lack of access was the standard defense against a claim of subconscious copying: the composer couldn't possibly have heard the accuser's obscure song. At music publishers' offices, assistants were instructed to return unsolicited recordings unopened, so that the sender couldn't argue later that his work had been filched. But platforms like SoundCloud, Spotify, and TikTok have severely curtailed that defense. Finell, the musicologist, told me, \"Some kid will come to me and say, 'I just heard the latest Beyoncé song, and she stole my drum track!' I say, 'How did Beyoncé get to hear a drum track that you composed in your garage?' 'Well, I put it out on social media, and I have a hundred thousand followers. One of them could work with Jay-Z!' \"\n\nCan a style or a vibe ever be infringed on, if not all that much in pop is really new? True, some homages to past styles are more brazen than others: Bruno Mars and Mark Ronson took eighties funk grooves from the Gap Band's \"Oops Upside Your Head\" and made them part of the Grammy-winning song \"Uptown Funk\" without asking for permission. After the \"Blurred Lines\" verdict, a number of songwriters were added to the song's credits.\n\nThe music industry was recently shaken by \"Heart on My Sleeve,\" a song featuring a duet between a fake Drake and a fake the Weeknd, in which both vocals were created, using generative A.I., by an anonymous user called Ghostface. Artists and rights holders are concerned that their creations will be used to train A.I. generators that will eventually replace them. Faced with that possibility, rights holders are likely to seek more protection for style, even though doing so could make it harder for artists to do their work without infringing.\n\nEd Townsend had two sons, Clef Michael and David, born to his wife, Cherrigale, and a daughter, also named Cherrigale, born in Los Angeles in 1960 to a singer, who gave the child up for adoption at birth. The adoptive family, the Griffins, changed the baby's name to Kathryn. When Kathryn was a child, her adoptive mother would point at a hysterectomy scar on her stomach and say, \"This is where you came from.\"\n\nKathryn showed an aptitude for music, which made her parents nervous. \"My whole life, I wanted to play piano, flute, piccolo,\" she told me. The family moved from L.A. to Hattiesburg, Mississippi: \"They didn't want me in the music industry, because they were afraid I'd find out who my father was and fall into the life he did.\"\n\nGriffin fell anyway. She became addicted to crack cocaine and got into sex work to support her habit. She was trafficked, she told me, and after escaping her abusers she lived for a time in a \"cardboard condominium\" under a bridge. She speaks in a hoarse Southern drawl; in spite of her past, she laughs a lot.\n\nIn 1986, when Griffin was twenty-six, her grandfather, a Christian minister, told her that she was adopted. Her mother then confessed that her biological father was a famous musician. Griffin called an acquaintance, Hubert Laws, the jazz musician. \"Have you ever heard of a man named Ed Townsend?\" she asked. Laws replied, \"Everybody knows who Ed Townsend is!\" Griffin said, \"Well, I don't!\"\n\nShe recalled reaching Townsend by phone for the first time: \"I said, 'This is your daughter.' He said, 'I have looked for you your entire life.' \" But he had been searching for a Cherrigale, not a Kathryn.\n\nTownsend left Griffin a third of his \"Let's Get It On\" royalties. (In the nineteen-eighties, he had sold part of his share of the song's publishing copyright to Jobete.) She promised to protect his legacy. Griffin got sober in 2003, the year Townsend died. She began counselling women in prison in Houston who had been sex workers; she is now an expert in human-trafficking victims' rights. Griffin estimates that she has rescued more than a thousand women from \"the life.\" When her half brother David died, in 2005, he left Griffin his share of his father's royalties, as did her aunt Helen McDonald, in 2020.\n\nEarly in 2015, friends of Griffin alerted her to the similarities between \"Let's Get It On\" and a new song called \"Thinking Out Loud.\" \"They said, 'This British guy, he just changed the words and kept all the music!' \" she told me. Griffin listened to both: \"And I went, 'Oh, my God. Wow.' \"\n\nGriffin tried to notify Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the behemoth that had recently acquired the Jobete catalogue. But no one at Sony returned her calls. \"Let's Get It On\" was in the American Songbook. Shouldn't Sony want to protect its I.P. from infringement? Then Griffin figured it out: Sony was probably conflicted because it was also the publisher of \"Thinking Out Loud,\" along with much of the rest of Sheeran's catalogue.\n\nSony eventually asked two musicologists to investigate the claim. Both advised the company that there was no infringement, as did a third musicologist, whom Sheeran had hired in the U.K. Still, it seemed to Griffin that no one at Sony was looking after her interests or her father's legacy. (Sony says that it often finds itself on both sides of infringement suits, and that it remains neutral in these cases.)\n\nGriffin found lawyers, Pat Frank and Keisha Rice, in Tallahassee, Florida. They contacted Alexander Stewart, a professor of music at the University of Vermont. Stewart heard enough similarities between the two songs to write a report saying that Sheeran and Wadge were infringing on Gaye and Townsend. In 2017, Griffin's attorneys filed a civil suit in New York, where Sony is headquartered, which charged that \"the melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic compositions of 'Thinking' are substantially and /or strikingly similar\" to \"Let's Get It On.\" As with \"Blurred Lines,\" the claim focussed not on obvious similarities in the songs' melodies or lyrics but on compositional elements associated with the rhythmic harmony-the groove.\n\nOn a Monday a few weeks ago, shortly after 11 A.M. , Judge Louis L. Stanton, who is ninety-five years old, took his place at the bench in a federal courtroom in downtown Manhattan. The plaintiff, now Kathryn Griffin Townsend, was seated next to her attorneys. She wore a dark-green dress, a long black coat, and an expression of sombre resolve. Her daughter Skye was also in attendance.\n\nIn music-copyright trials, similarities are assessed by two kinds of people: expert listeners and lay ones. The élite ears belong to forensic musicologists, who are often academics with advanced degrees. They hear music intellectually, in quantifiable component parts: tempo, amplitude, arrangement. The musicologists offer supposedly objective analyses of the \"musical fingerprints\" of songs, but they manage to arrive at opposite conclusions, depending on which side is employing them-generally for around five hundred dollars an hour. The lay listeners on the jury, who are a kind of proxy for pop music's audience, temper the experts' testimony with what their own ears tell them.\n\nIn federal court, this methodology is known as the Arnstein test. It derives from Arnstein v. Porter-a famous 1946 case that was heard during New York's heyday as a songwriting town-involving Cole Porter , the Broadway composer, and Ira B. Arnstein, a writer of Yiddish folk songs and light opera, who became convinced that many of the biggest hits of the era had been stolen from him. The songwriter accused Porter of copying the melodies in \"Night and Day\" and \"My Heart Belongs to Daddy,\" among other songs, from sheet music kept in a trunk in his shabby Upper West Side apartment, possibly aided by a duplicitous landlord. Arnstein ultimately lost the case, as he lost every case in his long career as a copyright troll. However, as Gary Rosen notes in his book \"Unfair to Genius,\" from 2012, \"It is within American jurisprudence and not popular music that the name Ira B. Arnstein reverberates.\" He adds, \"If only he could have collected a royalty on the case law that bears his name.\"\n\nFourteen prospective lay listeners were called into the Griffin v. Sheeran jury box, and Judge Stanton asked whether anything prevented them from rendering impartial judgment.\n\n\" 'Perfect' was my wedding song,\" a young woman said.\n\n\"My teen-age daughters love Ed Sheeran,\" another said. \"I don't know his music.\"\n\nBoth women were eventually rejected during voir dire, as was a young man who said that he was pursuing a doctorate in musicology at Columbia University. Even though he was probably the best-qualified potential juror to decide the case, he clearly wasn't a lay listener. The final seven-person jury included a lawyer, a special-ed teacher, a dramaturge, an amateur singer, a recent college graduate, and a guy who'd played trumpet in middle school.\n\nBecause \"Let's Get It On,\" or \"L.G.O.,\" as the legal documents refer to the song, was recorded before 1978, it is governed by the 1909 Copyright Act, which stipulated that, in order for a musical work to be registered for copyright, a written composition must be submitted to the U.S. Copyright Office, in Washington, as the \"deposit copy.\" (It wasn't until the 1976 Copyright Act, which went into effect on January 1, 1978, that sound recordings were admissible as deposit copies.)\n\nIn both the \"Blurred Lines\" and \"Stairway to Heaven\" cases, the jury was not permitted to listen to any pre-1978 recording. The jurors in Griffin v. Sheeran could listen to the recording of Sheeran's song, but they had to rely on the five pages of sheet music for \"Let's Get It On,\" a skeletal transcription that contained lyrics, melody, chords, and a notation of where the syncopated beats fall. Gaye's piano and the Funk Brothers' additions to the groove, such as the bass line, weren't on the deposit copy. Gaye, who didn't read music, probably never even saw the transcription. (Sheeran can't read music, either, a fact that he readily admitted on the stand.) The only versions of \"L.G.O.\" that the jury could listen to were the experts' MIDI audio files, which were made from the sheet music using musical software, and sung by a computer-generated voice. The tinny, wheedling sound of the synthesized music and the high-pitched android vocal made a classic soul song sound utterly soulless.\n\nAlmost all the major African American contributions to American music-ragtime, jazz, swing, hip-hop-were built on rhythmic innovations that weren't transcribed in sheet music and copyrighted. (The bent third and seventh blue notes that lie at the heart of the blues can't even be written in twelve-note chromatic-scale notation.) Ingrid Monson, the Quincy Jones Professor of African American Music at Harvard, who also served as an expert witness for the Gaye family in the \"Blurred Lines\" trial, told me, \"There could be no copyright system less suited to rewarding the creativity of African American music than the one we have. It was obviously modelled on classical music, and on the idea that a real piece of music, one that was worthy of copyright, would be written in notation.\"\n\nEven though the Copyright Office now allows recordings to be submitted in place of transcriptions, melody and lyrics remain the most important elements of a musical copyright involving a song's composition, partly because they can be seen by judges and juries on paper. The focus on protecting the topline seems out of step with the dominance in contemporary pop of the track-the harmonic and rhythmic bed for a song, usually made by a producer on a digital workstation-which frequently precedes melodies and lyrics. It's often the track that makes a song sound unique.\n\nKathryn Griffin Townsend isn't the first person to accuse Ed Sheeran of copying a song. In 2017, on the advice of counsel, Sheeran settled an infringement claim brought by the writers of \"Amazing,\" a song performed by Matt Cardle, an \"X Factor\" winner, who maintained Sheeran's 2014 hit \"Photograph\" infringed on their track. Infringement claims are often resolved this way. In 2015, Sam Smith settled amicably with Tom Petty over the similarity between the chorus hook in Smith's song \"Stay with Me\" and that in Petty's \"I Won't Back Down.\" In 2021, Olivia Rodrigo offered the band Paramore a writing credit and a share of the profits from her song \"Good 4 You,\" whose hook sounds a lot like the pre-chorus of Paramore's \"Misery Business.\"\n\nBut Sheeran came to feel that settling (reportedly for five million dollars) made him a target for copyright trolls. \"Shape of You,\" a 2017 Sheeran megahit, was the subject of multiple disputes. He amicably resolved one, with the songwriters of TLC's hit \"No Scrubs,\" for borrowing its melody. (While writing the song, he'd referred to it as \"the TLC song.\") He initiated and won another case, brought in the U.K., against Sami Chokri, a British songwriter and grime artist, who'd asserted that Sheeran's \"Shape of You\" had stolen the chorus from his 2015 song \"Oh Why.\" The magistrate who decided the case in Sheeran's favor ordered Chokri to pay more than nine hundred thousand pounds, to cover Sheeran's legal fees.\n\nIn a BBC Two \"Newsnight\" interview that aired in the U.K. after the victory, Sheeran and his co-writer John McDaid, of Snow Patrol, talked about the \"extraordinary strain\" of the lawsuit on their creativity and mental health. \"The best feeling in the world is the euphoria around the first idea of writing a great song,\" Sheeran said, perhaps recalling that night in the kitchen with Wadge. \"The first spark, where you go, 'This is special-we can't spoil this.' \" He went on, \"But that feeling has now turned into 'Oh, wait, let's stand back for a minute, have we touched anything?' You find yourself in the moment second-guessing yourself.\" As a precaution, Sheeran added, he films all his songwriting sessions, should a claim later arise.\n\n\"This is not about money,\" Sheeran said. \"It's about heart, honesty, and integrity. Win or lose, we had to go to court-we had to stand up for what we thought was right.\"\n\nSheeran decided to go to court rather than settle with Griffin for the same reason. He testified that his songwriter and artist friends were urging him to fight, saying, \" 'You have to win this for us.' \" These days, Sheeran observed, \"it's just something that happens. When you write songs and they're successful, someone comes after you.\" He also said that, if he lost this case, he was going to quit music. \"I'm finished,\" he declared. \"I'm done.\"\n\nSheeran arrived in court the day after jury selection. He wore a dark-navy suit with double vents in the back, and a blue necktie with small white polka dots, but he still managed to look scruffy, like a subway busker turned banker. He sat at the defense table, where, in the course of seven days, the spectators behind him-a mix of copyright attorneys, music journalists, and superfans-could study his distinctive copper-colored coif.\n\nTownsend sat just in front of Sheeran, at the plaintiff's table. Her coat, a gift from the musician George Clinton , had the word \" INTEGRITY \" emblazoned on the back, directly in Sheeran's line of sight. Townsend's legal team included the civil-rights lawyer Ben Crump, a personal friend, who represented George Floyd 's family after Floyd's murder, and worked with Keisha Rice on the Trayvon Martin wrongful-death case. This would be his first music-copyright trial.\n\nA few weeks earlier, Crump had held a press conference outside the courthouse. With Townsend standing next to him, he'd said, \"It is important that we understand that this is part of a larger issue. Far too many times in history, Black artists have created some of the most miraculous music in the world, only to see white artists come and usurp that music and reap untold fortunes while these Black artists and their families derive nothing from their genius.\"\n\nBut surely the Yorkshire-born Sheeran wasn't solely responsible for the shameful exploitation of Black artists within the U.S. music industry? As Jennifer Jenkins, a copyright-law professor at Duke, put it to me, \"Sheeran isn't Pat Boone covering songs by Little Richard, and he isn't Alan Freed taking credit for Chuck Berry's 'Maybellene' without writing a single note.\" Nevertheless, Crump called on Sheeran to \"do the right thing\" and settle with Griffin before the trial started. Otherwise, Crump thundered, \"let's get it on!\"\n\nIn his opening statement, Crump called for \"credit where credit is due,\" but he stopped short of accusing Sheeran of appropriating Black music. He characterized the video of Sheeran's Zurich concert as a \"smoking gun.\"\n\n\"Maya Angelou tells us that when a person shows you who they are, it's our duty to believe them,\" Crump declared. \"When someone provides you a voluntary confession, believe them.\"\n\nIlene Farkas, a copyright specialist at the powerhouse firm Pryor Cashman, who along with Donald Zakarin led Sheeran's legal team, delivered the defense's opening. She said that the only similarities between the two songs were a common chord progression and an equally common syncopated rhythm. The plaintiffs, she argued, \"cannot own these common musical elements.\"\n\nOn the stand, Townsend described her feelings about Sony's failure to respond to her inquiries. \"I feel they've been so negligent,\" she said, her voice thick with emotion. \"And I promised my father I would protect his work and artistry.\" She went on, \"I have nothing against Mr. Sheeran personally. I think he's a great artist with a great future. I am simply trying to protect my father's legacy.\"\n\nAfter lunch, the plaintiffs called Sheeran to the stand, where Rice questioned him. Sheeran testified to hearing \"L.G.O.\" for the first time in an Austin Powers movie, but denied copying it.\n\nRice asked Sheeran about his song \"Take It Back,\" which boasts about stealing rap lyrics:\n\nYou'll find me ripping the writtens\n\nOut of the pages they sit in\n\nAnd never once I get bitten\n\nBecause plagiarism is hidden\n\n\"Are those your lyrics?\" Rice asked.\n\n\"Can I just give context?\" Sheeran replied.\n\n\"If I need more context, I'll certainly ask,\" Rice said.\n\n\"I feel like you don't want me to answer because you know what I'm going to say is going to make a lot of sense,\" Sheeran said.\n\nFinally, the plaintiffs played the Zurich video, which they saw as their strongest single piece of evidence. (The admissibility of the video as evidence had been the subject of much legal maneuvering by the defense, who appeared keen not to see it played.) Sheeran watched from the witness box, his moon face expressionless. Afterward, he remarked, with some heat, \"Quite frankly, if I had done what you're accusing me of doing, I would be an idiot to stand on a stage in front of twenty thousand people and show that.\"\n\nSheeran is a master of the mashup. At shows, he often interpolates his songs and other people's songs, as a kind of musical party trick; he sometimes takes requests from the audience. Throughout his time on the stand, he entertained the jury and spectators by demonstrating this with an acoustic guitar that his team placed within reach of the witness box. At one point, he started singing \"Thinking Out Loud,\" transitioned into Shania Twain's \"You're Still the One,\" then into Bob Dylan's \"Just Like a Woman,\" and finished with Van Morrison's \"Crazy Love.\" Recordings of Sheeran's mashups were played: \"Take It Back\" with \"Superstition,\" by Stevie Wonder, and \"Ain't No Sunshine,\" by Bill Withers.\n\n\"You can kind of play most pop songs over most pop songs,\" Sheeran told the room. It was persuasive testimony, but it also helped explain why Sheeran's songs sound familiar-they're not so different from many other songs.\n\nIn the \"Blurred Lines\" trial, Judith Finell devoted much of her testimony to a PowerPoint presentation. Average listeners have a hard time comparing two songs aurally, she told me: \"The first song doesn't stay in their memory when the second song starts playing.\" But, she added, \"people do retain visual information.\" Her presentation used a time-stamped map of intervals in the two songs which showed \"significant similarities\" by way of color-coded charts. To critics, her presentation was all smoke and mirrors, designed to trick the jury into thinking that a collection of unprotectable elements was forensic proof that \"Blurred Lines\" was stained with Marvin Gaye's musical DNA.\n\nTownsend's expert, Alexander Stewart, had also prepared a slide show, and his presentation focussed on three areas of similarity between the songs. These were several melody fragments; the syncopated rhythm that anticipated the second and fourth chords; and the progression, which Stewart claimed was, in the Roman nomenclature of chords, a I-iii-IV-V progression. He testified that, of all the songs that came before \"L.G.O.,\" he could find only one-a version of \"Georgy Girl\" recorded by \"a rather obscure Mexican bandleader\" in 1966-that employed the same combination of chord progression and syncopation. He estimated that seventy per cent of the \"musical value\" of Sheeran's song was derived from Gaye and Townsend's.\n\nLawrence Ferrara, a professor of music at N.Y.U., was the forensic musicologist for the defense. He pointed out that the chord progression Ed Townsend had played for Gaye was so common that it was in elementary music-method books such as \"How to Play Rock 'n' Roll Piano,\" published in 1967. He claimed that six songs had the same progression and rhythm as \"L.G.O.,\" including Holland-Dozier-Holland's \"You Lost the Sweetest Boy\" (1963), sung by Mary Wells, and the Mexican recording of \"Georgy Girl.\" (In the Seekers' hit version, the expert noted, the guitar is anticipated, but the bass plays on the beat.) If Sheeran were found to have illegally copied \"Let's Get It On,\" then the rights holders of those earlier songs could claim that \"L.G.O.\" had infringed on them, resulting in a circular firing squad of lawsuits. Ferrara variously characterized parts of Stewart's testimony as \"farcical,\" \"absurd,\" and \"ludicrous.\"\n\nSheeran also commented on Stewart's presentation. \"I think what he's doing is criminal,\" he said. \"I don't know why he's allowed to be an expert.\" What annoyed Sheeran most was that Stewart heard an F-sharp minor chord at the beginning of \"Thinking Out Loud.\" This would make it identical to the I-iii-IV-V progression in \"L.G.O.,\" if Sheeran's song were transposed to E-flat. But, in fact, Sheeran said, Stewart was wrong: the chord was a D over F-sharp-a D-major first inversion, which Sheeran demonstrated by strumming both progressions.\n\n\"I know what I'm playing on guitar,\" he said. \"It's me playing it.\"\n\n\"And how do you know Dr. Stewart is wrong?\" Farkas asked.\n\n\"I wrote it, and I play it every week, a lot,\" Sheeran said.\n\nThe other third of Ed Townsend's third of the \"Let's Get It On\" royalties, which was once owned by his son Michael, now belongs to Structured Asset Sales, an L.A.-based company founded by the financier David Pullman. Pullman is a pioneer in packaging song catalogues as investment-grade securities, a common practice today. Essentially, an investor buys a share and reaps a portion of future earnings from royalties, licensing, and new technologies like streaming. Pullman created the first of these securities, Bowie Bonds, in collaboration with David Bowie , in 1997. He has worked on similar deals for catalogues belonging to the estates of James Brown, the Isley Brothers, and Holland-Dozier-Holland, among others.\n\nPullman filed a separate hundred-million-dollar suit against Sony in 2018. In another legal action, he is seeking to capitalize on an amicus brief filed by the Copyright Office in the \"Stairway to Heaven\" case, which noted that there could be \"multiple, distinct copyrightable works that are all versions of the same song.\" This opened up the possibility of refiling a sound recording with the Copyright Office as a new arrangement, which would be covered by the rules of the 1976 Copyright Act. After reading the brief, Pullman submitted the recording of \"L.G.O.\" and sued Sheeran again, based on substantial similarities that were not reflected in the original deposit copy. Sheeran might well spend the rest of his life defending his tender evocation of enduring love against an implacable opponent whose name, like Arnstein's, is embedded in New York case law. (To \"Pullmanize\" someone is to legally remove an unwanted owner from a co-op building, named for the process that Pullman's fellow-owners on West Sixty-seventh Street went through in state court in 2001.)\n\nPullman now lives in an art-filled villa high atop Hollywood, with an unbeatable view of the city from his trapezoidal pool. As a music investor, he favors evergreens. In his estimation, there are so many more infringement cases these days not because of frivolous lawsuits but because of bolder instances of theft. \"It used to be, you'd find a song that wasn't that big a hit,\" he said, in his rapid-fire speaking style. \"Now they'll take hits. You have a better chance of having a hit if you take a giant hit. Why? Because people already recognize it!\"\n\nIn Pullman's opinion, Sheeran is a serial infringer: \"Why does he write songs so quickly? Maybe it's because parts of them are already written.\" He mentioned the Zurich video: \"He seamlessly goes into 'Let's Get It On'-did you pick that song out of a hat? Out of sixty million registered songs, why do you pick that song? It's a tell.\" He recalled the well-known story of Paul McCartney going around and asking people if the melody of \"Yesterday,\" which had come to him in a dream, was in fact remembered from another song. Today, Pullman said, it's \"infringe now, worry about it later.\"\n\nPullman said that he would consider settling for a respectful sum: \"I don't understand why someone wants to go through so many trials. Every case against him will just get stronger.\"\n\nWhen I saw Kathryn Griffin Townsend in the courthouse cafeteria before closing arguments, she looked rested and happy. \"Win, lose, or draw, it doesn't matter, because we won,\" she told me. \"Now people know what happened. And they'll think before they do it again.\" She added, \"This has never been about money.\"\n\nIlene Farkas, who closed for the defense, noted that we were all here because, exactly fifty years ago, Ed Townsend sat down at his piano and played Marvin Gaye four chords. Townsend had been free to use them to make a song, just as Sheeran should be. \"Do we have to tell the eleven-year-old next Ed Sheeran that they better find out who owns that chord progression?\" she asked.\n\nBen Crump reminded the jurors that this Ed Sheeran had threatened to quit music if they decided against him: a heavy burden. Millions of Sheeran fans would despise them, and the promoters and stadium owners involved in Sheeran's forthcoming world tour for his new album, \"Subtract,\" would be on the hook for the cancelled shows. \"That's simply a threat to try to play on your emotions,\" Crump said. \"I promise you, no matter what your verdict is, he won't be done with music.\" The lawyer observed that Sheeran is, above all, a performer. \"Don't be charmed,\" he said. \"I'm sure if Ed Townsend was alive and in this court, he would have been just as charming.\"\n\nThe jury deliberated for less than three hours before handing its verdict to Judge Stanton: Sheeran and Wadge had independently created \"Thinking Out Loud\"; they had not infringed on \"Let's Get It On.\"\n\nSheeran, who had missed his paternal grandmother's funeral to testify, emotionally embraced Farkas and Zakarin. Wadge wept. The music executives looked pleased. The trial had given both songs streaming bumps.\n\nOutside, on Worth Street, the pop star read a statement. \"It looks like I'm not going to have to retire from my day job,\" Sheeran said. However, \"I am unbelievably frustrated that baseless claims like this are allowed to go to court at all.\" He hoped that now he and his fellow-songwriters could \"all just go back to making music.\" (Judge Stanton dismissed the first of Pullman's lawsuits a week later.) Then his artfully tousled head disappeared into a black S.U.V. and was gone.\n\nTownsend did not seem at all downhearted by the verdict. She had honored her promise to her father, she told me, which was \u0000\u0000\"to protect his intellectual property.\" She'd embraced Sheeran in the courtroom after the verdict, and they'd chatted briefly. \" 'All I ever wanted to do was talk to you about this,' \" she said she'd told him. \" 'I'm sorry it took all this to make that happen.' \"\n\nTownsend went on to say that Sheeran had offered her tickets to his upcoming concert at NRG Stadium, in Houston. She ended up declining the offer, opting to attend her grandson's pre-K graduation instead. At the show, \"Thinking Out Loud\" came midway through. \"Let's Get It On\" did not make the set list. ♦\n\nAn earlier version of this article misidentified the street where David Pullman lived in a co-op building.\n\nAudio: Robin Thicke, T.I., and Pharrell Williams, \"Blurred Lines\" (Star Trak); Johnny Cash, \"Folsom Prison Blues\" (Sun Label Group); The Chiffons \"He's So Fine\" (Capitol Records); Marvin Gaye, \"Let's Get It On\" (Motown Record Company); Cory Daye, \"Wiggle and Giggle All Night\" (Featherbed Music); Tom Petty, \"I Won't Back Down\" (MCA Records); George Harrison, \"My Sweet Lord\" (G.H.

      "text": "Whom Does Kobe Bryant Represent?\n\nI had no particular expectation of controversy when I asked Kobe Bryant about the Miami Heat players' Twitter activism in the wake of Trayvon Martin's death, posing in hoodies as a protest against racial profiling. It was, if anything, a so-called softball question, meant to confirm my impression that Bryant, the subject of my Profile in last week's magazine, who had spoken proudly of his participation in Bill Clinton's Health Matters Initiative, was more politically engaged than his idol Michael Jordan.\n\n\"Is that the kind of thing you could see yourself doing?\" I asked.\n\nBryant paused and said, \"Smartly,\" seeming to imply that my example wasn't one that he would have chosen himself. \"I won't react to something just because I'm supposed to, because I'm an African-American. That argument doesn't make any sense to me. So we want to advance as a society and as a culture, but, say, if something happens to an African-American, we immediately come to his defense? Yet you want to talk about how far we've progressed as a society? Well, if we've progressed as a society, then you don't jump to somebody's defense just because they're African-American. You sit and you listen to the facts just like you would in any other situation, right? So I won't assert myself.\"\n\nThis particular quote sparked a contentious debate, particularly among African-American commentators. On ESPN, the columnist and on-air personality Jason Whitlock dismissed Bryant's \"disingenuous appeal for colorblindness,\" and wrote that he \"sounds like he's promoting Rush Limbaugh's opening monologue.\" Roland Martin, a former CNN contributor who now hosts a morning show on the TV One network, tweeted his disapproval so relentlessly (e.g., \"Does this dude have a brain?\" ) that Bryant was moved to call Martin's cell phone for an impromptu debate. (See here for Martin's recap of their conversation, in which, Martin said, Bryant lamented that others questioned Condoleezza Rice's \"blackness\" because of her politics.) Najee Ali, the founder of an organization called Project Islamic H.O.P.E., even called for a boycott of all products endorsed by Bryant. Yesterday, the Heat's Dwyane Wade offered a milder reproach , saying that he \"respectfully\" disagreed with his rival shooting guard. \"It was our back yard, and being in our back yard, being something that a lot of guys on this team-not only growing up in the kind of environment that Trayvon was in-but also having young boys,\" Wade said, of the motivation behind the hoodie photo. \"It was more so that than the color of his skin.\"\n\nIn our conversation, Bryant was speaking generally, more about my expectation that he should voice a strong opinion about the Martin case than about the incident itself. (He has since tweeted that he believes that \"Martin was wronged\" and \"the system did not work.\") \"I won't say, 'O.K., I'm going to vote for Obama just because he's an African-American,' \" he went on. \"I'm not going to do that in a million years. You got to sit and take everything as equal and pick the best candidate for the job. That's it. Now, from a responsibility, individually, I feel like I speak quite a bit to African-American kids about dreaming bigger. If you look at playing basketball, or you play baseball, or you're a musician, or whatever it is, there's a thousand different things that surround that career path that you can get into as well. I tweeted a while ago for athletes not just to understand their sport but to understand their sport's industry, because I think that's where it's at. You don't want to go out there and just play the game. There's so much that goes on around you in your brand and what you represent, and what you could represent.\"\n\nThe quotes in the preceding paragraph were not included in the Profile but they bring us back to the question of what-or whom-Bryant represents, and how he wishes to exert his considerable influence. (Ben Crump, a lawyer representing Trayvon Martin's parents, appeared the other day on Roland Martin's show and said, \"What made the Miami Heat so inspiring is that they have this influence, and they weren't just using it to sell basketball shoes.\") Bryant told me that the seven years that he spent living in Italy, as a child, while his father played professional basketball there, inspired in him a strong sense that there is \"a much bigger world out there.\" His ambitions have long seemed international in scope, if inchoate, such that he might not want to be perceived as speaking exclusively for a subset of the domestic population. \"We are not even the dominant minority anymore,\" the ESPN host Stephen A. Smith, who is black, said on \"The Arsenio Hall Show,\" on Sunday night, in the course of defending Bryant. \"We have to recognize that we are outnumbered.\"\n\nA few months ago, even before the Trayvon Martin flap, the retired running back Jim Brown appeared on Hall's show and argued that Bryant was, in effect, not a true African-American: \"He is somewhat confused about culture because he was brought up in another country.\" At the time, Bryant seemed almost to embrace the dis, referring to himself on Twitter as a \" 'Global' African-American\" and wondering whether Nelson Mandela or Martin Luther King, Jr., would have appreciated Brown's pejorative insinuation that Bryant's foreign upbringing made him less authentically black. In the past week, Bryant has continued to embrace the debate, telling Roland Martin that society needs lightning rods, and that he's willing to be one, proclaiming, via hashtag , that he was proudly color-blind and gender-blind. \"Critical or not,\" Bryant wrote , \"We've had a ton of convo the last few days about a BIG issue. That's always a good thing. Luv to ALL who tweeted thoughts.\" Let's hope that he keeps the discussion going. Michael Jordan may or may not have said \"Republicans buy shoes, too,\" to defend his decision not to endorse a black challenger to Senator Jesse Helms, in 1990, but he never cared to articulate a vision grander than Being Like Mike.\n\nPhotograph by Lisa Blumenfeld/Getty.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "The Case for and Against Ed Sheeran\n\nThe pop singer's trial for copyright infringement of Marvin Gaye and Ed Townsend's \"Let's Get It On\" highlights how hard it is to draw the property lines of pop.\n\nEd Sheeran denies illegally copying Ed Townsend and Marvin Gaye's song. Photo illustration by Mark Harris; Source photographs from Getty\n\nOne day in 1973, Edward Townsend, a singer-songwriter who'd had a minor hit with the 1958 ballad \"For Your Love,\" invited a friend, the R. & B. superstar Marvin Gaye, to his home in Los Angeles, to hear some new tunes. Sitting at the piano, Townsend played a four-chord progression in the key of E-flat major while singing a melody that harked back to his doo-wop days. Townsend, then forty-three, had recently been released from rehab, and the song was a plea to a higher power to help him stay sober. \"I've been really tryin' baby, tryin' to hold back this feeling for so long\" was one of the lines.\n\nGaye, who was suffering from writer's block after the huge success of \"What's Going On,\" for Motown Records, in 1971, heard his friend's song as a hymn to sex. Together, they created \"Let's Get It On.\"\n\nMotown's music-publishing company, Jobete, took fifty per cent of the song's copyright. Gaye and Townsend agreed to split their share of the composition's future earnings. Gaye recorded the song in L.A., in March, 1973, with members of the Funk Brothers, Motown's house band, who added the wah-wah guitar introduction and the song's undeniable groove, in which the second and fourth chords are anticipated-slightly in front of the beat. Gaye, in addition to his soaring vocal, played keyboard on the record. The song, Gaye's first No. 1, was one of the biggest hits of the year. It became a foundational track in the quiet storm of seventies R. & B. and soul, and has remained an evergreen-a steady earner.\n\n\"Let's Get It On\" launched a new phase in Gaye's career; four years later, his song \"Got to Give It Up\" also reached No. 1. Before his death, a filicide by Marvin Gaye, Sr., in 1984, Gaye had a final smash with \"Sexual Healing.\"\n\nTownsend's career peaked with \"Let's Get It On.\" He fell back into alcohol abuse, acquired a cocaine habit, and ended up living on the streets of Los Angeles. He eventually beat his addictions, and, near the end of his life, devoted himself to helping others on the street. He died in 2003, at the age of seventy-four.\n\nIn February, 2014, an English singer-songwriter named Amy Wadge visited the pop star Ed Sheeran at his home in Suffolk. Wadge was an old friend and a frequent collaborator. Sheeran's paternal grandfather had recently died, and his maternal grandmother was in a wheelchair, following cancer surgery. Sheeran and Wadge had a long talk that evening about enduring love.\n\nSheeran excused himself to shower before dinner with his parents, who live nearby, and Wadge picked up one of his acoustic guitars (a gift from Harry Styles) and began strumming a four-chord progression in D major. Sheeran heard it when he came out of the shower, and called out, \"We need to do something with that!\"\n\nAfter dinner, Wadge and Sheeran returned home and continued writing in Sheeran's kitchen. The first line, \"When your legs don't work like they used to,\" referred to his grandmother's condition. By midnight, \"Thinking Out Loud\" was finished. Sheeran recorded the song, in which the second and fourth chords are anticipated, just in time to include it on his second album, \"Multiply.\"\n\nAs a writer, Sheeran is known for his speed and facility. He can toss off four or five songs a day when he's recording an album. His EP \"No. 5 Collaborations Project\" led to a deal with Atlantic Records, a Warner Music label, when he was nineteen. He writes ballads as well as bangers; he also raps. He has collaborated with artists including Taylor Swift , Rita Ora, and Justin Bieber . His songs are popular partly because they are so accessible. It's as if you already know them.\n\nSheeran usually performs solo with a guitar-without costume changes, dancers, or pyrotechnics-backed only by looped tracks that he makes with a pedal as he plays. The two-year-long tour for his 2019 album, \"Divide,\" took in more than seven hundred and seventy-five million dollars, making it the second-highest-grossing tour of all time. Now, at thirty-two, he is one of the wealthiest people in the U.K.\n\n\"Thinking Out Loud,\" released in September, 2014, was one of the first songs to be streamed half a billion times on Spotify; it has since passed 2.2 billion streams. It won the 2015 Grammy for Song of the Year, and its success shot Sheeran into the thin air of the world's top hitmakers. The song also became a favorite at his concerts.\n\nIn a YouTube video of a Sheeran show in Zurich in November, 2014, the artist, playing an electric guitar, smoothly transitions from \"Thinking Out Loud\" to \"Let's Get It On\" and back to \"Thinking,\" without changing chords or the harmonic rhythm-the syncopated cadence at which chords are played. He smiles a bit mischievously. The crowd loves it.\n\nMost pop songs are made out of other pop songs. Many are constructed on three- or four-chord progressions, and have a near-identical blueprint-intro, verse, chorus, bridge, outro. Other than words and melody, not much in a composition is protected by copyright. As the Australian comedy trio Axis of Awesome demonstrates in a video that went viral, any number of pop songs can fit inside the same four chords. For this reason, the property lines of popular music are hard to draw. Inspiration, imitation, homage, and pastiche are all at play. Often, the trick is to sound new and old at the same time. But at what point do influence and interpolation become appropriation and plagiarism?\n\nIn 2019, the hitmaker Pharrell Williams spoke with the producer Rick Rubin, for a filmed conversation about creativity. Williams described his reaction to hearing a song that makes him feel something he hasn't felt before: \"I'm going to have to reverse engineer the feeling in order to get to the chord structure.\" He did just that with \" Blurred Lines ,\" his 2013 hit with Robin Thicke, for which he seemed to metabolize almost every aspect of Marvin Gaye's 1977 hit \"Got to Give It Up,\" including the crowd noises and the cowbell.\n\nBut, according to a jury in Los Angeles, Williams went too far. In 2015, it found that the composers of \"Blurred Lines\" had illegally copied Gaye's song. The songwriters were ultimately forced to pay the Gaye family $5.3 million, and to share half the song's future publishing royalties. The verdict was a victory for the copyright attorney Richard Busch. Afterward, more than two hundred producers and other people in the music business signed an amicus brief predicting that, if the verdict was upheld, they would be forced to work \"always with one foot in the recording studio and one foot in the courtroom.\" It was upheld anyway, in a 2-1 vote, in 2018. The dissenting judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Jacqueline Nguyen, described the ruling as \"a devastating blow to future musicians and composers everywhere,\" because it allowed \"the Gayes to accomplish what no one has before: copyright a musical style.\"\n\nMany people correctly predicted that the \"Blurred Lines\" ruling would trigger a wave of frivolous infringement cases. \"I can't tell you how many calls we get after the Grammys,\" Judith Finell, who was the Gaye family's expert musicologist in the \"Blurred Lines\" case, told me. \"Mostly from lawyers wanting to see if their client's claim of infringement is winnable.\"\n\nTaylor Swift, the Weeknd, and Justin Bieber are only a few of the artists who have been subject to recent allegations of infringement. The composers of Dua Lipa's 2020 hit \"Levitating\" are being sued on both coasts: In Los Angeles, the reggae band Artikal Sound System is claiming that the song copied its 2017 track \"Live Your Life.\" In the Southern District of New York, L. Russell Brown and Sandy Linzer believe that \"Levitating\" infringes on two songs they wrote, \"Wiggle and Giggle All Night,\" from 1979, and \"Don Diablo,\" from the following year.\n\nTwo influential decisions in California's Ninth Circuit in the past few years have repaired some of the \"Blurred Lines\" damage. In 2020, the appeals court confirmed a jury's verdict that Led Zeppelin's \"Stairway to Heaven\" did not infringe on \"Taurus,\" by the late-sixties rock band Spirit, because the descending A-minor figure in \"Taurus\" consisted of \"common musical elements\" that can't be copyrighted. In 2020, a district judge in Los Angeles overturned a verdict that found Katy Perry's \"Dark Horse\" had infringed on eight notes from \"Joyful Noise,\" an obscure song by the Christian artist Flame. The judge's decision was upheld on appeal.\n\nThis spring, a high-stakes copyright trial took place in New York City. The issue in Griffin v. Sheeran was whether Sheeran and Wadge had illegally copied from \"Let's Get It On\" in creating \"Thinking Out Loud.\" The larger issues were how much songwriters like Sheeran should be allowed to borrow from earlier works, and the opaque and antiquated process by which the law determines what part of a pop song the composer actually owns.\n\nMusic copyright, which became law in the United States in 1831, allows composers to establish the \"metes and bounds\" of their intellectual property, just as mechanical inventors do in obtaining patents. But a patent is granted only after examiners have determined, by way of an investigation, that an invention is truly new and useful. A music copyright is more like a virtual rubber stamp that a musician gets automatically as soon as a song is \"fixed in a tangible medium of expression.\" If the song is a hit and the musician is sued-because \"where there's a hit, there's a writ,\" as an old adage goes-it is up to the courts to figure out how original the work is.\n\nCopyright makes it commercially viable to be an artist. But painters can't claim ownership of a color, and songwriters can't monopolize notes or, for that matter, common chord progressions, modes, or rhythms. A composer is entitled to own only a particular expression or arrangement of a musical idea, not the idea itself. (The concept of an arpeggio, or of counterpoint, cannot be copyrighted.) The question is how to legally separate the two. The law, which represents the Apollonian side of human experience-the rational, analytical, and intellectual-is a leaky sieve for containing the Dionysian elements of music: the irrational, abstract, and emotional parts.\n\n\"Songwriters almost never steal melodies from one another on purpose,\" Joe Bennett, a professor of forensic musicology at Berklee College of Music, told me. \"In almost every case, the copying is inadvertent.\" Still, outright theft does happen-compare Johnny Cash's \"Folsom Prison Blues,\" from 1955, to Gordon Jenkins's 1953 song \"Crescent City Blues.\" Cash ultimately paid Jenkins seventy-five thousand dollars (which now amounts to some six hundred and sixty thousand) for lifting his melody and some of his lyrics.\n\nBennett explained that songwriters can be found liable for infringement of copyright even if the infringement was \"subconsciously accomplished.\" The phrase comes from the judge in a 1976 case, which found that George Harrison had unknowingly but unlawfully copied the Chiffons' 1963 song \"He's So Fine\" in his 1970 hit \"My Sweet Lord.\" The two melodies are virtually identical.\n\n\"Also known as 'cryptomnesia,' \" Bennett added. He defined the term as \"a forgotten memory that is mistaken for an original idea.\" Pop music is bursting with cryptomnesiacs.\n\nBefore the Internet, lack of access was the standard defense against a claim of subconscious copying: the composer couldn't possibly have heard the accuser's obscure song. At music publishers' offices, assistants were instructed to return unsolicited recordings unopened, so that the sender couldn't argue later that his work had been filched. But platforms like SoundCloud, Spotify, and TikTok have severely curtailed that defense. Finell, the musicologist, told me, \"Some kid will come to me and say, 'I just heard the latest Beyoncé song, and she stole my drum track!' I say, 'How did Beyoncé get to hear a drum track that you composed in your garage?' 'Well, I put it out on social media, and I have a hundred thousand followers. One of them could work with Jay-Z!' \"\n\nCan a style or a vibe ever be infringed on, if not all that much in pop is really new? True, some homages to past styles are more brazen than others: Bruno Mars and Mark Ronson took eighties funk grooves from the Gap Band's \"Oops Upside Your Head\" and made them part of the Grammy-winning song \"Uptown Funk\" without asking for permission. After the \"Blurred Lines\" verdict, a number of songwriters were added to the song's credits.\n\nThe music industry was recently shaken by \"Heart on My Sleeve,\" a song featuring a duet between a fake Drake and a fake the Weeknd, in which both vocals were created, using generative A.I., by an anonymous user called Ghostface. Artists and rights holders are concerned that their creations will be used to train A.I. generators that will eventually replace them. Faced with that possibility, rights holders are likely to seek more protection for style, even though doing so could make it harder for artists to do their work without infringing.\n\nEd Townsend had two sons, Clef Michael and David, born to his wife, Cherrigale, and a daughter, also named Cherrigale, born in Los Angeles in 1960 to a singer, who gave the child up for adoption at birth. The adoptive family, the Griffins, changed the baby's name to Kathryn. When Kathryn was a child, her adoptive mother would point at a hysterectomy scar on her stomach and say, \"This is where you came from.\"\n\nKathryn showed an aptitude for music, which made her parents nervous. \"My whole life, I wanted to play piano, flute, piccolo,\" she told me. The family moved from L.A. to Hattiesburg, Mississippi: \"They didn't want me in the music industry, because they were afraid I'd find out who my father was and fall into the life he did.\"\n\nGriffin fell anyway. She became addicted to crack cocaine and got into sex work to support her habit. She was trafficked, she told me, and after escaping her abusers she lived for a time in a \"cardboard condominium\" under a bridge. She speaks in a hoarse Southern drawl; in spite of her past, she laughs a lot.\n\nIn 1986, when Griffin was twenty-six, her grandfather, a Christian minister, told her that she was adopted. Her mother then confessed that her biological father was a famous musician. Griffin called an acquaintance, Hubert Laws, the jazz musician. \"Have you ever heard of a man named Ed Townsend?\" she asked. Laws replied, \"Everybody knows who Ed Townsend is!\" Griffin said, \"Well, I don't!\"\n\nShe recalled reaching Townsend by phone for the first time: \"I said, 'This is your daughter.' He said, 'I have looked for you your entire life.' \" But he had been searching for a Cherrigale, not a Kathryn.\n\nTownsend left Griffin a third of his \"Let's Get It On\" royalties. (In the nineteen-eighties, he had sold part of his share of the song's publishing copyright to Jobete.) She promised to protect his legacy. Griffin got sober in 2003, the year Townsend died. She began counselling women in prison in Houston who had been sex workers; she is now an expert in human-trafficking victims' rights. Griffin estimates that she has rescued more than a thousand women from \"the life.\" When her half brother David died, in 2005, he left Griffin his share of his father's royalties, as did her aunt Helen McDonald, in 2020.\n\nEarly in 2015, friends of Griffin alerted her to the similarities between \"Let's Get It On\" and a new song called \"Thinking Out Loud.\" \"They said, 'This British guy, he just changed the words and kept all the music!' \" she told me. Griffin listened to both: \"And I went, 'Oh, my God. Wow.' \"\n\nGriffin tried to notify Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the behemoth that had recently acquired the Jobete catalogue. But no one at Sony returned her calls. \"Let's Get It On\" was in the American Songbook. Shouldn't Sony want to protect its I.P. from infringement? Then Griffin figured it out: Sony was probably conflicted because it was also the publisher of \"Thinking Out Loud,\" along with much of the rest of Sheeran's catalogue.\n\nSony eventually asked two musicologists to investigate the claim. Both advised the company that there was no infringement, as did a third musicologist, whom Sheeran had hired in the U.K. Still, it seemed to Griffin that no one at Sony was looking after her interests or her father's legacy. (Sony says that it often finds itself on both sides of infringement suits, and that it remains neutral in these cases.)\n\nGriffin found lawyers, Pat Frank and Keisha Rice, in Tallahassee, Florida. They contacted Alexander Stewart, a professor of music at the University of Vermont. Stewart heard enough similarities between the two songs to write a report saying that Sheeran and Wadge were infringing on Gaye and Townsend. In 2017, Griffin's attorneys filed a civil suit in New York, where Sony is headquartered, which charged that \"the melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic compositions of 'Thinking' are substantially and /or strikingly similar\" to \"Let's Get It On.\" As with \"Blurred Lines,\" the claim focussed not on obvious similarities in the songs' melodies or lyrics but on compositional elements associated with the rhythmic harmony-the groove.\n\nOn a Monday a few weeks ago, shortly after 11 A.M. , Judge Louis L. Stanton, who is ninety-five years old, took his place at the bench in a federal courtroom in downtown Manhattan. The plaintiff, now Kathryn Griffin Townsend, was seated next to her attorneys. She wore a dark-green dress, a long black coat, and an expression of sombre resolve. Her daughter Skye was also in attendance.\n\nIn music-copyright trials, similarities are assessed by two kinds of people: expert listeners and lay ones. The élite ears belong to forensic musicologists, who are often academics with advanced degrees. They hear music intellectually, in quantifiable component parts: tempo, amplitude, arrangement. The musicologists offer supposedly objective analyses of the \"musical fingerprints\" of songs, but they manage to arrive at opposite conclusions, depending on which side is employing them-generally for around five hundred dollars an hour. The lay listeners on the jury, who are a kind of proxy for pop music's audience, temper the experts' testimony with what their own ears tell them.\n\nIn federal court, this methodology is known as the Arnstein test. It derives from Arnstein v. Porter-a famous 1946 case that was heard during New York's heyday as a songwriting town-involving Cole Porter , the Broadway composer, and Ira B. Arnstein, a writer of Yiddish folk songs and light opera, who became convinced that many of the biggest hits of the era had been stolen from him. The songwriter accused Porter of copying the melodies in \"Night and Day\" and \"My Heart Belongs to Daddy,\" among other songs, from sheet music kept in a trunk in his shabby Upper West Side apartment, possibly aided by a duplicitous landlord. Arnstein ultimately lost the case, as he lost every case in his long career as a copyright troll. However, as Gary Rosen notes in his book \"Unfair to Genius,\" from 2012, \"It is within American jurisprudence and not popular music that the name Ira B. Arnstein reverberates.\" He adds, \"If only he could have collected a royalty on the case law that bears his name.\"\n\nFourteen prospective lay listeners were called into the Griffin v. Sheeran jury box, and Judge Stanton asked whether anything prevented them from rendering impartial judgment.\n\n\" 'Perfect' was my wedding song,\" a young woman said.\n\n\"My teen-age daughters love Ed Sheeran,\" another said. \"I don't know his music.\"\n\nBoth women were eventually rejected during voir dire, as was a young man who said that he was pursuing a doctorate in musicology at Columbia University. Even though he was probably the best-qualified potential juror to decide the case, he clearly wasn't a lay listener. The final seven-person jury included a lawyer, a special-ed teacher, a dramaturge, an amateur singer, a recent college graduate, and a guy who'd played trumpet in middle school.\n\nBecause \"Let's Get It On,\" or \"L.G.O.,\" as the legal documents refer to the song, was recorded before 1978, it is governed by the 1909 Copyright Act, which stipulated that, in order for a musical work to be registered for copyright, a written composition must be submitted to the U.S. Copyright Office, in Washington, as the \"deposit copy.\" (It wasn't until the 1976 Copyright Act, which went into effect on January 1, 1978, that sound recordings were admissible as deposit copies.)\n\nIn both the \"Blurred Lines\" and \"Stairway to Heaven\" cases, the jury was not permitted to listen to any pre-1978 recording. The jurors in Griffin v. Sheeran could listen to the recording of Sheeran's song, but they had to rely on the five pages of sheet music for \"Let's Get It On,\" a skeletal transcription that contained lyrics, melody, chords, and a notation of where the syncopated beats fall. Gaye's piano and the Funk Brothers' additions to the groove, such as the bass line, weren't on the deposit copy. Gaye, who didn't read music, probably never even saw the transcription. (Sheeran can't read music, either, a fact that he readily admitted on the stand.) The only versions of \"L.G.O.\" that the jury could listen to were the experts' MIDI audio files, which were made from the sheet music using musical software, and sung by a computer-generated voice. The tinny, wheedling sound of the synthesized music and the high-pitched android vocal made a classic soul song sound utterly soulless.\n\nAlmost all the major African American contributions to American music-ragtime, jazz, swing, hip-hop-were built on rhythmic innovations that weren't transcribed in sheet music and copyrighted. (The bent third and seventh blue notes that lie at the heart of the blues can't even be written in twelve-note chromatic-scale notation.) Ingrid Monson, the Quincy Jones Professor of African American Music at Harvard, who also served as an expert witness for the Gaye family in the \"Blurred Lines\" trial, told me, \"There could be no copyright system less suited to rewarding the creativity of African American music than the one we have. It was obviously modelled on classical music, and on the idea that a real piece of music, one that was worthy of copyright, would be written in notation.\"\n\nEven though the Copyright Office now allows recordings to be submitted in place of transcriptions, melody and lyrics remain the most important elements of a musical copyright involving a song's composition, partly because they can be seen by judges and juries on paper. The focus on protecting the topline seems out of step with the dominance in contemporary pop of the track-the harmonic and rhythmic bed for a song, usually made by a producer on a digital workstation-which frequently precedes melodies and lyrics. It's often the track that makes a song sound unique.\n\nKathryn Griffin Townsend isn't the first person to accuse Ed Sheeran of copying a song. In 2017, on the advice of counsel, Sheeran settled an infringement claim brought by the writers of \"Amazing,\" a song performed by Matt Cardle, an \"X Factor\" winner, who maintained Sheeran's 2014 hit \"Photograph\" infringed on their track. Infringement claims are often resolved this way. In 2015, Sam Smith settled amicably with Tom Petty over the similarity between the chorus hook in Smith's song \"Stay with Me\" and that in Petty's \"I Won't Back Down.\" In 2021, Olivia Rodrigo offered the band Paramore a writing credit and a share of the profits from her song \"Good 4 You,\" whose hook sounds a lot like the pre-chorus of Paramore's \"Misery Business.\"\n\nBut Sheeran came to feel that settling (reportedly for five million dollars) made him a target for copyright trolls. \"Shape of You,\" a 2017 Sheeran megahit, was the subject of multiple disputes. He amicably resolved one, with the songwriters of TLC's hit \"No Scrubs,\" for borrowing its melody. (While writing the song, he'd referred to it as \"the TLC song.\") He initiated and won another case, brought in the U.K., against Sami Chokri, a British songwriter and grime artist, who'd asserted that Sheeran's \"Shape of You\" had stolen the chorus from his 2015 song \"Oh Why.\" The magistrate who decided the case in Sheeran's favor ordered Chokri to pay more than nine hundred thousand pounds, to cover Sheeran's legal fees.\n\nIn a BBC Two \"Newsnight\" interview that aired in the U.K. after the victory, Sheeran and his co-writer John McDaid, of Snow Patrol, talked about the \"extraordinary strain\" of the lawsuit on their creativity and mental health. \"The best feeling in the world is the euphoria around the first idea of writing a great song,\" Sheeran said, perhaps recalling that night in the kitchen with Wadge. \"The first spark, where you go, 'This is special-we can't spoil this.' \" He went on, \"But that feeling has now turned into 'Oh, wait, let's stand back for a minute, have we touched anything?' You find yourself in the moment second-guessing yourself.\" As a precaution, Sheeran added, he films all his songwriting sessions, should a claim later arise.\n\n\"This is not about money,\" Sheeran said. \"It's about heart, honesty, and integrity. Win or lose, we had to go to court-we had to stand up for what we thought was right.\"\n\nSheeran decided to go to court rather than settle with Griffin for the same reason. He testified that his songwriter and artist friends were urging him to fight, saying, \" 'You have to win this for us.' \" These days, Sheeran observed, \"it's just something that happens. When you write songs and they're successful, someone comes after you.\" He also said that, if he lost this case, he was going to quit music. \"I'm finished,\" he declared. \"I'm done.\"\n\nSheeran arrived in court the day after jury selection. He wore a dark-navy suit with double vents in the back, and a blue necktie with small white polka dots, but he still managed to look scruffy, like a subway busker turned banker. He sat at the defense table, where, in the course of seven days, the spectators behind him-a mix of copyright attorneys, music journalists, and superfans-could study his distinctive copper-colored coif.\n\nTownsend sat just in front of Sheeran, at the plaintiff's table. Her coat, a gift from the musician George Clinton , had the word \" INTEGRITY \" emblazoned on the back, directly in Sheeran's line of sight. Townsend's legal team included the civil-rights lawyer Ben Crump, a personal friend, who represented George Floyd 's family after Floyd's murder, and worked with Keisha Rice on the Trayvon Martin wrongful-death case. This would be his first music-copyright trial.\n\nA few weeks earlier, Crump had held a press conference outside the courthouse. With Townsend standing next to him, he'd said, \"It is important that we understand that this is part of a larger issue. Far too many times in history, Black artists have created some of the most miraculous music in the world, only to see white artists come and usurp that music and reap untold fortunes while these Black artists and their families derive nothing from their genius.\"\n\nBut surely the Yorkshire-born Sheeran wasn't solely responsible for the shameful exploitation of Black artists within the U.S. music industry? As Jennifer Jenkins, a copyright-law professor at Duke, put it to me, \"Sheeran isn't Pat Boone covering songs by Little Richard, and he isn't Alan Freed taking credit for Chuck Berry's 'Maybellene' without writing a single note.\" Nevertheless, Crump called on Sheeran to \"do the right thing\" and settle with Griffin before the trial started. Otherwise, Crump thundered, \"let's get it on!\"\n\nIn his opening statement, Crump called for \"credit where credit is due,\" but he stopped short of accusing Sheeran of appropriating Black music. He characterized the video of Sheeran's Zurich concert as a \"smoking gun.\"\n\n\"Maya Angelou tells us that when a person shows you who they are, it's our duty to believe them,\" Crump declared. \"When someone provides you a voluntary confession, believe them.\"\n\nIlene Farkas, a copyright specialist at the powerhouse firm Pryor Cashman, who along with Donald Zakarin led Sheeran's legal team, delivered the defense's opening. She said that the only similarities between the two songs were a common chord progression and an equally common syncopated rhythm. The plaintiffs, she argued, \"cannot own these common musical elements.\"\n\nOn the stand, Townsend described her feelings about Sony's failure to respond to her inquiries. \"I feel they've been so negligent,\" she said, her voice thick with emotion. \"And I promised my father I would protect his work and artistry.\" She went on, \"I have nothing against Mr. Sheeran personally. I think he's a great artist with a great future. I am simply trying to protect my father's legacy.\"\n\nAfter lunch, the plaintiffs called Sheeran to the stand, where Rice questioned him. Sheeran testified to hearing \"L.G.O.\" for the first time in an Austin Powers movie, but denied copying it.\n\nRice asked Sheeran about his song \"Take It Back,\" which boasts about stealing rap lyrics:\n\nYou'll find me ripping the writtens\n\nOut of the pages they sit in\n\nAnd never once I get bitten\n\nBecause plagiarism is hidden\n\n\"Are those your lyrics?\" Rice asked.\n\n\"Can I just give context?\" Sheeran replied.\n\n\"If I need more context, I'll certainly ask,\" Rice said.\n\n\"I feel like you don't want me to answer because you know what I'm going to say is going to make a lot of sense,\" Sheeran said.\n\nFinally, the plaintiffs played the Zurich video, which they saw as their strongest single piece of evidence. (The admissibility of the video as evidence had been the subject of much legal maneuvering by the defense, who appeared keen not to see it played.) Sheeran watched from the witness box, his moon face expressionless. Afterward, he remarked, with some heat, \"Quite frankly, if I had done what you're accusing me of doing, I would be an idiot to stand on a stage in front of twenty thousand people and show that.\"\n\nSheeran is a master of the mashup. At shows, he often interpolates his songs and other people's songs, as a kind of musical party trick; he sometimes takes requests from the audience. Throughout his time on the stand, he entertained the jury and spectators by demonstrating this with an acoustic guitar that his team placed within reach of the witness box. At one point, he started singing \"Thinking Out Loud,\" transitioned into Shania Twain's \"You're Still the One,\" then into Bob Dylan's \"Just Like a Woman,\" and finished with Van Morrison's \"Crazy Love.\" Recordings of Sheeran's mashups were played: \"Take It Back\" with \"Superstition,\" by Stevie Wonder, and \"Ain't No Sunshine,\" by Bill Withers.\n\n\"You can kind of play most pop songs over most pop songs,\" Sheeran told the room. It was persuasive testimony, but it also helped explain why Sheeran's songs sound familiar-they're not so different from many other songs.\n\nIn the \"Blurred Lines\" trial, Judith Finell devoted much of her testimony to a PowerPoint presentation. Average listeners have a hard time comparing two songs aurally, she told me: \"The first song doesn't stay in their memory when the second song starts playing.\" But, she added, \"people do retain visual information.\" Her presentation used a time-stamped map of intervals in the two songs which showed \"significant similarities\" by way of color-coded charts. To critics, her presentation was all smoke and mirrors, designed to trick the jury into thinking that a collection of unprotectable elements was forensic proof that \"Blurred Lines\" was stained with Marvin Gaye's musical DNA.\n\nTownsend's expert, Alexander Stewart, had also prepared a slide show, and his presentation focussed on three areas of similarity between the songs. These were several melody fragments; the syncopated rhythm that anticipated the second and fourth chords; and the progression, which Stewart claimed was, in the Roman nomenclature of chords, a I-iii-IV-V progression. He testified that, of all the songs that came before \"L.G.O.,\" he could find only one-a version of \"Georgy Girl\" recorded by \"a rather obscure Mexican bandleader\" in 1966-that employed the same combination of chord progression and syncopation. He estimated that seventy per cent of the \"musical value\" of Sheeran's song was derived from Gaye and Townsend's.\n\nLawrence Ferrara, a professor of music at N.Y.U., was the forensic musicologist for the defense. He pointed out that the chord progression Ed Townsend had played for Gaye was so common that it was in elementary music-method books such as \"How to Play Rock 'n' Roll Piano,\" published in 1967. He claimed that six songs had the same progression and rhythm as \"L.G.O.,\" including Holland-Dozier-Holland's \"You Lost the Sweetest Boy\" (1963), sung by Mary Wells, and the Mexican recording of \"Georgy Girl.\" (In the Seekers' hit version, the expert noted, the guitar is anticipated, but the bass plays on the beat.) If Sheeran were found to have illegally copied \"Let's Get It On,\" then the rights holders of those earlier songs could claim that \"L.G.O.\" had infringed on them, resulting in a circular firing squad of lawsuits. Ferrara variously characterized parts of Stewart's testimony as \"farcical,\" \"absurd,\" and \"ludicrous.\"\n\nSheeran also commented on Stewart's presentation. \"I think what he's doing is criminal,\" he said. \"I don't know why he's allowed to be an expert.\" What annoyed Sheeran most was that Stewart heard an F-sharp minor chord at the beginning of \"Thinking Out Loud.\" This would make it identical to the I-iii-IV-V progression in \"L.G.O.,\" if Sheeran's song were transposed to E-flat. But, in fact, Sheeran said, Stewart was wrong: the chord was a D over F-sharp-a D-major first inversion, which Sheeran demonstrated by strumming both progressions.\n\n\"I know what I'm playing on guitar,\" he said. \"It's me playing it.\"\n\n\"And how do you know Dr. Stewart is wrong?\" Farkas asked.\n\n\"I wrote it, and I play it every week, a lot,\" Sheeran said.\n\nThe other third of Ed Townsend's third of the \"Let's Get It On\" royalties, which was once owned by his son Michael, now belongs to Structured Asset Sales, an L.A.-based company founded by the financier David Pullman. Pullman is a pioneer in packaging song catalogues as investment-grade securities, a common practice today. Essentially, an investor buys a share and reaps a portion of future earnings from royalties, licensing, and new technologies like streaming. Pullman created the first of these securities, Bowie Bonds, in collaboration with David Bowie , in 1997. He has worked on similar deals for catalogues belonging to the estates of James Brown, the Isley Brothers, and Holland-Dozier-Holland, among others.\n\nPullman filed a separate hundred-million-dollar suit against Sony in 2018. In another legal action, he is seeking to capitalize on an amicus brief filed by the Copyright Office in the \"Stairway to Heaven\" case, which noted that there could be \"multiple, distinct copyrightable works that are all versions of the same song.\" This opened up the possibility of refiling a sound recording with the Copyright Office as a new arrangement, which would be covered by the rules of the 1976 Copyright Act. After reading the brief, Pullman submitted the recording of \"L.G.O.\" and sued Sheeran again, based on substantial similarities that were not reflected in the original deposit copy. Sheeran might well spend the rest of his life defending his tender evocation of enduring love against an implacable opponent whose name, like Arnstein's, is embedded in New York case law. (To \"Pullmanize\" someone is to legally remove an unwanted owner from a co-op building, named for the process that Pullman's fellow-owners on West Sixty-seventh Street went through in state court in 2001.)\n\nPullman now lives in an art-filled villa high atop Hollywood, with an unbeatable view of the city from his trapezoidal pool. As a music investor, he favors evergreens. In his estimation, there are so many more infringement cases these days not because of frivolous lawsuits but because of bolder instances of theft. \"It used to be, you'd find a song that wasn't that big a hit,\" he said, in his rapid-fire speaking style. \"Now they'll take hits. You have a better chance of having a hit if you take a giant hit. Why? Because people already recognize it!\"\n\nIn Pullman's opinion, Sheeran is a serial infringer: \"Why does he write songs so quickly? Maybe it's because parts of them are already written.\" He mentioned the Zurich video: \"He seamlessly goes into 'Let's Get It On'-did you pick that song out of a hat? Out of sixty million registered songs, why do you pick that song? It's a tell.\" He recalled the well-known story of Paul McCartney going around and asking people if the melody of \"Yesterday,\" which had come to him in a dream, was in fact remembered from another song. Today, Pullman said, it's \"infringe now, worry about it later.\"\n\nPullman said that he would consider settling for a respectful sum: \"I don't understand why someone wants to go through so many trials. Every case against him will just get stronger.\"\n\nWhen I saw Kathryn Griffin Townsend in the courthouse cafeteria before closing arguments, she looked rested and happy. \"Win, lose, or draw, it doesn't matter, because we won,\" she told me. \"Now people know what happened. And they'll think before they do it again.\" She added, \"This has never been about money.\"\n\nIlene Farkas, who closed for the defense, noted that we were all here because, exactly fifty years ago, Ed Townsend sat down at his piano and played Marvin Gaye four chords. Townsend had been free to use them to make a song, just as Sheeran should be. \"Do we have to tell the eleven-year-old next Ed Sheeran that they better find out who owns that chord progression?\" she asked.\n\nBen Crump reminded the jurors that this Ed Sheeran had threatened to quit music if they decided against him: a heavy burden. Millions of Sheeran fans would despise them, and the promoters and stadium owners involved in Sheeran's forthcoming world tour for his new album, \"Subtract,\" would be on the hook for the cancelled shows. \"That's simply a threat to try to play on your emotions,\" Crump said. \"I promise you, no matter what your verdict is, he won't be done with music.\" The lawyer observed that Sheeran is, above all, a performer. \"Don't be charmed,\" he said. \"I'm sure if Ed Townsend was alive and in this court, he would have been just as charming.\"\n\nThe jury deliberated for less than three hours before handing its verdict to Judge Stanton: Sheeran and Wadge had independently created \"Thinking Out Loud\"; they had not infringed on \"Let's Get It On.\"\n\nSheeran, who had missed his paternal grandmother's funeral to testify, emotionally embraced Farkas and Zakarin. Wadge wept. The music executives looked pleased. The trial had given both songs streaming bumps.\n\nOutside, on Worth Street, the pop star read a statement. \"It looks like I'm not going to have to retire from my day job,\" Sheeran said. However, \"I am unbelievably frustrated that baseless claims like this are allowed to go to court at all.\" He hoped that now he and his fellow-songwriters could \"all just go back to making music.\" (Judge Stanton dismissed the first of Pullman's lawsuits a week later.) Then his artfully tousled head disappeared into a black S.U.V. and was gone.\n\nTownsend did not seem at all downhearted by the verdict. She had honored her promise to her father, she told me, which was \u0000\u0000\"to protect his intellectual property.\" She'd embraced Sheeran in the courtroom after the verdict, and they'd chatted briefly. \" 'All I ever wanted to do was talk to you about this,' \" she said she'd told him. \" 'I'm sorry it took all this to make that happen.' \"\n\nTownsend went on to say that Sheeran had offered her tickets to his upcoming concert at NRG Stadium, in Houston. She ended up declining the offer, opting to attend her grandson's pre-K graduation instead. At the show, \"Thinking Out Loud\" came midway through. \"Let's Get It On\" did not make the set list. ♦\n\nAn earlier version of this article misidentified the street where David Pullman lived in a co-op building.\n\nAudio: Robin Thicke, T.I., and Pharrell Williams, \"Blurred Lines\" (Star Trak); Johnny Cash, \"Folsom Prison Blues\" (Sun Label Group); The Chiffons \"He's So Fine\" (Capitol Records); Marvin Gaye, \"Let's Get It On\" (Motown Record Company); Cory Daye, \"Wiggle and Giggle All Night\" (Featherbed Music); Tom Petty, \"I Won't Back Down\" (MCA Records); George Harrison, \"My Sweet Lord\" (G.H.

Photo illustration by Mark Harris; Source photographs from Getty\n\nOne day in 1973, Edward Townsend, a singer-songwriter who'd had a minor hit with the 1958 ballad \"For Your Love,\" invited a friend, the R. & B. superstar Marvin Gaye, to his home in Los Angeles, to hear some new tunes. Sitting at the piano, Townsend played a four-chord progression in the key of E-flat major while singing a melody that harked back to his doo-wop days. Townsend, then forty-three, had recently been released from rehab, and the song was a plea to a higher power to help him stay sober. \"I've been really tryin' baby, tryin' to hold back this feeling for so long\" was one of the lines.\n\nGaye, who was suffering from writer's block after the huge success of \"What's Going On,\" for Motown Records, in 1971, heard his friend's song as a hymn to sex. Together, they created \"Let's Get It On.\"\n\nMotown's music-publishing company, Jobete, took fifty per cent of the song's copyright. Gaye and Townsend agreed to split their share of the composition's future earnings. Gaye recorded the song in L.A., in March, 1973, with members of the Funk Brothers, Motown's house band, who added the wah-wah guitar introduction and the song's undeniable groove, in which the second and fourth chords are anticipated-slightly in front of the beat. Gaye, in addition to his soaring vocal, played keyboard on the record. The song, Gaye's first No. 1, was one of the biggest hits of the year. It became a foundational track in the quiet storm of seventies R. & B. and soul, and has remained an evergreen-a steady earner.\n\n\"Let's Get It On\" launched a new phase in Gaye's career; four years later, his song \"Got to Give It Up\" also reached No. 1. Before his death, a filicide by Marvin Gaye, Sr., in 1984, Gaye had a final smash with \"Sexual Healing.\"\n\nTownsend's career peaked with \"Let's Get It On.\" He fell back into alcohol abuse, acquired a cocaine habit, and ended up living on the streets of Los Angeles. He eventually beat his addictions, and, near the end of his life, devoted himself to helping others on the street. He died in 2003, at the age of seventy-four.\n\nIn February, 2014, an English singer-songwriter named Amy Wadge visited the pop star Ed Sheeran at his home in Suffolk. Wadge was an old friend and a frequent collaborator. Sheeran's paternal grandfather had recently died, and his maternal grandmother was in a wheelchair, following cancer surgery. Sheeran and Wadge had a long talk that evening about enduring love.\n\nSheeran excused himself to shower before dinner with his parents, who live nearby, and Wadge picked up one of his acoustic guitars (a gift from Harry Styles) and began strumming a four-chord progression in D major. Sheeran heard it when he came out of the shower, and called out, \"We need to do something with that!\"\n\nAfter dinner, Wadge and Sheeran returned home and continued writing in Sheeran's kitchen. The first line, \"When your legs don't work like they used to,\" referred to his grandmother's condition. By midnight, \"Thinking Out Loud\" was finished. Sheeran recorded the song, in which the second and fourth chords are anticipated, just in time to include it on his second album, \"Multiply.\"\n\nAs a writer, Sheeran is known for his speed and facility. He can toss off four or five songs a day when he's recording an album. His EP \"No. 5 Collaborations Project\" led to a deal with Atlantic Records, a Warner Music label, when he was nineteen. He writes ballads as well as bangers; he also raps. He has collaborated with artists including Taylor Swift , Rita Ora, and Justin Bieber . His songs are popular partly because they are so accessible. It's as if you already know them.\n\nSheeran usually performs solo with a guitar-without costume changes, dancers, or pyrotechnics-backed only by looped tracks that he makes with a pedal as he plays. The two-year-long tour for his 2019 album, \"Divide,\" took in more than seven hundred and seventy-five million dollars, making it the second-highest-grossing tour of all time. Now, at thirty-two, he is one of the wealthiest people in the U.K.\n\n\"Thinking Out Loud,\" released in September, 2014, was one of the first songs to be streamed half a billion times on Spotify; it has since passed 2.2 billion streams. It won the 2015 Grammy for Song of the Year, and its success shot Sheeran into the thin air of the world's top hitmakers. The song also became a favorite at his concerts.\n\nIn a YouTube video of a Sheeran show in Zurich in November, 2014, the artist, playing an electric guitar, smoothly transitions from \"Thinking Out Loud\" to \"Let's Get It On\" and back to \"Thinking,\" without changing chords or the harmonic rhythm-the syncopated cadence at which chords are played. He smiles a bit mischievously. The crowd loves it.\n\nMost pop songs are made out of other pop songs. Many are constructed on three- or four-chord progressions, and have a near-identical blueprint-intro, verse, chorus, bridge, outro. Other than words and melody, not much in a composition is protected by copyright. As the Australian comedy trio Axis of Awesome demonstrates in a video that went viral, any number of pop songs can fit inside the same four chords. For this reason, the property lines of popular music are hard to draw. Inspiration, imitation, homage, and pastiche are all at play. Often, the trick is to sound new and old at the same time. But at what point do influence and interpolation become appropriation and plagiarism?\n\nIn 2019, the hitmaker Pharrell Williams spoke with the producer Rick Rubin, for a filmed conversation about creativity. Williams described his reaction to hearing a song that makes him feel something he hasn't felt before: \"I'm going to have to reverse engineer the feeling in order to get to the chord structure.\" He did just that with \" Blurred Lines ,\" his 2013 hit with Robin Thicke, for which he seemed to metabolize almost every aspect of Marvin Gaye's 1977 hit \"Got to Give It Up,\" including the crowd noises and the cowbell.\n\nBut, according to a jury in Los Angeles, Williams went too far. In 2015, it found that the composers of \"Blurred Lines\" had illegally copied Gaye's song. The songwriters were ultimately forced to pay the Gaye family $5.3 million, and to share half the song's future publishing royalties. The verdict was a victory for the copyright attorney Richard Busch. Afterward, more than two hundred producers and other people in the music business signed an amicus brief predicting that, if the verdict was upheld, they would be forced to work \"always with one foot in the recording studio and one foot in the courtroom.\" It was upheld anyway, in a 2-1 vote, in 2018. The dissenting judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Jacqueline Nguyen, described the ruling as \"a devastating blow to future musicians and composers everywhere,\" because it allowed \"the Gayes to accomplish what no one has before: copyright a musical style.\"\n\nMany people correctly predicted that the \"Blurred Lines\" ruling would trigger a wave of frivolous infringement cases. \"I can't tell you how many calls we get after the Grammys,\" Judith Finell, who was the Gaye family's expert musicologist in the \"Blurred Lines\" case, told me. \"Mostly from lawyers wanting to see if their client's claim of infringement is winnable.\"\n\nTaylor Swift, the Weeknd, and Justin Bieber are only a few of the artists who have been subject to recent allegations of infringement. The composers of Dua Lipa's 2020 hit \"Levitating\" are being sued on both coasts: In Los Angeles, the reggae band Artikal Sound System is claiming that the song copied its 2017 track \"Live Your Life.\" In the Southern District of New York, L. Russell Brown and Sandy Linzer believe that \"Levitating\" infringes on two songs they wrote, \"Wiggle and Giggle All Night,\" from 1979, and \"Don Diablo,\" from the following year.\n\nTwo influential decisions in California's Ninth Circuit in the past few years have repaired some of the \"Blurred Lines\" damage. In 2020, the appeals court confirmed a jury's verdict that Led Zeppelin's \"Stairway to Heaven\" did not infringe on \"Taurus,\" by the late-sixties rock band Spirit, because the descending A-minor figure in \"Taurus\" consisted of \"common musical elements\" that can't be copyrighted. In 2020, a district judge in Los Angeles overturned a verdict that found Katy Perry's \"Dark Horse\" had infringed on eight notes from \"Joyful Noise,\" an obscure song by the Christian artist Flame. The judge's decision was upheld on appeal.\n\nThis spring, a high-stakes copyright trial took place in New York City. The issue in Griffin v. Sheeran was whether Sheeran and Wadge had illegally copied from \"Let's Get It On\" in creating \"Thinking Out Loud.\" The larger issues were how much songwriters like Sheeran should be allowed to borrow from earlier works, and the opaque and antiquated process by which the law determines what part of a pop song the composer actually owns.\n\nMusic copyright, which became law in the United States in 1831, allows composers to establish the \"metes and bounds\" of their intellectual property, just as mechanical inventors do in obtaining patents. But a patent is granted only after examiners have determined, by way of an investigation, that an invention is truly new and useful. A music copyright is more like a virtual rubber stamp that a musician gets automatically as soon as a song is \"fixed in a tangible medium of expression.\" If the song is a hit and the musician is sued-because \"where there's a hit, there's a writ,\" as an old adage goes-it is up to the courts to figure out how original the work is.\n\nCopyright makes it commercially viable to be an artist. But painters can't claim ownership of a color, and songwriters can't monopolize notes or, for that matter, common chord progressions, modes, or rhythms. A composer is entitled to own only a particular expression or arrangement of a musical idea, not the idea itself. (The concept of an arpeggio, or of counterpoint, cannot be copyrighted.) The question is how to legally separate the two. The law, which represents the Apollonian side of human experience-the rational, analytical, and intellectual-is a leaky sieve for containing the Dionysian elements of music: the irrational, abstract, and emotional parts.\n\n\"Songwriters almost never steal melodies from one another on purpose,\" Joe Bennett, a professor of forensic musicology at Berklee College of Music, told me. \"In almost every case, the copying is inadvertent.\" Still, outright theft does happen-compare Johnny Cash's \"Folsom Prison Blues,\" from 1955, to Gordon Jenkins's 1953 song \"Crescent City Blues.\" Cash ultimately paid Jenkins seventy-five thousand dollars (which now amounts to some six hundred and sixty thousand) for lifting his melody and some of his lyrics.\n\nBennett explained that songwriters can be found liable for infringement of copyright even if the infringement was \"subconsciously accomplished.\" The phrase comes from the judge in a 1976 case, which found that George Harrison had unknowingly but unlawfully copied the Chiffons' 1963 song \"He's So Fine\" in his 1970 hit \"My Sweet Lord.\" The two melodies are virtually identical.\n\n\"Also known as 'cryptomnesia,' \" Bennett added. He defined the term as \"a forgotten memory that is mistaken for an original idea.\" Pop music is bursting with cryptomnesiacs.\n\nBefore the Internet, lack of access was the standard defense against a claim of subconscious copying: the composer couldn't possibly have heard the accuser's obscure song. At music publishers' offices, assistants were instructed to return unsolicited recordings unopened, so that the sender couldn't argue later that his work had been filched. But platforms like SoundCloud, Spotify, and TikTok have severely curtailed that defense. Finell, the musicologist, told me, \"Some kid will come to me and say, 'I just heard the latest Beyoncé song, and she stole my drum track!' I say, 'How did Beyoncé get to hear a drum track that you composed in your garage?' 'Well, I put it out on social media, and I have a hundred thousand followers. One of them could work with Jay-Z!' \"\n\nCan a style or a vibe ever be infringed on, if not all that much in pop is really new? True, some homages to past styles are more brazen than others: Bruno Mars and Mark Ronson took eighties funk grooves from the Gap Band's \"Oops Upside Your Head\" and made them part of the Grammy-winning song \"Uptown Funk\" without asking for permission. After the \"Blurred Lines\" verdict, a number of songwriters were added to the song's credits.\n\nThe music industry was recently shaken by \"Heart on My Sleeve,\" a song featuring a duet between a fake Drake and a fake the Weeknd, in which both vocals were created, using generative A.I., by an anonymous user called Ghostface. Artists and rights holders are concerned that their creations will be used to train A.I. generators that will eventually replace them. Faced with that possibility, rights holders are likely to seek more protection for style, even though doing so could make it harder for artists to do their work without infringing.\n\nEd Townsend had two sons, Clef Michael and David, born to his wife, Cherrigale, and a daughter, also named Cherrigale, born in Los Angeles in 1960 to a singer, who gave the child up for adoption at birth. The adoptive family, the Griffins, changed the baby's name to Kathryn. When Kathryn was a child, her adoptive mother would point at a hysterectomy scar on her stomach and say, \"This is where you came from.\"\n\nKathryn showed an aptitude for music, which made her parents nervous. \"My whole life, I wanted to play piano, flute, piccolo,\" she told me. The family moved from L.A. to Hattiesburg, Mississippi: \"They didn't want me in the music industry, because they were afraid I'd find out who my father was and fall into the life he did.\"\n\nGriffin fell anyway. She became addicted to crack cocaine and got into sex work to support her habit. She was trafficked, she told me, and after escaping her abusers she lived for a time in a \"cardboard condominium\" under a bridge. She speaks in a hoarse Southern drawl; in spite of her past, she laughs a lot.\n\nIn 1986, when Griffin was twenty-six, her grandfather, a Christian minister, told her that she was adopted. Her mother then confessed that her biological father was a famous musician. Griffin called an acquaintance, Hubert Laws, the jazz musician. \"Have you ever heard of a man named Ed Townsend?\" she asked. Laws replied, \"Everybody knows who Ed Townsend is!\" Griffin said, \"Well, I don't!\"\n\nShe recalled reaching Townsend by phone for the first time: \"I said, 'This is your daughter.' He said, 'I have looked for you your entire life.' \" But he had been searching for a Cherrigale, not a Kathryn.\n\nTownsend left Griffin a third of his \"Let's Get It On\" royalties. (In the nineteen-eighties, he had sold part of his share of the song's publishing copyright to Jobete.) She promised to protect his legacy. Griffin got sober in 2003, the year Townsend died. She began counselling women in prison in Houston who had been sex workers; she is now an expert in human-trafficking victims' rights. Griffin estimates that she has rescued more than a thousand women from \"the life.\" When her half brother David died, in 2005, he left Griffin his share of his father's royalties, as did her aunt Helen McDonald, in 2020.\n\nEarly in 2015, friends of Griffin alerted her to the similarities between \"Let's Get It On\" and a new song called \"Thinking Out Loud.\" \"They said, 'This British guy, he just changed the words and kept all the music!' \" she told me. Griffin listened to both: \"And I went, 'Oh, my God. Wow.' \"\n\nGriffin tried to notify Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the behemoth that had recently acquired the Jobete catalogue. But no one at Sony returned her calls. \"Let's Get It On\" was in the American Songbook. Shouldn't Sony want to protect its I.P. from infringement? Then Griffin figured it out: Sony was probably conflicted because it was also the publisher of \"Thinking Out Loud,\" along with much of the rest of Sheeran's catalogue.\n\nSony eventually asked two musicologists to investigate the claim. Both advised the company that there was no infringement, as did a third musicologist, whom Sheeran had hired in the U.K. Still, it seemed to Griffin that no one at Sony was looking after her interests or her father's legacy. (Sony says that it often finds itself on both sides of infringement suits, and that it remains neutral in these cases.)\n\nGriffin found lawyers, Pat Frank and Keisha Rice, in Tallahassee, Florida. They contacted Alexander Stewart, a professor of music at the University of Vermont. Stewart heard enough similarities between the two songs to write a report saying that Sheeran and Wadge were infringing on Gaye and Townsend. In 2017, Griffin's attorneys filed a civil suit in New York, where Sony is headquartered, which charged that \"the melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic compositions of 'Thinking' are substantially and /or strikingly similar\" to \"Let's Get It On.\" As with \"Blurred Lines,\" the claim focussed not on obvious similarities in the songs' melodies or lyrics but on compositional elements associated with the rhythmic harmony-the groove.\n\nOn a Monday a few weeks ago, shortly after 11 A.M. , Judge Louis L. Stanton, who is ninety-five years old, took his place at the bench in a federal courtroom in downtown Manhattan. The plaintiff, now Kathryn Griffin Townsend, was seated next to her attorneys. She wore a dark-green dress, a long black coat, and an expression of sombre resolve. Her daughter Skye was also in attendance.\n\nIn music-copyright trials, similarities are assessed by two kinds of people: expert listeners and lay ones. The élite ears belong to forensic musicologists, who are often academics with advanced degrees. They hear music intellectually, in quantifiable component parts: tempo, amplitude, arrangement. The musicologists offer supposedly objective analyses of the \"musical fingerprints\" of songs, but they manage to arrive at opposite conclusions, depending on which side is employing them-generally for around five hundred dollars an hour. The lay listeners on the jury, who are a kind of proxy for pop music's audience, temper the experts' testimony with what their own ears tell them.\n\nIn federal court, this methodology is known as the Arnstein test. It derives from Arnstein v. Porter-a famous 1946 case that was heard during New York's heyday as a songwriting town-involving Cole Porter , the Broadway composer, and Ira B. Arnstein, a writer of Yiddish folk songs and light opera, who became convinced that many of the biggest hits of the era had been stolen from him. The songwriter accused Porter of copying the melodies in \"Night and Day\" and \"My Heart Belongs to Daddy,\" among other songs, from sheet music kept in a trunk in his shabby Upper West Side apartment, possibly aided by a duplicitous landlord. Arnstein ultimately lost the case, as he lost every case in his long career as a copyright troll. However, as Gary Rosen notes in his book \"Unfair to Genius,\" from 2012, \"It is within American jurisprudence and not popular music that the name Ira B. Arnstein reverberates.\" He adds, \"If only he could have collected a royalty on the case law that bears his name.\"\n\nFourteen prospective lay listeners were called into the Griffin v. Sheeran jury box, and Judge Stanton asked whether anything prevented them from rendering impartial judgment.\n\n\" 'Perfect' was my wedding song,\" a young woman said.\n\n\"My teen-age daughters love Ed Sheeran,\" another said. \"I don't know his music.\"\n\nBoth women were eventually rejected during voir dire, as was a young man who said that he was pursuing a doctorate in musicology at Columbia University. Even though he was probably the best-qualified potential juror to decide the case, he clearly wasn't a lay listener. The final seven-person jury included a lawyer, a special-ed teacher, a dramaturge, an amateur singer, a recent college graduate, and a guy who'd played trumpet in middle school.\n\nBecause \"Let's Get It On,\" or \"L.G.O.,\" as the legal documents refer to the song, was recorded before 1978, it is governed by the 1909 Copyright Act, which stipulated that, in order for a musical work to be registered for copyright, a written composition must be submitted to the U.S. Copyright Office, in Washington, as the \"deposit copy.\" (It wasn't until the 1976 Copyright Act, which went into effect on January 1, 1978, that sound recordings were admissible as deposit copies.)\n\nIn both the \"Blurred Lines\" and \"Stairway to Heaven\" cases, the jury was not permitted to listen to any pre-1978 recording. The jurors in Griffin v. Sheeran could listen to the recording of Sheeran's song, but they had to rely on the five pages of sheet music for \"Let's Get It On,\" a skeletal transcription that contained lyrics, melody, chords, and a notation of where the syncopated beats fall. Gaye's piano and the Funk Brothers' additions to the groove, such as the bass line, weren't on the deposit copy. Gaye, who didn't read music, probably never even saw the transcription. (Sheeran can't read music, either, a fact that he readily admitted on the stand.) The only versions of \"L.G.O.\" that the jury could listen to were the experts' MIDI audio files, which were made from the sheet music using musical software, and sung by a computer-generated voice. The tinny, wheedling sound of the synthesized music and the high-pitched android vocal made a classic soul song sound utterly soulless.\n\nAlmost all the major African American contributions to American music-ragtime, jazz, swing, hip-hop-were built on rhythmic innovations that weren't transcribed in sheet music and copyrighted. (The bent third and seventh blue notes that lie at the heart of the blues can't even be written in twelve-note chromatic-scale notation.) Ingrid Monson, the Quincy Jones Professor of African American Music at Harvard, who also served as an expert witness for the Gaye family in the \"Blurred Lines\" trial, told me, \"There could be no copyright system less suited to rewarding the creativity of African American music than the one we have. It was obviously modelled on classical music, and on the idea that a real piece of music, one that was worthy of copyright, would be written in notation.\"\n\nEven though the Copyright Office now allows recordings to be submitted in place of transcriptions, melody and lyrics remain the most important elements of a musical copyright involving a song's composition, partly because they can be seen by judges and juries on paper. The focus on protecting the topline seems out of step with the dominance in contemporary pop of the track-the harmonic and rhythmic bed for a song, usually made by a producer on a digital workstation-which frequently precedes melodies and lyrics. It's often the track that makes a song sound unique.\n\nKathryn Griffin Townsend isn't the first person to accuse Ed Sheeran of copying a song. In 2017, on the advice of counsel, Sheeran settled an infringement claim brought by the writers of \"Amazing,\" a song performed by Matt Cardle, an \"X Factor\" winner, who maintained Sheeran's 2014 hit \"Photograph\" infringed on their track. Infringement claims are often resolved this way. In 2015, Sam Smith settled amicably with Tom Petty over the similarity between the chorus hook in Smith's song \"Stay with Me\" and that in Petty's \"I Won't Back Down.\" In 2021, Olivia Rodrigo offered the band Paramore a writing credit and a share of the profits from her song \"Good 4 You,\" whose hook sounds a lot like the pre-chorus of Paramore's \"Misery Business.\"\n\nBut Sheeran came to feel that settling (reportedly for five million dollars) made him a target for copyright trolls. \"Shape of You,\" a 2017 Sheeran megahit, was the subject of multiple disputes. He amicably resolved one, with the songwriters of TLC's hit \"No Scrubs,\" for borrowing its melody. (While writing the song, he'd referred to it as \"the TLC song.\") He initiated and won another case, brought in the U.K., against Sami Chokri, a British songwriter and grime artist, who'd asserted that Sheeran's \"Shape of You\" had stolen the chorus from his 2015 song \"Oh Why.\" The magistrate who decided the case in Sheeran's favor ordered Chokri to pay more than nine hundred thousand pounds, to cover Sheeran's legal fees.\n\nIn a BBC Two \"Newsnight\" interview that aired in the U.K. after the victory, Sheeran and his co-writer John McDaid, of Snow Patrol, talked about the \"extraordinary strain\" of the lawsuit on their creativity and mental health. \"The best feeling in the world is the euphoria around the first idea of writing a great song,\" Sheeran said, perhaps recalling that night in the kitchen with Wadge. \"The first spark, where you go, 'This is special-we can't spoil this.' \" He went on, \"But that feeling has now turned into 'Oh, wait, let's stand back for a minute, have we touched anything?' You find yourself in the moment second-guessing yourself.\" As a precaution, Sheeran added, he films all his songwriting sessions, should a claim later arise.\n\n\"This is not about money,\" Sheeran said. \"It's about heart, honesty, and integrity. Win or lose, we had to go to court-we had to stand up for what we thought was right.\"\n\nSheeran decided to go to court rather than settle with Griffin for the same reason. He testified that his songwriter and artist friends were urging him to fight, saying, \" 'You have to win this for us.' \" These days, Sheeran observed, \"it's just something that happens. When you write songs and they're successful, someone comes after you.\" He also said that, if he lost this case, he was going to quit music. \"I'm finished,\" he declared. \"I'm done.\"\n\nSheeran arrived in court the day after jury selection. He wore a dark-navy suit with double vents in the back, and a blue necktie with small white polka dots, but he still managed to look scruffy, like a subway busker turned banker. He sat at the defense table, where, in the course of seven days, the spectators behind him-a mix of copyright attorneys, music journalists, and superfans-could study his distinctive copper-colored coif.\n\nTownsend sat just in front of Sheeran, at the plaintiff's table. Her coat, a gift from the musician George Clinton , had the word \" INTEGRITY \" emblazoned on the back, directly in Sheeran's line of sight. Townsend's legal team included the civil-rights lawyer Ben Crump, a personal friend, who represented George Floyd 's family after Floyd's murder, and worked with Keisha Rice on the Trayvon Martin wrongful-death case. This would be his first music-copyright trial.\n\nA few weeks earlier, Crump had held a press conference outside the courthouse. With Townsend standing next to him, he'd said, \"It is important that we understand that this is part of a larger issue. Far too many times in history, Black artists have created some of the most miraculous music in the world, only to see white artists come and usurp that music and reap untold fortunes while these Black artists and their families derive nothing from their genius.\"\n\nBut surely the Yorkshire-born Sheeran wasn't solely responsible for the shameful exploitation of Black artists within the U.S. music industry? As Jennifer Jenkins, a copyright-law professor at Duke, put it to me, \"Sheeran isn't Pat Boone covering songs by Little Richard, and he isn't Alan Freed taking credit for Chuck Berry's 'Maybellene' without writing a single note.\" Nevertheless, Crump called on Sheeran to \"do the right thing\" and settle with Griffin before the trial started. Otherwise, Crump thundered, \"let's get it on!\"\n\nIn his opening statement, Crump called for \"credit where credit is due,\" but he stopped short of accusing Sheeran of appropriating Black music. He characterized the video of Sheeran's Zurich concert as a \"smoking gun.\"\n\n\"Maya Angelou tells us that when a person shows you who they are, it's our duty to believe them,\" Crump declared. \"When someone provides you a voluntary confession, believe them.\"\n\nIlene Farkas, a copyright specialist at the powerhouse firm Pryor Cashman, who along with Donald Zakarin led Sheeran's legal team, delivered the defense's opening. She said that the only similarities between the two songs were a common chord progression and an equally common syncopated rhythm. The plaintiffs, she argued, \"cannot own these common musical elements.\"\n\nOn the stand, Townsend described her feelings about Sony's failure to respond to her inquiries. \"I feel they've been so negligent,\" she said, her voice thick with emotion. \"And I promised my father I would protect his work and artistry.\" She went on, \"I have nothing against Mr. Sheeran personally. I think he's a great artist with a great future. I am simply trying to protect my father's legacy.\"\n\nAfter lunch, the plaintiffs called Sheeran to the stand, where Rice questioned him. Sheeran testified to hearing \"L.G.O.\" for the first time in an Austin Powers movie, but denied copying it.\n\nRice asked Sheeran about his song \"Take It Back,\" which boasts about stealing rap lyrics:\n\nYou'll find me ripping the writtens\n\nOut of the pages they sit in\n\nAnd never once I get bitten\n\nBecause plagiarism is hidden\n\n\"Are those your lyrics?\" Rice asked.\n\n\"Can I just give context?\" Sheeran replied.\n\n\"If I need more context, I'll certainly ask,\" Rice said.\n\n\"I feel like you don't want me to answer because you know what I'm going to say is going to make a lot of sense,\" Sheeran said.\n\nFinally, the plaintiffs played the Zurich video, which they saw as their strongest single piece of evidence. (The admissibility of the video as evidence had been the subject of much legal maneuvering by the defense, who appeared keen not to see it played.) Sheeran watched from the witness box, his moon face expressionless. Afterward, he remarked, with some heat, \"Quite frankly, if I had done what you're accusing me of doing, I would be an idiot to stand on a stage in front of twenty thousand people and show that.\"\n\nSheeran is a master of the mashup. At shows, he often interpolates his songs and other people's songs, as a kind of musical party trick; he sometimes takes requests from the audience. Throughout his time on the stand, he entertained the jury and spectators by demonstrating this with an acoustic guitar that his team placed within reach of the witness box. At one point, he started singing \"Thinking Out Loud,\" transitioned into Shania Twain's \"You're Still the One,\" then into Bob Dylan's \"Just Like a Woman,\" and finished with Van Morrison's \"Crazy Love.\" Recordings of Sheeran's mashups were played: \"Take It Back\" with \"Superstition,\" by Stevie Wonder, and \"Ain't No Sunshine,\" by Bill Withers.\n\n\"You can kind of play most pop songs over most pop songs,\" Sheeran told the room. It was persuasive testimony, but it also helped explain why Sheeran's songs sound familiar-they're not so different from many other songs.\n\nIn the \"Blurred Lines\" trial, Judith Finell devoted much of her testimony to a PowerPoint presentation. Average listeners have a hard time comparing two songs aurally, she told me: \"The first song doesn't stay in their memory when the second song starts playing.\" But, she added, \"people do retain visual information.\" Her presentation used a time-stamped map of intervals in the two songs which showed \"significant similarities\" by way of color-coded charts. To critics, her presentation was all smoke and mirrors, designed to trick the jury into thinking that a collection of unprotectable elements was forensic proof that \"Blurred Lines\" was stained with Marvin Gaye's musical DNA.\n\nTownsend's expert, Alexander Stewart, had also prepared a slide show, and his presentation focussed on three areas of similarity between the songs. These were several melody fragments; the syncopated rhythm that anticipated the second and fourth chords; and the progression, which Stewart claimed was, in the Roman nomenclature of chords, a I-iii-IV-V progression. He testified that, of all the songs that came before \"L.G.O.,\" he could find only one-a version of \"Georgy Girl\" recorded by \"a rather obscure Mexican bandleader\" in 1966-that employed the same combination of chord progression and syncopation. He estimated that seventy per cent of the \"musical value\" of Sheeran's song was derived from Gaye and Townsend's.\n\nLawrence Ferrara, a professor of music at N.Y.U., was the forensic musicologist for the defense. He pointed out that the chord progression Ed Townsend had played for Gaye was so common that it was in elementary music-method books such as \"How to Play Rock 'n' Roll Piano,\" published in 1967. He claimed that six songs had the same progression and rhythm as \"L.G.O.,\" including Holland-Dozier-Holland's \"You Lost the Sweetest Boy\" (1963), sung by Mary Wells, and the Mexican recording of \"Georgy Girl.\" (In the Seekers' hit version, the expert noted, the guitar is anticipated, but the bass plays on the beat.) If Sheeran were found to have illegally copied \"Let's Get It On,\" then the rights holders of those earlier songs could claim that \"L.G.O.\" had infringed on them, resulting in a circular firing squad of lawsuits. Ferrara variously characterized parts of Stewart's testimony as \"farcical,\" \"absurd,\" and \"ludicrous.\"\n\nSheeran also commented on Stewart's presentation. \"I think what he's doing is criminal,\" he said. \"I don't know why he's allowed to be an expert.\" What annoyed Sheeran most was that Stewart heard an F-sharp minor chord at the beginning of \"Thinking Out Loud.\" This would make it identical to the I-iii-IV-V progression in \"L.G.O.,\" if Sheeran's song were transposed to E-flat. But, in fact, Sheeran said, Stewart was wrong: the chord was a D over F-sharp-a D-major first inversion, which Sheeran demonstrated by strumming both progressions.\n\n\"I know what I'm playing on guitar,\" he said. \"It's me playing it.\"\n\n\"And how do you know Dr. Stewart is wrong?\" Farkas asked.\n\n\"I wrote it, and I play it every week, a lot,\" Sheeran said.\n\nThe other third of Ed Townsend's third of the \"Let's Get It On\" royalties, which was once owned by his son Michael, now belongs to Structured Asset Sales, an L.A.-based company founded by the financier David Pullman. Pullman is a pioneer in packaging song catalogues as investment-grade securities, a common practice today. Essentially, an investor buys a share and reaps a portion of future earnings from royalties, licensing, and new technologies like streaming. Pullman created the first of these securities, Bowie Bonds, in collaboration with David Bowie , in 1997. He has worked on similar deals for catalogues belonging to the estates of James Brown, the Isley Brothers, and Holland-Dozier-Holland, among others.\n\nPullman filed a separate hundred-million-dollar suit against Sony in 2018. In another legal action, he is seeking to capitalize on an amicus brief filed by the Copyright Office in the \"Stairway to Heaven\" case, which noted that there could be \"multiple, distinct copyrightable works that are all versions of the same song.\" This opened up the possibility of refiling a sound recording with the Copyright Office as a new arrangement, which would be covered by the rules of the 1976 Copyright Act. After reading the brief, Pullman submitted the recording of \"L.G.O.\" and sued Sheeran again, based on substantial similarities that were not reflected in the original deposit copy. Sheeran might well spend the rest of his life defending his tender evocation of enduring love against an implacable opponent whose name, like Arnstein's, is embedded in New York case law. (To \"Pullmanize\" someone is to legally remove an unwanted owner from a co-op building, named for the process that Pullman's fellow-owners on West Sixty-seventh Street went through in state court in 2001.)\n\nPullman now lives in an art-filled villa high atop Hollywood, with an unbeatable view of the city from his trapezoidal pool. As a music investor, he favors evergreens. In his estimation, there are so many more infringement cases these days not because of frivolous lawsuits but because of bolder instances of theft. \"It used to be, you'd find a song that wasn't that big a hit,\" he said, in his rapid-fire speaking style. \"Now they'll take hits. You have a better chance of having a hit if you take a giant hit. Why? Because people already recognize it!\"\n\nIn Pullman's opinion, Sheeran is a serial infringer: \"Why does he write songs so quickly? Maybe it's because parts of them are already written.\" He mentioned the Zurich video: \"He seamlessly goes into 'Let's Get It On'-did you pick that song out of a hat? Out of sixty million registered songs, why do you pick that song? It's a tell.\" He recalled the well-known story of Paul McCartney going around and asking people if the melody of \"Yesterday,\" which had come to him in a dream, was in fact remembered from another song. Today, Pullman said, it's \"infringe now, worry about it later.\"\n\nPullman said that he would consider settling for a respectful sum: \"I don't understand why someone wants to go through so many trials. Every case against him will just get stronger.\"\n\nWhen I saw Kathryn Griffin Townsend in the courthouse cafeteria before closing arguments, she looked rested and happy. \"Win, lose, or draw, it doesn't matter, because we won,\" she told me. \"Now people know what happened. And they'll think before they do it again.\" She added, \"This has never been about money.\"\n\nIlene Farkas, who closed for the defense, noted that we were all here because, exactly fifty years ago, Ed Townsend sat down at his piano and played Marvin Gaye four chords. Townsend had been free to use them to make a song, just as Sheeran should be. \"Do we have to tell the eleven-year-old next Ed Sheeran that they better find out who owns that chord progression?\" she asked.\n\nBen Crump reminded the jurors that this Ed Sheeran had threatened to quit music if they decided against him: a heavy burden. Millions of Sheeran fans would despise them, and the promoters and stadium owners involved in Sheeran's forthcoming world tour for his new album, \"Subtract,\" would be on the hook for the cancelled shows. \"That's simply a threat to try to play on your emotions,\" Crump said. \"I promise you, no matter what your verdict is, he won't be done with music.\" The lawyer observed that Sheeran is, above all, a performer. \"Don't be charmed,\" he said. \"I'm sure if Ed Townsend was alive and in this court, he would have been just as charming.\"\n\nThe jury deliberated for less than three hours before handing its verdict to Judge Stanton: Sheeran and Wadge had independently created \"Thinking Out Loud\"; they had not infringed on \"Let's Get It On.\"\n\nSheeran, who had missed his paternal grandmother's funeral to testify, emotionally embraced Farkas and Zakarin. Wadge wept. The music executives looked pleased. The trial had given both songs streaming bumps.\n\nOutside, on Worth Street, the pop star read a statement. \"It looks like I'm not going to have to retire from my day job,\" Sheeran said. However, \"I am unbelievably frustrated that baseless claims like this are allowed to go to court at all.\" He hoped that now he and his fellow-songwriters could \"all just go back to making music.\" (Judge Stanton dismissed the first of Pullman's lawsuits a week later.) Then his artfully tousled head disappeared into a black S.U.V. and was gone.\n\nTownsend did not seem at all downhearted by the verdict. She had honored her promise to her father, she told me, which was \u0000\u0000\"to protect his intellectual property.\" She'd embraced Sheeran in the courtroom after the verdict, and they'd chatted briefly. \" 'All I ever wanted to do was talk to you about this,' \" she said she'd told him. \" 'I'm sorry it took all this to make that happen.' \"\n\nTownsend went on to say that Sheeran had offered her tickets to his upcoming concert at NRG Stadium, in Houston. She ended up declining the offer, opting to attend her grandson's pre-K graduation instead. At the show, \"Thinking Out Loud\" came midway through. \"Let's Get It On\" did not make the set list. ♦\n\nAn earlier version of this article misidentified the street where David Pullman lived in a co-op building.\n\nAudio: Robin Thicke, T.I., and Pharrell Williams, \"Blurred Lines\" (Star Trak); Johnny Cash, \"Folsom Prison Blues\" (Sun Label Group); The Chiffons \"He's So Fine\" (Capitol Records); Marvin Gaye, \"Let's Get It On\" (Motown Record Company); Cory Daye, \"Wiggle and Giggle All Night\" (Featherbed Music); Tom Petty, \"I Won't Back Down\" (MCA Records); George Harrison, \"My Sweet Lord\" (G.H.

Photo illustration by Mark Harris; Source photographs from Getty\n\nOne day in 1973, Edward Townsend, a singer-songwriter who'd had a minor hit with the 1958 ballad \"For Your Love,\" invited a friend, the R. & B. superstar Marvin Gaye, to his home in Los Angeles, to hear some new tunes. Sitting at the piano, Townsend played a four-chord progression in the key of E-flat major while singing a melody that harked back to his doo-wop days. Townsend, then forty-three, had recently been released from rehab, and the song was a plea to a higher power to help him stay sober. \"I've been really tryin' baby, tryin' to hold back this feeling for so long\" was one of the lines.\n\nGaye, who was suffering from writer's block after the huge success of \"What's Going On,\" for Motown Records, in 1971, heard his friend's song as a hymn to sex. Together, they created \"Let's Get It On.\"\n\nMotown's music-publishing company, Jobete, took fifty per cent of the song's copyright. Gaye and Townsend agreed to split their share of the composition's future earnings. Gaye recorded the song in L.A., in March, 1973, with members of the Funk Brothers, Motown's house band, who added the wah-wah guitar introduction and the song's undeniable groove, in which the second and fourth chords are anticipated-slightly in front of the beat. Gaye, in addition to his soaring vocal, played keyboard on the record. The song, Gaye's first No. 1, was one of the biggest hits of the year. It became a foundational track in the quiet storm of seventies R. & B. and soul, and has remained an evergreen-a steady earner.\n\n\"Let's Get It On\" launched a new phase in Gaye's career; four years later, his song \"Got to Give It Up\" also reached No. 1. Before his death, a filicide by Marvin Gaye, Sr., in 1984, Gaye had a final smash with \"Sexual Healing.\"\n\nTownsend's career peaked with \"Let's Get It On.\" He fell back into alcohol abuse, acquired a cocaine habit, and ended up living on the streets of Los Angeles. He eventually beat his addictions, and, near the end of his life, devoted himself to helping others on the street. He died in 2003, at the age of seventy-four.\n\nIn February, 2014, an English singer-songwriter named Amy Wadge visited the pop star Ed Sheeran at his home in Suffolk. Wadge was an old friend and a frequent collaborator. Sheeran's paternal grandfather had recently died, and his maternal grandmother was in a wheelchair, following cancer surgery. Sheeran and Wadge had a long talk that evening about enduring love.\n\nSheeran excused himself to shower before dinner with his parents, who live nearby, and Wadge picked up one of his acoustic guitars (a gift from Harry Styles) and began strumming a four-chord progression in D major. Sheeran heard it when he came out of the shower, and called out, \"We need to do something with that!\"\n\nAfter dinner, Wadge and Sheeran returned home and continued writing in Sheeran's kitchen. The first line, \"When your legs don't work like they used to,\" referred to his grandmother's condition. By midnight, \"Thinking Out Loud\" was finished. Sheeran recorded the song, in which the second and fourth chords are anticipated, just in time to include it on his second album, \"Multiply.\"\n\nAs a writer, Sheeran is known for his speed and facility. He can toss off four or five songs a day when he's recording an album. His EP \"No. 5 Collaborations Project\" led to a deal with Atlantic Records, a Warner Music label, when he was nineteen. He writes ballads as well as bangers; he also raps. He has collaborated with artists including Taylor Swift , Rita Ora, and Justin Bieber . His songs are popular partly because they are so accessible. It's as if you already know them.\n\nSheeran usually performs solo with a guitar-without costume changes, dancers, or pyrotechnics-backed only by looped tracks that he makes with a pedal as he plays. The two-year-long tour for his 2019 album, \"Divide,\" took in more than seven hundred and seventy-five million dollars, making it the second-highest-grossing tour of all time. Now, at thirty-two, he is one of the wealthiest people in the U.K.\n\n\"Thinking Out Loud,\" released in September, 2014, was one of the first songs to be streamed half a billion times on Spotify; it has since passed 2.2 billion streams. It won the 2015 Grammy for Song of the Year, and its success shot Sheeran into the thin air of the world's top hitmakers. The song also became a favorite at his concerts.\n\nIn a YouTube video of a Sheeran show in Zurich in November, 2014, the artist, playing an electric guitar, smoothly transitions from \"Thinking Out Loud\" to \"Let's Get It On\" and back to \"Thinking,\" without changing chords or the harmonic rhythm-the syncopated cadence at which chords are played. He smiles a bit mischievously. The crowd loves it.\n\nMost pop songs are made out of other pop songs. Many are constructed on three- or four-chord progressions, and have a near-identical blueprint-intro, verse, chorus, bridge, outro. Other than words and melody, not much in a composition is protected by copyright. As the Australian comedy trio Axis of Awesome demonstrates in a video that went viral, any number of pop songs can fit inside the same four chords. For this reason, the property lines of popular music are hard to draw. Inspiration, imitation, homage, and pastiche are all at play. Often, the trick is to sound new and old at the same time. But at what point do influence and interpolation become appropriation and plagiarism?\n\nIn 2019, the hitmaker Pharrell Williams spoke with the producer Rick Rubin, for a filmed conversation about creativity. Williams described his reaction to hearing a song that makes him feel something he hasn't felt before: \"I'm going to have to reverse engineer the feeling in order to get to the chord structure.\" He did just that with \" Blurred Lines ,\" his 2013 hit with Robin Thicke, for which he seemed to metabolize almost every aspect of Marvin Gaye's 1977 hit \"Got to Give It Up,\" including the crowd noises and the cowbell.\n\nBut, according to a jury in Los Angeles, Williams went too far. In 2015, it found that the composers of \"Blurred Lines\" had illegally copied Gaye's song. The songwriters were ultimately forced to pay the Gaye family $5.3 million, and to share half the song's future publishing royalties. The verdict was a victory for the copyright attorney Richard Busch. Afterward, more than two hundred producers and other people in the music business signed an amicus brief predicting that, if the verdict was upheld, they would be forced to work \"always with one foot in the recording studio and one foot in the courtroom.\" It was upheld anyway, in a 2-1 vote, in 2018. The dissenting judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Jacqueline Nguyen, described the ruling as \"a devastating blow to future musicians and composers everywhere,\" because it allowed \"the Gayes to accomplish what no one has before: copyright a musical style.\"\n\nMany people correctly predicted that the \"Blurred Lines\" ruling would trigger a wave of frivolous infringement cases. \"I can't tell you how many calls we get after the Grammys,\" Judith Finell, who was the Gaye family's expert musicologist in the \"Blurred Lines\" case, told me. \"Mostly from lawyers wanting to see if their client's claim of infringement is winnable.\"\n\nTaylor Swift, the Weeknd, and Justin Bieber are only a few of the artists who have been subject to recent allegations of infringement. The composers of Dua Lipa's 2020 hit \"Levitating\" are being sued on both coasts: In Los Angeles, the reggae band Artikal Sound System is claiming that the song copied its 2017 track \"Live Your Life.\" In the Southern District of New York, L. Russell Brown and Sandy Linzer believe that \"Levitating\" infringes on two songs they wrote, \"Wiggle and Giggle All Night,\" from 1979, and \"Don Diablo,\" from the following year.\n\nTwo influential decisions in California's Ninth Circuit in the past few years have repaired some of the \"Blurred Lines\" damage. In 2020, the appeals court confirmed a jury's verdict that Led Zeppelin's \"Stairway to Heaven\" did not infringe on \"Taurus,\" by the late-sixties rock band Spirit, because the descending A-minor figure in \"Taurus\" consisted of \"common musical elements\" that can't be copyrighted. In 2020, a district judge in Los Angeles overturned a verdict that found Katy Perry's \"Dark Horse\" had infringed on eight notes from \"Joyful Noise,\" an obscure song by the Christian artist Flame. The judge's decision was upheld on appeal.\n\nThis spring, a high-stakes copyright trial took place in New York City. The issue in Griffin v. Sheeran was whether Sheeran and Wadge had illegally copied from \"Let's Get It On\" in creating \"Thinking Out Loud.\" The larger issues were how much songwriters like Sheeran should be allowed to borrow from earlier works, and the opaque and antiquated process by which the law determines what part of a pop song the composer actually owns.\n\nMusic copyright, which became law in the United States in 1831, allows composers to establish the \"metes and bounds\" of their intellectual property, just as mechanical inventors do in obtaining patents. But a patent is granted only after examiners have determined, by way of an investigation, that an invention is truly new and useful. A music copyright is more like a virtual rubber stamp that a musician gets automatically as soon as a song is \"fixed in a tangible medium of expression.\" If the song is a hit and the musician is sued-because \"where there's a hit, there's a writ,\" as an old adage goes-it is up to the courts to figure out how original the work is.\n\nCopyright makes it commercially viable to be an artist. But painters can't claim ownership of a color, and songwriters can't monopolize notes or, for that matter, common chord progressions, modes, or rhythms. A composer is entitled to own only a particular expression or arrangement of a musical idea, not the idea itself. (The concept of an arpeggio, or of counterpoint, cannot be copyrighted.) The question is how to legally separate the two. The law, which represents the Apollonian side of human experience-the rational, analytical, and intellectual-is a leaky sieve for containing the Dionysian elements of music: the irrational, abstract, and emotional parts.\n\n\"Songwriters almost never steal melodies from one another on purpose,\" Joe Bennett, a professor of forensic musicology at Berklee College of Music, told me. \"In almost every case, the copying is inadvertent.\" Still, outright theft does happen-compare Johnny Cash's \"Folsom Prison Blues,\" from 1955, to Gordon Jenkins's 1953 song \"Crescent City Blues.\" Cash ultimately paid Jenkins seventy-five thousand dollars (which now amounts to some six hundred and sixty thousand) for lifting his melody and some of his lyrics.\n\nBennett explained that songwriters can be found liable for infringement of copyright even if the infringement was \"subconsciously accomplished.\" The phrase comes from the judge in a 1976 case, which found that George Harrison had unknowingly but unlawfully copied the Chiffons' 1963 song \"He's So Fine\" in his 1970 hit \"My Sweet Lord.\" The two melodies are virtually identical.\n\n\"Also known as 'cryptomnesia,' \" Bennett added. He defined the term as \"a forgotten memory that is mistaken for an original idea.\" Pop music is bursting with cryptomnesiacs.\n\nBefore the Internet, lack of access was the standard defense against a claim of subconscious copying: the composer couldn't possibly have heard the accuser's obscure song. At music publishers' offices, assistants were instructed to return unsolicited recordings unopened, so that the sender couldn't argue later that his work had been filched. But platforms like SoundCloud, Spotify, and TikTok have severely curtailed that defense. Finell, the musicologist, told me, \"Some kid will come to me and say, 'I just heard the latest Beyoncé song, and she stole my drum track!' I say, 'How did Beyoncé get to hear a drum track that you composed in your garage?' 'Well, I put it out on social media, and I have a hundred thousand followers. One of them could work with Jay-Z!' \"\n\nCan a style or a vibe ever be infringed on, if not all that much in pop is really new? True, some homages to past styles are more brazen than others: Bruno Mars and Mark Ronson took eighties funk grooves from the Gap Band's \"Oops Upside Your Head\" and made them part of the Grammy-winning song \"Uptown Funk\" without asking for permission. After the \"Blurred Lines\" verdict, a number of songwriters were added to the song's credits.\n\nThe music industry was recently shaken by \"Heart on My Sleeve,\" a song featuring a duet between a fake Drake and a fake the Weeknd, in which both vocals were created, using generative A.I., by an anonymous user called Ghostface. Artists and rights holders are concerned that their creations will be used to train A.I. generators that will eventually replace them. Faced with that possibility, rights holders are likely to seek more protection for style, even though doing so could make it harder for artists to do their work without infringing.\n\nEd Townsend had two sons, Clef Michael and David, born to his wife, Cherrigale, and a daughter, also named Cherrigale, born in Los Angeles in 1960 to a singer, who gave the child up for adoption at birth. The adoptive family, the Griffins, changed the baby's name to Kathryn. When Kathryn was a child, her adoptive mother would point at a hysterectomy scar on her stomach and say, \"This is where you came from.\"\n\nKathryn showed an aptitude for music, which made her parents nervous. \"My whole life, I wanted to play piano, flute, piccolo,\" she told me. The family moved from L.A. to Hattiesburg, Mississippi: \"They didn't want me in the music industry, because they were afraid I'd find out who my father was and fall into the life he did.\"\n\nGriffin fell anyway. She became addicted to crack cocaine and got into sex work to support her habit. She was trafficked, she told me, and after escaping her abusers she lived for a time in a \"cardboard condominium\" under a bridge. She speaks in a hoarse Southern drawl; in spite of her past, she laughs a lot.\n\nIn 1986, when Griffin was twenty-six, her grandfather, a Christian minister, told her that she was adopted. Her mother then confessed that her biological father was a famous musician. Griffin called an acquaintance, Hubert Laws, the jazz musician. \"Have you ever heard of a man named Ed Townsend?\" she asked. Laws replied, \"Everybody knows who Ed Townsend is!\" Griffin said, \"Well, I don't!\"\n\nShe recalled reaching Townsend by phone for the first time: \"I said, 'This is your daughter.' He said, 'I have looked for you your entire life.' \" But he had been searching for a Cherrigale, not a Kathryn.\n\nTownsend left Griffin a third of his \"Let's Get It On\" royalties. (In the nineteen-eighties, he had sold part of his share of the song's publishing copyright to Jobete.) She promised to protect his legacy. Griffin got sober in 2003, the year Townsend died. She began counselling women in prison in Houston who had been sex workers; she is now an expert in human-trafficking victims' rights. Griffin estimates that she has rescued more than a thousand women from \"the life.\" When her half brother David died, in 2005, he left Griffin his share of his father's royalties, as did her aunt Helen McDonald, in 2020.\n\nEarly in 2015, friends of Griffin alerted her to the similarities between \"Let's Get It On\" and a new song called \"Thinking Out Loud.\" \"They said, 'This British guy, he just changed the words and kept all the music!' \" she told me. Griffin listened to both: \"And I went, 'Oh, my God. Wow.' \"\n\nGriffin tried to notify Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the behemoth that had recently acquired the Jobete catalogue. But no one at Sony returned her calls. \"Let's Get It On\" was in the American Songbook. Shouldn't Sony want to protect its I.P. from infringement? Then Griffin figured it out: Sony was probably conflicted because it was also the publisher of \"Thinking Out Loud,\" along with much of the rest of Sheeran's catalogue.\n\nSony eventually asked two musicologists to investigate the claim. Both advised the company that there was no infringement, as did a third musicologist, whom Sheeran had hired in the U.K. Still, it seemed to Griffin that no one at Sony was looking after her interests or her father's legacy. (Sony says that it often finds itself on both sides of infringement suits, and that it remains neutral in these cases.)\n\nGriffin found lawyers, Pat Frank and Keisha Rice, in Tallahassee, Florida. They contacted Alexander Stewart, a professor of music at the University of Vermont. Stewart heard enough similarities between the two songs to write a report saying that Sheeran and Wadge were infringing on Gaye and Townsend. In 2017, Griffin's attorneys filed a civil suit in New York, where Sony is headquartered, which charged that \"the melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic compositions of 'Thinking' are substantially and /or strikingly similar\" to \"Let's Get It On.\" As with \"Blurred Lines,\" the claim focussed not on obvious similarities in the songs' melodies or lyrics but on compositional elements associated with the rhythmic harmony-the groove.\n\nOn a Monday a few weeks ago, shortly after 11 A.M. , Judge Louis L. Stanton, who is ninety-five years old, took his place at the bench in a federal courtroom in downtown Manhattan. The plaintiff, now Kathryn Griffin Townsend, was seated next to her attorneys. She wore a dark-green dress, a long black coat, and an expression of sombre resolve. Her daughter Skye was also in attendance.\n\nIn music-copyright trials, similarities are assessed by two kinds of people: expert listeners and lay ones. The élite ears belong to forensic musicologists, who are often academics with advanced degrees. They hear music intellectually, in quantifiable component parts: tempo, amplitude, arrangement. The musicologists offer supposedly objective analyses of the \"musical fingerprints\" of songs, but they manage to arrive at opposite conclusions, depending on which side is employing them-generally for around five hundred dollars an hour. The lay listeners on the jury, who are a kind of proxy for pop music's audience, temper the experts' testimony with what their own ears tell them.\n\nIn federal court, this methodology is known as the Arnstein test. It derives from Arnstein v. Porter-a famous 1946 case that was heard during New York's heyday as a songwriting town-involving Cole Porter , the Broadway composer, and Ira B. Arnstein, a writer of Yiddish folk songs and light opera, who became convinced that many of the biggest hits of the era had been stolen from him. The songwriter accused Porter of copying the melodies in \"Night and Day\" and \"My Heart Belongs to Daddy,\" among other songs, from sheet music kept in a trunk in his shabby Upper West Side apartment, possibly aided by a duplicitous landlord. Arnstein ultimately lost the case, as he lost every case in his long career as a copyright troll. However, as Gary Rosen notes in his book \"Unfair to Genius,\" from 2012, \"It is within American jurisprudence and not popular music that the name Ira B. Arnstein reverberates.\" He adds, \"If only he could have collected a royalty on the case law that bears his name.\"\n\nFourteen prospective lay listeners were called into the Griffin v. Sheeran jury box, and Judge Stanton asked whether anything prevented them from rendering impartial judgment.\n\n\" 'Perfect' was my wedding song,\" a young woman said.\n\n\"My teen-age daughters love Ed Sheeran,\" another said. \"I don't know his music.\"\n\nBoth women were eventually rejected during voir dire, as was a young man who said that he was pursuing a doctorate in musicology at Columbia University. Even though he was probably the best-qualified potential juror to decide the case, he clearly wasn't a lay listener. The final seven-person jury included a lawyer, a special-ed teacher, a dramaturge, an amateur singer, a recent college graduate, and a guy who'd played trumpet in middle school.\n\nBecause \"Let's Get It On,\" or \"L.G.O.,\" as the legal documents refer to the song, was recorded before 1978, it is governed by the 1909 Copyright Act, which stipulated that, in order for a musical work to be registered for copyright, a written composition must be submitted to the U.S. Copyright Office, in Washington, as the \"deposit copy.\" (It wasn't until the 1976 Copyright Act, which went into effect on January 1, 1978, that sound recordings were admissible as deposit copies.)\n\nIn both the \"Blurred Lines\" and \"Stairway to Heaven\" cases, the jury was not permitted to listen to any pre-1978 recording. The jurors in Griffin v. Sheeran could listen to the recording of Sheeran's song, but they had to rely on the five pages of sheet music for \"Let's Get It On,\" a skeletal transcription that contained lyrics, melody, chords, and a notation of where the syncopated beats fall. Gaye's piano and the Funk Brothers' additions to the groove, such as the bass line, weren't on the deposit copy. Gaye, who didn't read music, probably never even saw the transcription. (Sheeran can't read music, either, a fact that he readily admitted on the stand.) The only versions of \"L.G.O.\" that the jury could listen to were the experts' MIDI audio files, which were made from the sheet music using musical software, and sung by a computer-generated voice. The tinny, wheedling sound of the synthesized music and the high-pitched android vocal made a classic soul song sound utterly soulless.\n\nAlmost all the major African American contributions to American music-ragtime, jazz, swing, hip-hop-were built on rhythmic innovations that weren't transcribed in sheet music and copyrighted. (The bent third and seventh blue notes that lie at the heart of the blues can't even be written in twelve-note chromatic-scale notation.) Ingrid Monson, the Quincy Jones Professor of African American Music at Harvard, who also served as an expert witness for the Gaye family in the \"Blurred Lines\" trial, told me, \"There could be no copyright system less suited to rewarding the creativity of African American music than the one we have. It was obviously modelled on classical music, and on the idea that a real piece of music, one that was worthy of copyright, would be written in notation.\"\n\nEven though the Copyright Office now allows recordings to be submitted in place of transcriptions, melody and lyrics remain the most important elements of a musical copyright involving a song's composition, partly because they can be seen by judges and juries on paper. The focus on protecting the topline seems out of step with the dominance in contemporary pop of the track-the harmonic and rhythmic bed for a song, usually made by a producer on a digital workstation-which frequently precedes melodies and lyrics. It's often the track that makes a song sound unique.\n\nKathryn Griffin Townsend isn't the first person to accuse Ed Sheeran of copying a song. In 2017, on the advice of counsel, Sheeran settled an infringement claim brought by the writers of \"Amazing,\" a song performed by Matt Cardle, an \"X Factor\" winner, who maintained Sheeran's 2014 hit \"Photograph\" infringed on their track. Infringement claims are often resolved this way. In 2015, Sam Smith settled amicably with Tom Petty over the similarity between the chorus hook in Smith's song \"Stay with Me\" and that in Petty's \"I Won't Back Down.\" In 2021, Olivia Rodrigo offered the band Paramore a writing credit and a share of the profits from her song \"Good 4 You,\" whose hook sounds a lot like the pre-chorus of Paramore's \"Misery Business.\"\n\nBut Sheeran came to feel that settling (reportedly for five million dollars) made him a target for copyright trolls. \"Shape of You,\" a 2017 Sheeran megahit, was the subject of multiple disputes. He amicably resolved one, with the songwriters of TLC's hit \"No Scrubs,\" for borrowing its melody. (While writing the song, he'd referred to it as \"the TLC song.\") He initiated and won another case, brought in the U.K., against Sami Chokri, a British songwriter and grime artist, who'd asserted that Sheeran's \"Shape of You\" had stolen the chorus from his 2015 song \"Oh Why.\" The magistrate who decided the case in Sheeran's favor ordered Chokri to pay more than nine hundred thousand pounds, to cover Sheeran's legal fees.\n\nIn a BBC Two \"Newsnight\" interview that aired in the U.K. after the victory, Sheeran and his co-writer John McDaid, of Snow Patrol, talked about the \"extraordinary strain\" of the lawsuit on their creativity and mental health. \"The best feeling in the world is the euphoria around the first idea of writing a great song,\" Sheeran said, perhaps recalling that night in the kitchen with Wadge. \"The first spark, where you go, 'This is special-we can't spoil this.' \" He went on, \"But that feeling has now turned into 'Oh, wait, let's stand back for a minute, have we touched anything?' You find yourself in the moment second-guessing yourself.\" As a precaution, Sheeran added, he films all his songwriting sessions, should a claim later arise.\n\n\"This is not about money,\" Sheeran said. \"It's about heart, honesty, and integrity. Win or lose, we had to go to court-we had to stand up for what we thought was right.\"\n\nSheeran decided to go to court rather than settle with Griffin for the same reason. He testified that his songwriter and artist friends were urging him to fight, saying, \" 'You have to win this for us.' \" These days, Sheeran observed, \"it's just something that happens. When you write songs and they're successful, someone comes after you.\" He also said that, if he lost this case, he was going to quit music. \"I'm finished,\" he declared. \"I'm done.\"\n\nSheeran arrived in court the day after jury selection. He wore a dark-navy suit with double vents in the back, and a blue necktie with small white polka dots, but he still managed to look scruffy, like a subway busker turned banker. He sat at the defense table, where, in the course of seven days, the spectators behind him-a mix of copyright attorneys, music journalists, and superfans-could study his distinctive copper-colored coif.\n\nTownsend sat just in front of Sheeran, at the plaintiff's table. Her coat, a gift from the musician George Clinton , had the word \" INTEGRITY \" emblazoned on the back, directly in Sheeran's line of sight. Townsend's legal team included the civil-rights lawyer Ben Crump, a personal friend, who represented George Floyd 's family after Floyd's murder, and worked with Keisha Rice on the Trayvon Martin wrongful-death case. This would be his first music-copyright trial.\n\nA few weeks earlier, Crump had held a press conference outside the courthouse. With Townsend standing next to him, he'd said, \"It is important that we understand that this is part of a larger issue. Far too many times in history, Black artists have created some of the most miraculous music in the world, only to see white artists come and usurp that music and reap untold fortunes while these Black artists and their families derive nothing from their genius.\"\n\nBut surely the Yorkshire-born Sheeran wasn't solely responsible for the shameful exploitation of Black artists within the U.S. music industry? As Jennifer Jenkins, a copyright-law professor at Duke, put it to me, \"Sheeran isn't Pat Boone covering songs by Little Richard, and he isn't Alan Freed taking credit for Chuck Berry's 'Maybellene' without writing a single note.\" Nevertheless, Crump called on Sheeran to \"do the right thing\" and settle with Griffin before the trial started. Otherwise, Crump thundered, \"let's get it on!\"\n\nIn his opening statement, Crump called for \"credit where credit is due,\" but he stopped short of accusing Sheeran of appropriating Black music. He characterized the video of Sheeran's Zurich concert as a \"smoking gun.\"\n\n\"Maya Angelou tells us that when a person shows you who they are, it's our duty to believe them,\" Crump declared. \"When someone provides you a voluntary confession, believe them.\"\n\nIlene Farkas, a copyright specialist at the powerhouse firm Pryor Cashman, who along with Donald Zakarin led Sheeran's legal team, delivered the defense's opening. She said that the only similarities between the two songs were a common chord progression and an equally common syncopated rhythm. The plaintiffs, she argued, \"cannot own these common musical elements.\"\n\nOn the stand, Townsend described her feelings about Sony's failure to respond to her inquiries. \"I feel they've been so negligent,\" she said, her voice thick with emotion. \"And I promised my father I would protect his work and artistry.\" She went on, \"I have nothing against Mr. Sheeran personally. I think he's a great artist with a great future. I am simply trying to protect my father's legacy.\"\n\nAfter lunch, the plaintiffs called Sheeran to the stand, where Rice questioned him. Sheeran testified to hearing \"L.G.O.\" for the first time in an Austin Powers movie, but denied copying it.\n\nRice asked Sheeran about his song \"Take It Back,\" which boasts about stealing rap lyrics:\n\nYou'll find me ripping the writtens\n\nOut of the pages they sit in\n\nAnd never once I get bitten\n\nBecause plagiarism is hidden\n\n\"Are those your lyrics?\" Rice asked.\n\n\"Can I just give context?\" Sheeran replied.\n\n\"If I need more context, I'll certainly ask,\" Rice said.\n\n\"I feel like you don't want me to answer because you know what I'm going to say is going to make a lot of sense,\" Sheeran said.\n\nFinally, the plaintiffs played the Zurich video, which they saw as their strongest single piece of evidence. (The admissibility of the video as evidence had been the subject of much legal maneuvering by the defense, who appeared keen not to see it played.) Sheeran watched from the witness box, his moon face expressionless. Afterward, he remarked, with some heat, \"Quite frankly, if I had done what you're accusing me of doing, I would be an idiot to stand on a stage in front of twenty thousand people and show that.\"\n\nSheeran is a master of the mashup. At shows, he often interpolates his songs and other people's songs, as a kind of musical party trick; he sometimes takes requests from the audience. Throughout his time on the stand, he entertained the jury and spectators by demonstrating this with an acoustic guitar that his team placed within reach of the witness box. At one point, he started singing \"Thinking Out Loud,\" transitioned into Shania Twain's \"You're Still the One,\" then into Bob Dylan's \"Just Like a Woman,\" and finished with Van Morrison's \"Crazy Love.\" Recordings of Sheeran's mashups were played: \"Take It Back\" with \"Superstition,\" by Stevie Wonder, and \"Ain't No Sunshine,\" by Bill Withers.\n\n\"You can kind of play most pop songs over most pop songs,\" Sheeran told the room. It was persuasive testimony, but it also helped explain why Sheeran's songs sound familiar-they're not so different from many other songs.\n\nIn the \"Blurred Lines\" trial, Judith Finell devoted much of her testimony to a PowerPoint presentation. Average listeners have a hard time comparing two songs aurally, she told me: \"The first song doesn't stay in their memory when the second song starts playing.\" But, she added, \"people do retain visual information.\" Her presentation used a time-stamped map of intervals in the two songs which showed \"significant similarities\" by way of color-coded charts. To critics, her presentation was all smoke and mirrors, designed to trick the jury into thinking that a collection of unprotectable elements was forensic proof that \"Blurred Lines\" was stained with Marvin Gaye's musical DNA.\n\nTownsend's expert, Alexander Stewart, had also prepared a slide show, and his presentation focussed on three areas of similarity between the songs. These were several melody fragments; the syncopated rhythm that anticipated the second and fourth chords; and the progression, which Stewart claimed was, in the Roman nomenclature of chords, a I-iii-IV-V progression. He testified that, of all the songs that came before \"L.G.O.,\" he could find only one-a version of \"Georgy Girl\" recorded by \"a rather obscure Mexican bandleader\" in 1966-that employed the same combination of chord progression and syncopation. He estimated that seventy per cent of the \"musical value\" of Sheeran's song was derived from Gaye and Townsend's.\n\nLawrence Ferrara, a professor of music at N.Y.U., was the forensic musicologist for the defense. He pointed out that the chord progression Ed Townsend had played for Gaye was so common that it was in elementary music-method books such as \"How to Play Rock 'n' Roll Piano,\" published in 1967. He claimed that six songs had the same progression and rhythm as \"L.G.O.,\" including Holland-Dozier-Holland's \"You Lost the Sweetest Boy\" (1963), sung by Mary Wells, and the Mexican recording of \"Georgy Girl.\" (In the Seekers' hit version, the expert noted, the guitar is anticipated, but the bass plays on the beat.) If Sheeran were found to have illegally copied \"Let's Get It On,\" then the rights holders of those earlier songs could claim that \"L.G.O.\" had infringed on them, resulting in a circular firing squad of lawsuits. Ferrara variously characterized parts of Stewart's testimony as \"farcical,\" \"absurd,\" and \"ludicrous.\"\n\nSheeran also commented on Stewart's presentation. \"I think what he's doing is criminal,\" he said. \"I don't know why he's allowed to be an expert.\" What annoyed Sheeran most was that Stewart heard an F-sharp minor chord at the beginning of \"Thinking Out Loud.\" This would make it identical to the I-iii-IV-V progression in \"L.G.O.,\" if Sheeran's song were transposed to E-flat. But, in fact, Sheeran said, Stewart was wrong: the chord was a D over F-sharp-a D-major first inversion, which Sheeran demonstrated by strumming both progressions.\n\n\"I know what I'm playing on guitar,\" he said. \"It's me playing it.\"\n\n\"And how do you know Dr. Stewart is wrong?\" Farkas asked.\n\n\"I wrote it, and I play it every week, a lot,\" Sheeran said.\n\nThe other third of Ed Townsend's third of the \"Let's Get It On\" royalties, which was once owned by his son Michael, now belongs to Structured Asset Sales, an L.A.-based company founded by the financier David Pullman. Pullman is a pioneer in packaging song catalogues as investment-grade securities, a common practice today. Essentially, an investor buys a share and reaps a portion of future earnings from royalties, licensing, and new technologies like streaming. Pullman created the first of these securities, Bowie Bonds, in collaboration with David Bowie , in 1997. He has worked on similar deals for catalogues belonging to the estates of James Brown, the Isley Brothers, and Holland-Dozier-Holland, among others.\n\nPullman filed a separate hundred-million-dollar suit against Sony in 2018. In another legal action, he is seeking to capitalize on an amicus brief filed by the Copyright Office in the \"Stairway to Heaven\" case, which noted that there could be \"multiple, distinct copyrightable works that are all versions of the same song.\" This opened up the possibility of refiling a sound recording with the Copyright Office as a new arrangement, which would be covered by the rules of the 1976 Copyright Act. After reading the brief, Pullman submitted the recording of \"L.G.O.\" and sued Sheeran again, based on substantial similarities that were not reflected in the original deposit copy. Sheeran might well spend the rest of his life defending his tender evocation of enduring love against an implacable opponent whose name, like Arnstein's, is embedded in New York case law. (To \"Pullmanize\" someone is to legally remove an unwanted owner from a co-op building, named for the process that Pullman's fellow-owners on West Sixty-seventh Street went through in state court in 2001.)\n\nPullman now lives in an art-filled villa high atop Hollywood, with an unbeatable view of the city from his trapezoidal pool. As a music investor, he favors evergreens. In his estimation, there are so many more infringement cases these days not because of frivolous lawsuits but because of bolder instances of theft. \"It used to be, you'd find a song that wasn't that big a hit,\" he said, in his rapid-fire speaking style. \"Now they'll take hits. You have a better chance of having a hit if you take a giant hit. Why? Because people already recognize it!\"\n\nIn Pullman's opinion, Sheeran is a serial infringer: \"Why does he write songs so quickly? Maybe it's because parts of them are already written.\" He mentioned the Zurich video: \"He seamlessly goes into 'Let's Get It On'-did you pick that song out of a hat? Out of sixty million registered songs, why do you pick that song? It's a tell.\" He recalled the well-known story of Paul McCartney going around and asking people if the melody of \"Yesterday,\" which had come to him in a dream, was in fact remembered from another song. Today, Pullman said, it's \"infringe now, worry about it later.\"\n\nPullman said that he would consider settling for a respectful sum: \"I don't understand why someone wants to go through so many trials. Every case against him will just get stronger.\"\n\nWhen I saw Kathryn Griffin Townsend in the courthouse cafeteria before closing arguments, she looked rested and happy. \"Win, lose, or draw, it doesn't matter, because we won,\" she told me. \"Now people know what happened. And they'll think before they do it again.\" She added, \"This has never been about money.\"\n\nIlene Farkas, who closed for the defense, noted that we were all here because, exactly fifty years ago, Ed Townsend sat down at his piano and played Marvin Gaye four chords. Townsend had been free to use them to make a song, just as Sheeran should be. \"Do we have to tell the eleven-year-old next Ed Sheeran that they better find out who owns that chord progression?\" she asked.\n\nBen Crump reminded the jurors that this Ed Sheeran had threatened to quit music if they decided against him: a heavy burden. Millions of Sheeran fans would despise them, and the promoters and stadium owners involved in Sheeran's forthcoming world tour for his new album, \"Subtract,\" would be on the hook for the cancelled shows. \"That's simply a threat to try to play on your emotions,\" Crump said. \"I promise you, no matter what your verdict is, he won't be done with music.\" The lawyer observed that Sheeran is, above all, a performer. \"Don't be charmed,\" he said. \"I'm sure if Ed Townsend was alive and in this court, he would have been just as charming.\"\n\nThe jury deliberated for less than three hours before handing its verdict to Judge Stanton: Sheeran and Wadge had independently created \"Thinking Out Loud\"; they had not infringed on \"Let's Get It On.\"\n\nSheeran, who had missed his paternal grandmother's funeral to testify, emotionally embraced Farkas and Zakarin. Wadge wept. The music executives looked pleased. The trial had given both songs streaming bumps.\n\nOutside, on Worth Street, the pop star read a statement. \"It looks like I'm not going to have to retire from my day job,\" Sheeran said. However, \"I am unbelievably frustrated that baseless claims like this are allowed to go to court at all.\" He hoped that now he and his fellow-songwriters could \"all just go back to making music.\" (Judge Stanton dismissed the first of Pullman's lawsuits a week later.) Then his artfully tousled head disappeared into a black S.U.V. and was gone.\n\nTownsend did not seem at all downhearted by the verdict. She had honored her promise to her father, she told me, which was \u0000\u0000\"to protect his intellectual property.\" She'd embraced Sheeran in the courtroom after the verdict, and they'd chatted briefly. \" 'All I ever wanted to do was talk to you about this,' \" she said she'd told him. \" 'I'm sorry it took all this to make that happen.' \"\n\nTownsend went on to say that Sheeran had offered her tickets to his upcoming concert at NRG Stadium, in Houston. She ended up declining the offer, opting to attend her grandson's pre-K graduation instead. At the show, \"Thinking Out Loud\" came midway through. \"Let's Get It On\" did not make the set list. ♦\n\nAn earlier version of this article misidentified the street where David Pullman lived in a co-op building.\n\nAudio: Robin Thicke, T.I., and Pharrell Williams, \"Blurred Lines\" (Star Trak); Johnny Cash, \"Folsom Prison Blues\" (Sun Label Group); The Chiffons \"He's So Fine\" (Capitol Records); Marvin Gaye, \"Let's Get It On\" (Motown Record Company); Cory Daye, \"Wiggle and Giggle All Night\" (Featherbed Music); Tom Petty, \"I Won't Back Down\" (MCA Records); George Harrison, \"My Sweet Lord\" (G.H.

      "text": "Despite a National Outcry, Activists in Louisville Fight the Breonna Taylor Decision Alone\n\nLast Thursday evening, downtown Louisville looked deserted. The boarded up windows of hotels, theatres, and restaurants faced empty pedestrian malls, and the scent of new plywood hung in the air. Sand-colored Humvees blocked off intersections and police checkpoints kept cars from breaching the perimeter of the city center. The fortification had started earlier in the week, on September 21th, when the Louisville Metro Police Department declared a state of emergency in anticipation of an announcement about a grand-jury proceeding into the death of Breonna Taylor , a twenty-six-year-old Black emergency-room technician who was shot and killed by members of the Louisville Metro Police Department, during a raid on her apartment on March 13th. On Wednesday, Daniel Cameron, the Republican attorney general of Kentucky, announced that no charges would be filed against Myles Cosgrove and Jonathan Mattingly, two of the three officers responsible for Taylor's death. The third officer, Brett Hankison, the only one of the three who has lost his job, was charged with a felony count of reckless endangerment for firing his gun without a line of sight.\n\nWhen Taylor was killed, in mid-March, many cities across the country were going into lockdown. Her cause drew relatively little attention until after May 25th, when a police officer killed George Floyd in Minneapolis. That same day, Memorial Day, a wreath-laying ceremony was held in Taylor's honor outside the apartment where she died. On May 28th, after the Courier Journal published a transcript of Taylor's boyfriend's frantic 911 call, and as Minneapolis inspired marches across the country, several hundred people in Louisville took to the streets to call for the firing and arrest of the officers responsible. That night, police met them with tear gas and paintballs, and seven protesters were hit with gunfire by an assailant whose identity remains unknown.\n\nThe wreath-laying ceremony last May had been organized by Linda Sarsour and Tamika Mallory, New York activists who were among the co-founders of the Women's March in 2017, under the auspices of a social-justice advocacy organization they founded last year called Until Freedom. Mallory, whose speech in Minneapolis about George Floyd went viral a few days later, had been recruited to advocate for Taylor by Ben Crump, the attorney from Florida who represents Taylor's family and the families of many other unarmed Black people killed by the police. By June, when Until Freedom held a rally in Frankfort, the state capital, Breonna Taylor's name was being chanted alongside Floyd's around the country, and appending \"arrest the cops who killed Breonna Taylor\" to otherwise banal statements on social media became a prevalent meme of the summer. In July, Until Freedom held a protest outside of Daniel Cameron's house at which eighty-seven activists were arrested. In August, Mallory and Sarsour relocated to live in Louisville, where they have organized food deliveries, voter-registration drives, and trainings in the Kingian principles of nonviolence. They also bring their contemporary public-relations savvy and a cozy and unapologetic relationship with celebrities. Their collaborators include Oprah Winfrey, who funded twenty-six billboards in Louisville calling for the arrest of the officers who killed Taylor, and who put Taylor's image on the cover of the August issue of O magazine, the first time in the publication's history that someone other than Oprah appeared there. They helped recruit Cardi B, Alicia Keys, and Tracee Ellis Ross for a video speaking out on behalf of Taylor, and their organization's donors include Roc Nation, the entertainment agency started by Jay-Z. Sarsour told me that using famous people is \"one of the things we do really well.\"\n\nIn a speech that accompanied his announcement about the grand jury, Daniel Cameron, a protégé of Mitch McConnell whom the Republican Party elevated to the national stage at the convention last summer, criticized the \"celebrities, influencers, and activists who, having never lived in Kentucky, will try to tell us how to feel.\" Given Cameron's own evident national ambitions, and the ways in which the Trump campaign has twisted the Movement for Black Lives into a narrative about urban chaos, this seemed hypocritical. Still, Until Freedom's success at publicizing Taylor's cause on the Internet has not shielded the beleaguered activists on the ground in Louisville from physical and legal risk.\n\nAs anticipated, local protesters took to the streets immediately after Cameron's announcement. By the end of Wednesday, police had arrested more than a hundred of them, and two police officers had been shot. A suspect, Larynzo Johnson, was taken into custody. (He later pleaded not guilty, and is being held on a million-dollar bond.) National politicians quickly published their opinions. From Washington, where he is working to push through the confirmation of a new Supreme Court Justice before the election, the Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell issued a statement about Taylor's \"tragic killing\" and condemned the \"lawlessness, riots, and violence\"-wording that managed to acknowledge that the killing was wrong while also avoiding calling for accountability. Trump sent his \"regards\" to Taylor's family, prayers to the police officers, and added a predictable \"LAW & ORDER!!\" on Twitter at midnight. Rather than calling for charges against the officers who killed her, the Democrats appeared a little too eager to chastise the activists. McConnell's Democratic opponent, Amy McGrath, quickly posted a statement condemning the shootings of the police officers in Louisville, calling it \"unacceptable.\" Joe Biden said, in his statement on the matter, \"I know people are frustrated and they have a right to peacefully protest, but violence is never acceptable.\"\n\nFor all the national attention, the daily work of direct action was a decidedly grassroots affair maintained by a relatively small but consistent group of Louisville residents. Jefferson Square Park, which the demonstrators refer to in flyers as \"injustice square,\" is the size of a city block, and is flanked by municipal buildings. At its center is the memorial to Taylor, meticulously tended, with paintings, flowers, and Christmas lights that blink on and off in the evenings. On the fringes are folding tables where volunteers register voters or distribute snacks. One had a pop-up tent on which had been written, in marker, a frequent chant during the marches: \"Breeway or the freeway.\"\n\nI arrived in downtown Louisville on Thursday night, as another march began. Street parking had been prohibited by police order, and I hastily parked my car in the lot of a Hampton Inn in order to catch up with a group of activists who had just walked past. I noticed only as I left the lot a group of armed militia members standing around their cars. More armed men wearing Kevlar vests, who, according to the Daily Beast, belonged to the far-right group the Oath Keepers, surrounded the perimeter of a Shell gas station across the street. It was shortly after eight o'clock in the evening. I caught up with the activists as their phones blared with an emergency alert announcing a nine o'clock curfew. They moved swiftly through the dark streets, monitored by helicopters above. We passed a modernist building, the Louisville Free Public Library, where I heard someone bludgeon a window. \"Not the library!\" someone yelled out.\n\nThe march did not last very long. By the time of curfew, the protesters, who likely numbered fewer than two hundred people, had taken sanctuary in the parking lot and yard of the First Unitarian Church, which had also served as a safe space the previous night. A clause in the curfew order made an exception for people returning to and from houses of worship, but there was also the symbolism of the thing.\n\nAn eerie two hours followed. Within minutes of the marchers' arrival, members of law enforcement with armored vehicles had surrounded the church, including a line of officers with their batons out who stood in a line under the streetlights at the end of an alley. Tear gas from somewhere down the street occasionally wafted over the group, setting off coughing and sneezing. A drone with green lights hovered overhead, and the crisp white floodlight of a helicopter passing over cast revolving shadows of trees as it circled. The protesters were mostly young and mostly Black. More than one had guns. I saw one with an aluminum baseball bat tucked in her backpack, and several wearing shin guards. Most of them, however, had shown up in T-shirts and face masks, and they now seemed very vulnerable. The amount of force there to meet them looked disproportionate, as if law enforcement had planned their logistics according to the chaos evoked on Fox News instead of this small, local reality. Oprah wasn't here, nor any national political figures. The deluge of Twitter posts about Taylor seemed very far away. Two white people from the church, one in a clerical collar and the other in monk's robes, crossed a parking lot to try and get information.\n\nActivists on their phones started sharing a piece of news. \"They arrested Shameka and Attica,\" someone announced. Shameka Parrish-Wright is a manager at the Louisville Bail Project. Attica Scott, a state representative who was marching through her own district, is the only Black female legislator in the Kentucky General Assembly. Both have been prominent organizers against police brutality in Louisville since Taylor's death. Scott had introduced a bill, \"Breonna's Law,\" that would ban so-called no-knock warrants statewide. Police had arrested the two, along with Scott's teen-aged daughter, as they attempted to cross the street to the church. They were later charged with first-degree rioting, a felony; the arrest statement claimed that they had attempted to set the Louisville Free Public Library on fire. As Scott later pointed out, to the Courier Journal, the library is in the district she represents. \"What I have done nothing but fight for and try to get funding for-you're going to accuse me of trying to set fire to it?\" she said. \"That's ridiculous.\"\n\nThe police finally allowed the protesters to go home. When I got back to my car, the militia members were still standing around the Shell station. Their presence after curfew, and all of their weaponry, were not deemed a threat by law enforcement.\n\nThe marches, rallies, and press conferences continued on Friday. In the morning, in Jefferson Square Park, members of the national media gathered for an announcement from Taylor's family and Ben Crump. Wearing a face mask with Taylor's name on it, Crump called for the release of the transcripts of the grand-jury trial, which Cameron had not made public. (After a legal complaint filed by an anonymous member of the grand jury on Monday challenged this decision, he has since announced that he would release a recording of their deliberation.) The harshest criticism for Cameron, who is Black, came from Tamika Mallory: \"We have no respect for you,\" she said. \"No respect for your black skin. Because all our skin folk ain't our kin folk, and you do not belong to Black people at all.\" The conference concluded with a ceremonial releasing of butterflies. Later, the University of Louisville men's basketball team led a march from Cardinal Stadium. A group of faith leaders held a press conference at the First Unitarian Church to express their support.\n\nOn Friday evening, shortly before curfew, Attica Scott, who had just been released from jail, returned to march, a quiet and mostly unnoticed presence in gray leggings and a T-shirt at the back of a crowd of several hundred. Earlier that day, the union that represents the employees of the Louisville Public Library had released a statement: \"We have seen no proof that the flare thrown into the library has done any major damage, nor that Representative Scott had anything to do with it,\" it read. I asked her how she saw the arrest. \"They set us up,\" she said of the police officers who had taken them in the previous night. \"It was clear they were trying to box us in, give us contradictory directives, just so they could arrest us.\" She spent the night in jail, she said, with a group of seventeen women, fourteen of whom were \"Black, indigenous, or Chicana, so that says something.\" She reiterated that she would never have attempted to burn down a library in Taylor's name.\n\nThe march moved through a neighborhood of pubs and restaurants, then reached a highway underpass that was blocked by police officers. The police threw crowd dispersants known as flashbangs, sending marchers running in disarray. I saw a boy and his mother holding each other in tears, panicked by the sudden chaos in what had been an otherwise calm evening. I saw organizers loading protesters with children into cars to get them away from a situation that seemed on the verge of turning volatile. But, a few moments later, the march regrouped, now on the sidewalk, and continued back to Jefferson Square Park.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Whom Does Kobe Bryant Represent?\n\nI had no particular expectation of controversy when I asked Kobe Bryant about the Miami Heat players' Twitter activism in the wake of Trayvon Martin's death, posing in hoodies as a protest against racial profiling. It was, if anything, a so-called softball question, meant to confirm my impression that Bryant, the subject of my Profile in last week's magazine, who had spoken proudly of his participation in Bill Clinton's Health Matters Initiative, was more politically engaged than his idol Michael Jordan.\n\n\"Is that the kind of thing you could see yourself doing?\" I asked.\n\nBryant paused and said, \"Smartly,\" seeming to imply that my example wasn't one that he would have chosen himself. \"I won't react to something just because I'm supposed to, because I'm an African-American. That argument doesn't make any sense to me. So we want to advance as a society and as a culture, but, say, if something happens to an African-American, we immediately come to his defense? Yet you want to talk about how far we've progressed as a society? Well, if we've progressed as a society, then you don't jump to somebody's defense just because they're African-American. You sit and you listen to the facts just like you would in any other situation, right? So I won't assert myself.\"\n\nThis particular quote sparked a contentious debate, particularly among African-American commentators. On ESPN, the columnist and on-air personality Jason Whitlock dismissed Bryant's \"disingenuous appeal for colorblindness,\" and wrote that he \"sounds like he's promoting Rush Limbaugh's opening monologue.\" Roland Martin, a former CNN contributor who now hosts a morning show on the TV One network, tweeted his disapproval so relentlessly (e.g., \"Does this dude have a brain?\" ) that Bryant was moved to call Martin's cell phone for an impromptu debate. (See here for Martin's recap of their conversation, in which, Martin said, Bryant lamented that others questioned Condoleezza Rice's \"blackness\" because of her politics.) Najee Ali, the founder of an organization called Project Islamic H.O.P.E., even called for a boycott of all products endorsed by Bryant. Yesterday, the Heat's Dwyane Wade offered a milder reproach , saying that he \"respectfully\" disagreed with his rival shooting guard. \"It was our back yard, and being in our back yard, being something that a lot of guys on this team-not only growing up in the kind of environment that Trayvon was in-but also having young boys,\" Wade said, of the motivation behind the hoodie photo. \"It was more so that than the color of his skin.\"\n\nIn our conversation, Bryant was speaking generally, more about my expectation that he should voice a strong opinion about the Martin case than about the incident itself. (He has since tweeted that he believes that \"Martin was wronged\" and \"the system did not work.\") \"I won't say, 'O.K., I'm going to vote for Obama just because he's an African-American,' \" he went on. \"I'm not going to do that in a million years. You got to sit and take everything as equal and pick the best candidate for the job. That's it. Now, from a responsibility, individually, I feel like I speak quite a bit to African-American kids about dreaming bigger. If you look at playing basketball, or you play baseball, or you're a musician, or whatever it is, there's a thousand different things that surround that career path that you can get into as well. I tweeted a while ago for athletes not just to understand their sport but to understand their sport's industry, because I think that's where it's at. You don't want to go out there and just play the game. There's so much that goes on around you in your brand and what you represent, and what you could represent.\"\n\nThe quotes in the preceding paragraph were not included in the Profile but they bring us back to the question of what-or whom-Bryant represents, and how he wishes to exert his considerable influence. (Ben Crump, a lawyer representing Trayvon Martin's parents, appeared the other day on Roland Martin's show and said, \"What made the Miami Heat so inspiring is that they have this influence, and they weren't just using it to sell basketball shoes.\") Bryant told me that the seven years that he spent living in Italy, as a child, while his father played professional basketball there, inspired in him a strong sense that there is \"a much bigger world out there.\" His ambitions have long seemed international in scope, if inchoate, such that he might not want to be perceived as speaking exclusively for a subset of the domestic population. \"We are not even the dominant minority anymore,\" the ESPN host Stephen A. Smith, who is black, said on \"The Arsenio Hall Show,\" on Sunday night, in the course of defending Bryant. \"We have to recognize that we are outnumbered.\"\n\nA few months ago, even before the Trayvon Martin flap, the retired running back Jim Brown appeared on Hall's show and argued that Bryant was, in effect, not a true African-American: \"He is somewhat confused about culture because he was brought up in another country.\" At the time, Bryant seemed almost to embrace the dis, referring to himself on Twitter as a \" 'Global' African-American\" and wondering whether Nelson Mandela or Martin Luther King, Jr., would have appreciated Brown's pejorative insinuation that Bryant's foreign upbringing made him less authentically black. In the past week, Bryant has continued to embrace the debate, telling Roland Martin that society needs lightning rods, and that he's willing to be one, proclaiming, via hashtag , that he was proudly color-blind and gender-blind. \"Critical or not,\" Bryant wrote , \"We've had a ton of convo the last few days about a BIG issue. That's always a good thing. Luv to ALL who tweeted thoughts.\" Let's hope that he keeps the discussion going. Michael Jordan may or may not have said \"Republicans buy shoes, too,\" to defend his decision not to endorse a black challenger to Senator Jesse Helms, in 1990, but he never cared to articulate a vision grander than Being Like Mike.\n\nPhotograph by Lisa Blumenfeld/Getty.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "What Rodney King and Tyre Nichols Have in Common\n\nListen to What Next:\n\nSlate's Joel Anderson feels like it's so common to hear about Black people being killed by the police that he's not actually sure when he first heard the name Tyre Nichols. Tyre Nichols was beaten by the cops in Memphis, Tennessee, on Jan. 7. He died three days later. The five officers who attacked him? They were fired-and then indicted, last week.\n\n\" Them firing those officers was the incident that made me look and say, \"Huh.\" It doesn't usually happen like that,\" Anderson said. He's covered a lot of deaths by police. There was Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Freddie Gray in Baltimore. And he hosted a whole season of the Slow Burn podcast about Rodney King and the riots that followed his assault back in 1991, which is why I wanted to talk to him now.\n\nAbout a week ago, Tyre's family got their first glimpse of the video of the brutality that led to his death. And afterward, they had this press conference with their lawyer, Ben Crump, to describe what they'd seen. \"Regrettably, it reminded us of the Rodney King video,\" Crump said, \"and unlike Rodney King, Tyre didn't survive.\"\n\nAnderson says it's hard not to take that comparison seriously coming from Crump, who has represented the families of almost every notable Black death at the hands of police. \"For that guy, who's seen it all, to say that this looks like the most notorious incident of police brutality in American history, that has to mean something.\"\n\nOn Tuesday's episode of What Next , I spoke with Anderson about the story of Tyre Nichols-and what it shows about how far we've come since Rodney King. Maybe not very far at all. Our conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nMary Harris: I'm wondering if you can introduce me to Tyre. Who was he? I've seen all these very charming skateboarding videos of him. But what do we know about him?\n\nJoel Anderson: That's really the lovely thing: All over social media, people are sharing that short video of him skateboarding, something that he clearly had a knack for. Tyre was a 29-year-old Black man who worked the second shift at the local FedEx facility, someone who was clearly close to his mother. His family said that every evening about 7 o'clock, he'd go to his mom's house for his lunch break. He even tattooed his mother's name on his arm. And his mother took a lot of pride in that. He was also a parent himself. He was a father to a 4-year-old son. So, he just seemed to be an everyman, a blue-collar worker in Memphis who was raising his child and was close to his family and apparently stopped at the same Starbucks for coffee every morning. Just a regular guy.\n\nWe don't seem to know a lot about the traffic stop that led to his death. And the video doesn't tell very much about that either. It just starts right away with police charging at the car. But what do we know?\n\nIt all starts that night in January when the officers claim they were pursuing his vehicle for suspected reckless driving. At this point, we have no way to sustain whether or not that's true. But, a lot of people who've seen that body camera surveillance video say they show that first initial stop when the officers confront Tyre, they drag him out of the car and start yelling these conflicting and contradictory orders at him-\"Show us your hands,\" and they're holding his hands, or \"Get on the ground,\" and he's already on the ground.\n\nAnd he says that, too. He's like, \"I'm on the ground.\"\n\nHe said, \"I'm on the ground. I didn't do anything.\" I defy anyone to explain to me how he could have done anything to deescalate it. They pulled him out of his car. He's trying to comply, but they won't allow him to comply with some of their commands.\n\nIt's funny, a few years ago, I talked with the Houston police chief at the time, Art Acevedo. He ended up going to Miami and didn't last in that position long. He was talking about how he had a teenage son. And I said, \"What would you do? You're Latino. If your son gets pulled over by the police, what do you tell them?\" He says, \"Well, I would just say make sure you don't make any sudden movements and be respectful and be cautious.\" And I'm like, that's the sort of thing you say if you encounter a mountain lion in the wild. And that's not really helpful. It really all depends on how good a mood, and does that cop respect you enough to treat you like you're somebody that pays his tax dollars?\n\nAnd you look at that stop and obviously those police officers didn't think of themselves as public servants. They thought of themselves as public warriors. And there's nothing that Tyre Nichols could have done to prevent them from treating him in the way that they did that night.\n\nPart of what this video shows is that people didn't treat him-the paramedics who eventually arrived didn't seem to intervene. Eventually he was taken to the hospital, and he died three days later. Something that stands out to me about this case is how quickly local authorities publicly admitted something had gone wrong.\n\nBecause, if I look back at Minneapolis, when George Floyd was murdered, the initial reaction from the police was \"Man dies after medical incident during police interaction.\" With Tyre, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation announced he died due to injuries sustained in a use of force incident with officers. And to me, that was the beginning of something seeming slightly different about this case. Do you think that's where it starts for you as well? Or was it a few days later?\n\nDefinitely the local government response, to admit that Tyre had been injured in this incident and to fire them, obviously it lets you know- whoa -something horrible has gone on here, and they don't really see any way around it. Sometimes I'm sort of cynical because this is not the first time that a local police department, when some of their police officers have been involved in brutality or abuse, has thrown that cop in front of the bus. It's not uncommon, especially with Black officers, for them to not necessarily get the sort of defense that white officers get in these incidents. But everybody in local government lined up so quickly to not only fire but then arrest and charge these officers. It was a clue that something really, really horrible had happened.\n\nAnd then it seemed like everyone was tensing and waiting for Friday night, because the police had said they were going to release the video after 6 p.m. Central time on Friday. And so it was all everyone could talk about, like they created this anticipation. And I really didn't know what to make of it at the time. Like, is this a strategy to get out front? Is that the right strategy? Because essentially the chief of police was saying, \"You have a right to be angry about this video.\" She went on CNN in the morning before they released it and said, \" You're going to see a lack of humanity. \" I've never seen it happen in that order.\n\nYou can be very cynical here and say that they're throwing themselves at the mercy of the public square-that they wanted to head off any potential protests, to at least keep the temperature down in the city. Maybe that move was successful, maybe it wasn't. There's still a long way to go. But yeah, absolutely, I think they wanted to give themselves some time to get into position and come up with an emergency plan to deal with the fallout. I would like to think that they thought this is so horrible that people are rightly going to be outraged and we want to give them some chance to prepare to deal with it. But I also think that it was a way to protect themselves and to give themselves a chance to get into order, so to speak.\n\nWhat police are trying to protect themselves from anytime an incident like this happens is a replay of what happened in Los Angeles 30 years ago. That's when Rodney King was beaten by four LAPD officers while, unbeknownst to them, a neighbor recorded the whole thing using his brand-new video camera. King was trying to flee a traffic stop, just like Tyre. And the tape was immediately shocking. A year later, when a jury acquitted the officers of any wrongdoing in the King case, Los Angeles erupted.\n\nAnderson says part of what makes Tyre Nichols' story different is that this time, the damning footage was captured by the police themselves. But all these years later, even though technology like officer-worn cameras is changing what we see, they aren't necessarily changing how police behave.\n\nBodycams can be useful, but it also depends on the officer. They'd had an incident in Memphis before where a police officer had killed a young Black man, and he turned off his camera. If they have the presence of mind to cut off the camera or shed that camera, then we're not going to see everything. And, yeah, in the last 30 years, the ubiquity of the camera-we all have a camera now. Back in 1991, when the Rodney King incident happened, that was the reason it exploded-because we had never seen brutality like that captured on camera in quite that way before. But also, nobody had seen a video like that. It was just very unusual for somebody to have something like that.\n\nWe've talked about how the reaction from people in power was notable this time, and it was also different from how people in power responded with Rodney King. When I went back and looked, it seemed to me like after the Rodney King video was released, it created a lot of tension in Los Angeles leadership between the police chief and the mayor, as opposed to what we've seen here, which is people moving more in lockstep. We saw on Saturday that this SCORPION Unit , which the police chief had created, disbanded.\n\nBut you've raised this kind of cynical thing about this, and I want to get into that because one thing that happened with Rodney King is that the tension caused there to be the Christopher Commission, an investigation of what's wrong with the police force. And I wonder if getting out in front of things like this means that there's not going to be a Christopher Commission in Memphis, someone coming in and saying, \"OK, let's get all the dirty laundry out there.\" Does that worry you a little bit?\n\nWhat I always worry about in these instances is that there's this initial outrage and shock, and then the officers get charged, and then people get a chance to retreat into their corners. And then the police get more defensive because the public is rightly outraged at them and is asking them to investigate themselves, to reform themselves, to show more public contrition. And they eventually get really upset, and they close their ranks. And that's actually what happened in the Rodney King case initially, which is amazing because LA's mayor at the time, Tom Bradley, and LAPD Chief Daryl Gates, they did not get along. They hated each other. They'd been longtime political rivals. And in the immediate aftermath of the release of the tape, they were roughly on the same page. They were like, \"This is horrible. This does not represent LAPD\"-which, OK, sure. But they were all on the same page. And then the idea for the commission came up, and as the case wound its way through the legal system, then people had a chance to go back to their original entrenched positions.\n\nAnd so that's the thing that I'll be looking for here. Memphis leadership all seems to be on the same page. The police chief, the mayor, the local prosecutor, they're all there together now. But will they be there in a year, year and a half when this case goes to trial-or if the case goes to trial? And will all of these same people still be in place then? And will they all feel the same way that they do about what happened?\n\nSomething I want to make sure we talk about is that the police officers involved, they're all Black. Memphis also has a Black police chief. I wonder what you make of that and whether in some ways it shows a fundamental misunderstanding that may exist about who's trustworthy on the police force, whether police are trustworthy at all.\n\nI'd note that most of the major cities in this country at this point have had Black police chiefs-New York, LA, Chicago, Houston, Philly, Phoenix, Dallas, so on and so forth. The idea that the officers look different because they're all five Black officers, this is not really that new. Seven years or so ago, I covered the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore. And at that time, Baltimore had a Black mayor and a majority-Black police force, and it had had several Black police chiefs over the years. And I spoke with community leaders, activists, and former Black police officers in Baltimore, and truthfully, they never had the trust or support of the people they patrolled. Maybe a few individual officers did, but on the whole, it's not like people were sitting around making distinctions between Black officers and police chiefs and the white ones. I've seen other people say this, so I can't credit it to anyone specifically, but they said basically, \"The race of a cop is cop.\"\n\nAnd again, over the weekend, there's been a million retweets of James Baldwin about Black police that have been meaningful and salient. But the one that really struck me was that he once said, in Notes of a Native Son , \"Negro policemen are feared more than whites, for they have more to prove and fewer ways to prove it.\" So anybody that has ever had a run-in with a Black cop, you know that you are not necessarily going to get treated any better by virtue of the fact that they're Black. And in fact, it may go even worse.\n\nWhich is interesting because I feel like so often the diversity of a police force is brought up as a really important goal of how to make policing better. And what you see here is it's just not an endpoint in and of itself. It's not meaningful without other things happening at the same time.\n\nIt's tough because if we're going to have police and we're going to devote all of this money to police-any local government's largest expenditure is the money that it devotes to public safety. If we're going to spend all that money, then they probably should be diverse. We don't want to turn it all over to the people that have not been around Black people, may have animus toward Black people. But I think we've seen in every police department in this country that any well-meaning attempt to diversify does not necessarily produce different outcomes. You can go to any corner of this country-from Seattle to Key West to Maine to San Diego-and Black people, regardless of who is in charge, who makes up the majority of the force, they have a legitimate gripe about the way they're being treated by the law enforcement community. If you're hoping for police reform, diversity, fine, sure. But it can't end there. You're going to have to go much further.\n\nGet more news from Mary Harris every weekday.\n\nI want to go back to the comparison between Tyre Nichols and Rodney King just for a moment to underline something that you brought up earlier. Over the weekend, there was a sigh of relief because there had been so much buildup for this release of the video, and then the protests were largely peaceful. And a lot of people, myself included, felt like, OK, great, things seem to be happening, moving in the right direction . But when you look back at Rodney King, the LA riots, they didn't happen right after the video came out. They happened when those officers were acquitted. And it reminded me that this is such a long path we're on.\n\nYeah, we have a long way to go. And I would like to remind people of the circumstance with the LAPD officers. So they get acquitted, and there's the riots. And this is all happening in the backdrop of a mayoral reelection between the hand-chosen successor to the Democratic incumbent and another guy who was sort of a Republican. And he ran on a plank of being tough on crime. So, not even barely a full year after we are looking at that incident with Rodney King and he says, \"It's time to clean up the crime in this town,\" and he gets elected.\n\nAnd I also go back to what has happened since the George Floyd incident. There were a few months where people took it very seriously-criminal justice reform-and it looked like we were going to get things done. And it's just hard to argue that there hasn't been a negative reaction against that to the idea of defund police or even a modicum of police reform. So, we seem to be in a good place today, but we have an awful long way to go.\n\nAfter our conversation ended, a sixth Memphis police officer was suspended from duty. The Memphis Fire Department also suspended two paramedics who had been at the scene. Tyre Nichols' family has asked that those EMTs be criminally charged.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Minneapolis Will Pay Record $27 Million Settlement to George Floyd's Family\n\nThe city of Minneapolis will pay $27 million to settle a lawsuit brought by the family of George Floyd . Attorneys for the family characterized it as the largest pretrial settlement in a civil rights wrongful death lawsuit in the history of the United States. But it came just at the murder trial of one of the former police officers who is accused of killing him is set to begin and some legal experts have raised fears that it could complicate that case .\n\nLawyers representing Floyd's family said the large settlement sends a powerful message that could serve as an example to other communities. \"This is a message that the unjust taking of Black life will no longer be written off as trivial, unimportant or unworthy of consequences,\" attorney Ben Crump said. The attorney also said it could help the city change the narrative. \"After the eyes of the world rested on Minneapolis in its darkest hour, now the city can be a beacon of hope and light and change for cities across America and across the globe,\" Crump said. Attorneys for Floyd's family said that they will be working with the city to put in place measures to prevent another death of this nature from ever happening again.\n\nThe lawsuit, which was filed In July accused the four former officers charged with his death of showing a \"reckless disregard\" for Floyd's civil rights while the city was accused of failing to get rid of dangerous officers while fostering a culture of racism. The confirmation of the settlement came after the City Council unanimously voted to approve the amount. \"No amount of money can ever address the intense pain or trauma caused by this death to George Floyd's family or to the people of our city,\" Minneapolis City Council President Lisa Bender said. \"Minneapolis has been fundamentally changed by this time of racial reckoning, and this city council is united in working together with our community and the Floyd family to equitably reshape our city of Minneapolis.\"\n\nNews of the settlement comes as jury selection continues for the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who is accused of killing Floyd by kneeling on his neck for almost eight minutes. Some legal experts say the settlement is likely to make jury selection even harder. The vast majority of possible jurors already said they had seen video of Floyd's arrest and now jurors might see the settlement as a sign that Chauvin did not act appropriately.\n\nThe amount of the settlement reflects how payments for police abuse are increasing rapidly. In 2015, for example, Freddie Gray's family reached a $6.4 million settlement with Baltimore and New York agreed to pay $5.9 million to Eric Garner's family.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

Members of Floyd's family had been watching the trial and news cameras captured their overjoyed reactions as they heard the verdict over the TV while sitting with their legal team:\n\nWATCH: George Floyd's family reacts to the conviction of Derek Chauvin on all three counts in the death of George Floyd. https://t.co/6nN46Fosol pic.twitter.com/15Q5jiE3oB\n\nOther members of the family watched the verdict from their home in Houston, Texas:\n\nGeorge Floyd's family watched the reading of the verdict in the Derek Chauvin trial from their home in Houston: https://t.co/WXD1mCjIgH pic.twitter.com/TOC2wzipam\n\nBen Crump, a civil rights lawyer representing the Floyds, also tweeted out a video of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris calling the family to express their satisfaction with the verdict. \"Nothing is going to make it all better, but at least now there's some justice,\" Biden said. \"You're an incredible family.\" Harris told them, \"This is a day of justice in America. Your family have been real leaders at this moment where we needed you.\"\n\nPresident Biden and VP Harris call the Floyd family after the GUILTY verdict! Thank you @POTUS & @VP for your support!

Philonise referred to Till as \"the first George Floyd.\" He talked about how the existence of video footage of his brother's death helped to raise awareness about the case, but also served as an emotional burden. \"It was a motion picture. The world's seen his life extinguished,\" Philonise said. \"And I could do nothing but watch, especially in that courtroom, over and over and over again as my brother was murdered.\" Terrence, another of George Floyd's younger siblings, spoke about his relationship with his older brother. \"He showed me how to be strong,\" Terrence said. \"He showed me how to be respectful. He showed me how to speak my mind. I'm going to miss him, but now I know he's in history. What a day to be a Floyd.\" George's youngest brother, Rodney Floyd, pressed lawmakers to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which would in part ban qualified immunity and chokeholds for law enforcement. \"For George this fight is not over. We're going to stand here together. We're going to try to get this George Floyd Act passed,\" Rodney said. \"The act has to be passed, people. It has to be. We're going to keep pressure on the Senate.\" The House passed the bill in March, though it could face opposition from Republicans and moderate Democrats in the Senate.\n\nShortly before the reading of the verdict, the Floyd family had been receiving gestures of moral support. Biden called the family on Monday as well to offer his prayers and sympathies. Philonise told NBC after the call that Biden \"knows how it is to lose a family member, and he knows the process of what we're going through, so he was just letting us know that he was praying for us and hoping that everything will come out to be OK.\" (The president's son Beau died from cancer in 2015, and his wife and daughter were killed in a car crash in 1972.) Biden said to reporters on Tuesday that he was praying for the \"right verdict, which is, I think it's overwhelming in my view.\" The family of Emmett Till was also reportedly with the Floyds to comfort them as the jury was deliberating.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Kenosha, Wisconsin, Officer Who Shot Jacob Blake Will Not Face Charges\n\nKenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley announced on Tuesday that the white officer who shot Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, seven times in the back and left him paralyzed will not face charges. Graveley said he found that the officer, Rusten Sheskey, was acting in self-defense and justified in using deadly force. The two other officers at the scene, who have not been publicly identified, will also not face charges. \"When there is enough information to raise self-defense, the burden of proof is on the state,\" the district attorney said. \"It's on the prosecutor to disprove self-defense.\"\n\nThe shooting occurred on the evening of Aug. 23 , when Sheskey was responding to a domestic disturbance call at an apartment complex. After a confrontation in the street, the officer shot Blake at close range as he was approaching his SUV, where his three children were sitting. Officers had previously tried to tase Blake, but it was ineffective. Videos taken by bystanders appear to show Blake walking away from the officer to get into the driver's side of the SUV. Though it is not evident from the available bystander footage, Graveley claimed that Blake admitted to investigators that he was holding a knife. The shooting severed Blake's spinal cord, rendering him unable to walk.\n\nA daily email update of the stories you need to read right now.\n\n\"We are immensely disappointed in Kenosha District Attorney Michael Graveley's decision not to charge the officers involved in this horrific shooting,\" Blake's family lawyer, Ben Crump, said in a statement to NBC News. \"We feel this decision failed not only Jacob and his family, but the community that protested and demanded justice.\"\n\nWisconsin Gov. Tony Evers authorized the deployment of 500 troops from the Wisconsin National Guard on Monday in anticipation of the attorney general's announcement. The Kenosha City Council also unanimously approved an emergency declaration \"regarding potential civil unrest,\" which bestows the mayor with certain powers like setting a curfew. There were multiple days of protests after Blake's shooting in August, which followed the high-profile police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.\n\nTwo days after Sheskey shot Blake, then-17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse, whose lawyers claimed that he traveled from Illinois to Wisconsin to protect local businesses, allegedly shot three people with an assault-style rifle during the protests. Two of those people died, while the third was seriously wounded. Rittenhouse entered not guilty pleas in a Kenosha court on Tuesday to charges of first-degree intentional homicide, first-degree reckless homicide, and attempted first-degree intentional reckless homicide.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

In a video posted on YouTube, Sgt. Ron King apologized to the Martin family but insisted the target can be a valuable training tool. Port Canaveral Interim Chief Executive Officer John Walsh told local television Friday that King had been fired.

      "text": "The Pitiful Excuse Sheriffs Trot Out for Not Arresting White Shooters of Black Victims\n\nEarlier this month, Ajike Owens, a Black mother of four, was gunned down in Ocala, Fla. in front of her 9-year-old son by a white neighbor who shot her from behind a door and then claimed self-defense. It took four days for the shooter, 58-year-old Susan Lorincz, to finally be arrested amidst growing media attention and public outrage. If this sounds familiar, it's because to find a similar case, you only have to go back to April when unarmed teen, Ralph Yarl, was shot twice by 84-year-old Andrew Lester after ringing the doorbell of the Missouri home he thought his siblings were visiting. In that case, the shooter also wasn't charged with any crime for four whole days .\n\nWhile both cases spotlight the inequity of our justifiable use of force laws alongside our increasingly lax regulation of civilian firearm use, a critical element of the stories and others like them has gone largely underexplored. \"Stand Your Ground\" laws across the country are providing local law enforcement a handy excuse for hesitating to arrest white shooters whose targets are Black.\n\nAlthough both Lester and Lorincz claimed that they acted out of fear for their lives, invoking a right to \"stand their ground,\" compelling evidence suggests racist aggression played a role in each. And yet, in each case, it took several days for charges to be filed.\n\nCases like these point to a concerning pattern in rates of arrest following cases of allegedly \"self-defensive\" gun violence. Ralph Yarl's shooter, Andrew Lester, was detained and questioned the night of the shooting, but was able to return home without being charged.\n\nOcala Sheriff Billy Woods, the primary law enforcement figure handling Owens' shooting death, offered as a reason for the delayed arrest that Florida's \" Stand Your Ground \" law prevents police from making an immediate arrest if the shooter claims to have acted in fear for his or her life. Law enforcement will often follow this practice in cases with Black victims and white shooters, even in a case like Owen's, where the shooter's fear seems dubious. Owens and her children were outside Lorincz's locked door, and Lorincz could have called the police if she truly felt endangered.\n\nComparing other cases reveals a pattern of delayed arrests after unarmed Black people have been killed by armed white people. Arrest hesitancy among law enforcement seems most prevalent in states like Florida, with provisions that make law enforcement officers liable for \"wrongful arrests,\" i.e. the arrest of shooters whom courts determine used force lawfully. While facially neutral, the \"wrongful arrest\" provisions can result in preferential treatment for white shooters who target Black people and then claim to have been in fear for their life. Law enforcement often delay arrests in cases where they believe the shooter has a chance of eventual acquittal. In 2018, Markeis McGlockton's killer, Michael Drejka, remained free for almost a month. And George Zimmerman was not taken into custody until 44 days after he pursued and killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. (Zimmerman was controversially acquitted, while Drejka was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison.)\n\nFlorida's \"Stand Your Ground\" law is the first of its kind and has served as a model for other states. As such, its \"wrongful arrest\" provision sets a dangerous precedent. Law enforcement in other states that lack such a stipulation often hesitate in making arrests because of the improper perception that \"Stand Your Ground\" requires an impossible burden of proof.\n\nThe racial implications can be stark. Compare for instance two stories of deadly \"road rage\" from Louisiana (a \"Stand Your Ground\" state) in 2016. The first is the shooting of retired New Orleans Saints star Will Smith by Cardell Hayes. Both men are Black, and Hayes was immediately arrested. Although he claimed to have acted in self-defense, Hayes was convicted. He is now awaiting a retrial after that conviction was vacated due to the non-unanimous jury verdict. In the second instance, former NFL player, Joe McKnight was shot by Ronald Gasser. Gasser, a white man, also claimed he shot in self-defense, and Sheriff Newell Normand didn't arrest him for five whole days . Gasser's conviction was also overturned due to the non-unanimous jury verdict, but he ultimately pled guilty to manslaughter before a retrial could be held.\n\nWhile law enforcement personnel claim that their hands are tied or that some homicides are \"close calls,\" requiring myriads of proof to justify an arrest, there is evidence to suggest they often use these \"wrongful arrest\" provisions as a shield, a viable excuse for failure to act on behalf of Black victims. In the recent case of Ajike Owens, the sheriff claimed that he could not arrest Lorincz until he was certain there was probable cause. Lorincz was charged only after prominent civil rights attorney Ben Crump stepped up to represent Owens' bereaved family.\n\nThe hypocrisy of \"Stand Your Ground\" laws comes into even clearer focus when we consider similar cases where the demographics of the victim and the perpetrator are somewhat flipped. When women-especially Black or low income women-defend themselves against violent partners, spouses, or ex-spouses in \"Stand Your Ground\" states, they are generally charged right away without concern for police liability. In the cases of Marissa Alexander and Callie Adams , for instance, law enforcement did not hesitate to make arrests. Both women claimed to have used force in self-defense-fearful that their abusive spouses would harm or kill them-and were nevertheless arrested the same day as the incident. They were charged with homicide and prosecuted, and both were exonerated years later.\n\nThese cases further suggest that there is scant evidence that law enforcement is in any real danger of being sued for \"wrongful arrest.\" Rather, the \"Stand Your Ground\" stipulation provides a pitiful but oft-repeated excuse for not arresting aggressive, trigger-happy white people until media attention and public pressure intervene.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Jacob Blake Speaks Out for First Time Since Kenosha Police Shooting: \"It Hurts to Breathe\"\n\nJacob Blake, the Black man who was shot multiple times in the back by a white police officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin last month, spoke publicly about how he is doing for the first time, releasing a video from his hospital bed. In a video posted by one of his attorneys , Ben Crump, late on Saturday, Blake, who was dressed in a hospital gown, described how he is in constant pain from the shooting that doctors say could leave him paralyzed from the waist down. \"I got staples in my back, staples in my damn stomach,\" the 29-year-old says in the video. \"It hurts to breathe, it hurts to sleep, it hurts to move from side to side, it hurts to eat.\"\n\n#JacobBlake released this powerful video message from his hospital bed today, reminding everyone just how precious life is. #JusticeForJacobBlake pic.twitter.com/87CYlgPDBj\n\nDuring the 57-second video, Blake said \"there's a lot more life to live\" and warned that everyone needs to realize how quickly things can change. \"Your life and not only just your life, your legs ― something that you need to move around and move forward in life ― could be taken from you like this,\" Blake said while snapping his fingers. That realization should push people to change how they live their lives. \"Please, I'm telling you: Change y'all lives out there,\" he said. \"We can stick together, make some money, make everything easier for our people out here, man. Because so much time has been wasted.\"\n\nThe video marked the second-ever public appearance for Blake, whose shooting sparked widespread protests. Blake made his first public appearance on Friday when he appeared in court from his hospital bed. He was charged in July with third-degree sexual assault, which is a felony, as well as criminal trespass and disorderly conduct, which are misdemeanors. His attorney entered not guilty pleas on the three charges. Blake spoke briefly with the judge during the appearance on the charges that are unrelated to the August 23 shooting.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Protests Break Out After Police Admit Man Killed by Officer in Alabama Mall Wasn't Gunman\n\nDozens of protesters gathered at Riverchase Galleria in Hoover, Alabama , Saturday afternoon to call for a boycott and protest the officer-involved killing of a man at that mall on Thanksgiving night. On Thursday night, Hoover police shot and killed Emantic \"E.J.\" Bradford, thinking he was the one who shot and injured an 18-year-old man during an argument. A 12-year-old girl was also injured. Turns out, Bradford, 21, was likely not the shooter . Those who knew him immediately questioned the veracity of the police version of events saying that Bradford, who had enlisted in the U.S. Army, would not have shot anyone during an argument.\n\nBradford was at the mall but was fleeing the shooting like everyone else. And like many around him, he was brandishing a handgun. But now officers are increasingly convinced he likely was not the one who fired the shots that injured the 18- and 12-year-olds. \"Over the past 20 hours, the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office investigators and crime scene technicians have interviewed numerous individuals and examined several critical evidentiary items,'' Hoover police Capt. Gregg Rector said. \"New evidence now suggests that while Mr. Bradford may have been involved in some aspect of the altercation, he likely did not fire the rounds that injured the 18-year-old victim. \"\n\nBradford's family has retained Ben Crump, a national civil rights attorney . Crump has previously represented the family of Michael Brown, the 17-year-old who was shot and killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri, and the family of Trayvon Martin, who was killed in Florida by George Zimmerman.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nNew calls for police reform face old Democratic and Republican divisions in Congress.\n\nby Nicole Narea and Li Zhou\n\nThe release of footage on Friday of Memphis police violently beating Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man who died from his injuries three days later, has renewed calls to pass federal police reform. But with the House of Representatives now in Republican hands and a closely divided Senate, the prospect for any such reform remains unlikely.\n\nChief among the existing proposals is Democrats' George Floyd Justice in Policing Act , which passed the then-Democratic controlled House in 2021 without a single Republican vote, but failed in the Senate.\n\nBen Crump, a lawyer for the Nichols family, has publicly urged Congress to pass the bill, saying in an interview with CNN Sunday that he hoped Nichols's death would prove to be a turning point. Democrats have echoed that sentiment, either rallying behind that bill specifically or calling for further bipartisan negotiations in the hopes of reaching a compromise that has a chance of passing.\n\nBoth Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Tim Scott (R-SC), who led unsuccessful negotiations on a police reform package in 2021, seemed receptive to giving bipartisan talks another chance in statements Friday. Booker said that he would \"never stop working to build a broad coalition\" necessary to pass policing reform, and Scott said that Nichols's death should be a \"call to action for every lawmaker in our nation at every level.\" The Congressional Black Caucus has called , too, for both a meeting with President Joe Biden and a robust push for national criminal justice reforms.\n\nStill, many Republicans have expressed opposition to key reforms proposed by Democrats, including limitations on qualified immunity , which protects officers from certain lawsuits. Others dismissed the need for reform at the federal level at all. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), for instance, said in an interview with NBC that, \"Democrats always think that it's a new law that's going to fix something that terrible. We kind of think that ... no new law is going to do that.\"\n\nWhile a divided Congress, particularly one with a slim Democratic Senate majority, makes a bipartisan policing bill unlikely, new legislation isn't impossible: Tragedy has galvanized bipartisan action on divisive topics in the recent past.\n\nIn December, two years after George Floyd was killed by police, Congress passed a law that supports deescalation training for law enforcement officers dealing with individuals who have mental health issues. And after a gunman killed 19 children and two teachers at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, last year, Congress passed its first federal gun safety law in nearly three decades, making strides in preventing guns from falling into the hands of dangerous individuals.\n\nBoth of those bills fell far short of a panacea to the epidemics of violence they aimed to address, but they represented incremental progress. So far, however, further compromise on police reform has proved elusive.\n\nPolice reform has long been stalled in Congress for a simple reason: disagreements between Republicans and Democrats over how comprehensive such legislation should be. In 2020, in the wake of George Floyd's murder and massive protests of law enforcement and racism, both parties introduced their own versions of legislation.\n\nThe Democratic version, the aforementioned George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, would lower the legal standard by which law enforcement officers can face criminal prosecution for misconduct and limit their protection from civil liability under qualified immunity, as well as curb federal officers' ability to use force, no-knock warrants, chokeholds, and carotid holds. It would also establish new reporting requirements, a new national database on police misconduct, and national accreditation standards for law enforcement agencies under which officers would be trained on racial profiling, implicit bias, and their duty to intervene when another officer uses excessive force, among other provisions.\n\nRepublicans' bill - the JUSTICE Act - focused heavily on data collection about police use of force and more documentation of police misconduct, and was much narrower than Democrats' proposal.\n\nQualified immunity, in particular, has consistently been a major sticking point between the two parties, with Democrats determined to end such protections, and Republicans arguing that doing so would leave police officers too vulnerable to liability. Under existing law, qualified immunity makes it challenging to file civil suits against police officers for harms they've caused unless there was a prior case deeming those exact same harms illegal or unconstitutional. As a result, police officers have not been held accountable in multiple cases when they have killed people, caused serious injuries, and damaged property.\n\nOne compromise floated by Scott, though it never materialized in legislation, was the idea that instead of holding individual officers liable for harms, police departments would be held liable, in a way to take the pressure off individuals while still increasing accountability. Sen. Lindsey Graham, in a tweet this week , once again referenced this idea, noting that \"holding police departments accountable makes sense.\"\n\nBroadly, the federal government faces limitations when it comes to how much it can address policing practices, since most departments operate at the state and local level, and are governed by those laws. Those limits were reflected in some of the commonalities between the previous Democratic and Republican bills, both of which tried to use federal dollars to encourage policy changes the US government couldn't mandate. For instance, both conditioned grant money to state and local law enforcement agencies based on whether they eliminated chokeholds.\n\nOne other key area of overlap between the two bills was a requirement that regional agencies do a better job reporting use of force to the Justice Department. That could also be a starting point for new negotiations.\n\nBooker, Scott, and former Rep. Karen Bass (D-CA) - now mayor of Los Angeles - previously led negotiations in Congress on the legislation. In September 2021, talks on police reform collapsed due to the parties' differences. Those same divides remain, and given the current makeup of Congress, it's likely that any police reform that could advance would be much narrower and even tougher to pass.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nIt adds to a long and disturbing pattern of police violence toward Black Americans.\n\nby Li Zhou\n\nBody camera footage released this week offered a harrowing look at the police killing of Sonya Massey, a 36-year-old Black woman in Springfield, Illinois, and renewed scrutiny of the disproportionate violence Black Americans face at the hands of law enforcement.\n\nOn July 6, Massey was shot by a sheriff's deputy in her own home, after officers responded to her call about a potential prowler. Following checks of her backyard and surrounding area, at least two officers entered her home as part of their visit. Inside, one of them asks her to turn off her stove. While doing so, she picks up a pot of boiling water and the officers back away, noting that they want to distance themselves from it. She makes a comment about rebuking them \"in the name of Jesus,\" at which point one of them, Sean Grayson, shoots at her three times, including once fatally in the head.\n\nA grand jury has since indicted Grayson on three counts of first-degree murder, with some law enforcement experts questioning why he'd shoot Massey rather than pursue other alternative responses like adding more distance between them or using a taser.\n\nThe shooting also adds to a long history of police violence against Black Americans - and underscores how enduring the problem continues to be. In 2020, mass protests erupted across the US following the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, after an officer knelt on his neck for over nine minutes. Those followed extensive demonstrations in 2014 after Michael Brown, an unarmed teenager, was shot and killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri. Massey is also among a number of Black Americans who've been shot by police in their own homes, including Roger Fortson in Fort Walton Beach, Florida, and Atatiana Jefferson in Fort Worth, Texas.\n\nPolice arrived at Massey's home after she called 911 around 12:50 am on July 6, and proceeded to do a sweep around the house. They eventually tell her that they didn't find anyone in the area and appear prepared to leave, when video shows them entering her home. While speaking with Massey, they also ask her if she's doing okay mentally and she responds by saying, \"Yes, I took my medicine.\" Ben Crump, a civil rights attorney for Massey's family, has said she dealt with mental health struggles .\n\nIt's not immediately apparent why the officers then go into Massey's house, but video shows her looking for her ID. While they're inside, the officers realize the stove is on and urge Massey to turn it off. As she goes to do so, she moves the pot of boiling water that's on it, prompting the officers to back away.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" says Massey.\n\n\"Away from your hot, steaming water,\" says Grayson.\n\n\"Away from my hot, steaming water?,\" Massey asks, while holding the pot. \"I rebuke you in the name of Jesus.\"\n\n\"You better f****** not or I swear to God I'll f****** shoot you in your f****** face,\" says Grayson as he draws his gun.\n\nMassey then says \"I'm sorry,\" and ducks while raising the pot over her head, as Grayson shoots multiple times and fatally wounds her.\n\nAs his colleague moves to get a medical kit from their vehicle, Grayson comments, \"Nah, she's done. You can go get it but that's a headshot.\" He also states later, \"Yeah I'm good, this f******* b**** is crazy.\"\n\nLast week, a grand jury indicted Grayson on charges of first-degree murder, as well as aggravated battery with a firearm and misconduct, all of which he pleaded not guilty to. He's also been fired from the Sangamon County Sheriff's Department, which noted that \"it is clear that the deputy did not act as trained or in accordance with our standards.\"\n\nA state's attorney review of the incident similarly concluded that its analysis \"does not support a finding that ... Grayson was justified in his use of deadly force.\" State prosecutors also cited an expert who described the act as comparable to \"an officer intentionally and unnecessarily putting himself in front of a moving vehicle and then justifying use of force because of fear of being struck.\"\n\nHer family has said that Massey - a mother of two - was a \"ball of energy,\" and a \"loving person\" who was known for helping those around her. They also noted that they weren't initially told that the shooting had been committed by an officer and that there were early implications it was done by someone else.\n\nMassey's family are now calling for an investigation into the Sheriff's Department's hiring of Grayson, who has worked in six different law enforcement agencies in the last four years, and been charged twice with driving under the influence. According to an Intercept report , Grayson had also been discharged from the military due to misconduct.\n\nIn the wake of the indictment, prosecutors will continue to pursue the charges against Grayson in a case that could head to trial. He has been denied pretrial release.\n\nMassey's shooting highlights how pervasive police violence toward Black Americans still is, and the dearth of effective policies that have been passed to combat it.\n\nIn 2023, police killed more than 1,300 people, which was a new record, according to the organization Mapping Police Violence . That same data set found that Black people were almost three times more likely to be killed by police than white people.\n\nAttempts to advance police reforms have varied at the city, state, and federal levels, with places like San Francisco investing in crisis response teams that serve as an alternative, and states like Minnesota approving new use of force standards .\n\nBut any federal compromise on police reform - including attempts after Floyd's shooting in 2020 to end officers' protections from legal liability - has thus far faltered.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nHow can you punish Trump officials for violating the law, when federal law enforcement is controlled by Trump?\n\nHow America's opioid crisis became a foreign policy issue.\n\nHow we design prisons and where we choose to build them says a lot about what we think of the people on the inside.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch's \"ghost guns\" opinion is extremely narrow, but it is correct.\n\nThe justices are likely to give gun companies a win, but they aren't sure how they will do it yet.\n\nRichard Glossip had everything going for him in his Supreme Court hearing.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nFortson's shooting deepens longstanding scrutiny of police violence.\n\nby Li Zhou\n\nThe police killing of a Black Air Force service member in his own home is drawing renewed scrutiny to the deadly violence that US law enforcement routinely and disproportionately uses against Black Americans .\n\nOn May 3, an officer responded to a call about a domestic disturbance and knocked on the door of US airman Roger Fortson's apartment in Fort Walton Beach, Florida. Body camera footage shows Fortson, 23, opening the door and holding a handgun pointed downward. Within seconds of the door opening, and without asking him to drop his weapon, the officer fired multiple shots at Fortson's chest. Fortson later died of the gunshot injuries at a nearby hospital.\n\nThe body camera footage has raised new questions about the officer's use of fatal force and his reason for visiting Fortson's apartment in the first place. In an initial statement about the incident, the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Department claimed that the shooting was in self-defense , but it's since fired Eddie Duran, the deputy involved in the shooting, and described the use of force as \"not objectively reasonable.\" The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is also conducting an ongoing criminal investigation into the shooting, and Fortson's family has urged criminal charges as well.\n\nFortson's shooting is another harrowing episode in the long history of police violence against Black Americans. In 2020, mass protests erupted across the US following the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, after an officer knelt on his neck for over nine minutes. Those followed extensive demonstrations in 2014 after Michael Brown, an unarmed teenager, was shot and killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri. The police shooting of Fortson also echoes other cases when law enforcement has killed Black Americans in their homes, including the shooting of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nPolice violence has continued unabated in recent years as well, with 2023 seeing the most police killings in more than a decade. That year, Black people comprised 13 percent of the US population but accounted for 27 percent of those killed by police, according to Mapping Police Violence , a nonprofit tracking this information.\n\nThis intractable trend has criminal justice advocates concerned that the problem won't improve without substantial policy changes that lawmakers have yet to invest in.\n\nThe shooting occurred after an unidentified woman in Fortson's apartment complex called the police to report a domestic disturbance. In the body camera footage provided by the Okaloosa Sheriff's Department, a police officer (now known to be Duran) can be seen approaching the complex and talking to a woman on the premises about a couple reportedly fighting in one of the apartments.\n\nThe woman leads the officer to the area of the complex where she says she heard the fighting and gives him Fortson's unit number, 1401. The officer approaches Fortson's door and knocks on it without identifying himself. After not receiving a response, the officer knocks two more times and says twice, \"Sheriff's office, open the door.\"\n\nFortson then opens the door, holding a gun that is pointed at the ground. Almost immediately, the officer shoots Fortson multiple times and he falls down. At that point, the officer says, \"Drop the gun,\" and Fortson replies, \"It's over there. I don't have it.\" The officer calls for emergency medical services, and Fortson is taken to a nearby hospital, where he died from his injuries.\n\nAccording to Ben Crump, a civil rights attorney representing Fortson's family, Fortson's girlfriend was on FaceTime with him during the entire encounter. Per Crump, she said he was by himself in the apartment. Crump added that Fortson heard the initial knock from the officer and retrieved his gun because he couldn't see who the person was at the door. And Fortson's family has said that the gun was legally owned.\n\nIn a CNN interview , Crump notes that the woman at the apartment complex may have made a mistake and directed officers to the incorrect unit. Fortson's girlfriend has also released part of their FaceTime video, via Crump, which includes audio of the aftermath of the shooting and police checking the apartment for more people.\n\nA follow-up report indicated that police did not find anyone else in the unit.\n\nThe body camera footage has also spurred concerns from advocates and his family about why the officer shot Fortson so quickly and before asking him to drop his weapon.\n\n\"It is very troubling that the deputy gave no verbal commands and shot multiple times within a split second of the door being opened, killing Roger,\" Fortson's family said via a statement from Crump . \"As the officer didn't tell Roger to drop the weapon before shooting, was the officer trained to give verbal warnings? Did the officer try to initiate life-saving measures? Was the officer trained to deal with law-abiding citizens who are registered gun owners?\"\n\nFortson's family has emphasized how dedicated he was to his work in the Air Force, how committed he was to his siblings, and how he hoped to one day buy his mother a home. \"He was fighting for everybody,\" his mother, Chantemekki Fortson, said.\n\nFortson's shooting adds to the fatal violence that Black Americans have experienced at the hands of police.\n\nA 2020 study from the Harvard School of Public Health found that Black people were more than three times as likely to be killed by police during an encounter than white people were. Last year, the fatal police beating of Tyre Nichols in Memphis and a deadly police shooting of Ta'Kiya Young in Blendon Township, Ohio, were two high-profile examples of this persistent trend.\n\nFortson also joins the tragic list of Black Americans killed by police in their own homes. These incidents include the fatal shooting of Botham Jean in 2018 by a police officer who entered the wrong apartment thinking it was her own and the police killing of Atatiana Jefferson in 2019, when officers thought she was an intruder in her own house.\n\nThese killings point to enduring institutional problems with policing that experts say will take much deeper systemic reforms to resolve than the policies that have been put forth since the 2020 mass protests.\n\nIn the wake of those demonstrations, certain cities have cut police budgets , and some states have approved reforms to better standardize reporting of law enforcement use of force. Police are still empowered, however, to use lethal force in many cases that do not require it, says Daniela Gilbert, a director of redefining public safety at the Vera Institute of Justice. And legal accountability and transparency regarding police misconduct are still lacking.\n\n\"It's bad and it's sad, but it's not shocking that we're still being killed at a higher rate,\" Karundi Williams, CEO of re:power, a group dedicated to training Black political leaders, told NBC News in 2022 . \"When we have moments of racial injustice that is thrust in the national spotlight, there is an uptick of outrage, and people take to the streets.\"\n\n\"But then the media tends to move on to other things, and that consciousness decreases,\" she continued. \"But we never really got underneath the problem.\"\n\nUpdate, June 4, 11: 25 am ET : This story was originally published on May 10 and has been updated to include information about the firing of the officer involved in the shooting.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe Bruen decision upended America's gun laws.

Following days of protest and outrage, Clay County Prosecutor Zack Thompson formally charged 84-year-old Andrew Lester with two felonies related to the shooting.\n\nLester, a white man, shot Yarl twice, once in the head and once in the arm, after the teenager rang his doorbell. Yarl was hospitalized with life-threatening wounds, underwent surgery, and is expected to make a full recovery. Lester turned himself in to police on Tuesday, and was released after paying a $200,000 bond. He was arraigned on Wednesday and pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn the days since Yarl's shooting, Kansas City residents and protesters have questioned whether the act was racially motivated and why law enforcement didn't act more quickly to press charges. While the shooting occurred on Thursday evening, prosecutors didn't file charges until days later on Monday. Shortly after announcing the charges, Thompson stated, \"There was a racial component to the case,\" though he did not elaborate further.\n\nLester faces one count of first-degree assault and one count of armed criminal action. Thompson said those charges were chosen due to the severity of their penalties: First-degree assault comes with a sentence between 10 and 30 years, or life in prison, and armed criminal action comes with a sentence between three and 15 years. He has faced questions about why this isn't being charged as a hate crime, and answered by saying that that charge would come with a lower sentence.\n\nThe shooting occurred as scrutiny of violence against Black Americans has grown following numerous killings and brutality toward Black people at the hands of police and other individuals. Frustration has also built in the wake of new attention to how the justice system has dealt with violence toward Black people in the past, with perpetrators often facing minimal or no consequences. This incident reignites scrutiny of ways the criminal justice system has treated such cases, and of Missouri's stand-your-ground law, which Lester could attempt to use in his defense .\n\nThe shooting has led to \"unimaginable\" trauma for Yarl, his aunt Faith Spoonmore noted in a GoFundMe post .\n\nHe is \"able to communicate mostly when he feels like it, but mostly he just sits there and stares and the buckets of tears just roll down his eyes,\" Yarl's mother, Cleo Nagbe, said in an interview with CBS This Morning . \"You can see that he is just replaying the situation over and over again, and that just doesn't stop my tears either.\"\n\nYarl's attorneys, prominent civil rights lawyers Ben Crump and Lee Merritt, called prosecutors' decision a \"step in the right direction,\" but noted they would \"continue to fight for Ralph while he works toward a full recovery.\" A junior in high school, Yarl is known for his love of music and engineering. He plays the bass clarinet in his school band, competes on the science olympiad team, and hopes to go to Texas A&M to study chemical engineering, Spoonmore says.\n\n\"Life looks a lot different right now,\" Spoonmore writes on a GoFundMe page. \"Even though he is doing well physically, he has a long road ahead mentally and emotionally.\"\n\nThe shooting took place last Thursday in Kansas City's Northland neighborhood. Yarl was asked to pick up his twin brothers from a friend's house, but accidentally went to 115th Street instead of 115th Terrace, which was just a block away.\n\nAccording to Spoonmore's post, the homeowner opened the door after Yarl rang the doorbell and then shot him in the head. After Yarl fell to the ground, the homeowner shot him again. Early evidence indicates that Lester shot Yarl through a glass door, with a handgun, Thompson said. Lester's home has two doors, including an interior main door and a glass exterior storm door. In the probable cause statement, Lester said he brought his handgun with him when he went to answer the doorbell and open the main door. After opening the main door , Lester claimed he saw the teen put his hand on the exterior door handle and said he believed Yarl was trying to break in. Yarl said in his statement to police that he did not pull on the door.\n\nLester claimed that he was \"scared to death\" given Yarl's size, and shot him to protect himself from a physical confrontation. Merritt, Yarl's attorney, noted at a rally this week that the teen isn't extraordinarily tall: \"The question is, at 5-8 and 140 pounds, what did Andrew Lester look out and see?\" Merritt asked. \"And the answer is he saw a Black person. And for him, that was enough justification.\"\n\nThompson noted that Yarl did not cross the threshold of the front door prior to the shooting. After he was shot, Spoonmore says Yarl sought help from neighboring houses and had to go to three places before finding someone who came to his aid .\n\nPolice said they responded to a call about Yarl's injuries around 10 pm local time on Thursday. They said then that Yarl experienced a life-threatening injury but was in stable condition. Sunday, Yarl left the hospital and is set to continue his recovery at home.\n\nHundreds of people gathered in Kansas City to protest over weekend, demonstrating to support Yarl and to call for prosecutors to pursue charges against the shooter. \"I realize that justice doesn't come overnight, but that fact that there is a kid in the hospital and everything I read says not even a charge has been done, that concerns me,\" Karen Allman, a neighborhood resident, told the local news network KSHB .\n\nPolice held Lester for a few hours after the shooting, but released him because they said they didn't yet have enough evidence for prosecutors to file charges. Monday, the department referred the case to Thompson's office, and he filed charges shortly after.\n\nYarl's shooting immediately spurred concerns about possible racial motivations in the attack, and also raised questions of whether implicit biases have affected the way law enforcement has treated the case.\n\n\"How do you protect a Black kid?\" Yarl family friend Patience Gaye told the Kansas City Star . \"We left our countries because we don't want to be killed. That's why we left. They came to America for a better life. How is this a better life?\" According to the Star , Yarl's parents immigrated to the US in order to flee violence in Liberia.\n\nThe shooting has taken place following police killings of Black men and boys, including 29-year-old Tyre Nichols in Memphis and 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Cleveland, as well as the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black jogger, by two white men in Georgia.\n\nCivil rights advocates believe the investigations in a number of these cases were slow-walked due to systemic racism, and some feared that was happening again with Yarl. In Arbery's case, for example, local officials did not arrest the two attackers for weeks, and the investigation cycled through multiple prosecutors . Ultimately, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation had to take over the case. Additionally, Georgia Attorney General Christopher Carr wound up requesting a federal DOJ investigation of local prosecutors' handling of their investigations. Arbery's killers were indicted on murder charges four months after he died.\n\nYarl's case is also unfolding amid a nationwide conversation about the ubiquity of guns and the relatively lax gun laws many states have. Missouri is one of more than 30 state s with a stand-your-ground law, under which a \"would-be shooter defending life or property does not have to retreat before taking violent action,\" according to NBC News . It's possible that Lester could use try to invoke this law as part of his defense, Forbes reports .\n\nOxford University researcher Michelle Degli Esposti has previously found links between the passage of state-level stand-your-ground laws and increased homicides. Between 1999 and 2017, the time frame that Esposti studied, Missouri in particular was one of the places with the highest increase in gun homicides after the passage of a stand-your-ground law. In that period, gun homicides increased 31 percent in the state. A stand-your-ground law also complicated the investigation of Arbery's case and was referenced to the jury reviewing the killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in 2012.\n\nThe recent spike in gun violence has spurred a push to reevaluate gun laws in different states , a conversation that Yarl's shooting could add to as well.\n\nUpdate, April 19, 3:30 pm ET: This story was originally published on April 17 and has been updated to include comments from Yarl's family and attorney.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch's \"ghost guns\" opinion is extremely narrow, but it is correct.\n\nThe justices are likely to give gun companies a win, but they aren't sure how they will do it yet.\n\nGood luck trying to win a suit against the gun industry in this Supreme Court.\n\nLuigi Mangione was charged with murdering a health care CEO. The internet responded with a flood of support.\n\nThe killing of the UnitedHealthcare CEO may be the first time a \"ghost gun\" was used in a high-profile shooting.\n\nThe justices appear skeptical of \"ghost guns.\"\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nTaking a new look at one of the most commonly adopted police reforms in the country.\n\nby Rachel Cohen\n\nNot even the Memphis police chief could dismiss the video footage of 29-year-old Tyre Nichols being fatally beaten by cops in early January. On the day before its public release, police chief Cerelyn Davis declared the attack \"heinous, reckless and inhumane.\"\n\nFriday night, the rest of the country saw what she meant. Officials released four videos - three from officers' body cameras and one from SkyCop surveillance footage - that showed Memphis police punching, kicking, and clubbing Nichols, who did not fight back. The videos showed Nichols crying out for his mom, captured a police officer saying, \"I hope they stomp his ass,\" and showed that it took over 25 minutes for him to receive medical attention. The Shelby County district attorney ultimately brought charges including murder, assault, and kidnapping against the five police responsible.\n\nMemphis has nominally implemented police reforms over the past few years, including 2,000 body-worn cameras for police, which the city started rolling out in 2016 .\n\nBody cameras, which UK officers began experimenting with in 2005, took off rapidly in the United States in the 2010s, following several high-profile police shootings that garnered viral national attention from footage that citizens recorded on their cellphones. When a grand jury declined in 2014 to indict the police officer who killed Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, Brown's family asked the nation to join them \"in our campaign to ensure that every police officer working the streets in this country wears a body camera.\"\n\nPresident Obama's Justice Department accelerated the deployment of body-worn cameras with a $23 million pilot program , and his Task Force on 21st Century Policing highlighted police-worn body cameras as one potential tool for improving community trust, albeit a costly one that came with privacy trade-offs. The camera programs were broadly popular with the public , and with police officers .\n\nBy 2016, nearly half of US law enforcement agencies - including in Memphis - had started to implement body camera programs, and today seven states have laws requiring officers to wear them. Yet while body-worn cameras have represented a widely adopted reform, it's hard to find much evidence that they've substantially improved community trust.\n\nThe escalation of police violence broadly has led some activists to lose faith in body cameras as a meaningful tool, particularly as deeper issues that afflict American policing remain unaddressed. Policies governing their use and access to footage also vary greatly, as does enforcement of those rules. So far, the best evidence we have suggests they have led to less use of force and provided more tools for holding rogue cops accountable - but, like most reforms, how they're used matters.\n\nPart of the confusion surrounding the question of whether police body cameras \"work\" stems from disagreements about what the technology was supposed to do in the first place.\n\nSome activists hoped to see the cameras reduce or prevent police violence, bring more accountability for unethical officers, and boost community relations. By contrast, according to a 2018 federal Bureau of Justice Statistics survey , just 34 percent of local police and sheriffs' offices say they acquired body-worn cameras to reduce use of force, and only 57 percent said the goal was to improve community perceptions. The top reasons agencies cited (about 80 percent each) were to \"improve officer safety, increase evidence quality, reduce civilian complaints, and reduce agency liability.\"\n\nSeventy-three percent said they hoped body cameras would improve accountability - though this figure includes officers looking to limit what they consider unfair complaints from the public, too.\n\nA growing body of research has aimed to test whether police body cameras have delivered on these various objectives.\n\nIn the beginning, there were just a handful of studies, which made it difficult to draw any clear conclusions. One influential randomized controlled trial from 2012 on the Rialto, California, police department showed a 59 percent reduction in police use of force among officers wearing the cameras, and an 88 percent decline in citizens filing complaints. The Rialto department is relatively small, though, and researchers cautioned against drawing overly broad conclusions from their findings.\n\nAs the decade stretched on, more studies emerged that painted a blurrier picture. For example, a 2017 randomized controlled trial involving more than 2,000 police officers in Washington, DC, found officers who wore cameras used force at about the same rate as officers who did not. While the researchers concluded that using body cameras led to a 9 percent increase in use of force, the study's confidence interval was large - meaning that the results actually showed anything ranging from a 12 percent reduction to a 30 percent increase.\n\nA randomized controlled trial with the Milwaukee Police Department in 2018 found that police wearing body cameras conducted fewer stops and were less likely to receive citizen complaints, but used force no differently than their colleagues not wearing cameras. Meanwhile, a separate RCT conducted with the Las Vegas Police Department , also in 2018, found significant reductions in use of force among officers wearing cameras compared to those not wearing them.\n\nIn 2020, an influential meta-analysis that combined the top existing studies came to a careful conclusion, if a disappointing one for those who hoped at last for clarity: There \"remains substantial uncertainty\" about whether body cameras can reduce officer use of force, though the researchers acknowledged the variation in effects they observed \"suggests there may be conditions in which [cameras] could be effective.\" The meta-analysis also concluded that the body cameras \"do not seem to affect other police and citizen behaviors in a consistent manner, including officers' ... arrest behaviors, dispatched calls for service, or assaults and resistance against police officers.\"\n\nWhile the meta-analysis concluded that body cameras can reduce citizen complaints, as researchers saw in Rialto and Milwaukee, the review emphasized that it's not clear if that's because police were behaving better or if citizens simply reported fewer concerns, perhaps because they assumed body camera footage would be sufficient for accountability. All this back-and-forth sparked many news stories that the research is mixed and no real conclusions can be drawn - although it's rare on any policy question for studies to reach a single, unanimous conclusion.\n\nHowever, in 2021, researchers got a bit closer to some clarity.\n\nThat year, economists with the University of Chicago Crime Lab and the Council on Criminal Justice updated the 2020 meta-analysis with two more recent experiments they deemed high-quality. Adding the new data led them to conclude that, on average, police body cameras had reduced use of force in fatal and non-fatal encounters by nearly 10 percent , a significantly higher rate than what the other researchers in 2020 found, and they reached their newer estimate with a smaller confidence interval.\n\nThe researchers stressed that body cameras are clearly no magic solution, but said their findings provide firmer evidence to support the idea that the technology can meaningfully change policing outcomes, and are justified financially from a cost-benefit perspective. Still, more studies are needed to dig further into these questions, particularly to clarify what sorts of policies and enforcement mechanisms drive real success.\n\nChristopher Brown, a lawyer who has brought cases against police for excessive force, said body-worn camera footage has been essential for attorneys like him to get any justice in court.\n\nIn 2013, Wayne Jones, a 50-year-old Black man with schizophrenia, was tasered, beaten, and shot 22 times by police officers in Martinsburg, West Virginia. After Jones died, his family sued the city and police, but the case was dismissed three times, with a district court judge finding the officers were protected by a controversial legal shield for government officials known as qualified immunity .\n\nBrown represented Jones's family in appealing this lawsuit, and in 2020, the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit issued a powerful verdict , saying Jones's case could proceed to trial. \"Although we recognize that our police officers are often asked to make split second decisions, we expect them to do so with respect for the dignity and worth of black lives,\" the Fourth Circuit judge wrote.\n\n\"Without the body cam footage, we simply would have lost that case,\" Brown told me. \"The officers all circled the wagon, saying that my client was fighting back, struggling, wouldn't listen to commands. The video contradicts that, and shows he was not moving.\" The family reached a $3.5 million settlement with Martinsburg following a seven-year legal fight.\n\nOf the few convictions of officers that have occurred in recent years, nearly all involved body camera or surveillance footage.\n\nIn 2018, a police officer in Texas was convicted of killing 15-year-old Jordan Edwards, in a case where body cam footage that contradicted the officer's narrative played an influential role. A year later, an officer in Chicago was convicted of murdering Laquan McDonald , after dash-cam video showed McDonald walking away from the officers, despite an officer previously claiming McDonald had approached him with a knife.\n\nBody cam footage was used extensively during the 2021 trial of the Minneapolis police officer convicted of murdering George Floyd, and in December 2022, two Washington, DC, officers were convicted of murdering Karon Hylton-Brown, following body camera footage released by the police department .\n\n\"Without footage, it's nearly impossible to break the 'blue wall,'\" said Brown, referring to an unofficial code of silence police take to protect one another against brutality charges.\n\nYet only about 14 percent of fatal police shooting incidents since 2015 have had body camera footage available at all, according to a national database compiled by the Washington Post.\n\nFootage also doesn't always result in justice, and rarely even in charges . Just 21 police officers in the US were charged in 2021 with murder or manslaughter from an on-duty shooting. That's a record high, according to an academic database that's tracked such incidents since 2005, but each year police kill about 1,000 people nationwide .\n\nSome racial justice advocates warn about the darker side of collecting body camera footage - as video evidence then used to prosecute civilians. A 2016 George Mason University study found that 92.6 percent of prosecutors' offices nationally in jurisdictions where police wear body cameras have used that footage as evidence in cases against private citizens. The researchers also found prosecutors generally did not expect body-worn cameras would meaningfully increase trust between citizens and police.\n\nPart of the confusion over the efficacy of body-worn cameras has stemmed from a wide range of police department policies , which can give officers immense discretion in when their cameras are actually capturing footage. There have also been countless reports of officers simply violating their department's body camera policies, like turning off their cameras in situations when they should clearly be recording.\n\nSometimes this sparks tougher enforcement and diminished discretion in the future for officers. Sometimes it ends with no consequence at all.\n\nLegitimate risks remain around surveillance , and around transparency regarding where the body camera footage is stored and how it might be shared with third parties. Other scandals include officers \"acting and directing\" with their body cameras. In 2017, the public learned Baltimore cops had manipulated their cameras to plant fake evidence against a man to arrest him. In Florida in 2014, police released body camera footage that seemed to corroborate their account of events, yet a surveillance camera from a nearby building showed video evidence that contradicted the police and their doctored footage.\n\nWhether a camera program is effective at achieving its goals and viewed by the public as a credible tool, researchers are learning, can often depend on whether the technology is required to be turned on, whether individual officers can review the footage before giving their statements, and whether the people involved in an incident or the public can watch the videos in a timely manner.\n\nIndeed, over the past decade, accessing recorded footage has been very difficult for individuals in some situations. In 2019, a civilian review watchdog said that the New York Police Department failed to provide body camera footage for police misconduct investigations in 40 percent of its requests . In Texas, the Dallas Morning News had to fight for three years to obtain body camera footage of the police officers who killed 32-year-old Tony Timpa in 2016.\n\nThe quick release of body camera footage in Memphis is unusual, and reflects what some experts are saying is a broader shift in how incidents of police violence are being handled.\n\nPolice departments have historically fought to keep damning footage private, and in cases where they have released videos, it's often begrudgingly after months or years of legal wrangling. It took 13 months and a court order for Chicago to release the footage of a police officer firing 16 bullets at Laquan McDonald. In Memphis, too, it took more than two years before the public could see police body camera footage of the 2018 shooting of 25-year-old Martavious Banks.\n\nBut more elected officials now say police chiefs are recognizing that this kind of secrecy will only undermine their agency's credibility and effectiveness. In other cases, local governments are stepping up to craft clearer rules around disclosure. The DC City Council, for example, passed a law during the pandemic standardizing rules for the local police department to release footage. Prior to that law, DC police would simply deny or ignore video requests .\n\nWith Nichols, unlike Banks, Memphis police voluntarily released the footage within three weeks of the incident. And Davis, the police chief, emphasized the importance of not letting the involved officers review the footage prior to giving their official statements - an acknowledgment that this can lead to doctored narratives. Some have asked, though, if the fact that all five officers charged are Black played a role in the stronger enforcement of policies.\n\nBen Crump, an attorney representing Nichols's family, addressed this point while applauding the speedy release of the video. \"We want to proclaim that this is the blueprint going forward for any time any officers, whether they be Black or white, will be held accountable,\" Crump said. \"No longer can you tell us we got to wait six months to a year.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

They also were found to have violated departmental policies regarding excessive force, duty to intervene, and duty to render aid.\n\nAll five former Memphis police officers charged in the death of Nichols pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder charges during their arraignment Friday, per the New York Times . All officers are out on bond, and their next court date is set for May 1, the Associated Press reported .\n\nShelby County District Attorney Steve Mulroy had previously announced that each would face charges of \"second-degree murder, aggravated assault, two charges of aggravated kidnapping, two charges of official misconduct, and one charge of official oppression.\" They could each face up to 60 years in prison for the murder charges alone.\n\nTwo Memphis Fire Department workers who were involved in Nichols's initial care have been \" relieved of duty ,\" according to the department. It's not clear whether they could also face charges.\n\nThe US attorney for the Western District of Tennessee also announced that there is an open civil rights investigation into Nichols's death, which could result in federal criminal charges.\n\nPolice stopped Nichols for reckless driving on January 7. Memphis's police chief later told CNN that investigators have \"been unable to substantiate\" the claim that Nichols was driving recklessly, however. Nichols expressed confusion about the stop, saying in the footage that he was \"just trying to go home.\"\n\nThe officers who initially stopped him responded by threatening to \"knock your ass the fuck out,\" and to break his bones. Nichols fled from the stop; once he was caught, those threats were carried out. Officers encircled Nichols, and repeatedly punched, kicked, and hit him with a baton - sometimes while he was restrained on the ground.\n\nHe was taken to a hospital after his arrest, where he died three days later of injuries sustained in the beating.\n\nIt's not the first time that police have turned a traffic stop into a deadly altercation . Deaths like Nichols's are all too common, especially for Black Americans, who nearly every available study shows are stopped more often than white Americans .\n\nAs Lauren Bonds, the executive director of the National Police Accountability Project, told Vox in an interview in January, \"so many of the high-profile police killings that we've seen in recent years have started out as a traffic stop - started out as an expired tag, reckless driving, fines or warrants due.\"\n\n\"One thing I'd say about the murder of Tyre in particular is that these officers were all part of a specific unit that was essentially designed to engage in, more or less, broken-windows policing, enforcing low-level offenses in order to identify higher-level crimes,\" Bonds said.\n\nThe unit that Bonds referred to is called SCORPION, or the Street Crimes Operation to Restore Peace in Our Neighborhoods; it was founded in 2021, ostensibly to address violent street crime in Memphis by flooding high-crime areas with officers from the hand-picked special unit. In 2021, according to the New York Times , Memphis had 346 homicides; in September, the city was on edge after a teacher was abducted and murdered, and days later a gunman shot and killed four people.\n\nOfficers from the SCORPION Unit - 40 in total, according to the Washington Post - were trained to use routine traffic stops as opportunities to find and arrest people for more serious offenses.\n\nAccording to Amber Sherman, an organizer with the official Black Lives Matter Memphis chapter , the high-crime areas the SCORPION unit was supposed to patrol \"realistically are highly impoverished.\" Local authorities, she told Vox in January, \"refuse to provide adequate resources to those areas and use it as an excuse to traumatize us and brutalize us, and in this case, murder us.\"\n\nAdditionally, Ben Crump, an attorney for Nichols's family, indicated the unit has had previous issues with excessive use of force. \"We believe that this was a pattern and practice and that Tyre is dead because this pattern and practice went unchecked,\" Crump said, according to the Washington Post .\n\nOn January 28, the Memphis Police Department announced that it had disbanded its SCORPION unit, which had previously been suspended after Nichols was beaten by officers in the unit.\n\n\"I think it's a step in the right direction - that was one of our key demands, and we were glad to have that answered, but we want to make sure that the full demands are answered,\" Sherman said of the unit's dissolution. \"The use of these rogue task force units is one of the key ways that we're over-criminalizing Black people.\"\n\nThe fact that both Nichols and the officers accused of his murder are Black isn't unusual, either in Memphis or in other incidents of police brutality. Memphis is \"a pretty Black city,\" Bonds told Vox; both the city and its police department are majority Black, and the department is led by a Black chief of police.\n\nUltimately, Bonds said, the race of those carrying out the violence is incidental.\n\n\"It's systemic, and it's ultimately state violence, which doesn't really have a color except for the color of the people who are in power in this country,\" she said. \"So to say that there are no racial implications because there's a Black victim and Black officers involved is a really myopic way of looking at the problem.\"\n\nComprehensive data on police brutality is lacking, particularly when it comes to looking at violence other than shootings and information broken out by race, William Sousa, a professor of criminal justice at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, told the Los Angeles Times . But available information indicates there hasn't been meaningful change in police violence since the murder of George Floyd by former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in 2020.\n\nStill, Bonds noted, prosecutors are more likely to bring cases against police officers involved in civilian killings since Floyd's murder, which sparked a national protest movement , and there have been recent high-profile convictions, like Chauvin's .\n\nBlack Americans are often taught - at home, through personal experience, and by the news - to see encounters with police, particularly traffic stops, as dangerous, if not potentially fatal.\n\nThe deaths of Americans like Nichols, or Daunte Wright , Sandra Bland, and Rayshard Brooks , validate that teaching. But it's not just Black civilians who learn to fear traffic stops. As University of Arizona law professor Jordan Blair Woods wrote for the Michigan Law Review , police are taught to view stops as dangerous as well - not for those they're stopping, but for themselves and their colleagues.\n\n\"Police academies regularly show officer trainees videos of the most extreme cases of violence against officers during routine traffic stops in order to stress that mundane police work can quickly turn into a deadly situation if they become complacent on the scene or hesitate to use force,\" Woods wrote.\n\nThat training belies the fact that police officers are rarely injured in traffic stops. In Woods's analysis of Florida traffic stop data from 2005 to 2014, the professor finds police had a 1 in 6.5 million chance of being killed during a traffic stop, and a 1 in 361,111 chance of being seriously injured. Overall, more than 98 percent of stops saw zero or minor injury to officers.\n\nData in other states mirrors Woods's findings. In their book Suspect Citizens , UNC political science professor Frank Baumgartner, University of Texas government professor Derek A. Epp, and University of South Carolina political science professor Kelsey Shoub found that North Carolina \"officers encountered violence about 24,000 times, or just over once per 1,000 stops.\" When someone was injured at a stop, it was usually the person being stopped, the authors found.\n\nComplicating matters for Black individuals is that the data suggests they're stopped more often than white people - in some localities, by a large margin. The Stanford Open Policing Project , a database of more than 200 million traffic stops, found that in St. Paul, Black drivers are a little over three times more likely than white drivers to be pulled over; in San Jose, California, Black drivers are six times more likely to be stopped.\n\nArguably, drivers of all races ought to be stopped at about the same rate - anyone of any race or gender could engage in the reckless driving Nichols was allegedly stopped for. This has led to a number of researchers trying to understand the disparity in who is stopped. In general, their results suggest that the issue has to do with officer bias, conscious or unconscious, that casts Black people as inherently more dangerous than their white counterparts.\n\nTied to this idea is the question of what stops are for. As a group of University of North Carolina Chapel Hill and Dartmouth College researchers led by Baumgartner wrote in a 2017 paper , in many departments, traffic stops are meant to serve a dual purpose: to deter illegal behavior and as a chance for officers to investigative past or potential crimes. In many ways, this system is akin to stop-and-frisk, a practice most prominently used in New York City that was meant to uncover criminal behavior through street searches. The program was ruled unconstitutional.\n\nAs Baumgartner wrote, \"officers are trained to use traffic stops as a general enforcement strategy aimed at reducing violent crime or drug trafficking. When officers are serving these broader goals, they are making an investigatory stop, and these stops have little (if anything) to do with traffic safety and everything to do with who looks suspicious.\"\n\nIf Black drivers are seen as more suspicious and police are trained to view traffic stops as dangerous in general, this creates a serious problem. When a Black driver is stopped, the interaction is more likely to begin with the officer even more on guard for trouble than they might otherwise be.\n\nThis can lead to the kind of rapid escalation seen in Nichols's case, in which officers ended the stop through violence. Some officers favor beginning with violence, perhaps out of fear, like during the encounter that ended George Floyd's life. Body camera footage released during Chauvin's trial, for example, shows an officer drawing his weapon shortly after approaching Floyd's vehicle and yelling at him to \"Put your fucking hands up right now.\"\n\nThese tactics, as well as the fear and bias that fuel them, put Black drivers in mortal danger. Law enforcement representatives have argued the stops are necessary - \"we find drugs, evidence of other crimes ... it's a very valuable tool,\" Kevin Lawrence, the Texas Municipal Police Association's executive director, told the Pew Charitable Trusts in 2020 - but those discoveries are rare. Nationally, about 4 percent of stops resulted in searches or arrests in 2015, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics .\n\nThis has a number of activists and elected officials questioning whether the risks traffic stops pose to drivers - particularly Black drivers - are worth such a small number of arrests.\n\nPoliticians both on the national and local levels have expressed sadness and outrage over Nichols's death. President Joe Biden called Nichols's mother, RowVaughn Wells, and his stepfather, Rodney Wells, to express his condolences, and Vice President Kamala Harris urged Congress in a statement to \"act with urgency and pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. To truly honor Tyre Nichols's memory, and the memory of so many others before him, we must demand that our justice system lives up to its name.\"\n\nA version of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act passed the House in 2021 before dying in the Senate; the bill would have ended qualified immunity for police officers, among a raft of other reforms.\n\nCrump, one of the attorneys for Nichols's family, put out a statement in January calling for better data on police use of force in SCORPION and similar special units, insisting on \"reform, transparency, and better oversight of these 'saturation' units, or for their removal as a tactic in American policing.\"\n\nHe also called for the introduction of \"Tyre's Law,\" which would create a \"duty to intervene\" for police who witness crimes being committed .\n\nSome police departments have also taken steps to address inequitable and sometimes deadly traffic stops. Berkeley , California, for instance, approved a plan in 2021 to prohibit officers from conducting traffic stops for violations that have nothing to do with safety; Oakland has a similar policy in place. Other places , including Montgomery County, Maryland , and Cambridge, Massachusetts , have contemplated such measures as well. Washington, DC , stripped its police department of some of its authority to regulate traffic laws in 2019, empowering its transportation department to do enforcement instead. New York's attorney general has recommended New York City make a similar change, and in 2022, New York City police announced they'd no longer use stops to randomly check for open warrants.\n\nThe long-term effectiveness of such measures remains to be seen. But they represent a small step away from the kind of policing that left Nichols, and so many before him, dead.\n\nUpdate, February 17, 2:05 pm: This story was originally published on January 27 and has been updated with the not-guilty pleas of the five officers charged with Nichols' killing, and information from released video footage and the death of Nichols.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

      "text": "What to expect at the Derek Chauvin murder trial\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nA guide to the jurors, charges, and defense strategy in the trial of the former officer charged with killing George Floyd.\n\nby Rachel Ramirez\n\nThe quest to seat the jury in the high-profile murder trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has reached its end.\n\nIn the last two weeks of the televised jury selection process, viewers got a sense of how the judge, defense attorney, prosecutors, and jury would perform when the trial starts Monday.\n\nSelecting 15 unbiased jurors was a challenge in itself - the killing of George Floyd is world-renowned. The 46-year-old Black man died in Minneapolis last May after being handcuffed and pinned to the ground for nearly nine minutes by Chauvin. Video of the incident - with Floyd pleading, \"I can't breathe\" and bystanders calling on Chauvin to give him some air - spread around the globe and sparked thousands of protests calling for police accountability and racial justice. It seemed an impossible task to find jurors who didn't come with strong preconceived notions regarding a case that has been highly publicized for almost a year.\n\nChauvin - who, along with the three other officers involved, was immediately fired following the incident - has been charged with second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter. Eric Nelson, the lead defense attorney, will argue that Floyd did not die because of Chauvin's knee on his neck. He also told a potential juror during the jury selection process that the trial is \"not about race.\" However, his line of questioning for prospective jurors suggested otherwise, asking them their views on racism, policing in communities of color, and the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nMeanwhile, the prosecution will have to prove that Chauvin's actions during the arrest ultimately caused Floyd's death. And because prosecutors believe it is a race-sensitive case, they struck out prospective white jurors who expressed police-friendly views or who had negative thoughts about the Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\"it's obviously about race,\" said D.A. Bullock, an organizer with Reclaim the Block , a Minneapolis grassroots group calling to divert funds from police departments to community resources. \"Given the history of white police officers not being charged in the killing of many unarmed Black men, it's clear that the justice system is not blind to race. It comes with inherent biases that work against us Black people.\"\n\nAbout a week into the jury selection, the city of Minneapolis agreed to settle a historic $27 million with the Floyd family over a wrongful death lawsuit. Because of this, Nelson asked to delay the trial and for a change of venue, arguing that the timing would prejudice the jury. Several potential jurors were dismissed after bringing up that their views were swayed by the settlement. Hennepin County District Court Judge Peter Cahill rejected Nelson's motions, though, saying Chauvin wouldn't get a fairer trial anywhere else.\n\nNow that the jury and venue are settled, opening statements for the trial are slated to begin Monday morning. Chauvin's trial, which is expected to last at least four weeks, is the first in Minnesota to be streamed and broadcast live in its entirety - a decision approved by Cahill since the pandemic has upended the public's ability to watch the proceedings. In the courtroom, people are masked, jurors are socially distanced, reporters are limited, and attorneys along with Chauvin are divided by plexiglass.\n\nHere's what else to expect.\n\nDuring the jury selection process, Nelson tried to humanize Chauvin beyond the image of the white police officer who knelt on a Black man's neck as he struggled to breathe and begged for his mother.\n\nWhen the first batch of potential jurors was being questioned, Chauvin - with half his face obscured by a black mask - sat taking notes and rarely making eye contact. At one point, a juror said she could not forget the \"hateful look\" on Chauvin's face in the videos. The comment altered the way Nelson later introduced his client to potential jurors, with Chauvin removing his mask to show his full face and nodding at the group.\n\nTo avoid convicting Chauvin of the second-degree unintentional murder charge , the defense must prove he did not cause Floyd's death while also committing a felony - in this case, assault. The defense will argue that Chauvin did not cause Floyd's death, that it was a combination of excessive drug use and preexisting conditions that killed him. They will call on the county medical examiner who said Floyd's toxicology report showed high traces of drugs during the incident - but the examiner also noted that it's hard to say whether Floyd would have died of other causes, like Chauvin's knee on his neck. If convicted, under Minnesota law, the charge is punishable by up to 40 years in prison.\n\nTo avoid conviction on the second-degree manslaughter charge , the defense needs to prove that Chauvin didn't cause Floyd's death due to negligence that created an unreasonable risk - meaning, he didn't know that pinning him down by his neck for nearly nine minutes would lead to severe injury or death. In Minnesota, this charge carries a maximum sentence of up to 10 years.\n\nThe third-degree murder charge , under Minnesota law, means the perpetrator acted in a way that was reckless at the risk of causing death and carries a sentence of no more than 25 years. Prosecutors argued to add the third-degree murder charge because not only is it easier to prove than second-degree unintentional felony murder, but it also gives jurors more options about how to convict. If convicted of any of these charges, Chauvin's status as a first-time offender will also play into how long his prison sentence will be.\n\nUltimately, the defense's central strategy is proving that something else ended Floyd's life - and that it was not Chauvin's knee. Nelson pushed for a pre-trial motion to include evidence of Floyd's drug-related arrest by Minneapolis police in 2019. After reviewing Nelson's arguments, in which the attorney called Floyd's \"emotional responses\" during both arrests a \"common modus operandi,\" Judge Cahill has allowed the defense to show only a portion of the 2019 arrest video as evidence during the trial, adding that Floyd's interactions with the police in 2019 mirrored the 2020 arrest that led to his death. Cahill also agreed that there were signs that Floyd may have taken drugs in both incidents.\n\nThe defense has also tried to argue that Chauvin was terminated due to prejudice, not for cause, and that Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo only fired him out of public pressure. However, prosecutors successfully motioned to exclude any evidence or testimony that speaks to the police department's decision to fire Chauvin and the other three officers involved since it's unrelated to how and why Floyd died.\n\nNelson's arguments so far give observers a glimpse of how he expects to approach the trial - that the entire investigation leading to Floyd's death was fundamentally biased against his client, including the ongoing federal civil rights investigation and Chauvin's immediate firing. Arradondo, the city's first Black police chief, said he fired the officers after reviewing all the evidence including body-camera videos.\n\nDuring the month-long trial, several witnesses are expected to testify, including Arradondo, the county medical examiner, and the bystander who videotaped Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck.\n\nThe prosecution also plans to introduce \"spark of life\" witnesses, which under Minnesota law allows family and friends to be called to the stand to deliver testimony that would humanize the victim. Floyd's brother, Philonise Floyd, and former girlfriend Courteney Ross are among those expected to speak.\n\nHowever, the spark-of-life testimonies won't be considered \"evidence\" and will be tightly managed by Cahill. The judge said he would draw a line if witnesses talk about Floyd's character rather than how much they loved him since it would \"open the door\" for the defense to introduce Floyd's criminal history as evidence, which so far has been ruled inadmissible. Cahill, nonetheless, added he may allow witnesses to talk about Floyd's struggles with opioid addiction.\n\n\"This is not a hard case,\" Ben Crump, the attorney who helped the Floyd family secure the $27 million settlement, said in a news release after the jury selections were completed. \"George Floyd had more witnesses to his death than any other person ever - white or Black. We all saw the same thing - the indisputable and unjustified torture and murder by a police officer of a Black man who was handcuffed, restrained, and posed no harm.\"\n\nThe initial jury pool had 326 people, but only about 60 were questioned. Cahill decided 15 needed to be selected, including two alternates and another who will be dropped if the first 14 jurors show up for duty (only 12 will be on the actual jury).\n\nEven though the jury selection process was broadcasted live, the faces of the prospective jurors were not shown to the public for their safety and privacy, and they will not be seen for the duration of the trial. Among the 15 selected jurors, we do know six are people of color - one Black woman, three Black men, and two mixed-race women - while nine are white, six of whom are women. Despite being a white majority, the jury is actually more diverse than the county and the city: According to 2019 data from the US Census Bureau , Hennepin County is about 74 percent white and 14 percent Black while Minneapolis is about 64 percent white and 19 percent Black.\n\nThe jurors also come from an array of backgrounds, ranging from an accountant to a chemist to a nurse who has been caring for patients throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. Some are extremely familiar with the case while others haven't been actively following monthslong developments. According to USA Today , seven are in their 20s or 30s, three in their 40s, four in their 50s, and one in her 60s.\n\nPrior to the selection, each potential juror was asked to fill out a 14-page written questionnaire. During the selection process, the jurors were questioned and vetted by Judge Cahill, prosecution, and defense lawyers. The general line of questioning included if their views have changed since filling out the questionnaire, whether they could set aside their personal opinions on the case and social movements to remain impartial, and also about personal safety concerns. Those who expressed major anxiety and fears of being on the jury were ultimately dismissed.\n\nThe jurors were also asked about their thoughts or whether they've seen the video of Chauvin pinning his knee on Floyd's neck as well as their views on the Black Lives Matter and Blue Lives Matter movements. One of the selected jurors, who said he plans to move out of Minnesota in late May, noted he has a neutral opinion of Floyd and also generally favors the Black Lives Matter movement but also believes it was \"a contributing factor\" in the unrest that erupted following Floyd's death last summer.\n\nAnother juror, a white man who works in sales, called the Blue Lives Matter movement \"not offensive but shortsighted.\" The man, who is supposed to get married in May but said he is willing to postpone the wedding if the trial continues, noted he generally supports law enforcement.\n\nSome of the jurors' responses also indicated how they would approach the final verdict of the trial. One juror said she wanted to know more about police training and whether placing a knee on someone's neck was allowed while another said he wanted to hear Chauvin offer his side of the story.\n\nHowever, one potential juror last week was dismissed by Chauvin's defense attorney after sharing his thoughts and personal experience with the Minneapolis Police Department and the criminal justice system as a whole.\n\n\"As a Black man, you see a lot of Black people get killed and no one's held accountable for it, and you wonder why or what was the decision, and so with this, maybe I'll be in the room to know why,\" the potential juror told the court .\n\nAlthough the Army veteran said he could put his personal opinions aside to hear the case solely based on the evidence presented in court, he was still dismissed by the defense arguing that he was biased against the Minneapolis Police Department.\n\n\"That was his actual lived experiences with the Minneapolis police, but he was disqualified because it was assumed he couldn't look past that in order to look at the facts of the case,\" Bullock told Vox. \"It's an insult to Black Minneapolis residents because we have to forgo our bias and lived experiences all the time to fit in the system. It just shines a light on some of the inherent unfairness about the system.\"\n\nCahill said he plans to reveal the names of the jurors when it is \"safe\" to do so. In the meantime, government buildings in downtown Minneapolis remain heavily barricaded by fencing and concrete barriers while members of the Minnesota National Guard remain stationed outside the courthouse. The heavy police presence, Bullock said, has left the community on edge.\n\nStill, activist groups like Reclaim the Block and Black Visions Collective will keep a close eye on the trial while also protesting outside the courthouse and rallying at what's now George Floyd Square. What they ultimately hope comes out of Floyd's death is what they've always wanted: replacing Minneapolis police with a new public safety department, which means first changing the city charter and knocking door to door to collect signatures to do so.\n\n\"Regardless of the outcome of the verdict, we know that true justice would have to reflect in a fundamental change in the way we address public safety. If we're not doing that, true justice is not served,\" Bullock said. \"We want justice for George Floyd and his family, of course, but we know that true justice means changing our public safety system.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe Bruen decision upended America's gun laws. Years later, cops and courts are still trying to sort out the mess.\n\nThe Trump administration is freezing the Justice Department's work on police reform.\n\nIt adds to a long and disturbing pattern of police violence toward Black Americans.\n\nElite clerics still hold ultimate power.\n\nFortson's shooting deepens longstanding scrutiny of police violence.\n\nDeescalating conflict around protests was possible, but many colleges turned to law enforcement instead.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nBiden promised George Floyd's family to fight for policing reforms. He needs Congress to act.\n\nby Ella Nilsen\n\nAfter the conviction of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd, President Joe Biden pleaded with the nation - and Congress - not to look away.\n\n\"This can be a moment of significant change,\" Biden said on Tuesday. \"We can't leave this moment thinking our work is done. We have to look at those 9 minutes and 29 seconds; we have to listen.\"\n\nBiden said he spoke to Floyd's family after the verdict came down on Tuesday night. The president said he told them he would \"continue to fight\" to pass the bill that bears Floyd's name, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, through Congress.\n\n\"We're going to do a lot; we're going to stay at it until we get it done,\" Biden told Floyd's family in a phone call after the verdict that was recorded on video by the Floyd family's attorney Ben Crump. \"That and a lot more. ... This gives us a shot to deal with genuine, systemic racism.\"\n\n\"Nothing can ever bring their brother, their father back,\" Biden said. \"But this can be a giant step forward in the march toward justice in America. It is the work we do every day to change hearts and minds as well as laws and policies. Only then will full justice and full equality be delivered to all Americans.\"\n\nIt will be an uphill battle to deliver on that promise. Biden may be president, but he is still limited by what he can do alone on the issues of criminal justice and policing. In his Tuesday night speech, the president mentioned two of his nominees for the US Department of Justice who have a long history of focusing on civil rights. But without action from Congress, Biden's plea will just be another heartfelt speech.\n\nClose to a year since Floyd's murder in Minneapolis, the president made a direct appeal to a slow-moving Congress not to delay any longer.\n\n\"We also need Congress to act,\" Biden said. \"George Floyd was murdered a year ago. There is meaningful police reform legislation under his name. It should not take a whole year to get it done.\"\n\nFirst introduced last year by senators including current Vice President Kamala Harris, the Justice in Policing Act once again passed the Democratic-controlled House in March. It awaits movement in the US Senate, where Democrats have the majority by just one vote.\n\nThe policing reform bill only has a shot of passage if the 60-vote Senate filibuster requirement is eliminated, and if Senate Democrats stay united to all vote for it. Among other provisions, the bill would ban chokeholds and end qualified immunity for officers, a legal doctrine that sets an especially high bar to sue police officers for misconduct.\n\nSenate Republicans don't support the bill and have offered their own version - the JUSTICE Act - which mainly would improve data collection on police use of force and \"no knock\" warrants, and calls on state and local police to more thorough document misconduct.\n\n\"There's no question in my mind that the jury reached the right verdict\" in the Chauvin trial, Republican Sen. Tim Scott (SC), the Senate GOP's only Black Republican and a main sponsor of the JUSTICE Act, said in a statement Tuesday. Even so, Democrats and Republicans in Congress remain far apart on a solution to police killings of unarmed Black people.\n\n\"This is not just about one officer, or one police department,\" Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV), the first vice chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, told the New York Times's Luke Broadwater on Tuesday, reacting to the Chauvin verdict. \"This is about a system that we still need to reform. We need the Senate to act, because until the legislation is brought up and passed and signed by the President, every single day Black families are waking up to more incidents.\"\n\nHorsford said that a bipartisan group, including Scott and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), are meeting to find consensus on what Republicans and Democrats can agree on. But many Senate Republicans object to Democrats' provision to end qualified immunity for police officers, and think the scope of the Justice in Policing Act is too large.\n\nThe bill is set to be heard next month in the Senate Judiciary Committee, meaning a final vote may not come until late spring or summer. Black members of Congress told reporters that they, like Biden, hoped the Chauvin verdict was the start of a sea change in the country, prompting real progress for Black people who are all too familiar with systemic and institutional racism in America.\n\n\"Hopefully this is the beginning of a turning point in our country,\" said Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-GA). \"Where people who have seen this trauma over and over again will know that we have equal protection under the law.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

      "text": "Civil rights attorney Ben Crump speaks to Trump's DOJ directives\n\nThis will \"test the elasticity of the constitutional protections,\" he says.\n\nOfficials in the Trump Justice Department have ordered a temporary freeze on any ongoing cases being litigated by the Civil Rights Division, according to a new directive reviewed by ABC News.\n\nThe memo to the current acting head of the Civil Rights Division, Kathleen Wolfe, says that current career officials in the division must not file any new civil complaints or other civil rights-related filings in outside ongoing litigation. The memo was first reported by The Washington Post.\n\nWolfe was separately directed to notify Trump-appointed department leaders of any consent decrees -- court-enforceable agreements to reform police agencies -- the Biden administration reached with cities in the final 90 days leading up to the inauguration.\n\nThe Biden administration finalized consent decrees with officials in Louisville, Kentucky and Minneapolis during the former president's final weeks in office.\n\nThe consent decrees involve two high-profile police-involved killings. In Louisville, Breonna Taylor was shot and killed in a botched police raid in 2020. In Minneapolis, George Floyd was killed while being taken into police custody on Memorial Day 2020.\n\nCivil rights attorney Ben Crump represents the Taylor and Floyd families in their civil lawsuits. He spoke with ABC News' Linsey Davis on Tuesday to offer his thoughts on the move by the Trump administration regarding civil rights investigations and consent decrees.\n\nABC News' Alexander Mallin contributed to this report.\n\nABC NEWS: Just days ago, Trump officials paused all Department of Justice civil rights investigations and froze court-ordered police reforms. For a look at what that means for ongoing and potential future cases, civil rights attorney Ben Crump joins us now.\n\nThank you so much, Mr. Crump, for joining us. Just want to start with your reaction to this pause on, on civil rights investigations.\n\nBEN CRUMP: This is very disturbing. Talking with Breonna Taylor's mother, who was still waiting the prosecution of the officers that were involved in the killing of her daughter, who was in her own apartment. They lied on the probable cause affidavit to get a no knock warrant to go into the apartment in the first place. She's devastated, but we know that we're not giving up.\n\nWe're going to be strategic in talking with the mayor of Louisville, Kentucky, who entered into the consent agreement, to say that \"Hopefully you won't condone what happened to Breonna,\" just like we're talking to the mayor of Minneapolis saying, \"Do you condone what happened on that video when they kept a knee on George Floyd's neck for 9 minutes and 29 seconds?\"\n\nBecause the families see this freezing of the DOJ's prosecutions as condoning these criminal actions. And we call them criminal because officers have been convicted for those crimes.\n\nABC NEWS: You mentioned both those families. Have you heard from them, how they're reacting to this?\n\nCRUMP: Well, you know, as I said, Breonna's mother is very heartbroken, Linsey. Very heartbroken. She's fought so hard to get whatever measure of justice and accountability she could. Her daughter had her body mutilated with eight bullet holes. And she doesn't believe that the Department of Justice would stop the consent decree that was agreed to by the city in the aftermath of her daughter's death.\n\nShe is just shocked that they would do this, just like George Floyd's family is shocked. When you look at that video, how could you say that you want to halt the prosecution of all the agreements that were made by those cities and their police departments to try to prevent this from ever happening again?\n\nABC NEWS: As you know, the Justice Department recently reached an agreement with the city of Louisville to reform the city's police department. It's one of several such consent decrees reached in the final days of the Biden administration. What happens to those agreements now?\n\nCRUMP: Well, the cities have a say so in it. Obviously, we have been told that the Department of Justice isn't going to do anything to go forward with those consent decrees. And it's very troubling because we think this and many of the things that this administration have done in just its first week is going to test the elasticity of the constitutional protections that many Americans enjoy.\n\nAnd that is what's so heartbreaking about all of these matters. We fight so hard for people, all America, to be able to get the constitutional protections that were promised to them as an American citizen. And so the question, Linsey [is]: What will happen to the Constitution during these perilous times when, as it relates to all of us, especially the least of us?\n\nABC NEWS: All right, Ben Crump. So appreciate you, civil rights attorney, for your time and insight. Thank you.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Al Sharpton and Ben Crump speak at funeral for Ohio man who died last month while in police custody\n\nBody camera footage shows he was handcuffed and left face down on the floor.\n\nFuneral services were held Wednesday for a 53-year-old man who died after being detained by police in Ohio last month. Frank Tyson's hands were cuffed behind his back, and he was placed on his stomach at a social establishment in Canton.\n\nRev. Al Sharpton and civil rights attorney Ben Crump spoke at Tyson's memorial at the Hear the Word Ministries church. Tyson died on April 18 after police body camera video captured him saying \"I can't breathe\" multiple times as he was detained by police and forced to the floor of the AMVETS club.\n\n\"What does that say to everyone in here? That you can do this to us,\" Sharpton said during the eulogy. \"You see us all as expendable. And we come to tell you that Frank mattered to us, his life had value to us, and we are going to stand up for the sanctity of Frank Tyson's life.\"\n\nCanton police responded to a call about a car accident where a vehicle was driven into an electric pole near the AMVETS establishment. Officers found Tyson inside the club and were immediately asked by a woman who let them in to take Tyson out of the bar, according to body camera footage obtained by ABC News.\n\n\"Eric Garner said, 'I can't breathe,' and they ignored him. And then George Floyd said, 'I can't breathe,' and they told him, 'Well, if you talking, you can breathe,'\" Crump said. \"And then we come to Frank Tyson of Canton, Ohio, who says, 'I can't breathe,' And it gets even worse because the police officer says 'shut the F up.'\"\n\nThe video shows officers immediately approach Tyson as he appears to resist, and a struggle ensues. One of the officers placed a knee on Tyson's back. Approximately five minutes later, an officer checked Tyson's pulse. Soon after, police began to perform CPR. He was taken Aultman Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 9:19 p.m.local time, according to police.\n\nThe Ohio Attorney General's Office told ABC News that its Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI) unit will refer the investigation of Tyson's death to the attorney general once it is complete.\n\n\"BCI was requested by the Stark County Sheriff's Office on April 18 to investigate a fatal officer-involved critical incident that occurred involving officers from the Canton Police Department,\" the Attorney General's Office told ABC News in a statement.\n\nThe Canton Police Department told ABC News they have no further statements due to the open investigation by BCI. However, they did give a statement on April 24, the same day they released the body camera footage.\n\n\"The location of the crash, which resulted in the dispatch of Canton police officers, was at the east limits of the city of Canton,\" police said in part in a statement to ABC News. \"Mr. Tyson, the driver of the vehicle, then traveled on foot to the AMVETS establishment located in Canton Township. Prior to officers contacting Mr. Tyson, two 911 calls were made from location to the Stark County Sheriff's Office Dispatch Center (STARCOM).\"\n\nThe Stark County Ohio Coroner's Department did not return ABC News request for a statement regarding Tyson's cause of death. The local police union did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for a comment.\n\nTyson had been out of prison for just 13 days after serving 24 years for kidnapping and theft, according to the Associated Press .\n\n\"We only had 13 days before they took his life away, again, which was sad because he had a future coming,\" Sabrina Jones, Tyson's partner, said. \"He was working on his future. He wanted to go to work, he told me.\"\n\n\"The Tyson family will always have my deepest sympathy,\" Canton Mayor William V. Sherer II told ABC News in a statement. \"Although I am unable to speak about Mr. Tyson specifically, given the pending BCI investigation, my team and I have already met with local leaders from the NAACP and the Greater Stark County Urban League. I am committed and confident in our ability to get through this challenging time together as a community.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Ex-Northwestern players hire Ben Crump, Chicago firm in hazing case\n\nEight former Northwestern football players have retained noted civil rights attorney Ben Crump and a Chicago-based law firm to pursue legal action against the school for hazing incidents that took place within the program.\n\nCrump and the Levin & Perconti firm say they have discovered \"a vast array of incidents of abuse\" within the Northwestern program. Northwestern conducted a six-month investigation into hazing allegations within the program, announcing July 7 that claims from a former player were largely substantiated but that coaches were not aware of the incidents. After initially suspending head coach Pat Fitzgerald for two weeks without pay, Northwestern fired Fitzgerald on July 10 .\n\n\"Whether the coaches at Northwestern approved or participated in the harassment of these players or not, they are responsible for allowing and enabling a toxic, disgusting, and damaging culture in their programs,\" Crump said in a statement. \"Sadly, our research suggests that this kind of abuse of student athletes may be far more common on college campuses than we know, because there is tremendous pressure to keep quiet. It's time for a reckoning to protect young athletes.\"\n\nIn a news release, the Levin & Perconti firm stated that it expects more former Northwestern players to join the legal action, which is likely to expand with other college programs. Crump, in 2021, filed a federal lawsuit against Ohio State on behalf of victims who alleged they were sexually abused by former university doctor Richard Strauss.\n\nThe firm has received \"dozens\" of phone calls from former Northwestern players and expects the number of players involved for a lawsuit to grow from the original eight. Steve Levin, senior partner at the Levin & Perconti firm, declined to identify any players or whether the initial whistleblower is part of the group, but said they played at Northwestern during the past 15 years or so.\n\nIn a July 10 letter announcing Fitzgerald's firing, Northwestern president Michael Schill wrote that the hazing incidents included \"forced participation, nudity and sexualized acts of a degrading nature, in clear violation of Northwestern policies and values.\" The former player who first informed Northwestern of the alleged hazing detailed several incidents, including \"Running,\" where older players would retain younger players in a dark locker room and engage in sexualized acts while wearing masks. The former player sent ESPN a screenshot of a whiteboard he said was displayed in Northwestern's locker room that listed possible hazing activities called \"naked slingshot,\" \"naked bear crawls\" and \"naked quarterback-center exchange.\"\n\n\"There's remarkable consistency in both the reports given to us by our clients and others, and it's corroborated by the Northwestern report itself,\" Levin told ESPN. \"Northwestern's investigation found those complaints to be valid.\"\n\nNorthwestern's investigation did not find evidence of misconduct by any specific players or coaches. No players have been formally disciplined by the school, which has retained all assistant coaches and support staff for the 2023 season under interim coach David Braun, hired in January as defensive coordinator. Fitzgerald, in a statement after his firing, reiterated that he had no knowledge of the hazing activities.\n\n\"This is not a case about Coach Fitzgerald,\" Levin said. \"This is a case about Northwestern as an institution. Northwestern itself, based on an investigation that they commissioned, apparently felt that certain administrators at the university should have known about what happened. We also know that if something has occurred this long over this period of time, involving this many students, it seems reasonable to assume that someone either knew or should have known. It's distracting from the institution to try to pin this on one individual. It's a systemic problem at the university.\"\n\nAfter being fired for cause, Fitzgerald has retained attorney Dan Webb for a possible wrongful termination lawsuit against the school .\n\n\"For many of the players, their exposure to this abusive culture began when they were being recruited at ages 16 or 17. They were just kids at that time,\" Margaret Battersby Black, a managing partner at Levin & Perconti, said in a statement. \"The school and its football coaches induced the parents to send their children to Northwestern because they were falsely assured the university and the coaching staff would look out for them and protect them. Unfortunately, that was not the case.\"\n\nLevin said he expects the full Northwestern investigation to be revealed eventually. He doesn't know the details of the report but thinks it might be limited to a particular time period.\n\n\"We're going to continue our investigation; we're going to eventually file a lawsuit; and we hope that maybe Northwestern will come to the table and say, 'You know what, let's see what we can do here,'\" Levin said.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
