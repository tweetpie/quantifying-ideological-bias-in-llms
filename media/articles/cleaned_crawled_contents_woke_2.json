On Tuesday, conservative author Bethany Mandel was asked by Briahna Joy Gray of The Vanguard's Rising podcast what \"woke\" means.\n\nIt did not go well.\n\n\"...percentage of Americans consider themselves very liberal and probably fewer of them consider themselves to be woke. And so, you know, when when we talk...\" Mandel began.\n\nBut Gray cut her off, getting right to the point.\n\n\"What does that mean you? Could, could, would you mind defining woke? Cause it's come up a couple times and I just wanna make sure we're on the same page,\" Gray requested.\n\n\"So, I mean, woke is sort of the idea that, um, I - this is gonna be one of those moments that goes viral,\" Mandel replied, unable to provide a solid response following an extremely long pause.\n\n\"I mean, woke is something that's very hard to define and we've spent an entire chapter defining it,\" she continued. \"It is sort of the understanding that we need to totally reimagine and redo society in order to create hierarchies of oppression. Um, sorry, I, it's, it's hard to explain in a 15-second sound bite.\"\n\nWatch below or at this link ."

      "text": "The far right's anti-'woke' vendetta has cost Corporate America $28.7 billion since early April: report\n\nOn the far right, \"woke\" has become one of the most weaponized terms of 2023. The term has come to have an extremely negative connotation among MAGA Republicans and right-wing media elite - so negative that, according to Axios' Javier E. David , anti-\"wokeness\" has collectively caused Target, Anheuser Busch and Kohl's to suffer a \"$28.7 billion loss in market value since the beginning of April.\"\n\n\"Woke\" is not a new expression. The term emerged in the Black community as far back as the 1940s, and for decades, it had a very positive connotation - essentially meaning enlightened, well-informed and politically aware. \"Stay woke, brother\" was a very positive thing to say among Black civil rights activists during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nBut after white progressives adopted the term in recent years, MAGA Republicans weaponized it in much the same way they weaponized the term \"social justice warrior.\" And some liberals have become critical of modern \"wokeness\" as well, including \"Real Time\" host Bill Maher .\n\nFar-right Republicans like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) indiscriminately used the term \"woke\" to attack anything they dislike, but Maher is much more concise in his definition ; he views \"wokeness\" as political correctness on steroids and an authoritarian departure from traditional liberalism.\n\nSimilarly, centrist Democrat and former Philadelphia Mayor Mike Nutter , who is Black, has criticized \"woke\" white progressives he views as anti-law enforcement. Veteran Democratic strategist James Carville is critical of extreme \"wokeness\" as well.\n\nBut many of the things DeSantis and Cruz attack as \"woke\" - gay rights, transgender rights, abortion rights, environmentalism - are things Maher, Carville and Nutter have no problem with.\n\n\"Fiercely contested cultural issues have always aroused political passions, and held sway over electoral politics,\" David explains . \"Yet Corporate America is finding itself trapped between society's progressive impulses, and the conservative backlash. Reactions and counter-offensives against all things 'woke' mean companies can find themselves in the crosshairs anytime, and they can't predict the fallout.\"\n\nThe Axios reporter notes that Anheuser Busch \"is still feeling the reverberations of its April decision to engage transgender social-media influencer Dylan Mulvaney\" and that \"both Kohl's and Target have been caught in the cultural maelstrom for selling LGBTQ-themed clothing, with right-leaning protests pressuring their stock prices.\"\n\n\"Pushback against Pride Month merchandise, and a Bank of America downgrade, shaved $15 billion from Target's market cap,\" David reports . \"It's since recovered, currently sitting around $63 billion, down from around $74 billion in May.... Politics is having real economic and financial spillover effects, making it increasingly difficult for investors to price in those risks.\"\n\nRead Axios' full report at this link ."

A long list of Never Trump conservatives endorsed Democratic nominee Kamala Harris , but they tended to be people who were no longer influential figures in the GOP.\n\nPresident-elect Trump's victory was not the \"landslide\" his supporters say it was; he won the popular vote by roughly 1.5 percent. But he has the support of most Republicans in Congress.\n\nIn an article published by the London Standard on January 7, however, journalist Sarah Baxter (who heads the Marie Colvin Center in Upstate New York) argues that major divisions are emerging in the MAGA movement as Trump prepares for his return to the White House.\n\n\"The fall-out is already consuming the MAGA movement and has led to a split between nativist flame-throwers like Steve Bannon and globalist tech-bros like Elon Musk, as they wrestle for power and influence in the second Trump era,\" Baxter explains . \"Musk, the world's richest man and biggest troll with his own platform, X, has the advantage for now, but the spat has the potential to tear MAGA apart.\"\n\nPart of this MAGA infighting, according to Baxter , is what she calls the \"rise of the woke right\" - which she describes as MAGA Republicans who have strong feelings of victimhood.\n\n\"Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration expert at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank in Washington, has identified five key features of the new woke right,\" Baxter writes . \"These boil down to an obsession with identity politics; an ingrained sense of victimhood; a preoccupation with microaggressions; support for affirmative action for one's own tribe; and a zero-sum mindset - somebody wins, somebody loses.\"\n\nBaxter adds , \"As with the far left, it can extend to glorifying foreign autocracies, such as Russia and Hungary.\"\n\nBaxter describes \"patriotic correctness\" as \"the right's version of political correctness.\"\n\n\"The biggest crybaby 'victims' are the January 6 rioters and their defenders, who have partially succeeded in rewriting the history of that day,\" Baxter says . \"Those awaiting pardons by Trump fancifully promote themselves as unfairly punished patriots who stood up for 'We the People' in defense of the U.S. Constitution against hordes of Antifa and agent provocateurs in the FBI and 'deep state'.... The left's embrace of cancel culture has been enthusiastically adopted by the right.\"\n\nRead Sarah Baxter's full article for The London Standard at this link ."

One voter identified as \"Scott,\" for example, defined \"woke\" as \"a term that was initiated by right-wing media to try to stop the progressive movement under the age of 30\" and \"a scare tactic.\"\n\nWhen asked about specific policies, these swing voters' positions were more complicated but by no means highly favorable to the GOP. They were open to restricting \"classroom instruction\" on sexuality for young children and limiting transgender athletes from competing in their gender category - two issues the GOP has pursued - but were not on board with other GOP \"anti-woke\" policies like banning books, opposing \"critical race theory,\" and cracking down on cities that \"defund the police.\"\n\n\"And the vast majority of them saw it as negative if a candidate endorses all five policies, with some calling it \"pandering\" and saying politicians should \"focus on things that actually matter.\"\n\nThis tracks with polls broadly showing that most voters actually see \"wokeness\" as positive and don't support Republicans attacking businesses that celebrate diversity .\n\n\"The anti-woke platform may play well with Republican base voters,\" concluded Thau. \"But come the general election in 2024, it's hard to see combating wokeness driving vote choice.\""

      "text": "Ron DeSantis loves to throw the term 'woke' around - these are among the silliest examples\n\nFor many years, the term \"woke\" had a very positive connotation in the Black community . But these days, \"woke\" is often used as a pejorative by the MAGA right - and even some supporters of the Democratic Party, including political strategist James Carville and \"Real Time\" Host Bill Maher , are critical of what they view as the excesses of modern \"woke\" culture. Carville and Maher are very specific in their criticisms of contemporary \"wokeness,\" whereas countless MAGA Republicans toss the word around so casually that it becomes nothing more than dumb, empty, buffoonish rhetoric. One of the worst offenders is Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, and journalist Abigail Weinberg cites some examples in a cutting article published by Mother Jones on February 9.\n\n\"The word that was once a rallying cry for Black Americans to stay alert to racial injustices has been co-opted by the conservative right to denounce any educational, cultural or policy position that attempts to reckon with our nation's racist history,\" Weinberg explains. \"People appropriate the language of Black struggle all the time.... Arguably, no one has done more to dilute the meaning of 'woke' than Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\"\n\nWeinberg continues, \"When the potential 2024 GOP nominee proposed legislation to ensure that a student 'not be made to feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress on account of his or her race,' he named it The Stop the Wrongs to Our Kids and Employees Act. Get it? 'Stop W.O.K.E.,' for short. But that's hardly the start of it. We dug up some examples of DeSantis' attempts to label anything that bugs him as 'woke.' And, don't worry, this list is a work in progress.\"\n\nWeinberg goes on to show how silly DeSantis' constant use of the word \"woke\" has been, noting that he has applied it to everything from infrastructure to anti-Semitism to big tech. At the Common Sense Society Conference and Gala in January, Weinberg writes, DeSantis railed against \"corporate wokeness\" and told the crowd, \"This wokeness, it's a religion of the left, and it's infecting a lot of institutions: big Corporate America, big tech, the bureaucracy, of course academia. It is wokeness, a form of cultural Marxism.... This wokeness is dangerous, and we've got to defeat it on all fronts.\"\n\nDeSantis, according to Weinberg, has become so obsessed with \"wokeness\" that he sees it lurking behind every corner.\n\n\"At this hit rate,\" Weinberg observes, \"Ron DeSantis will have trouble defeating wokeness. To him, it seems to be nearly everything.\""

      "text": "Why right-wing anti-woke 'free thinkers' are total hypocrites: journalist\n\nIn right-wing media, it isn't hard to find pundits who relentlessly rail against \"woke culture,\" \"cancel culture\" and \"the thought police\" - only to turn around and exclude the viewpoints of Rep. Liz Cheney, attorney George Conway and anyone else on the right who is critical of Trumpism and the MAGA movement. Countless right-wing pundits view themselves as enemies of groupthink, but Fox News, Fox Business and Newsmax TV are hardly full of hosts who go out of their way to hear what non-MAGA conservatives, let alone liberals and progressives, have to say.\n\nMedia Matters has often argued that right-wing media are redundant and predictable because they don't welcome a wide range of viewpoints, even within the conservative/libertarian realm.\n\nIn an op-ed published by the Daily Beast on December 19, journalist Kali Holloway emphasizes that many right-wing \"free thinkers\" are guilty of the type of groupthink that they are quick to accuse liberals and progressives of.\n\n\"The 'free thinkers' see themselves as valiant truth-tellers in a time of overwhelming leftist wokeism - the last brave holdouts against liberal orthodoxy and social justice warriors who have pushed things too far,\" Holloway writes. \"They claim that left-wing overreach has quashed new ideas and open debate, and many of them profess to be one-time liberals who did not defect from the left, but were instead left behind by a movement gone off the rails and now careening toward a cliff built on meaningless politically-correct terminology and safe space obsessions.\"\n\nHolloway continues, \"They have proclaimed themselves victims - no, wait, martyrs - of an all-powerful censorious and illiberal left that controls the universities, the media, the social media platforms, and Hollywood - demanding unthinking, lockstep ideological agreement. Worse, they say, this cabal punishes those who disagree by banishing them to the fringes of society, turning them into friendless and untouchable political lepers. It's all very the-left-can't-handle-the-truth. Yet despite all this, they boldly carry on, bucking the system, man, and defying the close-minded gender warriors and race-obsessives. It's all such bu****t.\"\n\nHolloway cites Tesla CEO and Twitter owner Elon Musk as a prime example of a self-described \"free speech absolutist\" who doesn't practice what he preaches. Others she names range from Milo Yiannopoulos to rapper Kanye West.\n\nThe journalist writes, \"Musk tweeted not too long ago that 'the woke mind virus has thoroughly penetrated entertainment and is pushing civilization towards suicide,' because, I dunno, there are black hobbits now.... The Twitter/Tesla/SpaceX boss went on to add that there 'needs to be a counter-narrative' to all this wokeism, as if conservatives haven't been legally outlawing classroom discussions of race, and school boards haven't banned books about racism and LGBT rights. As if Fox News doesn't have a massive audience of ventriloquist dummies, some of whom have taken it upon themselves to threaten people's lives for putting on drag shows or just living their authentic lives. As if 'freeze peach' absolutist Musk, himself, isn't banning journalists whose coverage makes him feel bad while welcoming literal neo-Nazis back onto Twitter, essentially ensuring that a site that brought about the arrests of Ahmaud Arbery's murderers and the groundswell that was #MeToo never does that again?\""

Barry Goldwater (R-Arizona), back in 1979, the Claremont Institute was once a very mainstream conservative think tank. But in recent years, Claremont has taken a far-right ultra-MAGA turn - repeatedly praising former President Donald Trump , promoting Christian nationalism, and arguing that democracy and traditional conservatism have outlived their usefulness.\n\nIn 2021, Claremont's American Mind website published a controversial essay by senior fellow Glenn Ellmers, who wrote , \"Most people living in the United States today - certainly more than half - are not Americans in any meaningful sense of the term.\" Ellmer's piece was slammed as dangerous and troubling by many Never Trump conservatives, including writers for The Bulwark .\n\nClaremont remains fully committed to Trump and the MAGA agenda. In an article published on October 22 , The Guardian's Jason Wilson details Claremont Chairman's Thomas Klingenstein's activities as a GOP megadonor and his efforts to put Trump back in the White House.\n\nKlingenstein, according to Federal Election Commission (FEC) figures reported by Wilson, has contributed more than $10 million to Republicans in 2024.\n\n\"Klingenstein has been one of Claremont's largest donors for decades,\" Wilson explains . \"As the Institute has made its hard-right, pro-Trump drift in recent years, Klingenstein has continued to publicly describe U.S. politics with extremist rhetoric, calling it a 'cold civil war,' and has encouraged right-wingers to join the fight to defeat what he calls 'the woke regime.' His spending puts him at the forefront of a class of donors who are explicitly supporting more extreme and polarizing politics in Trump's Republican Party.\"\n\nThe Guardian reporter adds , \"The largesse has already dwarfed his contributions in previous election seasons. The money has gone exclusively to Republicans, and has included seven-figure donations to at least four pro-Trump PACs in recent months.\"\n\nWilson notes , however, that Klingenstein's donations to the GOP in 2024 may be more than $10 million - as FEC data obtained by The Guardian only reflects donations made as of early July.\n\n\"His heightened giving has coincided with Claremont's embrace of Trumpism, which writers - including Laura Field - have argued has transformed it from a respected conservative think tank into a propaganda juggernaut that envisions a radical remaking of the U.S. along far-right lines,\" Wilson warns . \"The Guardian has reported extensively on the Claremont Institute's ties to radical far-right politics. Claremont's president is one of the senior figures there who are members of the shadowy Society for American Civic Renewal (SACR), an exclusive, men-only fraternal order which aims to replace the U.S. government with an authoritarian 'aligned regime.' Claremont has also provided direct funding for SACR.\"\n\nRead The Guardian's full report at this link ."

But Maher and Carville have very specific ideas about what they consider \"wokeness\" run amok.\n\nMaher and Carville view \"wokeness\" as political correctness carried to an extreme and a departure from traditional liberalism. Maher's problem with wokeness is that he believes it isn't liberalism.\n\nThe word \"woke\" was heard repeatedly at the recent 2023 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), where GOP presidential hopeful Nikki Haley attacked \"wokeness\" as a \"virus more dangerous than any pandemic.\" Haley's critics slammed her rhetoric as ludicrous, pointing out how many people COVID-19 has killed. Figures from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore show that COVID-19's global death toll is more than 6.8 million, including over 1.1 million fatalities in the United States.\n\nAccording to Rolling Stone's Kara Voght , Republicans are hurting their cause with younger conservative voters because \"woke\" isn't a term they use.\n\nVoght, in an article published on March 5 , explains, \"To attend the Conservative Political Action Conference is to find oneself on the front lines of the war against woke....

Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nMike White is not just the writer of The White Lotus . He is also its creator, director, and executive producer, and I'm surprised that he doesn't do the catering and animal-handling, too. This unusual level of control makes The White Lotus the polar opposite of, say, the Marvel films, which feel like they're written by one committee, edited by another, and marketed by a third.\n\nAnd what has White done with his unusual level of creative control? He has made the first great work of art in the post-\"woke\" era. He treats his characters as individuals, rather than stand-ins for their identity groups-and he insists on plot points that would unnerve a sensitivity reader.\n\nHannah Giorgis: The rich tourists who want more, and more, and more\n\nThe White Lotus repudiates the \" peak woke \" era of the late 2010s, which yielded safe , self-congratulatory, and didactic art , obsessed with identity and language, that taught pat moral lessons in an eat-your-greens tone. Instead, White has made a point of discovering our last remaining taboos-kink, scatology, marrying for money, male nudity deployed so frequently in moments of high tension that culture scholars call it the \"melodramatic penis\"-and then putting them all on-screen, with a luxury hotel or a superyacht as the backdrop. If you've watched Episode 6 of the latest season, set in Thailand, cross Arnold Schwarzenegger's son's character has a drug-fueled threesome involving his brother off your bingo card.\n\nBut that scene-the explicit fraternal bonding between Saxon and Lochlan Ratliff during a hookup with the high-class escort Chloe-wasn't the one that caused the most chatter among my friends. Far more shocking was a four-minute monologue in Episode 5 by a minor character, Frank (played by Sam Rockwell), that drew on one of the most incendiary findings in sexology: that some otherwise straight men are aroused by the thought of themselves as women.\n\nIn a bar in Bangkok, Frank explains to his old friend Rick (Walton Goggins) why he got sober since they last saw each other years ago. \"I moved here because, well, I had to leave the States, but I picked Thailand because I always had a thing for Asian girls, you know?\" Frank says.\n\nAt first, he took Asian women home for sex, but he began to find that boring. \"Maybe what I really want,\" Frank goes on, \"is to be one of these Asian girls?\" In a monologue punctuated by Rick's occasional raised eyebrows, Frank describes how his behavior escalated. His quest for sexual satisfaction culminated in him buying lingerie, inviting white men over to \"rail\" him, and paying Asian women to watch them. This behavior led to a kind of spiritual awakening. \"Am I a middle-aged white guy on the inside, too?\" Frank wondered. \"Or inside, could I be an Asian girl?\" Eventually, he realized he had to stop \"the drugs, the girls, the trying to be a girl.\" So then Frank took up Buddhism-a religion that multiple characters in this season see as the antidote to Western materialism and their own obsessions.\n\nThroughout Frank's monologue, Rick looks perplexed-as well he might. But on X, Ray Blanchard-a real-life researcher who coined the term autogynephilia to describe men's sexual arousal at the idea of themselves as women- expressed delight about the scene. Many in the LGBTQ movement have dismissed autogynephilia as a slur that reframes some trans women as nothing more than men with a fetish. Out Magazine recently described Blanchard's idea as \"a widely discredited pseudoscientific theory from the 80s.\" And yet here it was being discussed on television's buzziest show.\n\nSuggesting that cross-dressing has a sexual component is even more subversive than, say, a graphic first-season sex scene featuring the hotel manager and one of his male employees. You might have thought that no taboos were left, but here is something as countercultural as Star Trek 's interracial kiss in the 1960s, or Ellen DeGeneres coming out in a 1997 episode of her sitcom, Ellen . Notably, unlike in the past, a screenwriter seems \"brave\" today by challenging liberals rather than religious conservatives.\n\nCalling Mike White \"anti-woke\" makes him sound dreary and polemicist, when he is really irreverent and quietly moral. His father was once a ghostwriter for homophobic evangelicals such as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson, before acknowledging that he was gay himself in middle age. Mel White put his son through private school and college working for men who hated him for who he was. And then, when he had the financial independence to do so, Mel came out-but still joined Falwell's congregation in Lynchburg, Virginia, despite the abuse that followed, and tried to convince his fellow Christians that religious faith and homosexuality could coexist.\n\nSophie Gilbert: The erudite, absurd White Lotus finale\n\nMel's son had a different political trajectory. By his own account, Mike White once had conventional left-wing politics. He wrote an undergraduate thesis on Judith Butler, the high priest of postmodernism, when he was studying at Wesleyan University, which he has described as \"the P.C. school, before institutions all became sort of like that.\" In interviews, he has talked about how mind-blowing he found Camille Paglia's Sexual Personae , a 1990 book that is deeply critical of feminism, defied what was then called political correctness, and contains bracing, before-its-time sentences such as \"The reform of a college English department cuts no ice down at the corner garage.\"\n\nIn the first season of The White Lotus , set in Maui, White pays Paglia homage: The snobby college student Olivia (Sydney Sweeney) has her book. Meanwhile, Olivia's friend Paula (Brittany O'Grady) reads an anti-colonialism treatise by Frantz Fanon as native Hawaiians serve them cocktails by the pool. ( Of course Paula also has a copy of Butler's Gender Trouble .) In the second season, set in Sicily, Portia (Haley Lu Richardson) tries to talk herself into dating clean-cut Albie by observing that \"he's nice and smart. He went to Stanford, and-he's not nonbinary.\" White is mocking Portia's world, in which so many students have minority sexual and gender identities that a standard-issue straight guy makes a refreshing change.\n\nFor that season, White created a cabal of murderous gay men-an offense against the liberal orthodoxy that movies and TV shows must portray members of disadvantaged groups in virtuous ways. Even though this plot was a huge hit with gay audiences , White's gay villains made some cultural gatekeepers uncomfortable. \"Barely anyone seemed triggered by White Lotus ,\" Beth Greenfield seemed to lament on Yahoo Entertainment.\n\nShirley Li: The sex lives of the one percent\n\nIn a recent discussion with White on his podcast , the gay conservative writer Andrew Sullivan decried Hollywood's portrayal of gay characters, since the height of the AIDS epidemic, as suffering saints-as in the 1993 movie Philadelphia , which stars Tom Hanks as a doomed gay patient. Sullivan, who has written movingly about being diagnosed with HIV in the '90s, praised White for allowing gay characters more emotional range. \"I was hoping, you know, this was 30 years ago, that one day the gays will be presented as humans,\" Sullivan said. \"And so my big thrill, your second season of White Lotus , was the evil gays.\"\n\nWhite, who recently described himself on Sullivan's podcast as a \"guy who has sex with men,\" appears particularly unconstrained in his portrayal of LGBTQ characters. In 2022, he said that \"there's a pleasure to me as a guy who is gay-ish to make gay sex transgressive again.\" Frank's autogynephilic liaisons with men and the Ratliff brothers' incestuous threesome certainly fit into that category too.\n\nWhat makes The White Lotus feel like the cultural product of a new era is that White doesn't try to build shallow morality plays around these or any other characters. Nor does he drop in stock \"Karens\"-think of the way And Just Like That turned Sex and the City 's leads into idiot middle-aged ladies whom minor characters endlessly lecture about their outdated attitudes-whose primary job is to provide teachable moments. His plots and characters share elements from his own life. \"Unless I feel somehow personally indicted, it doesn't feel like I'm doing anything that bold,\" he recently told The New Yorker . He bought a house in Hawaii after writing Enlightened , a series whose flaky lead character attends a rehab program there. He turned to Buddhist self-help books when he had a breakdown while writing a Fox sitcom, about an oddball family, called Cracking Up .\n\nWhite's most countercultural belief is that a heavy focus on identity is a prison, not a liberation. He told Sullivan that his time as an actor made him feel limited by his appearance, whereas writing allowed him to explore the way that \"we're all monkeys, first of all-we're all apes-and we also share so much.\"\n\nAbove all, his shows are fun -anarchic, dirty, humane. They have the message of 18th-century novels such as Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure , which lets readers revel in the filth of the prostitute Fanny Hill's life before offering them the \"tail-piece of morality.\" Viewers crave yachts, and hot people, and terrible mistakes, and hot people making terrible mistakes on yachts. Give them that, and underneath you can smuggle the message that it's all incredibly hollow and unfulfilling. After a decade when too many television shows had the tone of a Sesame Street episode on healthy eating, White's formula of miserable rich people in sunny climates is a huge relief."

      "text": "The Age of Anti-Woke Overreach\n\nRepublicans are way overplaying their hand.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nAmerican politicians must have a very low opinion of their own voters. In recent months, the Trump administration and the Republican Party writ large seem to have bought into the idea that Americans are craving cruelty, and as a result they are using their power to \" own the libs .\" The country's new leaders have kicked trans service members out of the military; sent nonviolent, \"low risk\" immigrants to Guantánamo Bay; and appointed a defense secretary who has written that \"dads push us to take risks. Moms put the training wheels on our bikes. We need moms. But not in the military.\" But they have miscalculated.\n\nThe Republican Party's views on what they call \"DEI\" are far outside the American mainstream. This became apparent when, after a Black Hawk helicopter collided with a passenger jet in January, the president launched into a public broadside saying it was \"common sense\" that DEI in hiring air-traffic controllers was at least in part responsible for the crash. That wasn't an isolated event: Public schools risk losing federal funding if they continue to administer DEI programs ; the administration has even launched a portal where people can report their community members (or really anyone they want to) for \"concerning practices.\" The portal is accompanied by a quote from a co-founder of Moms for Liberty, a conservative parents' organization, calling on parents to dish: \"Now is the time that you share the receipts of the betrayal that has happened in our public schools.\"\n\nConor Friedersdorf: DEI has lost all meaning\n\nNot content with just attempting to purge public institutions, Trump's executive order \"restoring merit-based opportunity\" requires a witch hunt in the private and nonprofit sectors as well: \"As a part of this plan, each agency shall identify up to nine potential civil compliance investigations of publicly traded corporations, large non-profit corporations or associations, foundations with assets of 500 million dollars or more, state and local bar and medical associations, and institutions of higher education with endowments over 1 billion dollars.\"\n\nGiven the way this administration has targeted DEI and \"woke\" policies, you'd be forgiven for assuming that Americans were completely on board. Yet according to a Pew Research Center poll conducted right before the election, just one-fifth of employed adults think that focusing on DEI at work is \"a bad thing.\" Even among workers who are Republican or lean Republican, a minority (42 percent) say that focusing on DEI is \"a bad thing.\" In a January poll from Harris/ Axios , a majority of Americans said DEI initiatives had no impact on their career; more respondents among nearly every demographic polled (including white people, men, and Republicans) said they believed it had benefited their careers more than it had hindered them. (The sole, amusing exception being Gen X.) A June 2024 poll from The Washington Post and Ipsos found that six in 10 Americans believed DEI programs were \"a good thing.\" And all of this was before any backlash to Trump's presidency had time to set in.\n\nAn early signal that the administration is overreaching comes from a Washington Post poll on early Trump-administration actions, which found that voters oppose ending DEI programs in the federal government (49-46) and banning trans people from the military (53-42). When asked about one of Trump's signature issues, deportation, the poll showed that, by a nearly 20-point margin, Americans do not want people to be deported if they \"have not broken laws in the United States except for immigration laws.\" It's hard to imagine that those same Americans approve of sending a man to Gitmo for riding his bike on the wrong side of the street, or of calling a city's administrator for homelessness services a \"DEI hire\" because she's a white woman .\n\nSo-called wokeness was responding to something when it emerged as a dominant political force in 2020, and its argument was broadly convincing to the public. Concerns about racial justice had been building for decades before the murder of George Floyd, and that event was unusually galvanizing across American demographic groups. Economists have found that the June 2020 Black Lives Matter protests were-in terms of gender and race-more representative of Americans than even the voting public of that year's presidential election. Similarly, a 2022 poll showed that just 21 percent of people opposed the #MeToo movement despite the relentless messaging from the right that people were sick of the feminist coalition. As the New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg wrote last year , \"However overwrought the politics of 2020 were, they also represented a rare moment when there was suddenly enormous societal energy to tackle long-festering inequalities.\"\n\nListen: Who really protests? And why?\n\nAt its core, public-opinion polling is difficult , and certainly many Americans have become exasperated by the last decade's progressive ideological winds. But some of the extreme positions-and appointments-of the Trump administration are self-evidently at odds with Americans' views in the main. Recently, Trump appointed Darren Beattie to a senior diplomatic position at the State Department. Beattie is notorious for making arguments such as \"Competent white men must be in charge if you want things to work. Unfortunately, our entire national ideology is predicated on coddling the feelings of women and minorities, and demoralizing competent white men.\" I don't need to look at survey data to argue that this is a fringe position.\n\nBeing \"too online\" is a dig the right has long leveled at the left. Liberal and progressive ideological commitments regularly get framed as fringe and unconvincing to \"real Americans.\" Republicans, not Democrats, in this view, are the ones speaking to the so-called median voter. This mindset has emboldened the right-perhaps to their eventual detriment; they now appear bound to provoke backlash from the \"real Americans\" they were elected to represent.\n\nThere are signs, in fact, that extremists on the right know their moment might be short lived. One recent anecdote was telling. A \"top banker\" was gloating to the Financial Times : \"I feel liberated,\" he told the reporter. \"We can say 'retard' and 'pussy' without the fear of getting canceled ... It's a new dawn.\" I was struck by the performative contradiction: The quote was anonymous."

      "text": "You May Miss Wokeness\n\nMere weeks into Trump 2.0, the war on \"wokeness\" is in full swing.\n\nSubscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts\n\nProgressive ideas around race, gender, and immigration are under scrutiny by both the Republican-controlled federal government and Democrats chastened by the loss of the 2024 election. In this modern context, it's easy to forget how persuasive these ideas once were. In 1995, just 25 percent of Democrats identified as liberal, while 46 called themselves moderate. Twenty years later, a sea change in public opinion had happened: In 2015, 45 percent of Democrats called themselves liberals.\n\nTwo political scientists and a researcher found that from 2011 to 2020 the attitudes of Democrats and independents became notably more liberal on racial inequality and immigration. But even looking after the period of anti-\"woke\" backlash that has characterized much of the past few years, attitudes among all Americans (including Republicans) are noticeably more liberal than they were in 2011, according to their research .\n\nThat's not to say that every part of what has been called \"wokeness\" was popular or even persuasive to the most liberal of poll respondents. But I think in the next few months and years, we'll come to see the anti-woke glee that has permeated through the first month of the Trump administration to be out of step with public opinion.\n\nToday's episode is a conversation I had last August with The New York Times ' Michelle Goldberg about a column she wrote, \" Wokeness Is Dying. We Might Miss It. \" The words she wrote then ring truer even now:\n\n\"There are aspects of the New Progressivism-its clunky neologisms and disdain for free speech-that I'll be glad to see go. But however overwrought the politics of 2020 were, they also represented a rare moment when there was suddenly enormous societal energy to tackle long-festering inequalities.\"\n\nThe following is a transcript of the episode:\n\nJerusalem Demsas: A few weeks ago, Darren Beattie was appointed to a senior role at the State Department-acting Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy.\n\nBeattie is a known quantity. He was fired by the last Trump administration after it came out that he'd attended and spoken at a conference with white nationalists.\n\nBut this experience doesn't seem to have rattled him, in the following years he made many controversial remarks on twitter including that \"Competent white men must be in charge if you want things to work.\"\n\nJust watching the first few weeks of the new President's term indicates that curbing wokeness and cultural liberalism is top of mind for the administration. It's remarkable to look back on polling that shows that the economy , not the war on wokeness, was the top issue for Trump voters.\n\nBut from directing removal of trans Americans in the military to rolling back DEI initiatives throughout the government, the Trump administration has made anti-wokeness a core focus.\n\n[ Music ]\n\nMy name's Jerusalem Demsas, I'm a staff writer at the Atlantic and this is Good on Paper , a policy show that questions what we really know about popular narratives. These past few weeks have had me thinking back to a conversation I had with New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg last year about whether Americans would miss wokeness when it was gone.\n\nNo one, including myself, will defend every part of a movement's form. There were many ridiculous DEI trainings, offensive instances of language policing, and stupid and counterproductive overreactions. But, as Goldberg wrote last year: \"however overwrought the politics of 2020 were, they also represented a rare moment when there was suddenly enormous societal energy to tackle long-festering inequalities.\"\n\nI'm excited to revisit this episode with you all today.\n\nMichelle, welcome to the show.\n\nMichelle Goldberg: Thanks for having me.\n\nDemsas: I read an article you wrote a few months ago, and it was called, \"Wokeness is Dying. We Might Miss It.\" And it's been something I've been reflecting on myself because I think that there's a conventional wisdom that's been built up in traditional media-and then just a lot of our public discourse-that the backlash of the progressive tilt of the 2010s is a good thing, and that we're seeing a good correction of a time period that went too far. And I thought that your article was a really interesting take on that idea.\n\nBut before we get into all that, I wanted to ground us in what we're even talking about. When we talk about wokeness , what are we talking about when you use that term?\n\nGoldberg: Well, it's a hard term to define. I actually rarely use it except in quote marks because it's one of those terms that was-obviously started out in Black vernacular and then was appropriated by people who are really hostile to it.\n\nBasically, any time someone uses woke , you assume that they're using it as an insult. Very few people actually identify their own politics that way. But how I often describe it, even if it's a little clunky, is like a style of social-justice politics that is extremely focused on changing the world by changing the way we talk about the world.\n\nDemsas: It's funny because as I was preparing for this episode, I was just looking back at before the 2010s, and it feels like we had a version of this before then. People would complain about political correctness all the time. And I wonder how you distinguish the two eras. Is this just a piece that has always been in our politics-it just changes forms and maybe the specific issues it cares about?\n\nOr is it actually something completely separate and different?\n\nGoldberg: No. I think it's basically a replay of the political correctness and the political-correctness backlash of the 1990s, which also came about at a time when you were seeing a lot more ethnic-studies, women's-studies, area-studies programs in universities; some academic language starting to filter out into everyday life, a lot of people feeling really annoyed and alienated by that; and then a right-wing backlash, which was out of proportion and was so much more damaging to progressive politics than any gains that they might have made through the evolution and language that people were pushing at the time.\n\nDemsas: So when you chart the beginning of this-I think it's hard because it's fuzzy. I was looking back to see when people really started talking about this. Matt Yglesias has this piece in 2019 in Vox where he coined the term the Great Awokening , and he charts it then as beginning with the 2014 protests in Ferguson after Michael Brown was shot by a police officer. He looks at the increase that you see in polls in concern for racial inequality and discrimination and the simultaneous divergence of the Democratic Party, where you see racially conservative Democrats leave the party.\n\nAnd his story is very focused on race and immigration there. I think there are other people who would go even earlier, and then others who think it really takes off with Hillary Clinton. What time period are you really thinking about?\n\nGoldberg: It's interesting that Matt Yglesias says that. I felt that was also maybe the year that this style of politics became really dominant in certain circles, if not in the culture at large. And I wouldn't just limit it to the debate about race and policing, because I think some of it comes out of Tumblr culture and just the perverse incentives of social media, the perverse incentives of left-wing politics.\n\nI wrote a piece in 2014 for The Nation , where I was a writer at the time, called, \"Feminism's Toxic Twitter Wars.\" And it wasn't about quote, unquote, \"wokeness.\" I don't remember if people were actually using that word at the time. But it was about this really destructive style of competitive self-righteousness. And one of the texts that helped me make sense of what was going on was an essay by a feminist writer named Jo Freeman from the '70s called, \"The Tyranny of Structurelessness,\" that was about how-when you have ostensibly horizontal, leaderless organizations-people do, in fact, fight for power and leaders emerge, but they do it through passive-aggressive and emotionally manipulative means. And so, this has always been an issue on the left; it's just that social media supercharged it.\n\nDemsas: Yeah. I've been thinking about how much of this is a story about technology, right? Social media, as you say-to unpack a bit, there's obviously an incentive to move to the extremes. People often only think about this in terms of talking about politics, in terms of, Oh, people are saying radical things .\n\nBut if you scroll through TikTok or anything-and I'm sure you've seen this stuff, too-you see pretty shocking content in general: people doing weird things with food, really bizarre things with different toys and things in order to just get the viewer confused and really fixated. ( Laughs .)\n\nGoldberg: ( Laughs .) Right. Social media does two things: On the one hand, it just incentivizes extremism because you need to catch people's attention. And extremism can also serve as a form of novelty. But it also-and I've written about this, as well-there used to be this idea that the problem with social media was that it kept people siloed in quote, unquote, \"filter bubbles,\" and I don't think that's the problem. I think the problem is that it exposes you to some of the most obnoxious examples on the other side, so it ends up furthering this negative polarization.\n\nDemsas: Let's turn to the piece that you wrote. You titled it, \"Wokeness Is Dying. We Might Miss It.\" Why is wokeness dying, and why do you miss it?\n\nGoldberg: Obviously, I don't miss all of it. As I write in the piece, there was tons of it that I have always found-I'm kind of a cranky Gen-X person. I didn't like these clunky neologisms. I find some of the language, like the people-first language-I'm trying to think of even-\n\nDemsas: Like saying person without housing , or saying unhoused instead of homeless ?\n\nGoldberg: Right. I do understand some of it. And that's the problem, that all of this you can understand in certain instincts. I do understand that there's certain language that can be really stigmatizing, and that there's reason for language to evolve. I'm watching-my kids are super into 30 Rock right now, and they're constantly saying things on 30 Rock that my kids are like, Oh, my God. You can't say that!\n\nDemsas: ( Laughs .)\n\nGoldberg: And that show-I don't remember at the time feeling particularly provocative. And so the natural evolution of language is often a good thing. The forced evolution of language in a way that feels like it comes down from some really sanctimonious, prissy commissar is not a good thing. Although I just said that, we have to remember that there actually was no commissar.\n\nPeople, I think-in reaction to stuff that really annoyed them, the kind of people who made their identity around opposition to wokeness-they almost had to inflate its danger to match the scale of their annoyance. Rather than something that, like, really bugged them or really seemed obnoxious, it had to be totalitarian. It had to be something that was remaking all of the systems of our society, which I just don't think was ever really true.\n\nBut anyway, there was this very laudable attempt to correct systemic injustices in our society, systemic injustices that were really thrown into high relief for a lot of people by the election of Donald Trump. And one of the reasons I don't like this approach to politics is that changing the way you talk about things is one of the easiest things to do, as opposed to making concrete, material change.\n\nBut nevertheless, it's a step. It was a good thing that people felt less comfortable using certain kind of slurs. Let me put it this way: It was a good thing that when J. D. Vance was writing to one of his left-wing classmates, who I believe he had described as a lesbian, but they were trans, and wrote (these emails have now leaked) this sensitive email that, you know, I love you. I'm sorry if I misgendered you. I hope you know it was coming from a place of respect -I think it was good that conservative men, or all sorts of people, felt the need to be a little bit more thoughtful and sensitive.\n\nObviously, there was plenty of places where it veered into self-parody, and those places were exaggerated and amplified by a social-media panic, which has now led to a really ugly right-wing backlash.\n\nDemsas: The definition you gave for wokeness, too-it really speaks to the idea that it's about language and discourse policing in a way. And I wonder-because it seems almost like a definition that has been won by the opponents of it, right? Because I would imagine the people in the 2010s who are really parts of these movements-whether they're part of #MeToo movement or they're part of racial-justice movements-there were very specific policy ideas and things that they were upset about.\n\nAnd many of them were very popular. Police brutality becomes-even amongst independents and, in some polls, even with Republicans, you see support for measures that would rein back police. Of course, the prosecution of people like Harvey Weinstein was very popular. And then, of course, something like abortion, which is seen as now the best issue for Democrats, is something that's obviously an issue about women's rights and feminism.\n\nBut there's a way in which we've bifurcated these two things that I'm not really sure how to think about. Because, at one point, I totally agree with you: There is clearly an increased focus on what types of things people are saying, but that seems it was at least intended by some people to be a way to get people on board with a policy agenda.\n\nBut those two things seem difficult to also separate. If you're looking for who your allies are and you're like, Who's misgendering trans people? That tells you who's part of your political movement. And I wonder how you think about how we've bifurcated the policy goals of these movements from the discourse policing, and were those two things really necessary to be together?\n\nGoldberg: It's a complicated question. But I would agree with you that the intention of a lot of people was to make real-world change, not just to change the way people talk about things. Do you remember, at a certain point on the internet, there was this taboo against quote, unquote, \"tone policing?\"\n\nDemsas: Yeah.\n\nGoldberg: Which meant, in turn, that it was almost impossible for the left to either make or listen to any kind of critique of its rhetoric or the way it approached people who might be partially on board but not fully on board. And it ended up really alienating a lot of people outright and then creating this rumbling, subterranean resentment that was then able to be harnessed by really sinister forces. And I think it's easy to say, Well, if you were attracted to fascism because you don't like being told what to say or because you're angry about some new terminology, then that's on you. And that shows that you always had these inclinations.\n\nBut people have lots of different inclinations. And it's the job of a social movement to, I think, meet people where they are and draw out the parts of them that you want to encourage.\n\nDemsas: Well, it seems in your piece that you're skeptical about the framing that wokeness has won in any way. And I wonder why you think that, because, from my perspective, I mean, it's obviously hard. People can point to different areas in which different movements have been successful or not.\n\nBut when you look at attitudes amongst the general public on many progressive issues, they've shifted dramatically to the left. And, of course, a lot of that is being driven from people moving really far left within the Democratic Party. But even independents on these issues-they've moved people left on these things.\n\nAnd I think there's also material gains that have happened. People don't talk about these a lot, but in the year after the murder of George Floyd, for instance, half of U.S. states passed legislation in at least one of the following categories: use of force; duty for officers to intervene, report, or render medical aid in instances of police misconduct; or policies relating to law-enforcement misconduct reporting.\n\nGoldberg: Well, can I just say-I don't think we should tar all. Again, I feel like this category of wokeness is so unstable and amorphous. But I definitely would not want to put criminal-justice reform under that auspice, right? When I'm saying that I think this style of politics is dead, I certainly don't mean all left-wing politics, and I don't mean all criminal-justice reform.\n\nWhat's dead is-not only is the Democratic Party trying to memory-hole calls to defund the police, but there was a social pressure to get on board with that language that is completely gone. And so I'm talking about something a little bit more hard to pin down, but something that a lot of people felt and responded to.\n\nThe reason I say it's dead-and I wrote this piece in response to a book by Nellie Bowles called the Morning After the Revolution . It was sort of satirical, but it was also so exaggerated that it was kind of ridiculous. Like at one point she says, I heard people saying that roads were racist. And that didn't come from some asshole teenager; that came from Robert Caro writing about Robert Moses. But I think that, in part, just to either justify her project or to inflate its importance, she said, This movement hasn't calmed down because it lost; it's calmed down because it won.\n\nAnd I think that for some people that means they have to go to various HR workshops or whatever. But let's just look at the evidence: You see company after company dismantling their DEI initiatives, states banning DEI in colleges. One of the examples I gave in that column was a school named after a Confederate general that had changed its name and then decided to change it back.\n\nTarget, for example, responding to these right-wing backlashes, taking Pride merchandise out of a lot of its stores-there was a sense, at one point, that corporate America wanted to ride the social-justice train. And it might have been hypocritical, but it also suggested that they saw these views as ascendant and something that they wanted to latch onto for their own purposes. I don't think they see things like that anymore.\n\n[ Music ]\n\nDemsas: All right. We're going to take a quick break. More with Michelle when we get back.\n\n[ Break ]\n\nDemsas: I just want to run my theory for you why there was such a focus on discourse policing and on language versus these policies. I think that often-and I found that it felt a little disingenuous sometimes-you'd ask people, Hey, it seems like your organization's really focused on these language things. Why are you policing whether someone says they're Latino or Latinx , or something like that. And they would say, Well, we're actually focused on all of these issues that impact people on the material level. And it's like, Yeah, but what are you tweeting about? What is it that you're actually talking about in public constantly? What is your driving ethos?\n\nAnd so, when I see this, I don't think of it as disingenuous. I think a lot of people have read this as sort of a disingenuous thing, that people don't actually care about changing the material reality of people that they're working for. But I think it's actually just that the structures of movement organizations have changed so dramatically, such that movement building is now both really easy and really hard.\n\nAny individual person can put up a flyer or an Instagram graphic and say, Hey, we're gonna do a protest here . And that doesn't require an organizational capacity to really get someone out and be a part of a group. And that means that people are just showing up for something-or not showing up for something-and it's completely unrelated to whether they're being drawn into a broader group.\n\nIn the past, you had an NAACP that could speak credibly and say, We actually have organized the groups and the individuals who care a lot about racial justice in this country. And if you don't vote X or Y way on a bill, that means that we're going to turn up and we're going to protest you. But now they can't credibly say, No one will protest you if you do X or Y , because anyone can do it. And in many ways, that's great.\n\nGoldberg: Did you read this book-a great book by my colleague Zeynep Tufekci-called, Twitter and Tear Gas ?\n\nDemsas: I have not, but I've heard it's a great book.\n\nGoldberg: That's what the book is about.\n\nDemsas: Can you tell us about it?\n\nGoldberg: So the book-I mean, she could obviously speak to it better than I could, but the book is basically about how before social media, your ability to muster a large protest was an outward sign of your organizational capacity, right?\n\nIt meant that you had members. It meant that you had people working on all the stuff that it takes to get people out, and that you were building relationships. And you also had to build an internal structure just in order to get this stuff done, and that structure would be there after the march was over.\n\nNow you have these protests that come together very quickly and virally. But there's nothing to buttress them. And then the issues that I mentioned earlier, with \"The Tyranny of Structurelessness,\" come up. Because, especially in left-wing spaces, there's often an aversion to hierarchy, which makes sense to a point, but you need some lines of organization in order to keep something going. When you don't have that, you do still have people emerge as leaders, but the way that they emerge as leaders is either about cultivating celebrity or shivving other people for not being radical or committed enough.\n\nDemsas: Yeah. I think the horizontal nature of a lot of social movements now, it leads to the point where it becomes actually quite difficult to be a credible partner to or credible bargaining-table member with politicians. Because if they say, We'll do what you're asking us, but that means you have to mobilize your people in support of it , and if you can't credibly do that, then it becomes politically disadvantageous for any politician to work with you.\n\nAnd that doesn't mean I agree with that. I think they should just do what they think is right. But at the same time, what ends up happening then is the places where you can see a lot of pressure is just around virality and around these issues where you don't actually need to work through the formal systems of political power or electoral power. You can work discursively.\n\nGoldberg: I also should say: Somebody who's deep into progressive organizing once told me that they saw this also as just a form of work avoidance. And maybe people don't mean this, but it's just the path of least resistance. The easiest thing to do is to complain about the word somebody is using.\n\nDemsas: But the most cynical argument that I think has been advanced by, especially, a lot of people who are on the right or in the center is that a lot of the movement on liberalization on these views has come from white Democrats, a lot of whom are materially advantaged already. So you have, for instance, people who are maybe homeowners in, or live in, really high cost-of-living cities, and they make a lot of money. And maybe they don't want to see material changes happen, because that would actually affect their lives.\n\nFor instance, I do a lot of reporting on the housing crisis. And it's clear that a lot of people who consider themselves progressives, who fight for a lot of these causes and seem very genuine and caring about that sort of thing, often will revolt if you say, I think that you should allow for affordable housing to exist in your community .\n\nAnd I think that there's some people who take that dynamic and attribute it largely and say, Yeah, the reason they're focusing on whether you're saying the right words is because they don't want to focus on the sorts of material changes that would require something actually being taken from them .\n\nGoldberg: I don't think it's that intentional. I find it very hard to imagine that somebody is saying, I don't want zoning reform in my suburban neighborhood, so I'm going to distract people with a fight over whether it's ableist to say that we're standing up for ourselves . I just don't think that's how people work.\n\nI do think that people who both went to elite colleges, where these concepts are really prevalent, and are highly verbal and work in fields where communication is a central part of the work they do-it's not that surprising that they default to questions of communication when they're involved in politics. And so I think that people have blind spots.\n\nBut, again, I think the right-wing version of this is often that it's a conspiracy to deflect from real challenges to the material privilege of rich, white liberals. And I don't think it's a conspiracy.\n\nDemsas: Yeah. I think your previous frame is more likely correct-that it is more a path-of-least-resistance argument. But that also, I think, still implicates people in this, Why is it the path of least resistance for you not to want to allow people who make less money than you to live in your neighborhood? Why is that so difficult to mobilize people around? And maybe it's not intentional, but that is just a harder thing to do.\n\nAnd so you see organizers at the local level-they're often like, Well, we can get people to sign onto an agreement to get the city to raise a Pride flag, but we can't get people to change the school-boundary lines near them to make it more inclusive to lower-income kids where they go to school . So there is a reason why I think progressive activists get pushed in a direction. And I do think that there's probably some truth to the idea that the material changes would be much less politically popular.\n\nBut I want to turn a little bit because a lot of your writing is about feminism that I've followed for years now. And you wrote an article called, \"The Future Isn't Female Anymore,\" and that's very much in line with what we're talking about today, so I'm hoping you talk a little bit about that piece. In it, you cite a poll from the Southern Poverty Law Center that asks respondents whether they agree that \"feminism has done more harm than good.\" And you write that while only four percent of Democratic men over 50 thought feminism was harmful, 46 percent of Democratic men under 50 did. And nearly a quarter of Democratic women under 50 agreed that feminism has done more harm than good.\n\nAnd so you see this split here, where you have older Democrats still towing the familiar line that feminism is, of course, on net, beneficial, and then younger folks increasingly feel that their feminism has done more harm than good.\n\nAnd that's among Democrats. What's happening there, and why is this space really polarizing people?\n\nGoldberg: I don't think it's younger folks. I mean, yeah, there is a section of women, but, in general, I think it's younger men. I remember when I quoted that poll, a lot of people were suspicious of it, and you can always have one poll that's an outlier, but there's been a few polls since then that show that young men, specifically, are moving to the right. And there's a growing political chasm between young women and young men that was really showing up a lot in the polling around the upcoming election. And I also just think there was a broader backlash.\n\nIt'll be interesting because we're at a different inflection point now. When I wrote that, there was a backlash to the idea of the girl boss. It had suddenly become really embarrassing to a lot of people, which, on the one hand-a backlash against unfettered ambition and burnout-inducing devotion to your career-I get that. But it came along with the rise of tradwives and stay-at-home girlfriends and these old forms of female subservience in hip, new clothing.\n\nAnd you see this again and again in the history of feminism, right? Because it's hard to work. It's hard to work and be a parent and fulfill all the expectations of ideal womanhood. People will look at being a kept woman of various guises and think that that's an out. You saw this with Susan Faludi's Backlash , and then you saw it with a whole bunch of articles about women stepping back from the workplace.\n\nDemsas: And who is Susan Faludi?\n\nGoldberg: Susan Faludi wrote one of the classics of modern feminism in a book called Backlash , which came out in the early 1990s and was about basically a decade of backlash propaganda telling women that feminism had made them miserable and that women wanted to return to cocooning and wanted to return to domesticity.\n\nAnd what you see when you actually look at the people who are pushing this message is either that they're not doing it themselves-you know, Martha Stewart was certainly never a homemaker, but neither was Phyllis Schlafly, right? These are professional women with high-powered careers. Or else you see women who do do that and then find themselves in really precarious situations if it falls apart. And so, again, there was this moment where, We don't need girl-boss feminism. We want a soft life . You know, don't we all? ( Laughs .)\n\nDemsas: ( Laughs .)\n\nGoldberg: But there was a refusal to see the traps that generations of feminists have identified in that life. Now we're at a different moment because you're starting to see women get really, really excited about the prospect of a female president again and getting really, really angry about patriarchy. Obviously, the Dobbs decision that ended Roe v. Wade was a big turning point for that. The Kamala Harris campaign is a big turning point.\n\nIt was interesting because when Hillary Clinton ran for president, there was always a dearth of organic enthusiasm compared to, say, Barack Obama. But there were people who were really, really excited about Hillary Clinton and were really, really excited about having a woman president. But a lot of them felt really embarrassed and afraid to admit that publicly.\n\nI remember going to some of the places after Donald Trump was elected, going to some of the suburban communities where these women who hadn't been very political before had suddenly gotten really political because they were so outraged and disgusted. And often they were like, I didn't even realize there were other Democrats on my street . And so there was this sheepishness. And now that sheepishness is totally gone. It's pretty new, but this is the first female campaign for president that is being really carried aloft on a tide of very vocal popular excitement.\n\nDemsas: Yeah. Well, when I think about the wokeness message, the presidential candidate that tried to do this the most was Ron DeSantis, and it didn't really work out for him. He obviously is not the presidential nominee for the Republican Party, but he also flamed out in a way that I think people were not expecting.\n\nThere was a ton of enthusiasm after he won his race by around 20 electoral points in Florida, when he ran for re-election for governor. And he was very clear on the national, at the local, at the state level that he was fighting a war on woke. But then you saw this message falter. You saw it falter in the Republican Party. People were much less interested in polls for voting for someone who's fighting wokeness than they were for people who were following traditional economic messaging. And obviously he himself did not do well there.\n\nGoldberg: Although, let's remember-let's look at who the Republicans chose as their vice president. J. D. Vance-he gave a speech at the National Conservatism Conference in 2021 that was called, \"The Universities Are the Enemy,\" and it was all about-I don't know how much he used the word wokeness , but that's basically what it was about. And he is obsessed with this stuff. It's part of what makes him weird.\n\nDemsas: I agree with you. I think it's interesting because it seemed like, at the end, Trump was between the North Dakota governor, Doug Burgum, who's a much more traditional Republican, and he ends up picking J. D. Vance, who I think is part of this wing of the party that's defined themselves by wokeness.\n\nDuring the Olympics, Imane Khelif, who is an Algerian boxer, beat an Italian boxer Angela Carini at the Paris Olympics, and it sparks this conservative outcry. Khelif is a cis woman; she was assigned female at birth and continues to identify as such. But people have really turned on her as being a man. J. D. Vance literally tweeted that Khelif was \"a grown man pummeling a woman.\" He called it \"disgusting\" and blamed Kamala Harris's ideas about gender.\n\nThis is obviously a very small vignette in a bunch of different areas in which you've seen the right radicalize in this space. But, to me, while of course Trump did pick Vance, it doesn't seem like this is actually a message that's a winning message for voters. I think a lot of people feel that this is actually going in the same way that maybe wokeness harmed the Democratic Party in some ways-that this version is actually not palatable to even Republican voters, but definitely not to independents or swing voters.\n\nThere's polling-this is when Biden was the presumptive nominee, from May-by Data for Progress that asked 1,200 voters whether they think Joe Biden's woke. And 21 percent said they didn't know what that meant. Twenty-seven percent said they didn't care. And 22 percent were the only people that said he was woke and that was a bad thing. So how much of this is just a fight that's really happening but is not actually electorally relevant or even electorally desirable?\n\nGoldberg: Well, I don't think it's super electorally relevant in that, yes, vanishingly few people, if you ask them, What are the issues that are important to you? are going to say any version of wokeness. Where I think it's relevant is around the edges.\n\nI think that people really underestimate just how much of politics is about emotion and how much of it is about how candidates make you feel. And so whether the language that candidates use resonates with you or is alienating to you really matters. Again, this is where I say that a lot of these linguistic changes, I feel like, are irritating and alienating, but that's very different from saying that they're part of some totalitarian conspiracy, which is often how the anti-woke side comes off. And so I think it's why even voters, again, to the extent that they're even aware of these arguments over linguistic conventions-and I think they are in a vague way.\n\nDemsas: Especially at the office, if you have DEI training or something like that.\n\nGoldberg: Right, or even just when I would go to Trump rallies, the thing I would hear over and over again-I remember in 2016, I would try to draw them out. You know, Did a factory close around here? Are you having trouble getting a job? But mostly it was like, No. But you just can't say anything anymore. There was just so much anger. And then sometimes you would ask them what they wanted to say, and you'd be like, Oh yeah. You definitely can't say that . ( Laughs .) And you shouldn't be able to say that. But I do think that it grates on people. But there's a difference between it grating on people and it being an all-consuming fixation.\n\nDemsas: Yeah. Well, how do we then understand the nascent Kamala Harris campaign? Because you've been doing some reporting about her campaign. And her candidacy, as you said, it's a historic candidacy. She's the first Black woman and South Asian woman presumptive nominee for a major party ticket. She will be only the second woman to achieve that, after Clinton.\n\nOne thing I think that's interesting is Clinton really leaned into her identity as a woman. And there's some reporting that indicates she was trying to follow the mold of Obama, who clearly made that a part of his historic rise and tapped into that \"first\" energy to build momentum.\n\nHarris seems to be tackling that quite differently. I know you said that you're seeing this energy finally out in the open, of women getting to be excited publicly for the first female potential president. But, at the same time, it seems like there's not as much attempt on the part of her and her team-at least so far-to really lean into that. Are you seeing that?\n\nGoldberg: Right. And she doesn't need to. Well, no, she doesn't need to. And I don't see any reason why she should. The people who are excited about it are getting excited about it.\n\nDemsas: But why not? Why not lean into it?\n\nGoldberg: First of all, because most people I think who are really, really excited to vote for the first woman candidate for president, the first Black woman candidate for president, the first Asian American woman candidate for president-those people are mostly voting for Harris. She doesn't really need to remind them of the historic nature of her candidacy.\n\nAnd she does in some ways, right? She speaks to the AKAs, the other members of her Black sorority. But I just think that, for the people that she needs to win over, she needs to convince them that she's going to make their lives better in some tangible, material way, rather than achieving a symbolic victory for certain identity groups.\n\nLook, obviously the identity component is there. You see people self-organizing these huge Zoom calls. But I guess the difference is that it would have been a big mistake for the Harris campaign to take the lead on doing that kind of stuff. People want to do it themselves. You can see that that's really powerful.\n\nDemsas: I also think that because she avoided a primary, it was much less important to base mobilization that that rhetoric would sometimes be used. You'd encourage it in that case, right? I think Warren and Harris both leaned into this during the 2020 presidential primaries-their historic nature of their candidacy. There were lots of references to Shirley Chisholm in Harris's 2020 primary.\n\nGoldberg: Oh, yeah. And I saw people wearing Shirley Chisholm shirts at the Harris rally in Atlanta. People are obviously really aware of it. I think you're right about the primary. She didn't need to distinguish herself in that way in a primary.\n\nAnd the fact that there was (a) no primary and (b) that so many Democrats feel like they were saved from near-certain doom means that the fissures that are usually left over after a really bruising primary just aren't there.\n\nDemsas: Well, thank you so much, Michelle. I've been reading your work for years, and I'm so glad to have you come on the show.\n\nGoldberg: Oh, thanks for having me.\n\nDemsas: I want to ask you our last question, which is: What's an idea that seemed good at the time but ended up being only good on paper?\n\nGoldberg: I'm going to say communism.\n\nDemsas: Oh, okay. Tell me more.\n\nGoldberg: I mean, I'm honestly surprised that anybody answers anything else. ( Laughs .) It just seems so obvious-it just seems obvious to me that, at a time when industrial capitalism was so brutal and exploitative, along comes this utopian theory promising human equality, gender equality, the brotherhood of man, the end of poverty, right? I don't know if you have kids, but my kids-and I think a lot of people have this experience-when they first learn about communism, they're like, Yeah, that sounds great. It does sound great. It just has not worked.\n\nDemsas: Yeah. Well, that is the most one-word-only-needed \"good on paper\" we've heard so far. ( Laughs .)\n\nGoldberg: ( Laughs .)\n\nDemsas: Usually it does require a lot more explanation. Communism-good on paper. Thank you again for coming on the show. We're so excited to have you on and continue following your work as you write about this issue on the campaign trail.\n\n[ Music ]\n\nGoldberg: Thank you so much.\n\nDemsas: This episode of Good on Paper was produced by Jinae West and Rosie Hughes.

      "text": "Where the New Identity Politics Went Wrong\n\nDon't let right-wing culture warriors obscure the fact that some ideas behind this progressive ideology have genuine problems.\n\nListen to more stories on curio\n\nUpdated at 6:00 p.m. ET on September 26, 2023\n\nI n universities and newspapers , nonprofit organizations and even corporations, a new set of ideas about race, gender, and sexual orientation has gained huge influence. Attitudes to these ideas-which are commonly called \"woke,\" though I prefer a more neutral term, the \"identity synthesis\"-have split into two camps: those who blame them for all of America's ills and those who defend them, largely uncritically.\n\nRight-wing polemicists deride these ideas as a form of \"cultural Marxism,\" which has substituted identity categories such as race for the economic category of class but still aims at the same old goal of communist revolution. They invoke wokeness to oppose anything they dislike, such as sex ed and insufficiently patriotic versions of American history.\n\nOn the other side, many people in media and politics claim that wokeness is simply a matter of justice and decency: a willingness to acknowledge the cruelties of America's past and a recognition of the ways they still shape the country. \"Being woke,\" Joe Walsh, a former Republican congressman who became a vocal critic of Donald Trump, has said , \"just means being empathetic.\"\n\nAdam Serwer: 'Woke capital' doesn't exist\n\nEach position mischaracterizes these ideas, obscuring their true nature. Over recent decades, writers, activists, and scholars have melded a diverse set of ideas inspired by postmodernism, postcolonialism, and critical race theory into a new worldview that animates today's progressive movements. It now constitutes a genuinely novel ideology, which has radically transformed what it means to be left-wing.\n\nAmid all the contention, this ideology deserves assessment in a more evenhanded manner, one that weighs what is interesting or potentially useful about its tenets against the ways in which it undercuts the very values it claims to advance. And the key to a more sophisticated understanding and critique of these ideas lies in the story of where they came from.\n\nA t the beginning , there was Michel Foucault.\n\nIn his early years, the French philosopher was shaped by the fashionable \"grand narratives\" of his time. When he studied with the Hegelian philosopher Jean Hyppolite, Foucault imbibed the idea that history should be understood as the gradual realization of freedom in the world. When, a few years later, he went on to study with the Marxist thinker Louis Althusser, a passionate defender of the Soviet Union, Foucault embraced the idea that liberation would come in the form of the proletariat staging a worldwide revolution. In 1950, Foucault joined the French Communist Party, which was unquestioningly loyal to Joseph Stalin.\n\nYet Foucault soon chafed at the Marxist orthodoxy demanded by his comrades, leaving the party by 1953. \"Over anyone who pretended to be on the left,\" he would later complain, the party \"laid down the law. One was either for or against; an ally or an adversary.\" He became an adversary.\n\nThis combination of a commitment to left-wing ideals and a mistrust of grand narratives that justify coercion, including Marxism, constitutes the core of Foucault's published work. In book after book, he argued against modern societies' complacent assumption that they had made progress in the way they punish criminals or treat the mentally ill. Doubting claims to objective truth, Foucault believed that societies had become not more humane but merely more effective at controlling their subjects.\n\nThis paved the way for Foucault's most influential argument, about the true nature of power. Power, he argued, is much more indirect than the top-down model traditionally taught in civics classes. Because real power lies in the normative assumptions embedded in the discourses that structure our society and the identity labels we use to make sense of the world, it is \"produced from one moment to the next, at every point.\"\n\nThis belief made Foucault deeply skeptical about the perfectibility of our social world. People would always chafe against the form that power takes at any given moment in history: \"Where there is power, there is resistance,\" he wrote. But this resistance, if successful, would itself come to exercise a power of its own. Even the most noble struggle, Foucault warned his readers, would contain within itself the seed of new forms of oppression.\n\nThomas Chatterton Williams: You can't define woke\n\nFoucault left his devotees with a complicated legacy. On the one hand, they recognized that his philosophy allowed them to question the prevailing assumptions and institutions of their age, including claims to objective truth or universal validity. On the other hand, Foucault's pessimism about the possibility of creating a less oppressive world disappointed them. As Noam Chomsky told me 50 years after a famous encounter with Foucault for a televised debate at a Dutch university, he had \"never seen such an amoral-not immoral, amoral-person in my life.\"\n\nIn the late 1970s and '80s, a series of postcolonial thinkers, such as Edward Said and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, set out to resolve this tension. Simultaneously influenced by Foucault and uncomfortable with his fatalistic conclusions, their ambition was to infuse the prospect for political agency back into his ideas.\n\nE dward Said , a Palestinian American literary theorist who taught at Columbia University, shot to fame by arguing that the way Western writers had imagined the \"Orient\" helped them wield power over it, causing real-world harm. Explicitly acknowledging his debt to \"Michel Foucault's notion of a discourse,\" he claimed that analyzing the discourse of \"Orientalism\" was crucial to understanding \"the enormously systematic discipline by which European culture was able to manage-and even produce-the Orient politically, sociologically, militarily, ideologically, scientifically, and imaginatively.\"\n\nThis \"discipline\" of Oriental Studies cloaked itself as a scholarly tradition that claimed to be politically neutral, even objective. In reality, argued Said, \"political imperialism governs an entire field of study, imagination, and scholarly institutions.\" Historically, Western representations of the East justified colonial rule. Since then, Said argued, a newer set of ideas about the \"Arab mind\" had helped motivate U.S. interventions in the Middle East. Said's goal was to free his readers from the pernicious power Orientalist assumptions still held.\n\nThis critique prepared the ground for a more politically engaged adaptation of postmodernism. For many of Orientalism 's readers, it seemed clear that the goal of cultural analysis should be to help those who have the least power. They sought to change the dominant discourse to help the oppressed resist the oppressor.\n\nPostcolonial scholars took Said's work as a model for how to apply discourse analysis to explicitly political ends. A new wave of researchers concerned with such topics as gender, the media, and the experiences of migrants and ethnic minorities quickly embraced their toolkit. In time, the idea that a lot of political activism might revolve around critiquing dominant discourses or labeling certain cultural artifacts as \"problematic\" went mainstream, finding currency on social-media platforms and in traditional newspapers.\n\nFranklin Foer: The new Republican battle cry\n\nF oucault's legacy left postcolonial scholars with a second obstacle. In rejecting grand narratives, he had not only turned against the idea of universal values or objective truth; he was also arguing that identity labels such as \"women,\" \"proletarians,\" and the \"masses of the Third World\" were reductive. Such generalizations, he claimed, create the illusion that a hugely varied group of people share some essential set of characteristics; this misperception could even help perpetuate injustices. The oppressed, Foucault observed, do not need intellectuals to speak on their behalf.\n\nSpivak, an Indian literary scholar, strongly disagreed. Parisian philosophes , she argued, could take their social standing for granted. But the people with whom she was most concerned had none of their resources and enjoyed no such recognition. In countries such as India, she concluded in her most celebrated article, the \"subaltern\" cannot speak.\n\nThis presented Spivak, who had made her name as an interpreter of postmodernist philosophers, with a dilemma. How could she stay true to her distrust of dominant discourses, including identity categories, while speaking on behalf of the marginalized groups for which she felt a deep kinship? The key to doing better, she argued, was to embrace identity markers that could prove useful in practice even if they might be suspect in theory. \"I think we have to choose again strategically,\" she suggested, \"not universal discourse but essentialist discourse ... I must say I am an essentialist from time to time.\"\n\nThese cryptic remarks took on a life of their own. Faced with the problem of how to speak for the oppressed, scholars from numerous disciplines followed Spivak's example. They continued in the spirit of postmodernism to cast doubt on claims of scientific objectivity or universal principles. At the same time, they insisted on using broad identity categories and speaking for the downtrodden by embracing what they came to call \"strategic essentialism.\"\n\nOver time, Spivak's paradoxical compromise became a political rallying cry. Today, activists who carefully acknowledge that race or gender or ability status \"is a social construct\" nevertheless go on to make surprisingly essentializing claims about what, say, brown people or women or the disabled believe and demand.\n\nThe embrace of strategic essentialism also helps explain the logic behind the rise of new social customs, such as the establishment of racially separate \"affinity groups\" in many progressive spaces. Spivak came to believe that a commitment to identity categories such as race was strategically useful. Many progressives took this to mean that activists-and even grade-school students-should be encouraged to conceive of themselves first and foremost in racial terms.\n\nS lowly but surely , these ideas gained traction in different parts of academia, including law schools. A new generation of legal scholars set out to question long-held beliefs about the judiciary, such as the idea that judges made decisions based on fine points of legal doctrine rather than on their own worldview or self-interest. But one member of this emerging tradition who proved especially influential argued that it had a crucial blind spot of its own: race.\n\nDerrick Bell was a Black lawyer who spent the 1960s doing heroic work in the fight for desegregation. As an attorney for the NAACP's Legal Defense and Educational Fund, his mission was to win compliance with the major judicial victories of the civil-rights era, such as Brown v. Board of Education . In total, he helped oversee some 300 cases involving the desegregation of schools and businesses.\n\nAt first, Bell found his work exhilarating. But the longer he stayed in the job, the more dispirited he became. His lawsuits took so long to wind their way through the courts that many of the boys and girls he represented were adults by the time the school they'd hoped to attend was integrated.\n\nEven then, progress could prove illusory. As Black schools were dissolved, many good Black teachers lost their jobs. And as white schools were integrated, many parents chose to send their kids to private schools, or moved out of the neighborhood altogether. In the end, some of the newly \"integrated\" schools were still predominantly Black and still suffered from a lack of resources.\n\nAdam Serwer: Trumpism is 'identity politics' for white people\n\nThese disappointments transformed Bell's thinking. By the time his first major scholarly article appeared, in 1976, Bell had come to reject basic assumptions that had underpinned his earlier work as a litigator. Expanding on an argument that-as Bell himself acknowledged-had originally been advanced by segregationists, he warned that civil-rights lawyers, caught between their clients' wishes and their own ideals, were trying to \"serve two masters.\"\n\n\"Having convinced themselves that Brown stands for desegregation and not education,\" Bell complained, \"the established civil rights organizations steadfastly refuse to recognize reverses in the school desegregation campaign-reverses which, to some extent, have been precipitated by their rigidity.\" Civil-rights lawyers needed instead to listen to their Black clients, Bell said. According to him, that meant becoming more open to creating schools that were (to reappropriate the disingenuous segregationist mantra) more truly \"separate but equal.\"\n\nBell's skepticism about the civil-rights movement also made him distrust the idea that the racial attitudes of most Americans were improving. \"Racism,\" he contended, is not \"a holdover from slavery that the nation both wants to cure and is capable of curing\"; rather, it is \"an integral, permanent, and indestructible component of this society.\" The civil-rights movement might have succeeded in making discrimination \"less visible,\" but, he wrote in the early 1990s, racism had become \"neither less real nor less oppressive.\"\n\nAccording to Bell, the legal remedies implemented during the civil-rights era, such as school desegregation, would never suffice to overcome the legacy of slavery. It was high time, he wrote in a 1992 paper, for a \"review and replacement of the now defunct racial equality ideology.\" To win lasting progress, Bell proposed, would require more than nominal equality; it would take explicit group rights that compensated the marginalized. He and his followers called for policies that openly distinguished among citizens on the basis of skin color, so that those who had historically been oppressed would henceforth receive preferential treatment.\n\nBell died in 2011. A decade later, his ideas are enjoying a second life as an avowedly anti-racist left is embracing his call for race-sensitive public policy. The determination to put \"racial equity\" before old-fashioned forms of \"racial equality\" is evident today in many public policies, such as when, in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, the Small Business Administration prioritized nonwhite restaurant owners for emergency relief funds.\n\nM uch of today's progressive politics is a popularized version of what I call the \"identity synthesis.\" To a remarkable extent, the ideas, norms, and practices that have become so prevalent on social media and in corporate diversity trainings owe a debt to these four thinkers in particular. They are rooted in a deep skepticism about objective truth inspired by Foucault, the use of discourse analysis for explicitly political ends taken from Said, an embrace of essentialist categories of identity derived from Spivak, and a preference for public policies that explicitly tie the treatment a person receives to their group identity, as advocated by Bell. (Kimberlé Crenshaw, the Black feminist legal scholar who coined the idea of \"intersectionality,\" which has since taken on a life of its own, might be considered another key member of this progressive pantheon.)\n\nThe mainstream influence of these ideas makes all the more interesting the fact that several of these thinkers came to have misgivings about the uses to which they were put. Foucault, who died in 1984, would, I suspect, have been quick to remind his devotees that the impulse to reshape discourses for political ends can, despite the liberatory aim, readily morph into new forms of repression.\n\nSaid, who died in 2003, addressed the problem explicitly. \"Identity,\" he wrote shortly before his death, is \"as boring a subject as one can imagine.\" For that reason, he admonished, \"marginality and homelessness are not, in my opinion, to be gloried in; they are to be brought to an end, so that more, and not fewer, people can enjoy the benefits of what has for centuries been denied the victims of race, class, or gender.\"\n\nGraeme Wood: What happens when a carnival barker writes intellectual history\n\nSpivak, too, was forthright about her dismay at how the idea of strategic essentialism had helped forge a new ideology. Praising the \"political use of humor\" by African Americans, she lamented its absence among today's \"university identity wallahs.\"\n\nT he identity-synthesis advocates are driven by a noble ambition: to remedy the historic injustices that scar every country, including America. These injustices are and remain real. Although social movements and legislative reforms can help address them, the practice of politics, as the sociologist Max Weber famously wrote, is the \"strong and slow boring of hard boards.\" It rarely provides remedies as quickly or as comprehensively as hoped-leading some to conclude that a more radical break with the status quo is needed.\n\nThe appeal of the synthesis stems from promising just that. It claims to lay the conceptual groundwork necessary to remake the world by overcoming the reverence for long-standing principles that supposedly constrain our ability to achieve true equality. Advocates of the identity synthesis reject universal values like free speech as distractions that conceal and perpetuate the marginalization of minority groups. Trying to make progress toward a more just society by redoubling efforts to realize such ideals, its advocates claim, is a fool's errand.\n\nBut these ideas will fail to deliver on their promises. For all their good intentions, they undermine progress toward genuine equality among members of different groups. Despite its allure, the identity synthesis turns out to be a trap.\n\nAs the identity synthesis has gained in influence, its flaws have become harder to ignore. A striking number of progressive advocacy groups, for example, have been consumed by internal meltdowns in recent years. \"We used to want to make the world a better place,\" a leader of one progressive organization complained recently . \"Now we just make our organizations more miserable to work at.\" As institutions such as the Sierra Club and the ACLU have implemented the norms inspired by the identity synthesis, they have had more difficulty serving their primary missions.\n\nThe identity synthesis is also starting to remake public policy in ways that are more likely to create a society of warring tribes. In the early months of the pandemic, for example, a key advisory committee to the CDC recommended that states prioritize essential workers in the rollout of scarce vaccines rather than the elderly, in part because \"racial and ethnic minorities are underrepresented\" among seniors. Not only did this policy, according to the CDC's own models, have the probable outcome of increasing the overall number of Americans who would perish in the pandemic; it also placed different ethnic groups in competition with one another for lifesaving medications.\n\nConor Friedersdorf: Intersectionality is not the problem\n\nWhen decision makers appear out of touch with the values and priorities of most citizens, demagogues thrive. The well-founded fears roused by the election of Trump accelerated the ascendancy of the identity synthesis in many elite institutions. Conversely, the newfound hold that these ideas now have over such institutions makes it more likely that he might win back the White House in 2024. The identity synthesis and far-right populism may at first glance appear to be polar opposites; in political practice, one is the yin to the other's yang.\n\nMany attacks on so-called wokeness are motivated by bad faith. They fundamentally misrepresent its nature. But that is no reason to deny how a new ideology has acquired such power in our society. In fact, it's imperative to recognize that its founders explicitly saw themselves as rejecting widely held values, such as the core tenets of the civil-rights movement.\n\nThe lure of the identity synthesis to so many people is a desire to overcome persistent injustices and create a society of genuine equals. But the likely outcome of uncritically accepting this ideology is a society that places an unremitting emphasis on our differences. The effect is to pit rigidly defined identity groups against one another in a zero-sum battle for resources and recognition.\n\nCritics of the identity trap commonly claim that progressive activists are \"going too far.\" But what is at issue is not having too much of a good thing. The real problem is that, even at its best, this ideology violates the ardent aspirations for a better future to which all of us should remain committed.\n\nThis essay is adapted from The Identity Trap: A Story of Ideas and Power in Our Time , which is out today.\n\nWhen you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

      "text": "How the Woke Right Replaced the Woke Left\n\nThe hypocrisy of Trump's language wars\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nUpdated at 1:19 p.m. E.T. on February 20, 2025\n\nOne of the defining features of the social-justice orthodoxy that swept through American culture between roughly the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012 to Hamas's assault on Israel in 2023 was the policing of language. Many advocates became obsessed with enforcing syntactical etiquette and banishing certain words.\n\n\"Wokeness,\" as it's known, introduced the asymmetrical capitalization of the letter b in Black but not the w in white . It forced Romance languages like Spanish to submit to gender-neutral constructions such as Latinx . It called for the display of pronouns in email signatures and social-media bios. It replaced a slew of traditional words and phrases: People were told to stop saying master bedroom , breastfeeding , manpower , and brown-bag lunch , and to start saying primary bedroom , chestfeeding , workforce , and sack lunch . At the extreme, it designated certain words-such as crazy -beyond redemption.\n\nThis was often a nuisance and sometimes a trap, causing the perpetual sense that one might inadvertently offend and consequently self-destruct. In certain industries and professions, wrongspeak had tangible consequences. In 2018, Twitter introduced a policy against \" dehumanizing language \" and posts that \"deadnamed\" transgender users (or referred to them by their pre-transition names). Those who were judged to have violated the rules could be banned or suspended.\n\nDonald Trump promised that his election would free Americans from ever having to worry about saying the wrong thing again. He even signed an executive order titled \" Restoring Freedom of Speech and Ending Federal Censorship .\" But a few weeks into his administration, we hardly find ourselves enjoying a culture of free speech and tolerance for opposing views. Almost immediately, the president did the opposite of what he'd promised and put together his own linguistic proscriptions. Most of the banned words related to gender and diversity, and this time the rules had the force of the government behind them.\n\n\"Fear that other words could run afoul of the new edicts led anxious agency officials to come up with lists of potentially problematic words on their own,\" wrote Shawn McCreesh in The New York Times . These included: \"Equity. Gender. Transgender. Nonbinary. Pregnant people. Assigned male at birth. Antiracist. Trauma. Hate speech. Intersectional. Multicultural. Oppression. Such words were scrubbed from federal websites.\"\n\nPlus ça change. The government itself determining the limits of acceptable speech is undeniably far more chilling and pernicious-and potentially unconstitutional-than private actors attempting to do so. But what is most striking about this dismal back-and-forth is how well it demonstrates that the illiberal impulse to dictate what can and cannot be said is always fundamentally the same, whether it appears on the right or the left.\n\nAn extraordinary number of conservatives have ignored and even delighted in their side's astonishing hypocrisy. But a few consistent defenders of free speech have not gone along with what they see as the new \"woke right.\"\n\nThe pervasive and nitpicky control of language is a crucial, but far from the sole, component of the woke-right movement. Like its antithesis on the left, the woke right places identity grievance, ethnic consciousness, and tribal striving at the center of its behavior and thought. One of the best descriptions I can find of it comes from Kevin DeYoung, a pastor and seminary professor, in a 2022 article called \" The Rise of Right-Wing Wokeism .\" DeYoung, reviewing a book on Christian nationalism in The Gospel Coalition , argues that the book's \"apocalyptic vision - for all of its vitriol toward the secular elites-borrows liberally from the playbook of the left.\" It \"redefines the nature of oppression as psychological oppression\" and tells white and male right-wing Americans that they are the country's real victims. But \"the world is out to get you, and people out there hate you,\" DeYoung warns, \"is not a message that will ultimately help white men or any other group that considers themselves oppressed.\"\n\nAnother hallmark of wokeness is an overriding impulse to contest and revise the historical record in service of contemporary debates. The New York Times ' \"1619 Project,\" which reimagined this nation's founding, was emblematic of this trend from the left. But similar attempts are happening on the right. Last summer, the amateur historian Darryl Cooper caused an uproar when he made the case, on Tucker Carlson's podcast, that Winston Churchill was the real villain of World War II.\n\nThe compelled politesse of the left has been swapped out for the reflexive and gratuitous disrespect of the right. Representative Mary Miller of Illinois recently introduced Representative Sarah McBride, Congress's sole transgender member, as \"the gentleman from Delaware, Mr. McBride.\" The activist Christopher Rufo, one of the most belligerent voices on the right, endorsed the move: \"We are all tempted to be polite,\" he wrote on X. \"But complicity in the pronoun game is the opening ante for the entire lie. Once you agree to falsify reality, you have signaled your submission to the gender cult.\"\n\nSpeaking of falsifying reality: The Trump administration seems to be devoting a remarkable amount of energy toward making sure people call the Gulf of Mexico the \"Gulf of America.\" In the White House press room last week, the administration went so far as to eject Associated Press reporters because the publication refused to alter its stylebook to comply with the change. \"I was very up front in my briefing on Day 1 that if we feel that there are lies being pushed by outlets in this room, we are going to hold those lies accountable,\" the White House press secretary said . \"And it is a fact that the body of water off the coast of Louisiana is called the Gulf of America.\" European exploration records have referred to El Golfo de México since the 16th century.\n\nTrump supporters fell immediately into line. Representative Mike Collins of Georgia-in a gesture encapsulating the digital-political fusion that has come to define the woke right-tweeted trollingly, \"Stop deadnaming the Gulf of America.\"\n\nJust as corporations genuflected at the altar of wokeness during and after the summer of 2020-posting their identical black squares on Instagram and Facebook and, in the case of Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, and CBS Sports, pausing their content for a symbolic eight minutes and 46 seconds-some of the country's most prominent companies have preemptively submitted to the woke right's new power play. Google and Apple have both relabeled the Gulf of Mexico on their map apps with Trump's risible neologism. And an NPR analysis of regulatory filings found that \"at least a dozen of the largest U.S. companies have deleted some, or all, references to 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' and 'DEI' from their most recent annual reports to investors.\"\n\nSome state leaders are following in Trump's footsteps. In January, Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders issued the \"Executive Order to Respect the Latino Community by Eliminating Culturally Insensitive Words From Official Use in Government\"-a loquacious way to say she ordered state agencies to stop using the word Latinx . Others, including Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, were woke right avant la lettre . The 2022 Individual Freedom Law, paradoxically known as the \"Stop WOKE\" act-developed under Rufo's guidance-imagines the state as one enormous, humid safe space. The legislation aggressively restricts speech in workplaces, K-12 schools, and public universities, and even encourages snitching on community members who dare to advance illicit perspectives.\n\nAll of these moves are ripe for mockery-and they deserve it. The scholar and provocateur James Lindsay gained a large online following in 2018 after he and two colleagues successfully placed a number of outrageously bogus papers in peer-reviewed academic journals focused on what Lindsay called \"grievance studies,\" including one text arguing that dogs engage in \"rape culture\" and another that rewrote Mein Kampf from a feminist point of view. Last year, Lindsay applied the same test to the woke right, cribbing 2,000 words from Marx and Engels's Communist Manifesto and submitting them as a critique of liberalism to The American Reformer , a respected platform in conservative Christian media. The gag ran under the title \"The Liberal Consensus and the New Christian Right.\"\n\n\"What the Woke Right fundamentally don't understand as they make their bid for power now, and why they'll lose,\" Lindsay wrote last week on X, \"is that none of us want more ideological crazy stuff. We don't want another freaking movement. We want to go back to our lives.\" The obligation to call people aliens or unlearn the name of a body of water appears every bit as petty as the prohibition on describing boring things as \"lame.\" More than that, it amounts to a politics of brute domination, a forced and demoralizing expression of subservience that only a genuine fanatic could abide.\n\nVoters in both parties are already signaling that the right's woke antics are unattractive to them. When it comes to its edgelord in chief, Elon Musk, an Economist /YouGov poll found that the share of Republicans who say he should have \"a lot\" of influence has dropped significantly over the past three months, to 26 percent. Seventeen percent say they want him to have no influence \"at all.\" Over the past two weeks, Trump's approval rating has fallen.\n\nThe truth is that most Americans bristle at wokeness from whichever direction it arrives. As the left is learning now, no victory can ever be final. The right's illiberal zeal only creates the conditions for an equal and opposite reaction to come.\n\nThis article originally referred to brave as being on a list of words to avoid. In fact, the list recommended avoiding brave as a noun, not avoiding the word entirely."

      "text": "The Not-So-Woke Generation Z\n\nThe same young people once derided as liberal snowflakes are moving to the right.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nFor years, Gen Z has been either derided or praised for supposedly being \"woke.\" Its members have been called snowflakes, mocked for performative \"slacktivism \" and embracing trigger warnings , and described (favorably and unfavorably) as climate warriors and gun-control activists. Some older commentators have even proclaimed them the nation's last hope . (The number of people who've argued that Gen Z might \"save the world\" is ... not small.)\n\nBut that progressive reputation was called into question when Donald Trump won last week's presidential election-partly thanks, it seems, to Gen Z, which encompasses voters ages 18 to 27. Exit polls and county-by-county analyses , however imprecise, indicated that young voters had shifted right since 2020. That's especially true for young men -most of all young white men, who made up one of Trump's most supportive cohorts . Democrats also lost ground with young women , though. According to some national exit-poll data , the party's lead among 18-to-29-year-olds was cut nearly in half . And county data (which are considered more reliable, though still imperfect) indicate that counties with large populations of 18-to-34-year-olds moved 5.6 points rightward since the 2020 election.\n\nPeople had good reason for thinking that more young adults might vote for Kamala Harris. Surveys have shown that the group cares about blue-coded issues such as the environment , firearm safety , diversity , and inclusivity . One 2023 poll found that, compared with Baby Boomers and Generation X, Gen Z is more concerned about criminal-justice reform and racial equity; in 2020, Pew found that Gen Z members are likelier to say the government \"should do more to solve problems\" rather than leaving things to business and individuals.\n\nBut, as researchers told me, priorities change; young adults can care about progressive causes and still be moved by messaging that speaks to their deep unease and uncertainty. Many of them are struggling -to feel financially secure, psychologically safe, or hopeful. Trump, in his campaign, managed to mirror what many young people already felt: The world is a frightening place, and it's not getting better.\n\nEvery generation is more multifaceted than its stereotypes suggest. Even before this election, Gen Z's political leanings were more complex than older adults made them out to be; famous young activists such as Greta Thunberg and Malala Yousafzai could never have represented the more than 2 billion people globally who were born between 1997 and 2012. But particularly in the past few years, surveys have found young adults to be \"not off-the-charts liberal,\" as Corey Seemiller, a Gen Z researcher and professor at Wright State University, put it. When she and her collaborator Meghan Grace polled thousands of respondents in 2021 and 2022, they found a \"massive difference between women and men,\" Seemiller told me; women were nearly twice as likely as men to identify as being on the left side of the political spectrum. Still, less than half of women said they were politically left; about 20 percent identified as on the right and about 20 percent as \"in the middle.\" That survey result might not have seemed shocking at the time, but in hindsight, it suggested that not that much needed to change, Seemiller said, for many young people to tip into voting for Trump.\n\nIt's true that some progressive causes, including climate change and gun control, have typically appealed to members of Gen Z regardless of gender. But in the past few years, those priorities seem to have changed. Now many young people are more concerned about the economy, a topic that was a centerpiece of Trump's campaign. \"Gen Z is a very financially concerned generation,\" Grace told me. Relative to their elders, they're saving more earlier and are \"much more financially conservative.\" A University of Chicago study from earlier this fall similarly found that young adults across races and party affiliations rated inflation as the most important issue related to the 2024 election; economic growth ranked prominently as well. That doesn't mean that young adults stopped caring about lefty causes-but they're more ideologically varied than some imagined. In their 2021 research, Seemiller and Grace found that, compared with participants who simply fell down the middle on most issues, twice as many young people identified as \"center blended\": very liberal on some issues and very conservative on others. \"If you hit a nerve with something they really cared about,\" Seemiller said, \"you got their vote.\"\n\nSo what nerve did Trump hit? One common thread preoccupying many young people, Grace told me, is a desire for security. \"When you think about things like their passion for the environment, desire for school safety, financial success, affordable housing,\" she said, \"all of those things have the same spin on them: I just want to feel safe .\" They generally want to go to class without worrying about shooters, to grow older without witnessing the planet's demise, to pay rent without draining their whole paycheck, to believe they can make ends meet. Trump campaigned on fear-he warned of an economy in shambles, crime and danger lurking, undocumented immigrants taking work from \" forgotten men and women .\" Much of that wasn't rooted in reality: Violent crime rates are down in the U.S., for instance, and undocumented immigrants tend to fill jobs that American workers say they don't want . Still, fear resonated.\n\nOther populations who voted red last week were clearly drawn in by some of that messaging-but Gen Z might have been particularly susceptible, researchers told me. Young adulthood is a scary life stage, one in which many people are just beginning their careers and starting to save money, low not only on resources but also on power. The future, to many of them, probably feels deeply uncertain. Having left behind their old life contexts-family, school, the political and religious beliefs of parents and neighbors-they face the daunting task of finding new communities and driving principles, Jennifer Tanner, a developmental researcher, told me. (Young adults, she noted, are particularly vulnerable to cults, which can grant them a sense of direction and camaraderie.)\n\nIn many ways, the transition to adulthood has become harder in recent years. College tuition is ever-rising, which leaves many people with overwhelming debt. Sky-high rent has made living below one's means even trickier. And the ways young people have traditionally found new purpose are shifting: They're marrying and having kids later or not at all, and religious participation is less common. Young men, whose rightward turn was especially pronounced in this election, may face particular challenges. They're now less likely than women to get a college degree. And although the military used to be an alternative route for many non-college-bound men to find structure and a sense of pride, recruitment has been down over the past two generations. Now, Tanner told me, that population is left wondering: \"What do I have to belong to?\"\n\nRead: Young adults are in crisis\n\nTrump had plenty of help convincing Gen Z that they could find solace on the right. Podcast hosts such as Joe Rogan and Andrew Tate spread the message to millions of young men that they'd been spurned and needed to take back power. Tradwife influencers sold an idealized conservative vision to huge counts of young women while preparing perfect desserts. Trumpism may also have reached many young adults through their parents-most of whom belong to Gen X, a notably conservative generation (and, if the exit polls are correct, the one that supported Trump more than any other last week).\n\nParents have always had some sway over their children's beliefs, and studies suggest that many have a mediating influence on their grown kids' voting behavior. But young adults today, on average, have particularly strong ongoing relationships with their parents. In a Pew poll from last year, a majority of 18-to-34-year-olds said they look to their parents for advice. And nearly 60 percent of the parents in that survey said they'd helped their kids financially in the past year; 57 percent of 18-to-24-year-olds in a January poll reported living with their parents. Someone who depends on their folks for money or a roof over their head might feel some extra pressure, whether consciously or not, to align with the family's politics.\n\nRead: The new age of endless parenting\n\nBut another person who might have nudged Gen Z rightward is Kamala Harris. The vice president's campaign hardly mentioned climate change or gun control-issues which, though they've dropped in importance for young voters more recently, might still have been \"unifying\" across race and gender if they'd been highlighted, both Grace and Seemiller told me. Harris did talk about some economic policies, such as lowering housing costs and instituting a price-gouging ban . But she also hammered home that she'd save America-and democracy-from Trump, and piece together the norms he shattered. That wouldn't necessarily have resonated with Gen Z, the oldest of whom were only 21 when Trump was first elected in 2016, the researchers I spoke with told me; a world with Trump is the only world they've really known as adults. In Seemiller and Grace's 2021 survey, \"access to voting\" and \"political dysfunction\" were pretty low on the priority list. \"They might not have been hearing the issue that mattered to them,\" Grace told me. \"And so it really had to be simplified down to: Do I care about the economy or do I care about this other thing they're talking about? \"\n\nThe dark irony is that a Trump presidency, in all likelihood, will be particularly hard on young adults. Economists have warned that Trump's plans, if they come to fruition, will only worsen inflation. Trump is not likely to cancel student-loan debt. And well before November 5, LGBTQ youth were already at starkly high risk for suicide; now they've seen their nation elect someone who poured millions of dollars into anti-trans ads , and is expected to roll back policies that prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The crisis hotline for the Trevor Project, a suicide-prevention nonprofit for young LGBTQ people, reported a nearly 700 percent increase in reach-outs on November 6.\n\nOf course, whatever happens next won't affect all young adults in the same way-and ultimately, more voters under 30 still chose Harris than Trump. But anyone who was surprised by Gen Z last week might want to stop assuming they understand the young people of the world, and instead start listening to them."

      "website": "https://www.theatlantic.com",
      "text": "An Intellectual and a Moral Failure\n\nRichard Hanania's new book is a Trojan horse for white supremacy.\n\nThis week, HarperCollins will publish a new work by the conservative intellectual Richard Hanania. Titled The Origins of Woke , it bills itself as the \"definitive\" account of the rise of identity politics . The book makes the case that contemporary \"wokeness\" is an ideology that has its origins in-and was in fact created by-changes to the legal system that began with the Civil Rights Act, in the 1960s. \"Long before wokeness was a cultural phenomenon,\" Hanania argues, \"it was law.\" The Origins of Woke offers a plausible defense of this claim, and it features a smattering of interesting observations about the historical relationship between the legal system, corporate and education policy, and identity politics.\n\nYet these fleeting virtues are an insufficient counterbalance to the fatal flaw at the heart of Hanania's book: It is a racist, sexist fever dream, the product of an author whose not-inconsiderable intellect has been warped and distorted-like many young conservatives'-by a noxious mixture of racist pseudoscience and the casual misogyny of the extremely online right.\n\nThat his book marries brief flashes of scholarly acumen with casual, 4chan-style bigotry will not surprise anyone who has followed Richard Hanania closely. A bombshell HuffPost exposé published last month revealed that he had previously written for white-supremacist outlets under a pseudonym, where he expressed enthusiasm for eugenics and other racist ideas. For his part, Hanania-who holds a pair of advanced degrees and has been published in a number of prestigious outlets , including this one -maintains that his days of anonymous white-supremacist proselytizing are long in the past.\n\nIn an autobiographical essay entitled \"My Journey Out of Extremism\" that he wrote in response to the HuffPost exposé, Hanania professes that those earlier writings were a relic of a time when he \"used to suck.\" But any optimism that Hanania has changed for the better should be swiftly put to bed with the publication of The Origins of Woke .\n\nThroughout the book, Hanania slips seamlessly from legitimate intellectual history and sober legal analysis to blog-post-style grousing that is peppered with invocations of race science and winks at the \"Great Replacement\" theory. He frequently expresses frat-boy nostalgia for a world where offensive jokes and ass-pinching are part of office life. He asserts that \"the workplace has been cleansed of heterosexual relationships\" by policies that discourage office romance, laments that hiring and firing women on the basis of hotness is no longer legal, suggests that the idea that bosses cannot solicit sexual favors from their employees rests on a \"badly reasoned\" interpretation of the law, and heavily implies that sexual harassment should count as free speech. Underlying all this vitriol is Hanania's assumption-which he takes no trouble to conceal-that Black people and women are less competent, capable, and intelligent than white men.\n\nPut plainly, Richard Hanania remains a white supremacist. A real one. He is also intelligent and rhetorically savvy. Some progressive readers will no doubt be of the opinion that I should not \"platform\" The Origins of Woke by reviewing it in a mainstream outlet. Yet such an objection leaves us ill-equipped to confront the danger posed by figures like Hanania, who apes the posture of a serious scholar-he holds a law degree from the University of Chicago and a Ph.D. from UCLA-and uses his credentials, fluency in legalese, and disarming \"reasonable white guy\" demeanor to lend a sheen of rigor to regressive politics.\n\nGraeme Wood: What happens when a carnival barker writes intellectual history\n\nIn other words, Hanania's smart-guy aesthetic-his adeptness at presenting himself as a dispassionate, fair-minded researcher who is merely \"following the facts\"-is best understood as a key part of his game plan. The Origins of Woke is a gateway drug, one that smuggles virulent, pseudoscientific racism into the mainstream by dressing up its poison with occasional moments of serious argumentation. His apparent strategy is part of a broader far-right trend that we might call \"Trojan-horsing\": using the trappings of scholarship to lure college-educated readers who are put off by the excesses of \"woke\" culture down a reactionary or racist rabbit hole. In the same way that figures such as Jordan Peterson and Joe Rogan use sensible ideas-that men should clean their rooms, and people should have conversations with those they disagree with-to lend an air of intellectual legitimacy to sexism or the anti-vax movement, Hanania uses a few sophisticated observations about the impact of civil-rights law to get buy-in for his racist agenda.\n\nBoth conservative and liberal critics of \"wokeness\" have tended to argue that identity politics grew out of postmodern philosophies that are often umbrellaed under the catch-all term-and anti-Semitic conspiracy theory -\"cultural Marxism.\" These critics argue that the work of philosophers such as Herbert Marcuse and Michel Foucault brought about an ideological paradigm shift on the left by mounting an assault on truth and objective reason, and by encouraging the view that identities are \"socially constructed.\" Hanania's primary intervention in the woke wars is to argue that this narrative-that identity politics began in the humanities departments of elite universities before metastasizing into the mainstream-is little more than a fairy tale, one that accords far too much influence and power to eccentric academics and their jargon-filled theories.\n\nInstead, he insists that wokeness originated with the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the policy changes that emerged downstream from it. Many of the schools that are now considered \"woke\" had to be forced by the federal government to consider race and sex in their hiring practices. As Hanania notes, the case of Columbia University is especially illustrative. \"The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare was threatening to cut off federal funding unless the university provided employment data based on race and sex and timetables for hiring minorities,\" Hanania recounts. Though Columbia's president wrote an open letter in 1971 blasting the impact of affirmative action on the university's mission, he was forced to relent to federal demands not because he was persuaded by ideology but because there was no prudent alternative: \"'If we wish to continue to have federal resources, that is what we must do.'\" Hanania observes that Title IX, which requires equal treatment for men and women in education, was also initially resisted by universities, which again had to be cudgeled into compliance: \"Eventually, after losing in a series of court cases in the 1990s, as with affirmative action decades before, higher education came to identify with and support the costly regulations it once rallied against.\"\n\nIn Hanania's telling, the transformation of elite institutions into hotbeds of identity politics was largely occasioned by the need to comply with new laws around hiring, \"disparate impacts,\" and \"hostile work environments.\" These institutions were motivated not by obscure French philosophies or the carrot of moral progress but by the stick of withheld federal funding. Hanania attempts to show that government-mandated changes to hiring and admissions practices-changes that required corporations and universities to consider and keep track of the race and gender of their employees and applicants-made elite American institutions obsessed with identity because their funding and/or legal compliance depended on it.\n\nYet compliance wasn't straightforward. Hanania maintains that the complexity and bean-counting necessitated by the new laws resulted in \" bureaucratic bloat .\" Universities such as Columbia \"simply did not have the administrative capabilities to comply with new mandates coming from Washington, which required painstaking record keeping to prove that the institution was not discriminating against women and minorities.\" The complexity of the new legislation and the regimes of data gathering it demanded meant that institutions would need to create human-resource teams devoted to the task: These new \"diversity bureaucrats\" existed not only to ensure compliance with civil-rights law, but also to justify it within their institutions.\n\n\"Woke\" ideas were invented not proactively but retroactively, in Hanania's account, in order to intellectually legitimate a series of federally dictated bureaucratic overhauls made necessary by laws such as Title IX and the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1991. The rise of identity politics is not a tale of moral or philosophical progress, but of policy changes that generated new ways of thinking after the fact.\n\nThomas Chatterton Williams: You can't define woke\n\nThis specific argument has some substance and explanatory power even if the story it tells-that nearly all the blame for identity politics rests with federal law-is far too tidy and discounts other historical factors, such as the role of progressive activism. That being said, I find Hanania's description of the historical causes of wokeness more persuasive than other right-wing screeds or even the Atlantic contributor Yascha Mounk's forthcoming book on the topic. Almost all such books blame identity politics on postmodern philosophy and critical race theory, with some pinch-hitting by Tumblr . Although strong overlaps certainly exist between the ideologies found in American humanities departments and contemporary \"wokeness,\" critics rarely explain how exactly these complex, jargon-riddled philosophies are supposed to have migrated out of obscure academic journals and into mainstream discourse; they mistake correlation for causation. What Hanania proposes is a clear causal mechanism: Changes in federal law necessitated the creation of new HR bureaucracies, which in turn produced \"woke\" true believers who began peddling ideologies that justify their jobs.\n\nIf Hanania had stuck to this specific argument-\"the government mandates came first, and the ideology later\"-it would be possible to take The Origins of Woke seriously as a contribution to the generally vacuous culture-war debates over identity politics and its causes. Black social critics such as Adolph Reed , the Fields sisters , and others have long argued that anti-racism is corporate doublespeak that exists to preserve the status quo. I've made similar arguments in this outlet and elsewhere . Ironically, Hanania's legal history lends support to Black leftists like me who are critical of DEI but care profoundly about social justice: It exposes the fact that the kind of identity politics practiced by universities and corporations aren't a social-justice sea change; they're CYA (organization-speak for cover-your-ass ). Hanania's alternative history of \"wokeness\" adds further support to the idea that today's left cultural politics are only superficially radical: The real substance of \"wokeness\" is legal compliance and public relations that serve the elites rather than the Black, brown, and poor.\n\nHowever, although the narrow history Hanania sketches has some merit, the book does not content itself with mere history. Hanania's handful of genuine insights are marred by a slow drip of especially stupid bigotry that suffuses the book. This combination-fragments of defensible historical argument that are welded to indefensible conspiracy theories, pseudoscience, and incel-culture misogyny-is what makes Hanania's book so insidious.\n\nA. J. Bauer, an expert on conservative news and media at the University of Alabama, told me that figures like Hanania often communicate through a dizzying collage of academic research and conspiratorial assertions. One moment he's picking apart the legalese of an executive order, the next he's blaming civil-rights law for declining birth rates. Bauer explains that this isn't just house style; it's a matter of economic prudence. Far-right intellectuals rarely hold traditional university posts and are typically reliant on two revenue streams: billionaire donors who fund conservative scholarship and \"an audience cobbled together through Substack and Twitter trolling .\" The Origins of Woke features a perverse blend of academese and alt-right shitposting not because Hanania is a moron who can't tell the difference between the two, but because he is trying to appeal to-and profit off of-both normie conservative elites and angry online mobs: He runs a Substack, receives funding from Silicon Valley , and has floated between temporary academic gigs at institutions such as Columbia and the University of Texas at Austin .\n\nHanania has a habit of punctuating dense, judiciously footnoted paragraphs-which cite academic books, law reviews, and government documents-with racist or sexist claims that aren't backed up with evidence. For example, a section on the paradoxes of \"disparate impact\" laws provides several pages of properly cited legal history before arriving at this claim: \"An employer who wants to use intelligence tests to hire is potentially barred from doing so because whites could do too well.\" This claim, that white candidates would be likely to outscore Black candidates on intelligence tests, is not footnoted or otherwise supported with evidence. Another well-footnoted paragraph about the increasing prominence of equity discourse in university admissions, government institutions, and grant-awarding organizations ends with an unsupported, sexist assertion. \"While there may be some women able to meet the same standards as men,\" Hanania declares, \"it strains credulity to believe that, given the gender gap in math and science proficiency, a meritocratic system would produce a perfect equality of outcomes.\" Again, a paragraph full of footnotes and well-supported claims ends with a piece of bigotry unsupported by evidence.\n\nThis pattern repeats throughout the book: Evidence-free racist and sexist claims are nestled amidst properly cited history and legal analysis, providing the former with the veneer of scholarly respectability. In the cases where Hanania does go through the motions of tacking on a footnote to one of his racist musings, the source cited tends to be another white supremacist . That Hanania is perfectly capable of following scholarly conventions and evidentiary standards when it suits him shows that he knows exactly what he is doing: Trojan-horsing white supremacy by glazing his arguments with the signals, but not the substance, of academic sobriety. That HarperCollins published this book without requiring Hanania to back up its most incendiary assumptions is both an intellectual and a moral failure.\n\nThe idea of superior white intelligence that he implicitly and explicitly refers to throughout the book rests on bad studies and bad science that have long been refuted . The white-Black \"IQ gap\" that racists such as Hanania latch onto has likewise been explained by environmental factors . Craig Venter, one of the scientists who helped map the human genome, summarizes the state of race-IQ debates : \"There is no basis in scientific fact or in the human genetic code for the notion that skin color will be predictive of intelligence.\" Philosophers such as Mary Midgley and social theorists like Karen and Barbara Fields have demonstrated that notions of measurable abstract intelligence or fixed racial identity are shot through with mythmaking . Yarden Katz and Adolph Reed have likewise shown that these myths are time-honored capitalist propaganda that naturalize inequality by suggesting that poverty is a consequence of racial difference rather than economic exploitation. Hanania makes no efforts to engage with the trove of scientific, social-scientific, and humanistic research that would trouble his assumptions about intelligence, competence, and racial difference.\n\nAdam Serwer: Richard Hanania and the allure of racist pseudoscience\n\nSimilarly, Hanania's naked obsession with office romance is both unsettling and revealing of his mindset. He ends the book by fantasizing of a future where \"woke\" anti-discrimination and anti-harassment laws have been repealed, and \"some corporations start encouraging dating\" through \"Christian matchmaking\" or \"a party-like atmosphere.\" Such moments are creepy and juvenile.\n\nIn this sense, Hanania is employing the mirror image of the rhetorical tactic championed by Steve Bannon. Trump's infamous political strategist advised conservatives to pump out a constant stream of disinformation-as Bannon put it, \"flood the zone with shit\" -in order to keep the media in a state of near-constant hysteria, teetering from outrage to outrage while the public grows ever more confused about the truth. But whereas Bannon whipped up a frenzy through a tornado of untruths and fake news, Hanania lulls his audience into a sense of complacent stupor: Dangerous lies are hidden amidst bland scholarship.\n\nPushing back against figures such as Hanania requires understanding that the hodgepodge of high-brow theorizing, low-brow racism, and frat-bro misogyny that characterizes their discourse is not a paradox but a precise strategy designed to sneak white supremacy into the mainstream by obscuring the difference between scholarship and its simulacrum. And these tactics aren't just confined to Hanania; the phenomenon is pervasive.\n\nUntil recently, Nate Hochman was another young conservative intellectual cast as a measured thinker. (\"He looks like the kind of kid who would offer you granola at a trailhead,\" a largely positive profile observed.) Yet just a week before the publication of the HuffPost article that outed Hanania as a former anonymous eugenics enthusiast, Hochman was fired from the racist-scandal-riddled Ron DeSantis campaign. Axios reported that he'd created a video that prominently featured Nazi iconography . Like Hanania, the now-exiled former wunderkind weaponized sober speech to zhuzh up the kind of radical conservatism that is ascendant on the right .\n\nUnderstanding this strategy matters, because it has proved effective: Jordan Peterson has become one of the most popular right-wing figures on the planet by using Jungian psychobabble and professorial tweed to give the impression of Socratic wisdom, when what he really offers is retrograde sexism to lost men . If Hanania has so far managed to escape being sent to Siberia-unlike Hochman-it is because he has followed in Peterson's footsteps: not \"flooding the zone with shit,\" but rather hiding the shit in pseudo-erudition."

      "text": "Is Wokeness One Big Power Grab?\n\nBehind much social-justice discourse is a self-interested struggle for power.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nIn his 2023 Netflix comedy special, Selective Outrage , Chris Rock identified one of the core contradictions of the social-justice era: \"Everybody's full of shit,\" Rock said, including in the category of \"everybody\" people who type \"woke\" tweets \"on a phone made by child slaves.\"\n\nI was reminded of that acerbic routine while reading Musa al-Gharbi's new book, We Have Never Been Woke . Al-Gharbi, a 41-year-old sociologist at Stony Brook University, opens with the political disillusionment he experienced when he moved from Arizona to New York. He was immediately struck by the \"racialized caste system\" that everyone in the big liberal city seems to take \"as natural\": \"You have disposable servants who will clean your house, watch your kids, walk your dogs, deliver prepared meals to you.\" At the push of a button, people-mostly hugely underpaid immigrants and people of color-will do your shopping and drive you wherever you want to go.\n\nHe contrasts that with the \"podunk\" working-class environment he'd left behind, where \"the person buying a pair of shoes and the person selling them are likely to be the same race-white-and the socioeconomic gaps between the buyer and the seller are likely to be much smaller.\" He continues: \"Even the most sexist or bigoted rich white person in many other contexts wouldn't be able to exploit women and minorities at the level the typical liberal professional in a city like Seattle, San Francisco, or Chicago does in their day-to-day lives. The infrastructure simply isn't there.\" The Americans who take the most advantage of exploited workers, he argues, are the same Democratic-voting professionals in progressive bastions who most \"conspicuously lament inequality.\"\n\nRead: The blindness of elites\n\nMusa sees the reelection of Donald Trump as a reflection of Americans' resentment toward elites and the \"rapid shift in discourse and norms around 'identity' issues\" that he refers to as the \"Great Awokening.\" To understand what's happening to American politics, he told me, we shouldn't look to the particulars of the election-\"say, the attributes of Harris, how she ran her campaign, inflation worries, and so on,\" but rather to this broader backlash. All of the signs were there for elites to see if only they'd bothered to look.\n\nOne question We Have Never Been Woke sets out to answer is why elites are so very blind, including to their own hypocrisy. The answer al-Gharbi proposes is at once devastatingly simple yet reaffirmed everywhere one turns: Fooled by superficial markers of their own identity differences-racial, sexual, and otherwise-elites fail to see themselves for what they truly are.\n\n\"When people say things about elites, they usually focus their attention on cisgender heterosexual white men\" who are \"able-bodied and neurotypical,\" al-Gharbi told me, in one of our conversations this fall. Most elites are white, of course, but far from all. And elites today, he added, also \"increasingly identify as something like disabled or neurodivergent, LGBTQ.\" If you \"exclude all of those people from analysis, then you're just left with this really tiny and misleading picture of who the elites are, who benefits from the social order, how they benefit.\"\n\nSociologists who have studied nonwhite elites in the past have tended to analyze them mainly in the contexts of the marginalized groups from which they came. E. Franklin Frazier's 1955 classic, Black Bourgeoisie , for example, spotlighted the hypocrisy and alienation of relatively prosperous Black Americans who found themselves doubly estranged: from the white upper classes they emulated as well as from the Black communities they'd left behind. By analyzing nonwhites and other minorities as elites among their peers, al-Gharbi is doing something different. \"Elites from other groups are often passed over in silence or are explicitly exempted from critique (and even celebrated!),\" he writes. And yet, \"behaviors, lifestyles, and relationships that are exploitative, condescending, or exclusionary do not somehow become morally noble or neutral when performed by members of historically marginalized or disadvantaged groups.\"\n\nWhen al-Gharbi uses the word elite , he is talking about the group to which he belongs: the \"symbolic capitalists\"-broadly speaking, the various winners of the knowledge economy who do not work with their hands and who produce and manipulate \"data, rhetoric, social perceptions and relations, organizational structures and operations, art and entertainment, traditions and innovations.\" These are the people who set the country's norms through their dominance of the \"symbolic economy,\" which consists of media, academic, cultural, technological, legal, nonprofit, consulting, and financial institutions.\n\nAlthough symbolic capitalists are not exactly the same as capitalist capitalists, or the rest of the upper class that does not rely on income, neither are they-as graduate students at Columbia and Yale can be so eager to suggest-\"the genuinely marginalized and disadvantaged.\" The theorist Richard Florida has written about a group he calls the \"creative class,\" which represents 30 percent of the total U.S. workforce, and which overlaps significantly with al-Gharbi's symbolic capitalists. Using survey data from 2017, Florida calculated that members of that creative class earned twice as much over the course of the year as members of the working class-an average of $82,333 versus $41,776, respectively.\n\nSymbolic capitalists aren't a monolith, but it is no secret that their ruling ideology is the constellation of views and attitudes that have come to be known as \"wokeness,\" which al-Gharbi defines as beliefs about social justice that \"inform how mainstream symbolic capitalists understand and pursue their interests-creating highly novel forms of competition and legitimation.\"\n\nAl-Gharbi's own path is emblematic of the randomness and possibility of membership in this class. The son of military families on both sides, one Black and one white, he attended community college for six years, \"taking classes off and on while working,\" he told me. There he was lucky to meet a talented professor, who \"basically took me under his wing and helped me do something different,\" al-Gharbi said. Together, they focused on private lessons in Latin, philosophy, and classics-subjects not always emphasized in community college.\n\nAround that time he was also going on what he calls \"this whole religious journey\": \"I initially tried to be a Catholic priest, and then I became an atheist for a while, but I had this problem. I rationally convinced myself that religion was bullshit and there is no God, but I couldn't make myself feel it.\" Then he read the Quran and \"became convinced that it was a prophetic work. And so I was like, Well, if I believe that Muhammad is a prophet and I believe in God, that's the two big things. So maybe I am a Muslim. \" Soon after, he changed his name. Then, just when he was getting ready to transfer out of community college, his twin brother, Christian, was killed on deployment in Afghanistan. He chose to go somewhere close to his grieving family, the University of Arizona, to finish his degree in Near-Eastern studies and philosophy.\n\nThe same dispassionate analysis that he applies to his own life's progress he brings to bear on America's trends, especially the Great Awokening. He traces that widespread and sudden movement in attitudes not to the death of Trayvon Martin or Michael Brown, nor to Black Lives Matter or the #MeToo movement, nor to the election of Donald Trump, but to September 2011 and the Occupy Wall Street movement that emerged from the ashes of the financial crisis.\n\n\"In reality, Occupy was not class oriented,\" he argues. By focusing its critique on the top 1 percent of households, which were overwhelmingly white, and ignoring the immense privilege of the more diverse symbolic capitalists just beneath them, the movement, \"if anything, helped obscure important class differences and the actual causes of social stratification.\" This paved the way for \"elites who hail from historically underrepresented populations ... to exempt themselves from responsibility for social problems and try to deflect blame onto others.\"\n\nRead: The 9.9 percent is the new American aristocracy\n\nAl-Gharbi is neither an adherent of wokeism nor an anti-woke scold. He would like to both stem the progressive excesses of the summer of 2020, a moment when white liberals \"tended to perceive much more racism against minorities than most minorities, themselves, reported experiencing,\" and see substantive social justice be achieved for everyone, irrespective of whether they hail from a historically disadvantaged identity group or not. The first step, he argues, is to dispel the notion that the Great Awokening was \"some kind of unprecedented new thing.\"\n\nAwokenings, in al-Gharbi's telling, are struggles for power and status in which symbolic capitalists, often instinctively and even subconsciously, leverage social-justice discourse not on behalf of the marginalized but in service of their own labor security, political influence, and social prestige. He does not see this as inherently nefarious-indeed, like Tocqueville and many others before him, he recognizes that motivated self-interest can be the most powerful engine for the common good. Al-Gharbi argues that our current Awokening, which peaked in 2021 and is now winding down , is really the fourth such movement in the history of the United States.\n\nThe first coincided with the Great Depression, when suddenly \"many who had taken for granted a position among the elite, who had felt more or less entitled to a secure, respected, and well-paying professional job, found themselves facing deeply uncertain futures.\"\n\nThe next would take place in the 1960s, once the radicals of the '30s were firmly ensconced within the bourgeoisie. \"The driver was not the Vietnam War itself,\" al-Gharbi stresses. That had been going on for years without protest. Nor was the impetus the civil-rights movement, gay liberation, women's liberation, or any such cause. \"Instead, middle-class students became radical precisely when their plans to leave the fighting to minorities and the poor by enrolling in college and waiting things out began to fall through,\" he argues. \"It was at that point that college students suddenly embraced anti-war activism, the Black Power movement, feminism, postcolonial struggles, gay rights, and environmentalism in immense numbers,\" appropriating those causes for their own gain.\n\nIf this sounds familiar, it should. The third Awokening was smaller and shorter than the others, stretching from the late '80s to the early '90s, and repurposing and popularizing the Marxist term political correctness . Its main legacy was to set the stage for the fourth-and present-Awokening, which has been fueled by what the scholar Peter Turchin has termed \"elite overproduction\": Quite simply, America creates too many highly educated, highly aspirational young people, and not enough high-status, well-paid jobs for them to do. The result, al-Gharbi writes, is that \"frustrated symbolic capitalists and elite aspirants [seek] to indict the system that failed them-and also the elites that did manage to flourish-by attempting to align themselves with the genuinely marginalized and disadvantaged.\" It is one of the better and more concise descriptions of the so-called cancel culture that has defined and bedeviled the past decade of American institutional life. (As Hannah Arendt observed in The Origins of Totalitarianism , political purges often serve as jobs programs.)\n\nThe book is a necessary corrective to the hackneyed discourse around wealth and privilege that has obtained since 2008. At the same time, al-Gharbi's focus on symbolic capitalists leaves many levers of power unexamined. Whenever I'm in the company of capitalist capitalists, I'm reminded of the stark limitations of the symbolic variety. Think of how easily Elon Musk purchased and then destroyed that vanity fair of knowledge workers formerly known as Twitter. While some self-important clusters of them disbanded to Threads or Bluesky to post their complaints, Musk helped Trump win the election. His PAC donated $200 million to the campaign, while Musk served as Trump's hype man at rallies and on X. Trump has since announced that Musk will be part of the administration itself, co-leading the ominously named Department of Government Efficiency .\n\nAl-Gharbi's four Great Awokenings framework can sometimes feel too neat. In a review of We Have Never Been Woke in The Wall Street Journal , Jonathan Marks points out a small error in the book. Al-Gharbi relies on research by Richard Freeman to prove that a bust in the labor market for college graduates ignited the second Awokening. But al-Gharbi gets the date wrong: \"Freeman's comparison isn't between 1958 and 1974. It's between 1968 and 1974\"-too late, Marks argued, to explain what al-Gharbi wants it to explain. (When I asked al-Gharbi about this, he acknowledged the mistake on the date but insisted the point still held: \"The thing that precipitated the massive unrest in the 1960s was the changing of draft laws in 1965,\" he said. \"A subsequent financial crisis made it tough for elites to get jobs, ramping things up further.\" He argued it was all the same crisis: an expanding elite \"growing concerned that the lives and livelihoods they'd taken for granted are threatened and may, in fact, be out of reach.\")\n\nDespite such quibbles, al-Gharbi's framework remains a powerful one. By contrasting these periods, al-Gharbi stressed to me, we can not only understand what is happening now but also get a sense of the shape of wokenesses to come. As he sees it, \"the way the conversation often unfolds is just basically saying wokeness is puritanism or religion,\" he explained. \"They think Puritanism sucks, or religion sucks,\" he continued. But just saying that \"wokeness is bad\" is not \"super useful.\"\n\nIndeed, one of the primary reasons such anti-woke reactions feel so unsatisfactory is that wokeness, not always but consistently, stems from the basic recognition of large-scale problems that really do exist. Occupy Wall Street addressed the staggering rise of inequality in 21st-century American life; Black Lives Matter emerged in response to a spate of reprehensible police and vigilante killings that rightfully shocked the nation's conscience; #MeToo articulated an ambient sexism that degraded women's professional lives and made us consider subtler forms of exploitation and abuse. The self-dealing, overreach, and folly that each of these movements begat does not absolve the injustices they emerged to address. On the contrary, they make it that much more urgent to deal effectively with these ills.\n\nMusa al-Gharbi: Police punish the 'good apples'\n\nAny critique of progressive illiberalism that positions the latter as unprecedented or monocausal-downstream of the Civil Rights Act, as some conservatives like to argue-is bound not only to misdiagnose the problem but to produce ineffective or actively counterproductive solutions to it as well. Wokeness is, for al-Gharbi, simply the way in which a specific substratum of elites \"engage in power struggles and struggles for status,\" he said. \"Repealing the Civil Rights Act or dismantling DEI or rolling back Title IX and all of that will not really eliminate wokeness.\"\n\nNeither will insisting that its adherents must necessarily operate from a place of bad faith. In fact, al-Gharbi believes it is the very sincerity of their belief in social justice that keeps symbolic capitalists from understanding their own behavior, and the counterproductive social role they often play. \"It's absolutely possible for someone to sincerely believe something,\" al-Gharbi stressed, \"but also use it in this instrumental way.\"\n\nHaving been born into one minority group and converted to another as an adult, al-Gharbi has himself accrued academic pedigree and risen to prominence, in no small part, by critiquing his contemporaries who flourished during the last Great Awokening. He is attempting to outflank them, too, aligning himself even more fully with the have-nots. Yet his work is permeated by a refreshing awareness of these facts. \"A core argument of this book is that wokeness has become a key source of cultural capital among contemporary elites-especially among symbolic capitalists,\" he concedes. \"I am, myself, a symbolic capitalist.\"\n\nThe educated knowledge workers who populate the Democratic Party need more of this kind of clarity and introspection. Consider recent reports that the Harris campaign declined to appear on Joe Rogan's podcast in part out of concerns that it would upset progressive staffers, who fussed over language and minuscule infractions while the country lurched toward authoritarianism.\n\nAl-Gharbi's book's title is drawn from Bruno Latour's We Have Never Been Modern , which famously argued for a \"symmetrical anthropology\" that would allow researchers to turn the lens of inquiry upon themselves, subjecting modern man to the same level of analytical rigor that his \"primitive\" and premodern counterparts received. What is crucial, al-Gharbi insists, \"is not what's in people's hearts and minds.\" Rather the question must always be: \"How is society arranged?\" To understand the inequality that plagues us-and then to actually do something about it-we are going to have to factor in ourselves, our allies, and our preferred narratives too. Until that day, as the saying about communism goes, real wokeness has never even been tried."

      "text": "Woke Is Just Another Word for Liberal\n\nWhat many conservative critics of wokeness actually oppose is the pursuit of equality.\n\nThe conservative writer Bethany Mandel, a co-author of a new book attacking \"wokeness\" as \"a new version of leftism that is aimed at your child,\" recently froze up on a cable news program when asked by an interviewer how she defines woke , the term her book is about.\n\nOn the one hand, any of us with a public-facing job could have a similar moment of disassociation on live television. On the other hand, the moment and the debate it sparked revealed something important. Much of the utility of woke as a political epithet is tied to its ambiguity; it often allows its users to condemn something without making the grounds of their objection uncomfortably explicit.\n\nA few years ago, I wrote, \" Woke is a nebulous term stolen from Black American English , repurposed by conservatives as an epithet to express opposition to forms of egalitarianism they find ridiculous or distasteful.\" This is what people mean when they refer to \" woke banks \" or \" woke capital ,\" when they complain that the new Lord of the Rings series or the new Little Mermaid is \"woke\" because it includes Black actors , or when they argue for a \"great unwokening\" that would roll back civil-rights laws. Part of the utility of the term is that it can displace the criticism onto white liberals who are insincere about their egalitarianism, rather than appearing to be an attack on egalitarianism itself. In fact, woke has become so popular as a political epithet that providing an exhaustive list of definitions would be difficult. It is a slippery enough term that you can use it to sound like you are criticizing behavior most people think is silly, even if you are really referring to things most people think of as good or necessary.\n\nAdam Serwer: 'Woke capital' doesn't exist\n\nThis is not the only way that the term is employed-although it is almost always used as a pejorative now, whereas originally it could be sincere or ironic. Some commentators have used it as a shorthand for toxic dynamics in left-wing discourse and advocacy. \"Wokeness refers to the invocation of unintuitive and morally burdensome political norms and ideas in a manner which suggests they are self-evident,\" Sam Adler-Bell wrote in New York magazine. \"At other times, it means we express fealty to a novel or unintuitive norm, while suggesting that anyone who doesn't already agree with it is a bad person.\"\n\nAdler-Bell is describing a real phenomenon in left-of-center communities, but right-wing opposition to woke discourse is less about the mode of expression than its content. Suffice it to say, though, that no ideology is so pure or benign that it renders its adherents incapable of being cruel, selfish, or self-aggrandizing-especially in a social-media panopticon where everyone is seeking to raise or protect their own status, often at the expense of others.\n\nMandel herself later offered this definition of woke on Twitter: \"A radical belief system suggesting that our institutions are built around discrimination, and claiming that all disparity is a result of that discrimination. It seeks a radical redefinition of society in which equality of group result is the endpoint, enforced by an angry mob.\" The right-wing pundit Ben Shapiro offered a similar description .\n\nI like Mandel's definition because it makes the concept seem so reasonable that it requires a few modifiers and a straw man about mob enforcement to evoke the proper amount of dread in the reader. If you describe the ethnic cleansing of Muslims in Eastern Europe in the 1990s, you don't need to add that it was \"radical\" to get most people to understand that it was bad. But the claim that \"American institutions are built around discrimination\" is just a straightforward account of history. And if few of the people who are caricatured as woke would argue that all disparities result from discrimination, most of them would agree that many key disparities along the axes of class, race, and gender do. But either the history, policy, and structure of the American economy matter or they don't.\n\nTo claim the reverse, that people who are rich or white or male are just better than everyone else-to object to \"equality of group result\" as a goal, as if it's absurd to believe that people from across the boundaries of the biological fiction of race could be equal-reveals a prejudice so overt that it practically affirms the \"woke \" side of the argument. The \"radical redefinition of society\" that many of the so-called woke seek is simply that it lives up to its stated commitments. And one really could, I suppose, describe that as radical-the abolition of slavery, the ratification of women's suffrage, and the end of Jim Crow were all once genuinely radical positions whose adoption redefined American society.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Wokeness has replaced socialism as the great conservative bogeyman\n\nThose transitions were only possible because, as Mandel's definition inadvertently concedes, the ideology she opposes is grounded in fact. The United States could not have been created without displacing the people who were already living here . Its Constitution preserved slavery , which remained an engine of the national economy well into the 19th century. Among the first pieces of federal legislation was a bill limiting naturalization to free white people . Yet not even all white men could vote at the nation's founding-property requirements shut out many until around 1840-and universal white male suffrage (sometimes including noncitizens !) was paired with the explicit disenfranchisement of Black men, even in some northern states. The nation was nearly rent in two because the slave economy and the social hierarchy it created were precious enough, even to men who did not own slaves , that they took up arms to defend the institution of human bondage with their life. After the Civil War, the former Confederates reimposed white supremacy and subjected the emancipated to an apartheid regime in which they had few real rights, a regime my mother was born into and my grandparents fled. For most of the history of the United States, Black people could not vote and women could not vote; American immigration policy in the early 20th century was based on eugenics and an explicit desire to keep out those deemed nonwhite ; the mid-century American prosperity unleashed by the New Deal that conservatives recall with such nostalgia was stratified by race .\n\nI could go on, but I think you get the point. These things are real; they happened. To believe that the disadvantages of race, class, and gender imposed lawfully over centuries never occurred or entirely disappeared in just a few decades is genuinely \"radical\" in a negative way; to believe that creating those disadvantages was wrong and that they should be rectified is not. The idea that no one ever succeeds based on advantages unrelated to their personal abilities is likewise radical, and also ludicrous. But you can, perhaps, understand why one of the richest men in the world would consider the opposing idea-that where many people end up in life is the result of unearned advantages-to be a \"woke mind virus\" that should be eradicated. That kind of thinking leads to higher marginal tax rates for people with private planes.\n\nSome people so deeply resent the implication that they possess any unearned advantage that, in Republican-run states all over the country, the same folks who were recently shrieking about free speech and oversensitive snowflakes are busy using the power of the state to ban discussions about factual matters that might hurt their feelings, such as descriptions of racial segregation in the story of Rosa Parks. The irony here is that by framing everything they don't like as a symptom of pervasive oppression against white people or Christians that must be rectified by the state, they have themselves adopted the inverse of the logic they decry as \"wokeness.\" They believe that America's demographic majorities are the targets of broad institutional discrimination , which is unjust not because such discrimination is morally abhorrent but because it is targeted at the wrong people.\n\nThen there is the irony that the most zealous among the so-called woke and anti-woke form different denominations of the same religion, following high priests of racial salvation preaching parallel dogmas, one of which says that you need only read certain books or say certain words to attain salvation, and the other of which grants absolution to parishioners for their reflexive contempt for those they despise. Only one of them, however, has become the established church in certain states, deploying the power of the state to enforce its dogma .\n\nYou need not adopt either faith. Accepting the reality of American history and the persistence of discrimination does not mean that every egalitarian proposal is correct, nor that every egalitarian argument should be heeded. It does not necessarily mean that we should ban the SAT in college admissions or never refer to \"women\" when discussing abortion rights. Calling something racist or sexist doesn't mean that what you are describing is racist or sexist. Conversely, something that appears to be race-neutral can be implemented in a discriminatory fashion, or even adopted with that intention. But if you do accept the reality of our past, then you probably think we should try to level the playing field in some way. The merits of specific arguments or proposals are separate from that underlying principle. Whatever woke might mean, however, it is clear that the objections of the militantly \"anti-woke\" find the egalitarian idea itself to be worthy of contempt.\n\nTo say that traditional hierarchies are just and good, well, that's simply conservatism. It has been since the 18th century. And to say that those hierarchies do not reflect justice and that people should be equal under the law-all the people, not only propertied white men -well, that's more or less just liberalism. But if you don't like it, you'd probably call it woke."

      "text": "You Can't Define Woke\n\nThe word is not a viable descriptor for anyone who is critical of the many serious excesses of the left yet remains invested in reaching beyond their own echo chamber.\n\nUpdated at 11:58 a.m. ET on March 17, 2023\n\nAs I was preparing to go onstage for an event recently, the moderator warned my co-panelist and me that the very first prompt would be \"Please define the word woke for the audience.\" We all sighed and laughed. It's a fraught task, requiring qualification and nuance, because woke has acquired what the French philosopher Raymond Aron termed \"subtle,\" or \"esoteric,\" and \"literal,\" or \"vulgar,\" interpretations. Put simply, social-justice-movement insiders have different associations and uses for the word than do those outside these progressive circles. Before you can attempt to define what \"wokeness\" is, you should acknowledge this basic fact. Going further, you should acknowledge that as with cancel culture , critical race theory , and even structural racism , the contested nature of the term imposes a preemptive barrier to productive disagreement.\n\nMerriam-Webster offers this definition: \"aware of and actively attentive to important societal facts and issues (especially issues of racial and social justice).\" That's not bad so far as it goes, and there is a secondary definition that encapsulates the \"vulgar\" (or common) understanding that the attention is excessive: \"disapproving: politically liberal (as in matters of racial and social justice) especially in a way that is considered unreasonable or extreme.\" But neither adequately conveys the implication that the point of the attention is fundamentally to remake society. Progressives sometimes exploit these ambiguities to accuse the \"anti-woke\" side of rejecting near-consensus beliefs, such as the need to call out and remedy actual instances of racism.\n\nFrom the March 2023 issue: The French are in a panic over le wokisme\n\nThis messiness is why I have argued for years now that \"woke\" is not a viable descriptor for anyone who is critical of the many serious excesses of the left yet remains invested in reaching beyond their own echo chamber. The word is more confusing than useful, and we should make good-faith efforts to avoid using it. As I wrote in The Guardian in November 2021: \"Fairly or not, 'woke' and 'wokeness' now overwhelmingly signal that you're not fundamentally interested in that rhetorical labor, and those who need the most convincing give themselves permission to stop paying attention.\"\n\nWhen I shared this line of thought on Twitter, many of my most thoughtful centrist and conservative followers found it frustrating. A common critique boiled down to this: They were exasperated that just as the word had gained traction in the public imagination-becoming a useful tool to expose and stigmatize an activist idealism that they believe is illiberal and punitive in practice-moderates such as myself were wringing our hands and trying to take that tool away from them.\n\nIn the year or so since I made that case, the pejorative has gone international, as I wrote in this magazine recently. Yet I remain convinced that one should never rely on language one cannot hope to control or even fully explain. An important further complication to this debate is that as the word woke migrated from Black American slang to common usage, the critics of the social-justice ideologues the term denotes came to rely on their own esoteric jargon. Now they can barely communicate what, precisely, they find problematic about \"wokeness\" and wish to correct. Hence, they end up using this word as an epithet to refer-vaguely-to seemingly anything changing in the culture that they don't like. That is the critique they open themselves up to, in any event.\n\nTrying to define the subtle negative meaning of woke can feel like walking into a trap, a reality that leaped out to me when I watched the viral clip of the conservative writer Bethany Mandel on the talk show Rising . In an appearance to promote a new book in which she devotes a chapter to a critique of \"wokeness,\" Mandel states in passing that many more Americans consider themselves to be liberal than to be woke. At that point, the co-host Briahna Joy Gray interjects, asking Mandel to define woke so that everyone can be on the same page. This straightforward request gives way to an excruciating 45 seconds in which Mandel sputters and disintegrates, even as she shakes her head and predicts, \"This is going to be one of those moments that goes viral.\" Ultimately, Mandell says that woke amounts to \"the understanding that we need to totally reimagine and redo society in order to create hierarchies of oppression,\" before trailing off.\n\nThat explanation is not without logic or insight. The constellation of social-justice concerns and discursive lenses that have powerfully influenced institutional decision making does work to sort individuals into abstract identity groups arranged on spectrums of privilege and marginalization. To paraphrase James Baldwin, it proceeds from the insistence that one's categorization alone is real and cannot be transcended. The idea that patriarchy, white supremacy, transphobia, homophobia, Islamophobia, and other ills inexorably saturate our lived realities and that the highest good is to uncover and oppose them is, I think, a central component of \"wokeness\" as both its proponents and critics understand it.\n\nWhat's more, the gleefully vicious attacks on Mandel are in themselves a prime example of what rightist and centrist commentators mean when they note the excesses of social-justice ideology. Mandel's critics make a more substantive error too: Just because one person struggled to define a term that has become useless and riddled with bad-faith connotations from every angle does not mean the underlying issues disappear. On the contrary.\n\nBut perhaps we can all agree, at bare minimum, to set ourselves the task of limiting our reliance on in-group shorthand, and embracing clear, honest, precise, and original thought and communication. If we want to persuade anyone not already convinced of what we believe, we are going to have to figure out how to say what we really mean."

Crenshaw, who coined the term \"intersectionality,\" says Harris's candidacy is leading to backlash from those who fear the emergence of a more diverse country. \"The challenge is, quite clearly, that those who support Kamala Harris and those who support our democracy have to take back the ground that they have ceded in the war on woke,\" says Crenshaw, executive director of the African American Policy Forum, which is hosting its annual Critical Race Theory Summer School in Nashville this week.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.\n\nThis week, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump continued his racist attacks on the Democratic presidential candidate, Kamala Harris. Here's Trump on Fox News Monday night, interviewed by Laura Ingraham.\n\nDONALD TRUMP : Number one, they had an incompetent man as president, OK? Now they have somebody who's worse. She's sort of incompetent. She's not very smart, but she's very radical. Very radical. She will try and defund the police.\n\nLAURA INGRAHAM : How would they consider a Harris presidency, just in - geopolitically?\n\nDONALD TRUMP : I think they'll walk all over her. I think -\n\nLAURA INGRAHAM : How so?\n\nDONALD TRUMP : - they'll look at her. I think they'll walk all over her. She'll be so easy for them. She'll be like a play toy. They look at her, and they say, \"We can't believe we got so lucky.\" They're going to walk all over her. And I don't want to say as to why, but a lot of people understand it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : During a campaign event in Atlanta Tuesday evening, Vice President Kamala Harris challenged Trump to meet her on the debate stage so she could address his criticisms directly.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS : Well, Donald, I do hope you'll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage, because as the saying goes, if you got something to say, say it to my face.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : President Trump has called Kamala Harris \"dumb,\" \"dumb as a rock,\" a \"bum,\" and has called her \"evil.\"\n\nTo discuss Harris's historic campaign and more, we're joined by professor Kimberlé Crenshaw, professor of law at UCLA and Columbia University, executive director of the African American Policy Forum, which is hosting their annual Critical Race Theory Summer School in Nashville this week, where she is joining us from now. Speakers include Ben Crump, talking about the police killing of Sonya Massey. Their opening plenary was called \"Tip of the Spear: Tennessee on the Frontlines of the War on Woke.\"\n\nProfessor Crenshaw, thanks so much for being with us. Can you respond to what Kamala Harris said last night, her first big campaign rally? Thousands were there. And talk about what the Republicans are saying. Out of so many congressmembers' mouths, \" DEI hire,\" \"mediocre,\" \"This is all about DEI ,\" they say.\n\nKIMBERLÉ CRENSHAW : Well, first of all, one has to respond with just applause. I think it was such a perfectly delivered challenge to Donald Trump.\n\nBut, look, here's the reality. As much as Kamala Harris's likely nomination is galvanizing people around the country, she's also serving as an avatar for all the fears of people who fear the browning of America, those who fear the browning of America more than they fear the rise of fascism in the United States. So, the challenge is quite clearly that those who support Kamala Harris and those who support our democracy have to take back the ground that they have conceded to the war against woke. This attack on her as the DEI candidacy is a direct consequence of the fact that the attack on the entire infrastructure of racial justice the entire last half of the 20th century and the first half of the 21st century has largely been conceded by progressives, by liberals and by moderates, those who don't want to talk about the attack on racial justice, those who think that we can just ignore the racism on the right and ignore the racism that is being played out in Project 2025.\n\nSo, this is a moment where there's interest convergence between those of us who understand the relationship between racial justice and democracy and those who are deeply concerned about the descent of our country and what will happen under another Trump administration. We cannot defend democracy, we cannot defend Kamala Harris, without taking on directly the intersection of racism and sexism that we are seeing playing out across this campaign. And so, the summer school that we've been having and that we're having is designed to provide precisely those tools, the literacy that's necessary and the courage, frankly, to meet this battle where it actually is.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Kimberlé Crenshaw, also we're witnessing the hypersexualization of Kamala Harris, including the circulation of derogatory slogans and rumors about her personal life, media figure Megyn Kelly even saying that Kamala Harris slept her way to the top. Can you talk about the significance of this targeting of Harris with these kinds of claims?\n\nKIMBERLÉ CRENSHAW : Well, look, one of the insights of intersectionality is that racism and sexism are not simply additive. It's almost like an algebra equation. She's going to suffer both the misogyny that we saw play out with Hillary Clinton's campaign, the racism that we saw playing out with Barack Obama, but also without a deep understanding about how misogynoir comes together to shape how African American women in particular are viewed, how they've been stereotyped over the course of history.\n\nSo, this is a moment where all those who support democracy and all those who support this candidacy have to quickly come together and learn how to read this attack on her, know how to respond to this attack on her and, quite frankly, connect it to the attacks on other Black women. We talked about Sonya Massey yesterday when Ben Crump was here, and he talked about how the autopsy reports actually support the video, that she was in a crouched position. She was shot from top to - from above her. This kind of degradation, dehumanization is deeply part of our history, and there's a particular way that it plays out against women who are of African descent.\n\nSo, we are going to have to up our game. We're going to have to not pivot away from these attacks. We're going to have to meet them where they are. And we're going to have to make it clear that Kamala Harris's campaign offers much more to the white working class. And everybody wonders: Will she appeal to them? They're not wondering why the white working class is not turned off by Donald Trump's billionaire-focused agenda. We've got to talk about these things. And we've got to disarm the war on woke. It's like a gun that's been loaded, and it's on the table, and it's available to be targeted at things that people clearly care about, which is our democracy.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And do you have any concern on substantive issues, for instance, that the Harris campaign's website, even after her endorsement by President Joe Biden and former President Obama, does not have a platform or policies on it that explain what her particular policies will be if elected in office?\n\nKIMBERLÉ CRENSHAW : Well, you know, it is early in the campaign. So, one of the things that we know for certain is that this is a campaign that is about rescuing our democracy from the cliff that we are on. And, look, we got lucky that we were able to save the democracy when we did. But, look, we're not talking about the real threat. The real threat to our democracy that marched through that Capitol was the threat that was symbolized by that Confederate flag. There are those who fear sharing this country with all of us who are in it. If you look at the basic argument about the stolen election, who stole it? It was voters in Philadelphia, in Detroit, in Milwaukee, in Phoenix. They are saying what the quiet part is out loud. So, we know, at minimum, that the Harris campaign is about addressing the threat to our democracy.\n\nNow, of course, we're going to have to push the Democrats. We're going to have to push Kamala Harris to actually make good on the right to democracy, the freedom to learn, all the reproductive freedom. We know that the election is just the first part. The second part is maintaining the mobilization that put her there. That's the mistake that we made earlier on, and we can't make that mistake again. So, as we come together to save our democracy, we also have to come together to be a governing majority in that democracy. That's what we're here to celebrate. That's what we're here to commemorate. Freedom Summer 1964 is the precursor to Freedom Summer 2024. This is the tip of the spear. This is why we are here.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Kimberlé Crenshaw, we want to thank you for being with us, professor of law at UCLA and Columbia University and executive director of the African American Policy Forum, hosting the annual Critical Race Theory Summer School in Nashville. I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Fourteen protesters with Florida's Dream Defenders were arrested Wednesday for staging a peaceful sit-in inside the office of Florida's Republican Governor Ron DeSantis at the end of the state's legislative session, in which he backed efforts to ban abortion after six weeks, deny gender-affirming care for youth, roll back rent control, censor discussions of LGBTQ issues and Black history in schools, and crack down on immigrants and unions in his political crusade against \"wokeness.\" We speak with one of the arrested protesters, Nailah Summers-Polite, co-director of Dream Defenders, and Kimberlé Crenshaw, the legal scholar well known for her work in the field of critical race theory, about the Freedom to Learn protests and the push to preserve the integrity of the AP African American studies course attacked by DeSantis and other far-right activists.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report .\n\nWe end today's show looking at the Freedom to Learn. This week, protests were held across the United States against right-wing efforts to ban books and antiracism education in schools.

She was among the first to be arrested during Wednesday's occupation of Governor DeSantis's office. She's joining us now from Miami. Also with us, professor Kimberlé Crenshaw, executive director of the African American Policy Forum, professor of law at both UCLA and Columbia University, joining us from New Orleans.\n\nWe welcome you both to Democracy Now! Nailah, let's begin with you. Explain why you were in Ron DeSantis's office, the possible presidential candidate and governor of Florida? Why did you get arrested?\n\nNAILAH SUMMERS - POLITE : Well, Ron DeSantis has been on a rampage, with our Florida Legislature, attacking the rights of all the people in Florida who don't look or think like him. It's been an onslaught of attacks on immigrants, on Black people, on drag queens, on queer and trans youth, on renters, on teachers, on union members. I mean, it's just been relentless. And it's the last week of legislative session. Today is actually the last day of our legislative session. And we couldn't end it without, you know, taking courageous action and being heard.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Talk about the various bills, one after another made into law, that most concerned you, from reproductive rights to anti- LGBTQ legislation to issues of what teachers can teach in school.\n\nNAILAH SUMMERS - POLITE : Yeah. I mean, DeSantis has been going after working-class people in Florida, against people of color, since he first started off in office. And so, he has been turning the dial, turning up the hate every year, and, I mean, the abortion ban, the six-week abortion ban, you know, taking books out of classrooms of children, expanding \"Don't Say Gay\" 'til 12th grade. They cited the Fugitive Slave Act for a version of an immigration bill that they were trying to pass this year. I mean, it's just undiluted hate. And the entire session, again, has just been a platform for that, and he's attacking so many people in his quest to run for president. So it's all concerning. It's all, you know, attacking people, really putting people at risk in the state of Florida. So, yeah, it was time to do a little, a little extra, take a lot of action.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Professor Crenshaw, if you can put the Florida action, which was one of more than a hundred actions across the country, into context, why you helped to organize this nationwide protest this week?\n\nKIMBERLÉ CRENSHAW : Well, Amy, as we've heard, Ron DeSantis and many others in the anti-woke campaign have gone after a number of constituencies. They've gone after the entire infrastructure that has been developed over the last 50 years to actually make equality a real aspiration. That includes the ideas around equality, the very idea that there is such a thing called structural racism, the very idea that intersectional forms of discrimination still shape the futures of all too many people. The time had come to draw a line in the sand. Too many people had been reading about this issue but didn't know how to get involved in it.\n\nAnd I think when the College Board took the opportunity after the George Floyd murder to offer a course on African American studies, to ride the wave of the demands for frameworks to help people to understand how, 60 years after the passage of civil rights laws, we could all watch a man be choked out by the police on the street. They were driving the possibility for a new course. And at the same time, this was driving the anti-woke cabal, like DeSantis, to create laws against actually using many of these ideas in public education. These two forces came together when the College Board decided to excise all of these ideas that were in demand from the course, after Ron DeSantis said that these were unacceptable ideas.\n\nI think too many Americans finally decided that it was unacceptable to allow this censorship to go forward without being heard from. So, May 3rd was the beginning. It was the day of action, where 150 activities took place all across the country, including two protests at the College Board. It is just the beginning. At FreedomToLearn.net , people can get a sense of why it was important to draw the line, how they could get involved, and why this is a threat to our very democracy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to talk about The Wall Street Journal exposé that revealed, through emails, that the College Board's changes to its AP African American studies curriculum did not include input from members of its development committee. The article quotes Nishani Frazier, a University of Kansas professor on the African American studies development committee, saying, \"We all know this is a blatant lie. In fact, the major changes which occurred came from my unit - and not once did AP speak with me about these changes. Instead, it rammed through revisions, pretended course transformation was business as usual, and then further added insult to injury by attempting to gaslight the public with faux innocence.\" Professor Crenshaw, explain the significance of this exposé and all that it revealed.\n\nKIMBERLÉ CRENSHAW : Well, Amy, that was a letter written in fire. It basically confirmed what anybody who could actually read actually knew. The materials that were taken out, including intersectionality, Black feminism, Black queer studies, the idea of systemic marginalization, these ideas were exactly the ideas that DeSantis said were not educationally valuable, did not pass muster in Florida's anti-woke legislative terrain. So, the fact that the very things that DeSantis didn't like - the fact that those were taken out was met by the College Board saying, \"Well, we did it with consultation of our experts. And some of the things we took out, we took them out because the ideas had been so assaulted by critique and attack that they were no longer educationally valuable.\" You could tell that they were not telling the truth. But this was the smoking gun. This was someone on the committee saying, \"We all know that they were not being truthful,\" and we were basically being thrown out to justify it.\n\nThe real question is whether there will be any accountability for this. What made the College Board think that they could basically say that DeSantis, in trying to abide by anti-wokeness, had nothing to do with it, when they knew there was a paper trail that was going to show otherwise? It's telling us that the same lack of accountability for taking Black lives also potentially applies to taking our voices and our responses to this history of our lives being taken. So, that's why so many people were willing to say, \"Not on our watch. Enough of this. We're going to hold DeSantis accountable, and we're also going to hold institutions like the College Board accountable, as well.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And, Kimberlé Crenshaw, of course, we should say that it was your work on intersectionality - you really have coined this term that has become so powerful, linking so many different movements - that was moved out of the required curriculum of the African American Advanced Placement course. Your response to that?\n\nKIMBERLÉ CRENSHAW : Well, you know, we have to ask: Why is it that the ideas that the anti-woke cabal are so upset about are ideas that people have found incredibly useful? People all over the world use the basic concept of intersectionality to make sense out of facts. You know, a lot of people say, \"Well, it's a concept. It's a term. Why do we need it?\" Well, why do we need grammar? Why do we need to have rules to help us understand how to make meaning out of random phenomena? That's what structural inequality helps people understand. That's what Black feminism helps people to understand. So, taking out these ideas takes out our ability to analyze the situations that we have inherited, and, importantly, to plot, to understand, to organize strategies for transformation. If they want to take it away, it's because it's important. Just like they want to take our votes away because that's important, they want to take our voices away because that's important. That tells us where we have to take the fight.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to turn to Republican Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida telling reporters in February why he opposed the original AP African American studies course. Then, Nailah, I want to get your response.\n\nGOV . RON DESANTIS : This course on Black history, what are one - what's one of the lessons about? Queer theory. Now, who would say that an important part of Black history is queer theory? That is somebody pushing an agenda on our kids. And so, when you look to see they have stuff about intersectionality, abolishing prisons, that's a political agenda.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And last April, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed into law House Bill 7, also known as the Stop WOKE Act, which he claimed will take on critical race theory in the workplace and in schools.\n\nGOV . RON DESANTIS : We believe an important component of freedom in the state of Florida is the freedom from having oppressive ideologies opposed upon you without your consent, whether it be in the classroom or whether it be in the workplace, and we decided to do something about it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, Nailah Summers-Polite, you got arrested over his views this week because you were protesting them in his office. Your response?\n\nNAILAH SUMMERS - POLITE : I mean, I think it should tell us what kind of man Ron DeSantis is. He's unabashedly hateful. He is doing his very best to split us into silos. I mean, what - it's like he's never heard of Bayard Rustin. It's like he's never heard of so many Black queer pioneers, like Marsha P. Johnson. I mean, he just - he thinks it makes it easier to pick us off if we are fighting in silos.\n\nSo, really, what we were doing in his office on Wednesday was we were made up of all the kinds of people he's been attacking. We were queer. We are Black. We are immigrants. We are people who need abortions. We're teachers and union members. And so, we're not going to let him split us up or silo us off. What Dr. Crenshaw was saying about intersectionality is exactly it. Like, we need a multiracial movement to beat people like Ron DeSantis and the Greg Abbotts and the Sarah Huckabee Sanders, all these sort of new Confederate anti-woke people.\n\nSo, yeah, this is what he's doing on his trek to the White House. He's spewing this kind of nonsense. And, you know, we've got to fight back against it. We've got to come together and really resist this kind of rhetoric.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And, Dr. Crenshaw, do you think people are taking what is happening across the country - what, the Missouri Legislature voting that they might defund the libraries; Llano County, Texas, saying - when a judge said, \"You have to keep the books on the shelves,\" saying, \"We'll just shut down our library system\"; how many books are now being taken off the shelves across this country - do you think progressive forces, perhaps the majority of people in this country, are taking this seriously enough?\n\nKIMBERLÉ CRENSHAW : Well, Amy, I think they finally are. I mean, one thing we know is that the majority really is on our side. Americans don't like censorship. They don't like the idea that there are certain things that they're told that they're not able to read. And they especially don't like being told that they're doing this, or they're being told, because they're fighting indoctrination. There's indoctrination at foot in saying that these are ideas that are so dangerous, so divisive to the republic, that the autocrats can dictate whether we can engage them.\n\nLook, the whole point of academic freedom, the whole point of education, is to present material for people to engage in, to develop critical thinking about the world in which they live. Yet, the DeSantises and the anti-woke cabal have the exact opposite orientation. Look, I have no worries whatsoever about people being exposed to ideas that are critical of intersectionality or critical race theory or structural racism. I know the ideas are strong and powerful enough to survive debate. But when the response to ideas that they don't like, including democracy itself, is to try to suppress these ideas, well, that's when we have a problem.\n\nAnd I think now many Americans are waking up to it. It was slow. They thought that it was just about something called critical race theory, without understanding that critical race theory was the entire infrastructure that allowed people to identify racial inequality, racial power as a problem that still undermines our democracy. Now with the College Board doing what it did, people are seeing that the fight is against the anti-woke cabal. And the fight is also against institutions who need to be putting their money where their mouth is. You can't be pro-freedom of education and pro-anti-woke at the same time. The lines are drawn, and they're going to have to choose a side.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We just have 10 seconds. But, Dr. Crenshaw, I saw you on Tuesday night. We did not know at the time what was happening at Broadway-Lafayette subway stop, but Jordan Neely was killed by another passenger. He was Black. He was unhoused. You tweeted, \"Being Black and poor in America should not be crimes punishable by vigilante death.\"\n\nKIMBERLÉ CRENSHAW : And that is exactly the question about how the lack of accountability for taking Black lives extends to this current moment. We have to worry not only about police officers taking our lives, but individuals thinking that they're empowered enough to exact discipline, to exact lethal punishment for the possibility that they might be in fear of someone who needed help, rather than needed death.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Kimberlé Crenshaw, I want to thank you so much for being with us, executive director of the African American Policy Forum, professor at UCLA and Columbia University. By the way, a very happy birthday to you!\n\nKIMBERLÉ CRENSHAW : Thank you!\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And thank you so much to Nailah Summers-Polite.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

The Department of Education has already canceled some $600 million in grants for teacher training on race, social justice and other topics as part of its crusade against \"woke\" policies. This comes as President Donald Trump has said he wants to abolish the agency and tapped major Trump donor and former professional wrestling executive Linda McMahon to carry out that goal; she is expected to be confirmed by the Senate with little or no Republican opposition. Education scholar Julian Vasquez Heilig, who teaches at Western Michigan University, says Trump's moves are part of \"an attempt to privatize education\" in the United States, with DEI used as a wedge to accomplish a larger restructuring of social structures. \"Higher education hasn't faced a crisis like this since potentially McCarthyism.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The Trump administration has given K-through-12 schools and universities a two-week ultimatum to end DEI - diversity, equity and inclusion - initiatives or risk losing federal funding. In a letter sent on Valentine's Day, February 14th, one week ago, to school administrators, the Education Department barred schools and colleges from, quote, \"using race in decisions pertaining to admissions, hiring, promotion, compensation, financial aid, scholarships, prizes, administrative support, discipline, housing, graduation ceremonies and all other aspects of student, academic and campus life,\" unquote. The Education Department has already canceled some $600 million in grants focused on training teachers on critical race theory, social justice and other related topics. Meanwhile, the department's Office for Civil Rights has also declared race-based scholarships, cultural centers and even graduation ceremonies illegal.\n\nThe president of the American Council on Education, which represents more than 1,600 colleges and universities, said in a statement, quote, \"There's nothing specific enough for us to be able to act on in 14 days unless we just wipe the slate clean.\" He added, \"Overcompliance, anticipatory compliance, preemptive compliance is not a strategy. The strategy needs to be much more considered, much more nuanced,\" unquote.\n\nThis comes as Trump's pick to head the Department of Education, Linda McMahon, cleared a committee vote Thursday, and her nomination now heads to the full Senate, where it's expected to be approved. Trump has told reporters he wants McMahon to dismantle the Department of Education.\n\nREPORTER : Why nominate Linda McMahon to be the Education Department secretary if you're going to get rid of the Education Department?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : Because I told Linda, \"Linda, I hope you do a great job and put yourself out of a job.\" I want her to put herself out of a job, Education Department.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Linda McMahon is the former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment and a major Trump donor. During her confirmation hearing earlier this month, she was questioned by Democrat Chris Murphy on Trump's order banning diversity, equity and inclusion, DEI .\n\nSEN . CHRIS MURPHY : My son is in a public school. He takes a class called African American history. If you're running an African American history class, could you perhaps be in violation of this court order - of this executive order?\n\nLINDA McMAHON: I'm not quite certain, and I'd like to look into it further and get back to you on that.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : For more, we're joined by education scholar Julian Vasquez Heilig, professor of educational leadership, research and technology at Western Michigan University. His new piece is headlined \"U.S. Department of Education's 14-Day Ultimatum on Equal Opportunity: Will Universities Surrender or Resist?\" He also helped organize the coalition Defending the Freedom to Learn and served leader - with the NAACP on education and other issues.\n\nThanks so much for being with us. It's great to have you here. Professor, can you start off by talking about the response a week ago, on Valentine's Day, when university and college presidents across the United States got a letter that said, \"End DEI \" - and I want to ask you exactly what that means - \"in two weeks\" -\n\nJULIAN VASQUEZ HEILIG : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : - \"or lose all of your federal funding\"? We're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars across the United States.\n\nJULIAN VASQUEZ HEILIG : Right. Well, first of all, Amy, thank you so much for having me on your show. Just glad, glad to join you.\n\nFirst, you know, I want to say that I think that the higher education community, also the K-12 community, understands that this letter from the U.S. Department of Education doesn't carry the force of law. We do know, of course, that what's happening in Washington, D.C., is that there is uses - they're using resources, finances, as a lever. So, we've seen, for example, funding from the NSF , from the NIH , IES - at Western Michigan University, for example, we've lost $20 million in grants in the College of Education and Human Development. And so, they're really using the power of the purse to try - to attempt to enforce these different - you know, abolishing the Department of Education with this letter.\n\nBut I think it's been really bewildering to K-12 and higher education, which, my understanding, is the goal. I mean, the Office of Management and Budget, the director there has said that that's really the goal of this blitzkrieg, is for all of these requests to be bewildering. And I know in higher education, it's been very difficult. And so you have cabinets, presidents, provosts trying to understand what are going to be the impacts of this. You could see six-figure, seven-figure, eight-figure reductions in research funding. Our attempts to find the cure for cancer, to solve the teacher shortage, to create more efficient energy, all those things are under threat, because over the last hundred years or so, higher education has seen large investments from the federal government, and historically, those investments, that search to solve the teacher shortage and create more efficient energy, etc., they didn't come with strings attached. And now institutions, higher education institutions and K-12 districts are facing millions of dollars in reductions if they don't pause DEI .\n\nNow, you mentioned in your lead-up, \"Well, what is DEI ?\" And I think it's important to talk about what DEI is, actually. DEI is not reverse discrimination. What DEI does is, as educators - and I taught fourth grade. I taught ESL . I've taught college students, doctoral students. What DEI does is it helps us to create more success for historically marginalized communities. So, we want to ensure that African American students, that when we bring them to our campus, that we graduate them - Latino students, students with disabilities, veterans. It's a wide spectrum. And so, I think it's important to understand that DEI is not reverse discrimination. It's our attempts to ensure success for all students on our campus, close those gaps, those equity gaps, in graduation rates, in retention rates. That's what DEI work does. That's why we have Black graduation ceremonies or Mexican American graduation ceremonies. We want to create the climate. We want to create the opportunity for students when they come to us in higher education, when they come to us in our K-12 schools. We want them to be successful. We want all students to be successful, whether they're Jewish or have disabilities, etc. That's what DEI is, and so it's not about reverse discrimination. It's about student success, faculty success, staff success.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to go to a 2023 video on Donald Trump's campaign platform website in which he proposes taking, quote, \"billions and billions of dollars that we will collect by taxing, finding and suing excessively large private university endowments\" to create what he calls the American Academy.\n\nDONALD TRUMP : Whether you want lectures on ancient histories or an introduction to financial accounting or training in a skilled trade, the goal will be to deliver it and get it done properly, using study groups, mentors, industry partnerships and the latest breakthrough in computing. This will be a truly top-tier education option for the people. It will be strictly nonpolitical, and there will be no wokeness or jihadism allowed. None of that's going to be allowed.\n\nMost importantly, the American Academy will compete directly with the existing and very costly four-year university system by granting students degree credentials that the U.S. government and all federal contractors will henceforth recognize. The Academy will award the full and complete equivalent of a bachelor's degree.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I mean, this is very significant. Julian Vasquez Heilig, that Trump is proposing an alternative American education system. We already know what happened with his Trump University. He was successfully sued for this for-profit college. But talk about what he is proposing, the American Academy.\n\nJULIAN VASQUEZ HEILIG : So, first, I want to say - and then I'll directly address the question. First, I want to say that universities are not ideological. So, do we have folks on our campus who are on the right or on the left? Do we have students who are on the right or on the left? Do we have students who are apolitical? Absolutely. But universities are not ideological. They're places of learning. They're the places where the difficult conversations happen. So, I think that's the first thing to say.\n\nAll of the politicians that you see making pronouncements about universities, they all attended universities, some of them the elite Ivy Leagues - the president and vice president, for example. So, I think that's important to say.\n\nI think the second important to say is that this is expected. I want to take you back in history, OK, be a scholar for a moment here. If you think about the dictator Pinochet and what he did after he took over the country of Chile, he understood that as a part of the autocratic playbook, that you have to privately control and privatize education. And so you see a push for this in K-12 education right now with school vouchers, which is that we want education to be privatized. It's not a public good. And so what you see here, I believe, is an attempt to privatize education. And I'm sure it will be for profit. And, you know, he didn't speak to that. And so, this is a part of that sort of classic playbook, because when something is in the public realm, it's a public good. And so, what you see here is really an attempt to privatize education, by all indications.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to go to Russell Vought, head of the Office of Management and Budget, who was architect of Project 2025, the radical playbook to seize executive power, radically reshape federal agencies. Last year, undercover reporters with the Center for Climate Reporting recorded Vought discussing his plan.\n\nRUSSELL VOUGHT : I am opposed to the Department of Education because I think it's a department of critical race theory.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was Vought speaking on television.\n\nI want to go now, in response to the threats to DEI programs and LGBTQ outreach from the Trump administration, to the president of Mount Holyoke, Danielle Holley, who recently said, \"To basically comply with things that are not within our values simply because we feel a threat of investigation is something that we should not be doing as the higher education community. Instead, we need to just say 'No! Here's what we stand for. We will continue to stand for this. And if you believe that you can legally challenge our mission or our values, that's up to you to try to do,'\" the president of Mount Holyoke said, who herself is African American.\n\nJulian Vasquez Heilig, if you can tell us what is happening right now across the country?\n\nJULIAN VASQUEZ HEILIG : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This whole idea of obeying in advance, and, you know, because of the very real threat -\n\nJULIAN VASQUEZ HEILIG : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : - of losing so much money and funding, that will hurt the very people that these university presidents are trying to protect.\n\nJULIAN VASQUEZ HEILIG : Yeah, yes. First, let me just address Vought. So, you know, he also said, \"We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected. When they wake up in the morning, we want them not to want to go to work, because, increasingly, we want them viewed as the villains. We want their funding to be shut down. We want them to be put in trauma.\" So I think that helps us understand the blitzkrieg from political actors right now, is that they really want to put higher education in trauma. That's almost a direct quote from from Vought. So, I think that helps sort of contextualize.\n\nNow, we have some difficult decisions to make as higher education leaders, as K-12 leaders, some very difficult decisions, because, as I mentioned, over the last hundred years, universities have become very dependent on solving the world's issues through research, and so that means there's millions of dollars that the federal government has been providing without strings attached. Well, now there's going to be strings attached.\n\nBut who's to say that diversity is where these conversations stop? So, what if, after diversity, the question is, \"Well, we don't want you to have unions,\" or \"We don't want you to have a College of Fine Arts, because we don't think that that's appropriate\"?\n\nAnd so, when there's strings attached - so, universities have to make two decisions. One, there will have to be courage, like the president of Mount Holyoke or the president at Wesleyan in Connecticut, or, two, patronage. So, in talking with some folks, some scholars at the University of Michigan, yesterday, there's really those two choices for higher education institutions. And so, there's a side where we're going to have to innovate and rethink how higher education is funded, or we're going to have to succumb to a system of patronage where the federal government - you know, in four years, a Democrat might come in as president and say, \"You won't receive federal funding unless you have DEI programs.\" So, that's really the road we're headed down.\n\nAnd then, I think one - just one final thought, which is that when we hire leaders in higher education, we typically look at their pedigree. Did they go to Harvard or Berkeley or Stanford? Were they department chairs or deans? But now we have to have additional criteria when we're selecting our leaders, our deans, our department chairs. It involves courage. It involves morality. It involves empathy. So, we need special kinds of leaders in this very difficult time. I would argue that higher education hasn't faced a crisis like this since potentially McCarthyism. And so, we need a different kind of leader to address these modern challenges also.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And finally, are there lawsuits being planned? There's one week to go after this letter.\n\nJULIAN VASQUEZ HEILIG : Yeah. Well, there's already multiple lawsuits. For example, my understanding is that the NIH funding has been paused in court, from a report that I read from President Ono.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The freeze has been paused.\n\nJULIAN VASQUEZ HEILIG : Yeah, the freeze has been paused. Yeah, exactly. So, there is. I know that the APLU and the AAU - so, these are the conglomerates of the different kinds of institutions - that they're involved in litigation, too. I suspect that you'll see litigation from the civil rights community. And I think that's part of the strategy for educators. And, you know, I think it's important for us to understand that academics, educators, we have to create alliances with students and engage in political and legal advocacy, and research and document and publicize how these things are actually impacting our institutions and who they're impacting.\n\nAnd then I think it's also - one final thought is that we have to leverage our professional associations or organizations, accrediting bodies. There's a reason why accrediting bodies are also being targeted, because accrediting bodies set the standards for universities. So, it's very important that we create these coalitions, and so that as this pressure continues on higher education and K-12, that we can respond, because the number one priority of our institutions is student success. And I don't believe - my argument is that none of this is in the best interest of students.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Julian Vasquez Heilig, we thank you so much for joining us, from Kalamazoo, Michigan, professor of educational leadership, research and technology at Western Michigan University. We'll link to your new piece , \"U.S. Department of Education's 14-Day Ultimatum on Equal Opportunity: Will Universities Surrender or Resist?\"\n\nUp next, Erasing History: How Fascists Rewrite the Past to Control the Future . We'll speak with Yale philosopher Jason Stanley. Back in 20 seconds.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Historian Quinn Slobodian says three strains of conservatism have converged to form the second Trump administration's anti-democratic coalition: finance-backed corporate interests previously friendly to the Democratic Party, Christian conservative think tanks who have long advocated for the end of the administrative state, and the online-driven movement of reactionary extremists who traffic in white supremacist and neo-Nazi rhetoric. Meanwhile, says Slobodian, \"Trump is a person who doesn't believe in much, but he believes in money,\" leaving him willing to enact the political visions of these three pro-capitalist projects. Slobodian, an expert in German history, also discusses the connections between the Trump sphere and Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, supported by Musk and Vice President JD Vance.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : We look further now at the purge of the federal government underway by DOGE , led by tech billionaire Elon Musk, the richest man in the world. As protests mount, the two, Donald Trump and Elon Musk, appeared on Fox News together to defend their cuts. This is Elon Musk.\n\nELON MUSK : I think what we're seeing here is the sort of - the thrashing of the bureaucracy as we try to restore democracy and the will of the people.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : This comes as President Trump spoke at an investor conference in Miami Wednesday and floated the idea of sharing some of the savings he claims DOGE is making.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : There's even under consideration a new concept where we give 20% of the DOGE savings to American citizens and 20% goes to paying down debt, because the numbers are incredible, Elon, so many billions of dollars - billions, hundreds of billions.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : For more, we're joined by Quinn Slobodian, professor of international history at Boston University, author of Crack-Up Capitalism . His new piece is \"Speed Up the Breakdown.\" It's about Musk's push to do that.\n\nWe welcome you to Democracy Now! Professor Slobodian, if you can start off by telling us what Elon Musk is doing? This whole question over the last two days: What is his role? Does he run the Department of Government Efficiency, that President Trump says, when questioned about it, because court papers came out that indicated he didn't, he just said, \"Well, what counts is he's a patriot\"?\n\nQUINN SLOBODIAN : Yeah, I mean, I might have something to say about the patriot question later, but I think that, first, I think it's helpful to kind of dispel some of the fog of war and the sort of chaotic, anarchistic impressions that we're getting out of Washington these days, with a sense of what the actual lineages are of the political projects we're seeing unfolding here, because I think, and what I wrote about in the piece , is I think there's basically three somewhat distinct political projects underway here that haven't really had the chance to weave together and have the space close to power the way that they have now in the past.\n\nThe first one is the idea that the government should be run like a corporation, right? There's a kind of a core Clintonite notion here that we should treat citizens like consumers, we should, you know, expose bureaucracy to the same kind of competitive pressures and kind of hallmarking and benchmarking that private companies are, and then you have to go in and sort of act like an asset-stripping private equity firm and peel out all the waste and abuse and put back in sort of more efficient processes. That's how Musk sold DOGE to the American people in late 2024, and that's actually why even some Democrats were on board with a DOGE caucus already in December still. So, there's something kind of normal about that, and there's a reason why Musk has been posting pictures of Clinton and Gore and saying, \"Hey, I'm just doing that sort of business here.\" But, obviously, things have gone to another level.\n\nAnd the second, I think, strain of politics that's plugged in here is closer to that of Russell Vought at the Office of Management and Budget, one of the people who was critical to the Project 2025 document. And that is a more often Christian conservative sort of think tank vision of deconstructing the administrative state, not to make it more efficient and to cost cut to get to more efficiency and sort of productivity, but because you think certain things that the government has been doing are fundamentally illegitimate. So, there should be no kind of redistributive role for the government. There should be no role covering things like the protection of the environment or the provision of special education or the provision of sort of projects towards gender equity, antiracism and things of that nature. So, the idea there is you permanently sort of hobble the Leviathan of the state and, you know, hack back some of its capacity, send that back to the states and produce a government that governs intensively but not extensively, so, you know, order, military budget, maybe federal abortion bans, but all the other sort of post-civil rights, Great Society programs get sort of permanently euthanized.\n\nThe third strain, though, that sort of gets to some of the more extreme dynamics that people have been picking up on is what I think you can call right-wing accelerationism. So, this is a kind of very online ideology, often associated with people like Curtis Yarvin and Nick Land. And there, the idea is that you don't just sort of trim the state or kind of streamline it, but you shatter it altogether. And so, there's a vision of total decentralization of sovereignty, back to smaller kind of fortified private enclaves, turning the United States into a kind of a patchwork of fiefdoms, or \"sovcorps,\" as Yarvin calls them, where people are sort of, you know, opting in, paying to get into gated communities, and then sort of in zero-sum social Darwinist competition with the world beyond them. And that's quite sci-fi and kind of speculative, but at times I think that the sort of sense of panic that we feel is people wondering whether you can just delete all of the kind of capacities of the state and expect to be able to plug them back in at any level afterwards, or if there is a kind of irreversible process of dismantlement happening here.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : And so, Professor Slobodian, we'll get to Curtis Yarvin in a minute, whom you mentioned, but if you could elaborate on some of the ideological precursors to these three strains you identify? I mean, you mentioned in the second, for example, deconstructing the administrative state. We heard that first from Steve Bannon. So, if you could, you know, elaborate on where these strains are coming from within the American political tradition, most recently, you know, the last Trump administration, but also prior to that?\n\nQUINN SLOBODIAN : Yeah, I mean, many of these things that we think of as kind of natural parts of the way the U.S. government operates - for example, something like income tax - are actually just over a hundred years old. So, the idea of having a federal government that oversees many parts of social life is actually - you know, it's only a few generations in the past. And there are conservatives who see that as a kind of a project of decline.\n\nSo, famous examples would be someone like James Burnham, who wrote about what he called the managerial revolution. So, there was this fear that, you know, the kind of the essence of American enterprise was being strangled because there were just all of these civil servants producing a kind of a sclerotic layer over the economy and then pursuing their own kind of ideological projects. So, Russell Vought at OMB talks about what he calls the \"woke and weaponized bureaucracy.\" He talks about a almost complete Marxist takeover of the government.\n\nSo, this isn't really that much of a sort of neoliberal economic way of thinking. It's this belief that the state is a kind of a battlefield for opposing ideologies. And that's been, you know, pretty consistent on the American right, and certainly was informing Steve Bannon's more cultural and political idea of the kind of wars that need to be fought inside of bureaucracy and, indeed, outside of it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And can you talk about that battle right now between Bannon and Elon Musk, and who, in fact, is winning? He's been talking about vowing to get Elon Musk kicked out, just said, \"He's a truly evil guy, a very bad guy,\" and most recently referred to him as a \"parasitic illegal immigrant.\" Talk more about these two strains.\n\nQUINN SLOBODIAN : Sure. Yeah, I mean, this really flared up, obviously, at the end of last year with the debate about immigration, with the sort of Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy, Silicon Valley wing defending temporary visas, so-called H-1B visas, for their sector, because they need a lot of skilled workers kind of in the back office, and then Bannon saying that that was itself unpatriotic, and there needed to be a American-jobs-for-American-native-workers policy and a much more complete kind of exclusion of, you know, new incoming workers.\n\nWhat was interesting is that got extremely heated. I mean, as you say, Bannon has been not holding back at all in the way he's been describing Silicon Valley as an \"apartheid state.\" He's even using categories that are more common on the left, like calling it \"technofeudalism,\" and claiming that, like, the bayonets are out, and he's advancing, and he's coming for Musk. But what's symptomatic and interesting there is the way that Trump has sort of kept aloof from the whole conflict, right? I think that he is probably instinctively seeing you don't actually need to choose a side. Actually, you can accommodate - and you will, I think, and are accommodating - both sides of this apparent schism inside of the big MAGA coalition.\n\nSo, there's no reason why the kind of hard-border nativists can't get the kind of sadistic roundups that you were talking about at the top of the program, can't produce terror in the lives of young people in the way that they are doing so effectively, that will fulfill the kind of libidinal, sadistic desires of a certain sector of the MAGA coalition, even as, you know, more quietly, you keep doing more pragmatic immigration policy to fill out the programmers in the back offices of Silicon Valley. I think that, more likely than not, we're going to get a mixture of both.\n\nAnd as to who gets closest to Trump's ear, I mean, the answer, I think, is in the bank accounts. There are 500 billion reasons why Trump is going to listen to Musk more than he's going to listen to Bannon. And Trump is a person who doesn't believe in much, but he believes in money. And he doesn't trust many people, but he trusts people who are richer than him. And Musk's ability to kind of, you know, stroll through the White House as if he has been elected himself, have his 3-year-old sort of like muttering to Trump in the middle of a press conference, I think it gives us as much evidence as we need of the fact that he has been given kind of carte blanche here to act as, effectively, unelected co-president.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, let's go back to Curtis Yarvin, who you mentioned earlier. This is Yarvin speaking on The New York Times podcast The Interview last month. In this clip, he's asked about his belief that the Civil War and the end of chattel slavery were bad for the formerly enslaved.\n\nDAVID MARCHESE : But are you seriously arguing that the era of slavery was somehow better than the era -\n\nCURTIS YARVIN : The era of 1865 to 1875 was absolutely - and the war itself wasn't good, either, but if you look at the living conditions for an African American in the South, they are absolutely at their nadir between 1865 and 1875. They are very, very bad, because, basically, this economic system has been disrupted -\n\nDAVID MARCHESE : But abolition was a necessary step to get through that period towards -\n\nCURTIS YARVIN : So -\n\nDAVID MARCHESE : - to make people free.\n\nCURTIS YARVIN : Sure.\n\nDAVID MARCHESE : Like, I can't believe I'm arguing this.\n\nCURTIS YARVIN : Brazil - Brazil abolished slavery in the 1880s without a civil war.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : So, that was Curtis Yarvin, someone who Vice President JD Vance frequently invokes. And back in 2021, Vance, then Ohio candidate for U.S. Senate, he was interviewed by the conservative Jack Murphy Live podcast. Murphy just asked Vance how to root out wokeism from American institutions.\n\nJD VANCE : There's this guy Curtis Yarvin, who's written about some of these things. And so, one is to basically accept that this entire thing is going to fall in on itself, right? ... I tend to think that we should seize the institutions of the left and turn them against the left, right? We need like a de-Ba'athification program, but like a de-woke-ification program in the United States, right?\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : So, if you could tell us, Professor Slobodian, who is Curtis Yarvin? You note in your recent New York Review of Books piece , \"His idea\" - this is quote - \"His idea of RAGE - Retire All Government Employees - looks a lot like that of DOGE .\" So, who is this guy? Where did he emerge from? And how did he become so influential?\n\nQUINN SLOBODIAN : Yeah, I mean, he was someone who moved to the Bay Area and became a computer programmer, also kind of an amateur poet, and, I guess, most importantly, a pretty widely read blogger in the 2000s, especially the late 2000s, under the name Mencius Moldbug. And he became someone who was kind of giving voice to a nascent kind of what was called neo-reactionary or Dark Enlightenment sentiment in Silicon Valley, which I think combines, as the way I've been describing it, a kind of belief in economistic bottom-line thinking and productivity, but then also an idea that what we need to get back to is a proper sense of hierarchy in this country and in the world.\n\nSo, one of the problems of the administrative state is that it has been pursuing equality, and it's been working under the false assumption that all humans are somehow equal, that in fact there are kind of hierarchies of intelligence, best measured in IQ, which people like Yarvin and increasingly Vance and Trump are seemingly quite obsessed with. It can be measured in things like race - group differences in IQ are, you know, commonly assumed to be real empirical facts in the world of the sort of Silicon Valley right - and, perhaps most importantly, into hierarchies of gender. So, the masculinity component in all of this is kind of impossible to overstate. There is a reason why the sort of apparent scrambling of gender in gender queer and trans movements is so triggering and so terrifying to people in this world. Elon Musk has described the \"woke mind virus\" as having killed his child, even though his child is very much alive.\n\nSo, the project, I think, is really about how, through the mechanisms of the market and the dismantlement of the sort of post-New Deal state, the post-Great Society and civil rights state, we can get back to what they see as a more natural world where men are in charge, white people are in charge, and there is a kind of restoration of the natural order of things. And that sort of wishy-washy treatment of things like slavery is sort of a provocative way of reopening those questions.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And, Professor Slobodian, this is about both JD Vance and Elon Musk, the question of their stance on the far-right German party AfD. On Friday, Vice President JD Vance gave a speech at the Munich Security Conference where he repeatedly attacked Europe on a number of issues. And he, while in Germany, held a 30-minute meeting Friday with the head of Germany's far-right AfD party, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz rebuking Vance for meeting with the AfD ahead of Germany's election. And, of course, you have Elon Musk repeatedly using his social media platform X to support what many call the neo-Nazi party, or the Nazi-curious party, for those who are more generous.\n\nQUINN SLOBODIAN : Yeah, I mean, the AfD in Germany is actually a really good example of one of these sort of strange bedfellow-type parties that I actually think is sort of unhelpfully described as either neo-Nazi or Nazi-curious. What it actually is is it was founded by ordoliberal economics professors who disliked the way Merkel was handling the eurozone crisis, and thought you needed more monetary discipline and more fiscal discipline. They then created an alliance with basically ethnonationalists, traditionalist members of the so-called New Right, who felt that modernity had produced a fallen world, and we needed to get back to more rooted links to the land and that certain populations belonged in some spaces and not others. And now they have created this kind of this far-right neoliberal party, that Alice Weidel sort of gives voice to when she says that, you know, \"We're actually a libertarian conservative party,\" as she said in her Spaces chat with Musk.\n\nThe AfD is one of only many far-right parties that now Musk is aggressively platforming. In the last few days, he has promoted Viktor Orbán, Giorgia Meloni, the AfD, and in the past has gone as far as promoting Tommy Robinson, the sort of far-right figure from the U.K. He has adopted not just sort of a tame language of democracy, as Vance tends to be using, but a language as he used in the rally that he zoomed into of \"Germany for the Germans\" and saying that multiculturalism must not be allowed to dilute the German people. So these are now proper tropes of the far right as such, and indeed tropes of the \"great replacement\" theory, which suggests that liberals have used welfare policy and refugee policy to buy voters, which can then swamp and dilute the native population. This has now become a common talking point.\n\nThe thing that I think is interesting and important, and perhaps a sign of rare optimism these days, is that Germans actually don't like Elon Musk interfering in their politics. Polls have showed that, of non-AfD voters, you know, well over three-quarters thinks he has no right to butt in. And even among AfD voters, only about half actually wants him to be involved. So, I think what we're seeing already is a bit of a backlash against his attempt to kind of, you know, play kingmaker in countries, another country that is not his own. The Left Party in Germany has had a surge in recent weeks. They have more people entering the party now than they have since 2009. That's partially on the back of like a really full-throated anti-fascist call for the defense of democratic principles by the young leaders, the young female leaders of that party. So I think there is a chance here of his belief that he can just, you know, play puppet master globally actually having a boomerang effect and backlashing on his own attempts at manipulation.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Quinn Slobodian, we want to thank you for being with us, professor of international history at Boston University, author of Crack-Up Capitalism: Market Radicals and the Dream of a World Without Democracy .

Táíwò, who has recently written two widely acclaimed books: \"Elite Capture: How the Powerful Took Over Identity Politics (And Everything Else)\" and \"Reconsidering Reparations,\" which focuses in part on the climate crisis. He says identity politics is a concept that was stripped of its radical power to build solidarity and is now weaponized to split people into ever narrower categories that hamper movements for racial and social justice. \"Elite capture is what happens when the advantaged few in a group steer the resources and political direction of organizations or movements or parts of our social structure like the justice system toward their narrower interests and aims,\" Táíwò says.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González, as we end today's show with the philosopher Olúfẹ́mi O. Táíwò. He has recently written two widely acclaimed books: Elite Capture: How the Powerful Took Over Identity Politics (And Everything Else) and Reconsidering Reparations , which focuses in part on the climate crisis.\n\nRobin D. G. Kelley, author of Freedom Dreams: The Black Radical Imagination , has said, quote, \"Olúfẹ́mi O. Táíwò is a thinker on fire. He not only calls out empire for shrouding its bloodied hands in the cloth of magical thinking but calls on all of us to do the same. Elite capture, after all, is about turning oppression and its cure into a (neo)liberal commodity exchange where identities become capitalism's latest currency rather than the grounds for revolutionary transformation.\"\n\nFor more, we're joined by Olúfẹ́mi O. Táíwò, associate professor of philosophy at Georgetown University.\n\nWe welcome you to Democracy Now! , Professor. Thanks so much for being with us. Why don't we start off by you defining the term \"elite capture\"?\n\nOLÚFẸ́MI O. TÁÍWÒ: Well, thanks a lot for having me.\n\nThe basic idea behind elite capture is kind of like the idea behind inequality. So, elite capture is what happens when the advantaged few in a group steer the resources and political direction of organizations or movements or parts of our social structure, like the justice system, towards their narrower interests and aims.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And could you talk about how that works in practice in day-to-day activities within Black and Brown communities especially?\n\nOLÚFẸ́MI O. TÁÍWÒ: So, how this works in practice, I think, works a lot through the ways that we talk and communicate about politics and about what's going on in our lives. I think there is often a discussion that is related to elite capture when people talk about the corporate control of media and the result on our kind of day-to-day discussions and day-to-day understanding of politics. So, when we have conversations about things like racial justice, or even justice with respect to class politics and the class struggle, and end up steering those conversations around the kinds of conversational topics that have to do with representation in elite spaces, whether we're talking about universities or maybe media, like movies and film, and recognition for excellence in those kinds of aspects of life, that is the result, one could argue - I argue - of the disproportionate control of the institutions that control how we get information about politics on the day-to-day conversations that we have about politics.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, obviously, the Black Lives Matter movement and the upsurge of protest in recent years has led many of these institutions to basically create this whole new diversity, equity and inclusion industry, as I call it. I'm wondering your sense of how this attempt by the power structures to coopt these grassroots movements, how that has affected the way that especially the African American and Latino intelligentsia react to the DEI movement.\n\nOLÚFẸ́MI O. TÁÍWÒ: I definitely think there is a big influence there. And on the one hand, I think the response of the powerful to try to coopt grassroots movements in this way kind of reflects a sort of political victory that was won. A hundred years ago, the powers that be weren't trying to appear woke or weren't championing diversity and inclusion. Explicit, formal segregation was the rule in the United States, in South Africa. And over time, as those systems got pressured by grassroots movements that opposed things like Jim Crow and apartheid, then you saw what you're talking about, which was the rise of equity, diversity and inclusion initiatives and the use of the kind of energy generated by those movements to kind of wash or paint over the ongoing existence of structural racism and of capitalism and of the class injustices that are built into capitalism, but do it with, you know, a kind of rainbow coalition of faces in high places.\n\nAnd the intelligentsia at universities, which is one of the sectors of society that has been affected by this, has definitely responded to the rise in equity, diversity and inclusion kind of corporate framings by focusing on optics rather than kind of the material struggles which caused the creation of ethnic studies programs in the first place, which caused the rise of the study of racial justice and gender justice and all the other sorts of things that get studied under the heading of what we would now think of as EDI .\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Fẹ́mi, you talk about the Combahee River Collective and its relation to and framing of identity politics. Tell us what it is, once again - we've discussed it many times before - but how it frames identity politics, that you think are critical in this country.\n\nOLÚFẸ́MI O. TÁÍWÒ: So, the Combahee River Collective was a collective of queer Black women socialists that organized in and around Boston in the 1970s and, of course, has - the members of the collective have continued to be involved in politics since. And they coined this term \"identity politics\" that now gets used a lot these days.\n\nAnd as they thought of identity politics, or as they wrote about it in their manifesto, identity politics was essentially the drive to do politics starting from a first-personal basis. So, you look at your life and your political circumstances, and figure out your political priorities and work from there. That's compatible with ending up in coalitional politics, which is in fact what many of the members of this coalition did, in fact, do.\n\nBut I think nowadays when people use the term \"identity politics,\" they're thinking of the ways of talking about identity that circulate on social media, which are maybe more commonly hostile to coalitional politics, or at least suspicious about coalitional politics, and which seem to emphasize and encourage people kind of splitting up into smaller and smaller groups and only being willing to work with and advocate for people whose identities match theirs or most closely match the person who's speaking. And that's quite different from what I understand the point of the Combahee River Collective's coining of the term \"identity politics\" to be.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: In your book, you also talk about lessons that can be learned from the African struggle against colonialism, specifically in Cape Verde and in Guinea-Bissau against Portuguese colonialism in the 1960s and '70s. Could you expound on that?\n\nOLÚFẸ́MI O. TÁÍWÒ: Yes. So, the wars of independence that were fought throughout the African continent and the world beyond the African continent were linked. And the Bissau-Guinean and Cape Verdean struggle against the Portuguese Empire was one of these. They had to organize within themselves and across the groups that divided them and the groupings that divided them. That included divides between Bissau-Guineans and Cape Verdeans. That included divides on religious grounds and ethnic grounds between people.\n\nAnd they had to organize, zooming out, across much larger divides. They were part a wave of African independence struggles that were organizing with each other through the Organization of African Unity, as it was called then, and across some of the new country lines. There was international support from countries like Bulgaria and Sweden and the Soviet Union, and Cuba even went as far as to send troops.\n\nAnd all of these kinds of divisions, or potential divisions, were things that they had to be willing to work across to get their goal accomplished, which was defeating the Portuguese Empire, which was a NATO member state and had the material support of corporations like Lockheed Martin and countries like the United States. And they were ultimately successful in that struggle because they were willing to work across all of those kinds of factors of division.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Professor Táíwò, finally, in the minute we have left, a recent Grist interview described you as \"One of America's most prominent philosophers who argue that climate change calls us to rethink world history.\" Can you lay out what you call the constructive view of reparations?\n\nOLÚFẸ́MI O. TÁÍWÒ: Basically, what I mean by the constructive view of reparations is the idea that we do need the people who have gotten rich off the spoils of yesterday's injustice, yesterday's apartheid, yesterday's laying of the groundwork for today's capitalism, and there needs to be redistribution from the large corporations that have gotten all of that wealth to the rest of the people throughout the world.\n\nBut the point of that redistribution isn't just so we can shuffle around cells on an Excel spreadsheet. I think we should also be building a different kind of world that doesn't structurally run on racism and other kinds of oppression and capitalism. And the construction of constructive view is the point of building that world. That world would have a much different energy system. It would produce things in a different way. It would manage resources in a different and more democratic way. And I think those are the kinds of changes we have to think about building, rather than only thinking about redistributing money or only thinking about tearing down the structures that we have now.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Olúfẹ́mi O. Táíwò, we want to thank you so much for being with us, associate professor of philosophy at Georgetown University, author of, most recently, two books, the most recent, Elite Capture: How the Powerful Took Over Identity Politics (And Everything Else) and Reconsidering Reparations .\n\nThat does it for our show.

      "text": "Trump Said He's Going To 'End' Woke - But Experts Point Out This Embarrassing Mistake\n\nSenior Reporter, Work/Life\n\nIn Tuesday's joint address of Congress, President Donald Trump said there was one bogeyman he wanted America to stand against: Being \"woke.\"\n\n\"We've ended the tyranny of so-called diversity, equity and inclusion policies all across the entire federal government,\" he declared . \"Our country will be woke no longer.\"\n\nTrump's rally against wokeness is just the latest way this four-letter word has been co-opted by Republicans to mean the worst of humanity and to criticize progressive policies. Trump has previously said he doesn't like the term \"woke,\" believing that most people \"can't even define it.\"\n\nBut can he? Can you?\n\nIf you're confused about what exactly Trump means, you're not alone. The search result of \"What does woke mean?\" spiked +3,750% during Trump's address, according to Google .\n\nAlthough it is now a rallying cry for the GOP of what not to be, it had much more positive origins in America ― and many often get it wrong.\n\nLong before \"woke\" became a pejorative word by Republicans like Trump, the word had positive connotations that originated in Black vernacular.\n\nWokeness has been used to protest injustice since the early 1900s. In one of the earliest uses, Blues musician Lead Belly evoked the phrase in his song \"Scottsboro Boys\" that was about Black teens who were falsely accused of raping white women in Scottsboro, Alabama. In the song, musician Lead Belly warns of the South, \"I advise everybody to be a little careful when they go down there. Stay woke. Keep your eyes open.\"\n\nMost recently, during the Black Lives Matter movement of the 2010s, young Black people online popularized the hashtag #staywoke as a rallying cry to stay politically aware of systemic injustices and to protest police killing Black people .\n\nElaine Richardson, an Ohio State University literacy professor who specializes in African diaspora literacy studies, co-authored a 2018 paper that traced the history of the word.\n\n\"The Black word woke, in referring specifically to a political consciousness type of being awake, is an excellent example of how Black people develop African American language by imbuing it with concepts needing to be expressed efficiently ― in one word,\" Richardson and her co-author Alice Ragland wrote in the paper.\n\nClearly, the way Trump has used it to stoke political division is a long ways from the word's Black solidarity origins.\n\n\"'Woke' has definitely been co-opted and stripped of its Black cultural roots and meaning,\" Richardson told HuffPost. \"It has been used to manipulate white fear and to promote hate, by people who do not want equity for Black people and other marginalized groups.\"\n\nTrump's broadly negative meaning of woke might also be by design. In his speech to Congress, Trump made the claim that because the country would be woke no longer, professionals like doctors and accountants will now \"be hired and promoted based on skill and competence, not race or gender.\"\n\nIt's a claim that pits diversity, equity, and inclusion against meritocracy ― a false divide, many DEI experts stress, because DEI is actually what is necessary for a fair playing field in the workplace to be possible.\n\nUnder the status quo, multiple studies show that white men are the most likely to get job and education opportunities that are not based in merit.\n\nBut according to Republicans, \"wokeness\" needs to be rooted out. Similar to Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also frequently campaigned against the horrors of \"woke mob\" and signed legislation known as the \"Stop WOKE Act\" to ban instruction in schools or jobs that suggest a person is privileged or oppressed because of their race, sex or national origin ― and had enforcement provisions that were later blocked by a federal judge .\n\nWhen asked in a federal court, DeSantis' general counsel said the term referred to \"the belief there are systemic injustices in American society and the need to address them.\"\n\nDavey Shlasko, CEO and Founder of Think Again Training & Consulting, said Trump's definition might be similar to what DeSantis' lawyer said when he was asked to define \"woke.\"\n\n\"I think that is actually what Trump and others are talking about when they're against wokeness ― they don't want people to acknowledge, understand or work against systemic injustice,\" Shlasko said.\n\nAt the same time, Shlasko said others may connect Trump's version of wokeness to other things Trump has said that are more explicitly racist \"and hear it as a condemnation of people who aren't like them, or as permission to see people who aren't like them as less than human.\"\n\nBut if you hear woke as a bad word, that might say more about you than the person you are ridiculing, according to experts.\n\n\"Maybe some of the people who make fun of people for being woke are secretly jealous that those people seem to have something going for them, whether it be clarity of analysis, or solidarity ... or the ability to succeed in spite of systemic inequality,\" Shlasko said.\n\nThe truth is, Trump's view of wokeness is in the shrinking minority. In a 2023 USA TODAY/Ipsos poll , a majority of Americans said the word had a more positive definition.\n\nIn the survey, 56% said the term means \"to be informed, educated on and aware of social injustices.\" This group included not just three in four Democrats who believed this statement ― but also more than a third of Republicans.\n\nRecently, two-time Oscar winner and political activist Jane Fonda said , \"'Woke' just means you give a damn about other people.\" And, as Shlasko put it, if you follow the original meaning of the word, being woke is not a bad thing.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Oxford Dictionary Officially Extends Its Definition Of 'Woke'\n\nBlack Voices Editor/Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost\n\nThe dictionary just got a little more \"woke.\"\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary, which is updated four times per year, has expanded the definition of \"woke\" online and in its forthcoming print update. Though the word is also a past participle of the verb \"wake,\" for years, black people have been using the term to describe social and political awareness.\n\nOn their website, the dictionary defines it as \" alert to injustice in society, especially racism .\" Oxford notes that the word has more recently become \"prominent in general American use,\" which prompted them to extend the word as an adjective.\n\n\"The original meaning of adjectival woke (and earlier woke up) was simply 'awake', but by the mid-20th century, woke had been extended figuratively to refer to being 'aware' or 'well informed' in a political or cultural sense,\" Oxford explains. \"In the past decade, that meaning has been catapulted into mainstream use with a particular nuance of 'alert to racial or social discrimination and injustice', popularized through the lyrics of the 2008 song 'Master Teacher' by Erykah Badu, in which the words 'I stay woke' serve as a refrain, and more recently through its association with the Black Lives Matter movement, especially on social media.\"\n\nThe dictionary notes that it isn't new for black culture and language to be adopted by non-black people who don't fully understand or appreciate the context behind them. Because of this, the OED Appeals Program is seeking contextual evidence of \"woke\" in the sense of being socially aware that dates earlier than Badu's 2008 reference. (Black author William Melvin Kelly used \"woke\" to mean \"well-informed, up-to-date\" in a glossary about black slang in a 1962 New York Times article.)\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts for holding \"woke\" events .\n\nFonda, a lifelong actor, activist and 1960s counterculture icon, took to the Shrine Auditorium stage to receive a Life Achievement Award. She praised her fellow actors for creating empathy through their craft.\n\n\"While you may hate the behavior of your character, you have to understand and empathize with the traumatized person you're playing, right?\" Fonda said onstage. \"I'm thinking Sebastian Stan in 'The Apprentice.' Make no mistake, empathy is not weak or 'woke.'\"\n\nShe continued, \"And by the way, 'woke' just means you give a damn about other people.\"\n\nFonda didn't identify Trump by name, but did mention Stan's nominated performance in the 2024 drama about Trump's unscrupulous rise as a real estate magnate - which the Trump campaign tried to keep from release before last year's presidential election.\n\nFonda's clear-cut definition prompted raucous applause from the star-studded audience. Trump and his allies have often criticized Democrats , progressives and others opposed to his politics as \"woke,\" which is defined as \"alert to injustice in society, especially racism\" in the Oxford English Dictionary .\n\nEarlier this month, Trump announced he was taking over the Kennedy Center as chairman, claiming the iconic arts venue was being ruined by \"woke\" performances.\n\n\"We don't need woke at the Kennedy Center,\" he told reporters at the time .\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Ron DeSantis Went Down With The Anti-Woke Ship\n\n\"Florida is where woke goes to die,\" Gov. Ron DeSantis declared at a victory speech in November 2022, just after winning his second term as governor of Florida. He'd just had a decisive win in an election that wasn't otherwise particularly good for Republicans across the country, and he'd done it by promoting himself as an anti-woke warrior.\n\nIt wasn't his official presidential campaign announcement, but it was still a pitch to voters nationwide: I'm the candidate who can defeat the creeping specter of wokeness infecting schools, workplaces, and our culture as a whole.\n\nBut one year after that victory speech that unofficially anointed him as a formidable opponent to Donald Trump, he's polling in a far distant second place to the former president, and he's been unable to take his anti-woke message nationwide. What happened?\n\nIs DeSantis a bad messenger, is his anti-wokeness message just not resonating with GOP voters - or is the grip Trump has on the Republican electorate just too strong?\n\n\"It's a little bit of all the above,\" Alex Conant, a GOP consultant for Firehouse Strategies, a public affairs firm, told HuffPost.\n\nOriginally, \"woke\" was a term in African American Vernacular English meaning to stay alert to racial discrimination. But soon after the racial justice protests swept the country in the wake of the murder of George Floyd, conservative pundits co-opted the term to derogatorily refer to anything related to progressivism, equality or diversity.\n\nCompanies that put out statements in support of diversity initiatives or changed their racist logos , educators who wanted to teach accurate U.S. history , and celebrities who spoke out against discrimination were swiftly deemed \"woke\" ― and something conservatives everywhere should fear.\n\nIn contrast, in Florida and across the country, being anti-woke meant introducing bills that target LGBTQ+ students, diversity initiatives in the workplace, and what books children had access to at school. Any candidate promising to bring those ideas to the national stage, the thinking went, would be a strong Republican contender for the White House.\n\nAnd perhaps no public figure has invested as much in the concept, or hitched their wagon to it as publicly as DeSantis.\n\n\"The woke mind virus is basically a form of cultural Marxism. At the end of the day, it's an attack on the truth,\" DeSantis said during a Fox News interview shortly after announcing he was running for president. \"And because it's a war on truth, I think we have no choice but to wage a war on woke.\"\n\nThe following week he went to Iowa and promised to take on wokeness as president. \"We will fight the woke in education, we will fight the woke in corporations, we will fight the woke in the halls of Congress,\" he said .\n\nBut complaining about wokeness and stoking the culture wars has turned out to be a losing bet in elections across the country.\n\nIn the November 2022 election, candidates that focused on culture wars failed to win key races across the country, with losses in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Georgia . Then last month, school board candidates who ran on combating wokeness in schools were unsuccessful .\n\nIt's looking increasingly clear that Republicans overestimated how much GOP voters were invested in fighting wokeness. With just weeks to go before the first ballots are cast, a November poll out of Iowa shows that DeSantis is tied for second place with former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, at just 16%.\n\nTrump seemed to pick up on the weakness of anti-wokeness branding before DeSantis. \"I don't like the term 'woke' because I hear, 'Woke, woke, woke.' It's just a term they use, half the people can't even define it, they don't know what it is,\" he said at an Iowa event in June.\n\nConant says Trump is correct. \"A lot of voters don't know what woke is,\" he said. \"Republicans struggle to define it.\"\n\n\"Fundamentally, a lot of Republicans are troubled by activist politicians on the right and the left, and they don't want to see the government penalizing companies,\" Conant said.\n\nAs part of showing how strong he was on fighting wokeness, DeSantis famously went after Disney after the company criticized Florida's \"Don't Say Gay\" law, which restricts what educators can say about sexual orientation and gender identity in the classroom. In turn, DeSantis revoked the Disney district's special tax status and appointed a new board to oversee the district. The megacorporation sued the state , alleging the government was infringing on its First Amendment right.\n\n\"I think they crossed the line,\" DeSantis said about Disney's criticism of the law in March . \"We're going to make sure we're fighting back when people are threatening our parents and threatening our kids.\"\n\nBut by August, DeSantis appeared to be defeated. It turns out that even though DeSantis had filled the board with members who were loyal to him, the old board had passed a policy that made the new members effectively powerless .\n\n\"We've basically moved on,\" DeSantis said on CNBC . \"They're suing the state of Florida, they're going to lose that lawsuit. So what I would say is, drop the lawsuit.\"\n\nDespite railing against woke companies and politicians, according to Ron Bonjean, a former Republican spokesman and the co-founder of PR firm ROKK Solutions, traditional conservatives don't like when the government interferes with businesses.\n\n\"Seventy percent of polled Republicans are against elected officials going after companies and punishing them,\" Bonjean said about his polling. \"They want the government to stay out of the marketplace.\"\n\nAnd further polling shows that GOP voters are just not interested in the anti-woke culture wars - at least not enough to rally behind the most anti-woke candidate.\n\nA July 2023 New York Times/Siena College poll found that only 24% of respondents wanted a candidate that would focus on defeating woke ideology.\n\n\"It's immigration, national security, the economy, those are the issues that GOP voters care about the most,\" Conant said. \"But DeSantis spent most of the campaign talking about what he did in Tallahassee.\"\n\nAnd while campaigning against wokeness was a staple in DeSantis' stump speeches early in his campaign, he slowly began pivoting. In a televised town hall with CNN this month, he didn't utter the word once.\n\nNot every political campaign expert believes that it's simply a messaging problem.\n\n\"If you look at the kinds of things DeSantis is arguing against - progressive agendas pushed by school administration, the politics of corporations, DEI ― it's something that he has articulated well and has a wide audience,\" Daron Shaw, a political science professor and public opinion researcher at the University of Texas at Austin, told HuffPost.\n\nBut Shaw said DeSantis is just not an effective messenger. \"Most conservatives would agree that woke politics have gone too far. But DeSantis isn't the right messenger. He's not a happy warrior.\"\n\nTrump's supporters, for better or for worse, find him relatable and believe the former president is standing beside them. Meanwhile, DeSantis comes off as out of touch, like when he was unable to connect with a teenager describing his mental health struggles.\n\nOthers believe the media has a role to play. Initially, DeSantis sought only friendly media outlets, eschewing traditional television or print outlets that he likely believed would paint him in a bad light.\n\n\"He made a strategic mistake by not engaging in mainstream media,\" Conant said. \"He allowed his opponents to define him aloof, out of touch, and weird.\"\n\nFor example, several clips of DeSantis struggling to smile have gone viral . He's been accused of wearing high-heeled shoes to appear taller and made fun of for eating pudding with his fingers , and his candidacy has been dogged by allegations that he doesn't know how to relate to voters .\n\n\"The Trump influencers and messengers behind the Make America Great Again movement post about DeSantis in high-heeled boots or getting his make-up done,\" said David Capen, a North Carolina-based strategist. \"They're using these memes and little clips to make him look weak and insecure.\"\n\nAnd when you're running against Trump, who is famous for delivering low-blow insults and is polling around 50 points ahead of DeSantis , the last thing you want is to look weak.\n\nEven if DeSantis were polling better or if his message was resonating with voters nationwide and not just in Florida, he'd still have to contend with Trump - who has been the party's standard bearer since his nomination in 2016.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "To Be Black And #Woke Is To Be In A Rage All The Time\n\nNew York Times bestselling author of Dear Martin and Odd One Out\n\nA few months ago, while sitting on the floor in some obscure section of a local chain bookstore I frequently patronize, a friend and I - both African-American women - were approached by a white woman I can only assume was the manager. My friend was leaning against the shelf, reading a book she pulled. I had spread out the seven books I intended to purchase so I could get an Instagram story video. Four of those books were written by friends of mine and it was their release day. I wanted to celebrate them while still inside the store.\n\nMy celebration was cut short.\n\n\"Hi,\" the woman said as she stood over us, literally looking down her nose. \"You can't sit back here. There are tables available on the other side of the store, and if those are full, there are benches.\"\n\nLooking back to that incident, I think about all the ways I could have responded. I could have flat out asked her what her problem was. I could have angrily asked her if she needed something. I could have traipsed on over to where my book (the book I'd written about this very type of microaggressive behavior) was prominently displayed on a table at the center of the store - a \"New York Times Bestseller\" sticker plastered across the top - grabbed the entire stack, smiled in her face and asked if I could sign them.\n\nBut no. It was fine, I guess. I smiled, apologized and told her we'd move.\n\nAnd that would have been that had she not hovered over us until we'd gotten up and then followed us around the store until we checked out.\n\n\"It's a short journey from being seen as an inconvenient presence in a public place to being gunned down in the street by a cop who sees you as a \"demon\" instead of as a human being.\"\n\nAs I write this, I know there will be people who immediately say, \"But that doesn't sound like it has anything to do with race.\" To them I say only this: Must be nice to stay asleep.\n\nThere's this James Baldwin quote that I love: \"To be a negro in this country and to be relatively conscious is to be in a rage almost all the time.\" And it's so true: To be \"woke,\" to be even slightly aware of the way systemic racism and marginalization function in 21st-century America, is to be angry. Rage is what I felt when my friend and I were profiled and followed around the store like we were just itching to steal something (an experience black women and girls know all too well ). Rage is what I felt at a different bookstore when I was asked to show ID to sign my own books, even though my picture was printed in the back. If I, a well-dressed and \" articulate \" New York Times best-selling author, am being treated like I'm not good enough to sit in a bookstore let alone to write a novel, the brown and black kids I write for are having these dehumanizing experiences too . In fact, for many of our young people of color, it's much worse.\n\nRage is what I felt almost six years ago when I first heard about the death of a kid listening to loud music in a convenience store parking lot, and then rage again when a mistrial was initially declared on the murder count in the case. I felt rage when I heard a guy allegedly selling loose cigarettes had been choked to death by police - despite informing them that he couldn't breathe. Rage when I heard a kid with a toy gun had been shot in a park. Rage when a woman wound up dead in a jail cell after a traffic stop. And of course there's rage over the lack of indictments - let alone convictions - in most of the cases where a black American has lost his or her life at the hands of person supposedly paid to keep everyone safe.\n\nBut those are the obvious things. As we approach the four-year anniversary of Mike Brown's murder in Ferguson, Missouri, a murder - and subsequent failure to indict the murderer - that brought national attention to the type of rage James Baldwin was talking about as black folks took to the streets in televised protest, I can't help but think about other moments that don't result in nationwide protest but still stir this same rage. Things that make me wish I maybe weren't so \"woke\"... that I could just go back to sleep.\n\nLike the fact that a kid who murdered nine black people in cold blood during a church Bible study - after they invited him in, no less - was taken to Burger King and deemed \"not problematic\" after his arrest (he'd been on the run for 16 hours and was hungry apparently). Or that a private school's first black valedictorian was mysteriously barred from giving a commencement speech. There's the fact that a black graduate student had the cops called on her for falling asleep in a Yale dorm common room. That white news anchors expressed outrage over a black boy who worked his tail off and got into 20 colleges.\n\nA white college student had the audacity to brag about criminally harassing her black roommate. A 10-year-old black boy wet his pants after being handcuffed for no reason in Chicago. A woman who was CEO of a cannabis company in the Bay Area called the cops on a little black girl selling bottles of water \"without a permit\".\n\nI could go on .\n\nAnd on .\n\nAnd on and on and on .\n\n\"Put that rage to good use. Stand up, speak out, take to the streets. Things can change when we get angry enough.\"\n\nTo be black and #woke is to be aware that it's a short journey from being seen as an inconvenient presence in a bookstore or a public park to being gunned down in the street by a cop who sees you as a \" demon \" instead of as a human being. It is to be constantly bombarded with evidence that you live in a country where, on sight alone, it's assumed that you're less civilized. Less capable. More dangerous. Less valuable.\n\nA country where your life doesn't matter .\n\nAnd it's infuriating.\n\nSo what do we do?\n\nWhat does anyone who is truly woke - because even if you're not \"a negro\" as Baldwin put it, if you're conscious of the myriad forms of injustice faced daily by marginalized people in this country, you should feel the rage too - do with the fury said wokeness engenders?\n\nFor me the answer is to love a little harder. Be a little kinder. Live a little more mindfully. Be a little more intentional. Think a little more critically. Work a little more passionately. Walk with a little more empathy.\n\nAnd stir up a little fuss. Put that rage to good use. Stand up, speak out, take to the streets. Things can change when we get angry enough. The prosecutor who failed to indict Mike Brown's killer has just been replaced by a black man who promises criminal justice reform, largely thanks to the emotional response from the people of Ferguson and the Black Lives Matter movement. P oint out the problems and keep them front and center where everyone can see them. Write books that address them.\n\nBecause while I don't have the power to instantly move centuries-old mountains of injustice, I can speak out about the trauma - and rage - of being profiled in hopes that drawing attention to it will make people uncomfortable enough to check themselves, so maybe by the time that little kid hits adolescence, there's less of a chance he'll have similar experiences.\n\nSometimes - most of the time really - that's enough to make being woke worthwhile.\n\nIt's also enough to make me a little less angry.\n\nNic Stone is the New York Times best-selling author of Dear Martin and Odd One Out (out Oct. 9, 2018).

      "text": "The GOP Is Over Its War On 'Woke'\n\nSenior Political Reporter, HuffPost\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa - Jill Connell is sick of hearing the word \"woke.\"\n\nThe 66-year-old from Kansas is an undecided Republican voter with a host of concerns about the country, and she knows for sure what doesn't top that list.\n\n\"To me, wokeness is, 'Hey, I woke up this morning,'\" Connell said, employing the most literal definition of a word the right uses to describe what it sees as left-wing ideas and political correctness. \"I call it goofy - it's ridiculous. I'm a person who believes you should love everybody. I'm a person of faith.\"\n\nConnell isn't alone. After almost two years as a conservative rallying cry, Republicans may finally be over the war on woke.\n\nLast week at the Iowa State Fair, the Republican presidential candidates who had relentlessly decried wokeness in the weeks and months prior barely mentioned it by name. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who has called wokeness a virus more dangerous than COVID, didn't talk about it at all. Vivek Ramaswamy, the tech entrepreneur who wrote a manifesto against wokeness in corporate America, used it only a few times in front of crowds.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, the emperor of the state where woke goes to die , downplayed his offensive against Disney , his woke foil, mentioning the company only once in a stump speech. As recently as June, he used \"woke\" seven times in a mere 26 seconds .\n\nAnd Donald Trump , who complained that no one could define \"woke,\" was more focused on bashing DeSantis with a snarky message in the sky than pointing out that woke doesn't sell, an idea that recent polling bears out: For all the attention heaped on bathrooms and hormone replacements, Republican voters consistently respond better to bread-and-butter issues - tax cuts and lowering crime - than calls to ban abortion, outlaw gender therapy for minors and restrict classroom discussion on race, gender and sexuality.\n\nDeSantis seemed to use the word in Iowa more than any other candidate competing for the Republican presidential nomination. But it didn't pack the same punch it did even just a few months ago, when DeSantis entered the race as a culture-war crusader who framed wokeness as a \"mind virus\" zombifying the country.\n\n\"So your governor [Kim Reynolds] likes to say that both Iowa and Florida are places where woke goes to die,\" DeSantis said at a pre-fair campaign stop in Panora, Iowa, on a man-made lake with fake palm trees that resembled a fake Florida shoreline.\n\n\"I'll tell you, as president, we're gonna leave the woke agenda in the dustbin of history where it belongs,\" DeSantis said in a robotic monotone, a line that he's used plenty of times previously, still generating some whoops and hollers from the crowd.\n\nGOP voters in the nation's first caucus state, who flocked there to hear from presidential candidates, were torn on woke. On the one hand, they expressed deep concerns about the infusion of ideology they disagree with into the fabric of public life. But they also acknowledged the word can seem pandering coming from a politician.\n\nTiffany Welch, a 43-year-old undecided voter from Clive, Iowa, who attended the DeSantis event, said talking about wokeness isn't what will win her vote in the 2024 election. \"It's one of those things that doesn't seem to go anywhere. It's a non-issue to rile up voters. Nobody can give me a definition of it.\"\n\nTherein lies a major problem: While the sentiment of woke is generally understood, what is woke to one may not be woke to another. Wokeness is generally in the eye of the beholder.\n\n\"Anger. Dishonesty. Making America not what it is, not what it's supposed to be,\" said Ashley Long, a 33-year-old electrical apprentice wearing a Trump hat at the fair, after pausing for a moment to consider a definition.\n\n\"I don't want her to grow up feeling like a victim.\"\n\nLong doesn't want wokeness (a term born of the Black social justice movement) to make her young half-Black daughter feel less than her peers in school.\n\n\"I don't want her to grow up feeling like a victim,\" Long said. \"We've had a half-Black president - we had Barack Obama . She can be president one day.\"\n\nCelia Criswell, a 70-year-old retiree from Des Moines, said a Republican candidate needs to be staunchly anti-woke to earn her vote.\n\nBut what does it mean to be anti-woke?\n\n\"People say, \"What's woke?\" I know what woke is, and I'm sure there are a lot of people out there who can tell you what woke is, but if you say it out loud, you might get in trouble,\" Criswell told me.\n\nI asked Criswell to hit me with her definition anyway.\n\n\"Well, I'm not gonna say,\" she said.\n\nCriswell eventually linked wokeness to late-term abortion and gender therapy for transgender minors, procedures she strongly opposes and considers to be a litmus test for candidates.\n\nRichard, an Iowan who didn't want to share his last name after asking a question during longer-than-longshot Perry Johnson's political soapbox appearance, described wokeness as \"trying to change the face of America ... they can't tell who a man or a woman is.\"\n\nAlthough when it comes to choosing a presidential nominee, wokeness, as an voting issue, \"it's not number one,\" he said.\n\nPolling backs up this idea. Faced with the choice of a Republican focused on \"defeating radical 'woke' ideology in our schools, media and culture\" or one focused on \"restoring law and order in our streets and at our border,\" only 24% of respondents went with the woke candidate as their top choice, versus 65% for law and order, according to a New York Times/Siena College survey.\n\nJust 26% of Republican primary voters thought it was \"very important\" that a president support limiting the rights of transgender people, compared with 78% who said it was important for the candidate to have a plan to cut taxes, according to a CBS/YouGov poll . And only 14% wanted the 2024 nominee to be someone who would punish businesses for supporting LGBTQ rights, compared to 81% who preferred a candidate who would stay away from the issue.\n\n\"It's not quite falling flat, but it's just not top of mind,\" said Don Levy, the director of the Siena College Research Institute, referring to likely GOP primary voters in Iowa and nationwide and their attitude toward so-called woke ideas.\n\n\"If you're going to associate the woke issue with Gov. DeSantis, to some extent that explains why, when he's pitted head-to-head against former President Trump, he does as poorly as he does,\" Levy said. \"It doesn't seem to be the issue that's going to be a wellspring of support to move people away from Trump toward DeSantis.\"\n\nJeff Kaufmann, the chair of the Iowa GOP, said woke is a multi-tentacled issue, with certain aspects that are more resonant for conservative voters.\n\n\"What I hear resonate in terms of the woke issue - anything that has the element of parents making decisions. It's the general idea that parents should be making decisions for kids that aren't of age at all, that almost transcends the specific issue,\" he said, which might explain why DeSantis has made an effort to include his wife and young children more on the campaign trail.\n\nKaufmann's remarks underscore the reality that candidates are still discussing anti-woke themes, just not using the buzzword.\n\nRamaswamy recently rebranded some merchandise to ditch the word completely, The New York Times reported - changing \"Stop Wokism\" to \"Truth,\" a word that greets you immediately upon loading the candidate's website.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "The Best Way To \"Stay Woke\"\n\nDigital Storyteller\n\nEverybody claims to be \"woke\" (aware of injustice) but most just complain about problems and never create solutions. Thankfully, I've connected with one of my relatives who has a plan to change America for the better. From his perspective, the best kind of change starts from within.\n\nGood Fruit In My Family Tree\n\nMy second cousin, John Currie, is truly someone you should know. By day, he's a healthcare professional; on the weekends, he puts together strategies for social progress. In 2003, John founded the International Reach & Teach Institute -a California-based nonprofit which promotes self-sufficiency through professional and cultural seminars. While Republicans propose massive budget cuts for social programs, John is using his own resources to counteract those measures.\n\nJohn's first project of 2017: coordinating free test prep courses to help nursing students pass their board exams. As a veteran nursing instructor, he knows that students need good test scores to gain certification. Without board certification, students miss out on jobs; additionally, there will be a nursing shortage.\n\nJohn's proactive, self-sufficient approach should be emulated by other nonprofit managers. He doesn't wait until tragedy strikes to \"get woke\"; he keeps his ear to the ground to spot trouble before it occurs.\n\nIn a recent phone call, John shared his frustrations about people who complain and never work to change anything. \"[People need to] get up and do something!\" John exclaimed. \"That's what we do with the International Reach & Teach Institute: we allow each person to reach another person and teach what they know.\"\n\nDo For Self or Do Without\n\nJahmal Cole is getting things done in Chicago-without help from Trump's administration. The 33-year-old founder of My Block, My Hood, My City , works with underprivileged teens to expose them to cultural and economic resources in their own town. Cole started the program after realizing that young people were not aware of all the benefits that Chicago has to offer.\n\nIn addition to mentoring youth, Cole also provides free services for senior citizens-such as free snow removal. His efforts are proof that it doesn't take a lot of money to make a lot of change.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with being \"woke\"-but knowing is only half the battle. Knowledge must stimulate the imagination. We all have the power to save ourselves. Unfortunately, many of us are waiting to be saved because of low self-esteem, poor leadership, and a lack of political efficacy.\n\nAwaken The Sleeping Giants\n\nJohn Currie and Jahmal Cole are not the only ones making a difference. There are thousands of community leaders who work to make our country safer, smarter, and unified. But there is always room for one more leader. What's the purpose of reading editorials, debating/arguing online, and attending panel discussions if you aren't ready to \"be the change\"? You can't consider yourself \"woke\" if you are all talk and no action.\n\nProve your \"wokeness\" by doing the following things:\n\n1) Using Social Media Wisely\n\nCelebrity gossip is not good brain food. You should be connecting with people who want to create change. You should be sharing positive ideas instead of complaining about other people's status messages. There's no point in judging others for negative statuses if you are focused on positive things.\n\nSocial media friends should be assets-not liabilities towards your personal growth. Don't stop at hashtags; keep discussions going in real life.\n\n2) Less Talking, More Working\n\nThe best way to be productive is to be productive ! Your work should speak for you! Great leaders know how to bring good ideas into fruition. In order to create social change, you have to be an active participant in the process.\n\n3) Serving With Sacrifice\n\nThe most humble people are those who give, expecting nothing in return. It is disheartening to see stories in the news about fake charities which take advantage of those who want to help. Yet, there are people who have ulterior motives which can't be seen by the naked eye. This is why public servants must pursue their passions without expectations of monetary gain. Instead, we need leaders who prefer to \"shake up\" systems of inequality instead of \"shaking down\" corporations for hush money.\n\nThe question remains: How can we tell who is really \"woke\"?\n\nWe must look and see if their eyes are open to what really matters.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Ron DeSantis Wants To Take His 'War On Woke' National. There's One Big Problem: The Constitution.\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis launched his bid for the Republican presidential nomination Wednesday by promising to bring the suite of culture war policies he's signed into law in Florida to the whole nation if he's elected in 2024.\n\n\"The woke mind virus is basically a form of cultural Marxism,\" DeSantis said in an appearance on Fox News the same day he announced his campaign. \"At the end of the day, it's an attack on the truth. And because it's a war on truth, I think we have no choice but to wage a war on woke.\"\n\nThis \"war on woke\" serves as the central justification and argument for DeSantis' bid for the GOP nomination. By challenging the supposed liberal tilt in American culture as expressed in schools, the media and the corporate workplace culture, this \"war,\" and the legislation behind it, shows DeSantis as a culture fighter who gets things done.\n\nBut there's one big problem for DeSantis' war: the U.S. Constitution.\n\nBroad swathes of DeSantis' anti-woke agenda - from restrictions on the teaching of social science about race in colleges and universities, to bans on corporate diversity training to limits on public protests - have been temporarily suspended by judges who found them very likely to be in violation of the first and 14th amendments.\n\nIn suspending these laws, federal judges called them \" positively dystopian \" and the defenses presented in court \" wholly at odds with accepted constitutional principles .\" The suspended provisions of the laws may yet be upheld as they move through appeals courts and, possibly, U.S. Supreme Court review, but, at the moment, DeSantis' offensive against the \"woke mind virus\" has been partially reversed.\n\nThese multiple losses in court put a constitutional blemish on DeSantis' claims of success as a culture warrior who can deftly enact the social conservative agenda.\n\nOne of the laws partially suspended is the pillar of DeSantis' war: The Individual Freedom Act, popularly known as the Stop WOKE Act , prohibits the promotion or advancement of eight concepts related to race in public schools, colleges and universities and in private-sector corporate trainings. The definitions of the prohibited concepts are based on a Trump administration executive order banning government contractors from engaging employees in certain diversity training programs.\n\nIn response, a group of university professors, students and corporations filed three lawsuits challenging the law's prohibitions on teaching race-based concepts or using them in diversity trainings for private-sector employees. The two lawsuits challenging the law's application to colleges and universities were heard as a single case. In each case, U.S. District Judge Mark Walker in northern Florida, who was nominated by President Barack Obama , suspended the law's application with strong language.\n\n\"The State of Florida lays the cornerstone of its own Ministry of Truth under the guise of the Individual Freedom Act, declaring which viewpoints shall be orthodox and which shall be verboten in its university classrooms,\" Walker wrote in his November 2022 decision on the law's provisions governing colleges and universities.\n\n\"Recently, Florida has seemed like a First Amendment upside down,\" Walker wrote in suspending the provisions governing private corporations . \"Normally, the First Amendment bars the state from burdening speech, while private actors may burden speech freely. But in Florida, the First Amendment apparently bars private actors from burdening speech, while the state may burden speech freely.\"\n\nIn both cases, Walker determined that the law improperly allowed the state to discriminate against speech based on viewpoint: Professors or corporate trainers were banned from discussing the race-based concepts if they could be seen to be advancing or promoting them but not if they were criticizing or disparaging them.\n\n\"It's pretty black-letter law that if the government is saying you may not offer a training that espouses one viewpoint but you can offer a training that espouses the opposite viewpoint, that that is pretty blatant viewpoint discrimination,\" said Shalini Agarwal, a lawyer at the nonprofit Protect Democracy who serves as counsel for the private-sector plaintiffs.\n\nFurther, the law's language in describing the eight banned concepts is incredibly vague, which Walker ruled likely violates the 14th Amendment's Due Process Clause.\n\n\"A law cannot pass constitutional muster if the people that are supposed to be following them do not understand what's prohibited conduct and what's permitted conduct,\" said Greg Greubel, a lawyer at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression representing some of the university professors and students.\n\nWalker notes this in his decision by pointing to the fact that one banned concept contains a confusing triple negative.\n\nThe law bans instruction that states \"Members of one race, color, national origin, or sex cannot and should not attempt to treat others without respect to race, color, national origin, or sex.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\nSuch vague and contradictory language results in a \"cacophony of confusion\" that is \"bordering on unintelligible,\" Walker writes.\n\nThe law's provisions were also deemed unconstitutionally vague because they allow discussion of the prohibited concepts if they are \"given in an objective manner without endorsement.\" Since no definition of \"objective\" is provided, the professors and corporate trainers would be, according to Walker, \"at a loss on how to discuss concepts like white privilege, systemic racism, and white supremacy without simultaneously endorsing the notion that such prejudice should be overcome.\"\n\n\"When teaching history it is very difficult to teach in an objective manner if the state says you cannot promote these things but you can denigrate them,\" Greubel said.\n\nDue to Walker's decisions, the Stop WOKE Act's provisions limiting college and university classroom discussions and corporate trainings are on hold. As of March 16, an appeals court panel upheld Walker's injunction on the college and university prohibitions. However, the Stop WOKE Act's prohibitions on teaching the eight race-based concepts in primary and secondary education remain in effect.\n\nThese are not the only pieces of DeSantis' anti-woke war that have been blocked.\n\nWalker also blocked an anti-protest law, enacted in response to Black Lives Matter protests, from going into effect, ruling that a provision allowing prosecutors to charge anyone present at a protest where a handful of people commit acts of violence against people or property created a chilling effect on protected First Amendment activity. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit upheld the injunction on the law until the Florida Supreme Court rules on the definition of the law's vague terminology.\n\nBoth a U.S. district judge and the 11th Circuit ruled that a law banning large digital media platforms from taking down accounts, removing or appending notes to posts and \"shadow-banning\" users is unconstitutional. DeSantis had described the law as necessary to prevent digital corporations from discriminating \"in favor of the dominant Silicon Valley ideology.\" The challenge is now before the U.S. Supreme Court after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld a similar law in Texas.\n\nDeSantis' dismissal of former Hillsborough County prosecutor Andrew Warren was deemed a violation of Warren's First Amendment rights by the courts. DeSantis claimed that Warren, a reform-minded prosecutor, was improperly refusing to prosecute certain crimes when he removed him from office. A U.S. district judge ruled that DeSantis' allegations were \"false\" and there was \"not a hint of misconduct\" in Warren's actions. Warren is now petitioning in federal court to be reinstated.\n\nThe only major lawsuit that has gone DeSantis' way has been a challenge to the Parental Rights in Education law, also known as the \"Don't Say Gay\" law, that bans certain discussions of gender and sexuality in primary and secondary schools. That lawsuit failed after the parents and students who sued were denied standing by U.S. District Judge Allen Winsor, a Donald Trump nominee. The plaintiffs have since filed an appeal .\n\nAnd, of course, there's Disney's recent lawsuit alleging that DeSantis' efforts to strip the company of governance of the Florida special district where Disney World resides amounted to illegal retaliation violating the company's First Amendment rights. While such retaliation cases are often hard to prove, Disney's lawsuit contains copious evidence from public statements and DeSantis' own book highlighting how his actions were driven by a desire to punish the company for speaking out against the \"Don't Say Gay\" law. DeSantis responded to Disney's lawsuit by calling it \"political\" and without \"merit,\" and he asked the court to disqualify the judge assigned to the case, Mark Walker, due to his previous decisions that went against the governor. That lawsuit is pending.\n\nMore lawsuits are expected to come after the latest legislative session expanded the Stop WOKE Act and the \"Don't Say Gay\" law and banned gender transition health care for minors.\n\nThough the federal courts have increasingly tilted toward conservatives since the Trump administration, protecting the First Amendment's free speech rights remains an area where the judicial wings of both parties can find agreement. The conservatives on the Supreme Court have been especially protective of the free speech rights of corporations , a key target of DeSantis' war.\n\n\"I am very very confident in our position,\" Greubel said.\n\nStill, this broad effort to limit First Amendment rights by imposing restrictions on what may be discussed in colleges, universities and the private sector raises concerns among those who work to protect those rights, especially as DeSantis looks to take this war national in his presidential campaign.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Oxford Dictionary Officially Extends Its Definition Of 'Woke'\n\n.\n\nThe dictionary just got a little more \"woke.\"\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary, which is updated four times per year, has expanded the definition of \"woke\" online and in its forthcoming print update. Though the word is also a past participle of the verb \"wake,\" for years, black people have been using the term to describe social and political awareness.\n\nOn their website, the dictionary defines it as \" alert to injustice in society, especially racism .\" Oxford notes that the word has more recently become \"prominent in general American use,\" which prompted them to extend the word as an adjective.\n\n\"The original meaning of adjectival woke (and earlier woke up) was simply 'awake', but by the mid-20th century, woke had been extended figuratively to refer to being 'aware' or 'well informed' in a political or cultural sense,\" Oxford explains. \"In the past decade, that meaning has been catapulted into mainstream use with a particular nuance of 'alert to racial or social discrimination and injustice', popularized through the lyrics of the 2008 song 'Master Teacher' by Erykah Badu, in which the words 'I stay woke' serve as a refrain, and more recently through its association with the Black Lives Matter movement, especially on social media.\"\n\nThe dictionary notes that it isn't new for black culture and language to be adopted by non-black people who don't fully understand or appreciate the context behind them. Because of this, the OED Appeals Program is seeking contextual evidence of \"woke\" in the sense of being socially aware that dates earlier than Badu's 2008 reference. (Black author William Melvin Kelly used \"woke\" to mean \"well-informed, up-to-date\" in a glossary about black slang in a 1962 New York Times article.)\n\n\"Woke\" is only the latest word derived from African American slang to make it to the dictionary. In February, Merriam-Webster added \" shade \" to its pages."

Yet the book exaggerates their agency, casting \"wokeness\" as a core driver of economic inequality.\n\nA Google sign decorated for Pride Month on June 30, 2024, in New York City.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nReview of We Have Never Been Woke: The Cultural Contradictions of a New Elite by Musa al-Gharbi (Princeton University Press, 2024)\n\nMusa al-Gharbi's We Have Never Been Woke is an ambitious and insightful book that helps shed considerable light on the strange moral and cultural whirlwind of the late 2010s that we now call the \"Great Awokening.\" Al-Gharbi is to be commended for producing the kind of text that few academics bother to write anymore: a readable book with a sweeping argument. It's a book chiefly about the role of class, class interests, and class politics in American society. It doesn't hurt that it is exhaustively well-researched.\n\nFurther, it is refreshingly honest. Al-Gharbi's main subjects, the so-called woke elites in media, the academy, and the NGO world, are his colleagues and class peers. As such, he employs the not-so-royal \"we\" throughout the text, implicating himself in the politics of the elite. It's a small gesture, but one that forces the reader (who is probably also part of the said elite) to contend with actual social relations in a way that more abstract language would not.\n\nFinally, it's entertaining. At one point, the author recounts several high-profile examples - and there are many - of elites who falsely claim to be black, or disabled, or indigenous in order to leverage whatever authority said identity is meant to confer. The effect of all these stories collected together in one place is hilarious.\n\nStill, as with most books of such scope, it has some critical, though not fatal, weaknesses. Despite its vast range, al-Gharbi's narrative suffers from a certain kind of narrowness in its exclusive focus on the professional class. His theory is at times overly grand. And his reluctance to criticize woke ideas on their own merits leaves the reader underwhelmed. These criticisms aside, We Have Never Been Woke is a necessary intervention from a young and talented scholar. Hopefully, it will kick off a needed debate about the role and function of elite ideology in American politics.\n\nWhat actually is \"wokeness\"? In al-Gharbi's telling, it's the ideology of a particular group: \"symbolic capitalists.\" \"Capital\" here does not refer to money used to invest in profit-making firms but instead, following the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, the set of skills, dispositions, and soft assets that one can use to leverage greater status, income, and influence. Symbolic capitalists, then, are that group of \"professionals who traffic in symbols and rhetoric, images and narratives, data and analysis, ideas and abstraction (as opposed to workers engaged in manual forms of labor tied to physical goods and services).\" As the book's title suggests, these elites certainly aren't willing to sacrifice their comfortable lives or their high status to achieve what it might take to win something like a good society. Instead, woke ideas and behaviors serve mainly as status markers and as means to advance their particular class interests. For al-Gharbi, if the term \"woke\" is taken to mean \"aware of social injustice and committed to doing something about it,\" then they have never been woke.\n\nAll of this seems reasonable, but at times al-Gharbi can ascribe too much agency to \"symbolic capitalists,\" to the neglect of other social forces. Not only are symbolic capitalists blamed for their hypocritical posture and outsized influence. Not only are they, rightly, dinged for their unctuous champagne socialism. Al-Gharbi goes much further. These elites, he argues, are actually responsible for the exploitation and immiseration of the poor whom they claim to hold in such high esteem.\n\nAgain and again, al-Gharbi implies that economic exploitation and inequality results primarily from the behaviors of the professional class in their role as consumers. So he lays the blame for Amazon's awful labor practices at these professionals' feet, as he perceives them to be driving the demand for cheaper and faster goods and services - as if Walmart hadn't paved the way for hyper-convenience and \"rollback\" pricing decades before, with a much less fashionable customer base. He further argues that the rise of the new food-delivery app economy is the fault of symbolic capitalists who \"insist that meals are rapidly delivered to our home as well (as it is apparently too much for us to pick up the food ourselves, let alone actually dining at the restaurants we order from).\" The dig is a good one, because the laziness of Grubhubbing every meal deserves ridicule. But are the Grubhubbbers really driving these larger social processes? Are they the main profiteers?\n\nLikewise, he claims that high-end restaurants \"try to keep their prices relatively affordable (for professionals, at least) by paying subpar wages to 'back of house' workers.\" Yet McDonald's, along with every other fast-food outlet, also exploits its cooks, even though its clientele is euphemistically referred to as \"downscale.\" In fact, hyper-exploitative lower-end restaurants maintain supply chains that are even more brutal than those of restaurants that pedal in \"organic\" and \"fair-trade\" gimmicks. A McDonald's franchise owned by a decidedly nonsymbolic capitalist with definitely non-professional-class clientele still relies on grotesque levels of exploitation (which last year included seemingly credible allegations of literal slavery ). All of this without the meddling of any so-called symbolic capitalists and their taste for free-range chicken.\n\nThe fact is, symbolic professionals are not chiefly to blame for megacorporations' exploitative labor practices, the gigification of delivery work, or the low wages in commercial kitchens. Actual old-fashioned, Monopoly-man capitalists, and the anonymous forces of market competition, are to blame. Unfortunately, al-Gharbi's reliance on the term \"symbolic capitalists\" serves not only to inflate the power of the professional class. It also helps to mystify the workings of the capitalist market economy. Worse, a totalizing class theory, in which the behaviors, desires, and tastes of symbolic capitalists become the driving force of history, leaves little room for the agency and interests of other classes. And al-Gharbi's neglect of other class forces - both above and below the professional elite - weakens his larger historical argument.\n\nOne of al-Gharbi's major innovations is to argue that the \"Great Awokening\" was not a new or singular moment but instead one expression of a recurrent, even cyclical, phenomenon. Following Peter Turchin's theory of \"elite overproduction,\" al-Gharbi argues that \"awokenings\" are provoked by the frustrations of \"elite aspirants.\" Basically, when there are too many highly skilled professionals chasing too few salaried positions, they advocate for sweeping social reforms and rhetorically ally themselves with the oppressed and downtrodden. Awokenings, then, \"tend to collapse when a sufficient number of frustrated aspirants are integrated into the power structure or come to believe their prospects are improving.\" In other words, woke moments are the temper tantrums of a professional elite, who quickly put down their picket signs the moment they get the cushy gigs they think they deserve. \"All said,\" he concludes, \"awokenings seem unrelated to significant changes in law or allocation of resources.\" This is a compelling class-informed theory. The Progressive Era reformism of the 1910s and 1920s broadly conforms to this theory, as do virtually all liberal crusades since the late 1960s. Yet al-Gharbi stretches his theory too thin. Bafflingly, he claims the \"First Great Awokening\" was Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal.\n\nIn his telling, the New Deal was primarily about \"expansions of the government bureaucracy\" that \"provided elite workers with stable, respected, and well-paying positions.\" This hardly captures the nature and scope of the New Deal. Yes, the social security offices needed to be staffed with clerks and professionals, the National Labor Relations Board with lawyers and white-collar bureaucrats, but the actual beneficiaries of these new departments were not these employees but the millions of workers who now had the chance at a decent retirement and the assurance that they couldn't be fired at will. The government's new programs were not merely sinecures for elites but genuine solutions to poverty and joblessness. Moreover, the demands for such programs were not made by NGO staffers but by a very real working-class movement - a fact that is totally invisible in al-Gharbi's story.\n\nUnfortunately, al-Gharbi's narrow focus on the elite alone precludes him from seeing the broad impact of the New Deal clearly. \"After the war,\" he writes, \"Black gains proceeded apace through the 1960s.\" \"Gaps between Blacks and whites continued to close,\" but \"there was no apparent impact from the [New Deal] on any of these trends.\" Here he seems to echo the broadly swallowed idea that the New Deal did nothing for black people. This ironically regurgitates a major argument of woke liberals. What's more, it's not true . Even the evidence al-Gharbi cites for this remarkable claim, drawn from Robert Putnam's latest book The Upswing , shows almost the opposite of what he argues. According to Putnam, black gains in income and education were the greatest during the period between 1940 and 1970, largely thanks to redoubled government efforts toward these ends. Go figure.\n\nNot only does al-Gharbi suggest that the New Deal was little more than the venal expression of elite class interests, but myriad forms of socialism are similarly characterized. He insists that populist and socialist appeals are no less a mask for professional-class resentment than the race- or gender-based politics of wokeness. He goes as far as to argue that nothing in Marxism is \"out of line with mainstream symbolic capitalist ideals.\" Thus, appeals to economic redress or redistribution on behalf of the vast majority of the population are just disguised attempts at satisfying the appetite of a spoiled elite. At times it appears that all wide-ranging social critiques are ultimately driven by aristocratic frustrations, that any popular movement for social reform is a veil for elite interests - a theory so grand it risks swallowing the very point of class analysis. If, as al-Gharbi argues, \"literally any ideology\" can be used to further elite interests, then all politics throughout history amounts to nothing more than an interelite competition, an inescapable ouroboros.\n\nInstead of suggesting that all moments of social unrest and reform are elite-driven awokenings comparable to the so-called uprising of 2020, al-Gharbi would do better to see the long stretch of social progress beginning in the 1930s and concluding in the 1960s as comprising a single, productive, progressive moment. A unique moment when the working class managed to impose its interests on the elite against their will. Since then, much of progressive politics has consisted of superficial attempts at rehashing the political fights of 1968. In fact, it feels like the entire period of the neoliberal \"Knowledge Economy\" era is nothing but a cycle of '68s - as tragedy, farce, tragedy and farce. The woke moment just feels particularly farcical.\n\nMuch of what al-Gharbi identifies as wokeness makes up a code of elite manners. Wokeness isn't so much about what ought to be done as it is about how one ought to behave. In the sixth chapter, the book's strongest, al-Gharbi dissects the fight over \"Critical Race Theory\" (CRT) in school curricula. He notes that despite the massive amount of media attention this debate has generated, it really only concerns elite schools. \"That is,\" he argues, \"schools for elites.\" Why are these schools so obsessed with \"pushing woke ideology\" onto their students? As a means of signaling elite status: indeed, \"the very purpose of these schools is to generate inequality - to give children of elites a leg up on everyone else.\" As al-Gharbi rightly observes, effective admissions essays to Harvard or Yale are peppered with social justice jargon. Elite parents, ever anxious about ensuring that their kids can reproduce their social status, are eager to teach it to them. For an older generation of blue bloods, knowing which utensil to use at a formal dinner party sent the signal that one was well-bred; today knowing to include your pronouns in your email signature says the same. As al-Gharbi concludes, elite schools are teaching CRT not out of some duty to the common good but rather because \"mastering these frameworks will enhance students' social status and professional flourishing.\"\n\nThis all seems right. Yet again the critique is incomplete. Yes, wokeness is clearly the chosen form and style of an educated elite. And yes, woke rhetoric and behavior make up the manners of that elite. But are those manners, whatever they might be, good? Are they worth anything as standalone practices? Surprisingly, al-Gharbi is reluctant to criticize woke ideas on their own merits. Repeatedly, he argues that his aim is not to determine whether these ideas are \"bad\" per se but instead to criticize them primarily for being socially dishonest or contradictory; he aims to demystify woke ideas to show their true function in society but not to determine whether the ideas, separated from that function, are worthy. \"Ideas associated with wokeness,\" he even says, \"provide us tools for challenging the order that has been established in its name.\"\n\nThis isn't convincing. If al-Gharbi believes that woke ideas themselves are not \"especially dangerous or powerful,\" why would they merit a book-length challenge at all? Or if, instead, he believes the ideas and practices associated with wokeness are actually good, and the problem is that the professional class are not sincere in their convictions - that real wokeness has never been tried - then still the ideas deserve to be defended on their own terms. The book offers neither a defense nor a standalone critique of these ideas.\n\nThe lack of a normative critique makes al-Gharbi's book feel a bit dated already. Wokeness is undoubtedly a means of social advancement for elites - a way to shore up jobs and create new markets for professionals in the media, tech, financial, nonprofit and academic worlds. But as we enter the second Donald Trump term, is it the only means of doing so? Tech giants like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have lately embraced a full-scale anti-woke backlash. Scores of young professionals are now schooled in the \"based\" language of anti-wokeness. New York Magazine recently profiled the rich, educated, urban \"new young Right\" who feel \"liberated\" by Trump's election. They're excited to be able to say \"faggot\" again. And the Financial Times wonders if \"corporate America is going MAGA,\" quoting a \"top banker\" who relishes his newfound freedom to say \"pussy\" and \"retard.\"\n\nAre these the new manners of the elite? Is this a virtuous correction to woke excess? Whatever the case, we can be sure that both wokeness and anti-wokeness are perfectly unthreatening to America's alpha elite. Which raises the question: What kind of moral, political, and social ideals should one advance in the name of a genuinely democratic challenge to elite rule? Without a discussion of what is good and bad, right and wrong, in the war of ideas, we're left without an answer.\n\nStill, even these criticisms don't nullify al-Gharbi's achievement nor his many valuable observations. We Have Never Been Woke does help us explain why this particular expression of professional-class values triumphed and how woke ideas help advance the interests of this group. And even as elite \"anti-wokeness\" rises, al-Gharbi's analysis suggests that after Trumpism, whenever that may be, we might just experience another \"awokening.\" Buckle up. It's the elite's world; we're just living in it.\n\nDustin Guastella is director of operations for Teamsters Local 623 in Philadelphia and a research associate at the Center for Working-Class Politics.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

The kind more intellectuals need to write. Neiman's prose is lively and refreshingly fearless. She does not rely on complicated sentences or passive voice to gloss controversy. She takes a stand and sticks to it. Nor does she suffer from the reverse-victimhood complex common to so many \"anti-woke\" writers. This is a book you can recommend to friends and family members, even those who disagree with her starting premise.\n\nFor Neiman, \"wokeness\" is not a project that can rightly trace its inspiration from the progressive political tradition. And while much has been made about the political liabilities of woke rhetoric, few critics of wokeness from the Left have offered a sustained argument for what defines the Left and why \"staying woke\" might be at odds with it.\n\nNeiman's argument, sustained over four big chapters, is that wokeness is not only alien to the principles of the Left, but antithetical to them. It's an argument that has, expectedly, garnered her enemies - one reviewer called her book \"a cringe-inducing screed.\"\n\nBut far from a screed, Neiman's writing is compelling and sensitive. Wokeness, as defined by her, is an ideology that reduces all groups down to the \"prism of their marginalization.\" By doing so, it makes an implicit claim about society as a set of conflicts rooted in power dynamics between rival groups (black versus white; cis versus trans; straight versus gay; and on and on). Neiman offers a provocative question at the start: \"Which do you find more essential: the accidents we are born with, or the principles we consider and uphold? Traditionally, it was the right that focused on the first, the left that emphasized the second.\"\n\nThe book is broken into chapters such as \"Universalism Versus Tribalism,\" \"Justice Versus Power,\" and \"Progress Versus Doom.\" In each case, she demonstrates how the logic of wokeness falls on the right side of the dyad.\n\nFor Neiman, to be woke is to hold a tribal worldview, one that says that the in-group (defined by skin color, or gender, or nationality, or indeed even those who identify as \"progressive\") is \"good\" and the out-group is \"bad.\" This, she argues, is close to the worldview of German jurist Carl Schmitt, who views \"the essence of politics as a permanent struggle between friend and enemy.\" That kind of polarity may seem natural in all forms of democratic politics - after all, populist and socialist appeals rely on a narrative that splits the world between the people or the workers and the elite or the rich - but there is something very different about Schmittian \"political theology.\"\n\nFor one thing, it so happens that Schmitt's ideas were an inspiration for Nazism, and Schmitt himself never renounced his support for the Third Reich. His \"friend-enemy\" worldview is built around the notion of horizontal, irresolvable , conflicts between irreconcilable groups (as opposed to a labor-capital dialectic that could be overcome through the abolition of wage labor). For him, all concepts in politics are reducible to the friend-enemy groupings. In this light, it is impossible to appeal to some higher objective or moral judgment outside of the dynamics of these groups. Schmitt \"rejected universalism, any conception of justice that transcends a notion of power\" and the very notion of progress. He embraced a vision of politics where the collectivization of enmity is the goal. It's no wonder he considered democratic deliberation superfluous.\n\nTo be woke is to be similarly allergic to claims of universalism and appeals to objective standards of goodness. Indeed, the falseness of universalism is revealed as the narrow perspective of \"dead white guys.\" Neiman shows how flimsy this logic is. She rescues Enlightenment thinkers, especially Immanuel Kant, from their would-be assailants by demonstrating that it was the pursuit of a systematic theory of justice - predicated on the belief in the universal human capacity for reason - that allowed these dead white guys to envision a society beyond the dark and archaic tribalism of Medieval Europe. It was from these very appeals that movements against slavery and for democracy sprang. The woke rejection of the Enlightenment, therefore, represents an unconscious embrace of a kind of Nietzschean power struggle. A reassertion of \"my tribe versus yours.\"\n\nRelatedly, to be woke is to hold a nihilistic view of history. Perhaps Neiman's strongest chapter, and most acerbic, is that in which she defends the very notion of human progress. \" Progressive \" she writes \"would be the right name for those who lean left today, if they didn't embrace philosophies that undermine hope for progress.\" Instead, today's woke crusaders present history as nothing but a parade of horrors. A nonstop slouch toward Gomorrah. Everything you think is good? The idea of human progress , reason , scientific advancement - even math - are all actually racist. It's a paranoid worldview that makes people see even the most innocuous things as demonstrations of evil. A white male country music star covers a 1990s pop ballad written by a black lesbian? Here's why you should feel badly about that.\n\nSome of this nihilism, according to Neiman, was smuggled into the Left by Michel Foucault. Foucault's theoretical works were widely embraced by those who confused his subversive style for radical substance. As Neiman notes: \"Everything in his performance screamed rebel. He wrote books that glorified those on society's margins: the outlaw, the madman.\"\n\nStill, what Foucault lacked was a clear moral foundation. He was totally opposed to normative judgements, and therefore eschewed a belief that society ought to be better . Noam Chomsky famously claimed that Foucault was the most amoral person he'd ever met. There is a lesson here about the performance of transgression substituting for political commitment. For Neiman, Foucault's genius was to marry a radical style with a message that \"was as reactionary as anything Edmund Burke or Joseph de Maistre ever wrote.\"\n\nWhile Neiman offers a great argument for rescuing the progressive tradition from the clutches of woke stagnation, she doesn't explain how so many people on the Left came to fall for the ideology. Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's metaphor about the Owl of Minerva flying at dusk suggests that understanding and wisdom arrive only after events have unfolded. Given the truckload of books published in the last two years that try to make sense of wokeness, we might be tempted to think that the twilight of woke is at hand. And yet the lack of an explanation for the roots of woke - where this ideology came from, why it caught fire, whom it serves, and where it might be going - suggests that maybe the thing it has not reached maturation.  Maybe we still haven't hit \"peak woke.\"\n\nIt seems obvious that, for at least a short period, wokeness had reigned supreme. It also seems as if that period has passed or is passing. The New York Times opinion section on May 17, 2024, declared: \"Wokeness Is Dying, We Might Miss It.\" Is it? Will we? If we understand wokeness to be a kind of public mania that gripped liberal democratic opinion for a period, it's easy to imagine that the grip is loosening. But this only pushes the question back one level of abstraction. Naturally, we should ask, why did such a hysteria take hold in the first place?\n\nOne reason it's so hard to make sense of the thing is that defenders of wokeness almost never substantially engage with critics like Neiman. Indeed, many of today's woke sympathizers deny that wokeness is, or ever was, an identifiable set of influential ideas. Wokeness takes its self-conception as natural. Its advocates do not argue for their position, they merely mock.\n\nConsider that, whenever a critic of some woke supposition lays out the case for, say, why defunding or even abolishing the police is a terrible idea (as Neiman ably does), former advocates of said idea will respond with a laugh that no one ever really cared about that, or that it was never really part of the woke agenda even if those same individuals were explicitly championing that cause as little as a few months prior. Bad faith or post-hysteria amnesia? It's increasingly impossible to tell.\n\nThis bolsters Neiman's point about the dangerous woke aversion to reason and argument, their knee-jerk reflex against persuasion. But, worryingly, it does make it hard to undermine these ideas. For, if they present themselves as natural, and if many people invoke \"woke\" arguments in a kind of organic, unthinking way, then we have left the realm of reason and entered - as Slavoj Žižek might say - the domain of pure ideology.\n\nHowever, if we view wokeness as an ideological project, instead of a passing bout of social psychosis, then Karl Marx might be of some help. His dictum that the \"ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas\" might go some way toward understanding what this phenomenon is really about. Dominant ideas, and their peddlers, in every age, present their notions as part of the natural order of things, when really those ideas serve the class interests of the peddlers themselves. In that regard, wokeness must serve a very useful function in contemporary capitalist society, which means it will be much harder to leave behind than it may seem.\n\nThe story of how exactly it serves that function has yet to be adequately written. It probably has something to do with the immense (and immensely wealthy) \"nonprofit\" sector and the revolving door between large influential corporate foundations, the Democratic Party, the media, and the government. A self-reenforcing circuit that surely operates in ways similar to the military-industrial complex. Or, as Tom Holland has argued , it may be a bizarre Christian mutation for an increasingly unbelieving elite in desperate need of a way to satiate a religious impulse, in its rhetorical commitments to empowering the powerless. Still, the fact that the affinity between wokeness and capitalism has been more often remarked upon by the political right, should be a source of shame for the Left.\n\nPerhaps the most powerful part of Neiman's book is also its most worrying. Neiman brilliantly demonstrates the affinity between wokeness and the thought of Schmitt, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Foucault. These are the thinkers that offer us a real glimpse into the profoundly cynical worldview of wokeness. And she shows how these theorists - conductors in the \"symphony of suspicion that forms the background music to contemporary Western culture\" - lack any coherent argument for how society ought to be organized. While they are gifted critics of liberal hypocrisy and modernity, their failure to offer a convincing alternative, or even orientation, marks them as contemptuous of any pursuit of the common good. If Foucault, Nietzsche, and Schmitt are indeed the not-so-secret inspiration for the opinion makers and ideologists of our age, we're in trouble.\n\nAs bad as wokeness is, what's next could always be worse. If Foucauldian-Schmittianism wrought havoc on the Left, this \"mind virus\" is likely to cause even more trouble if its tenets become widely adopted on the Right. Consider that the major impulse of wokeness was a kind of reflexive pity for victims. Often, this pity was misplaced, and real economic victims (like poor white men) were scapegoated as the holders of privilege by well-heeled activists.\n\nYet the \"victimology\" mindset can go both ways. If the woke have insisted that characteristics like a person's skin color, or their gender, or whatever else, marks them as fundamentally different in a grand metaphysical way and have made that point central to political appeals, then what happens if the Right takes up the charge by simply reversing the friend-enemy polarity? They will say to young men that their loneliness is not a function of \"toxic masculinity\" but instead the result of women's claims to equality. And they will say to poor whites, who are adrift and frustrated, that they don't need to \"abolish 'whiteness'\" - instead, they should embrace it. We already see this beginning to happen - a reversal of the Left's hard-fought victory in the civil rights era.\n\nWhat is common in these appeals is that neither the injunction to destroy one's whiteness or masculinity, nor the injunction to embrace those features, appeals to any higher order common good. The game is all horizontal. The woke shift has already established that democracy, equality, and progress are just concepts used to mask power. They have already dispensed with persuasion in favor of hyperbolic injunctions. The Right could very well do the same.\n\nWe should be worried about the fact that the woke paved the way for a hard right in more ways than one. Not only has particularly outlandish woke rhetoric offered right-wingers a set of increasingly easier political layups, their mocking rejection of patient democratic persuasion offers them a playbook for how to do political combat in an age of ideological nihilism.\n\nWe may yet see an even colder winter of tribalism to come.\n\nDustin Guastella is director of operations for Teamsters Local 623 in Philadelphia.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

But when it means suing a predatory firm that acts woke while ripping working-class Americans off, Trump suddenly loses interest.\n\nPresident Donald Trump delivers remarks during a reception honoring Black History Month at the White House on February 20, 2025, in Washington, DC.

One of those six times was on Sunday, when Vought celebrated that his dismantling of the Wall Street watchdog had rescued an obscure company from dire straits.\n\n\"Shockingly, the CFPB tried to destroy this company, SoLo, which incurred millions in legal fees and had to lay off 30 percent of its workforce,\" Vought tweeted . \"It was wrong and we dismissed the case.\"\n\nAs many Twitter/X users rushed to point out, the company Vought was lauding as an \"innovative solution\" for helping \"working-class Americans with limited means\" deal with large, unexpected costs was, in reality, little more than a scandal-plagued payday lender. At first glance, it seems like a vintage move from Vought's playbook : let corporate greed run riot, cynically tell people that the regulations holding predatory firms in check that you just eliminated were \"woke and weaponized,\" and assume Americans will be gullible enough to swallow this.\n\nBut it's actually worse than that, because SoLo is also alleged to be exactly the kind of \"woke\" entity \"weaponized\" against working Americans that Vought normally rails against when he needs an excuse to put Americans out of work or cut off their health care.\n\nSoLo is meant to be a techified cross between a payday and microlender, connecting people who have spare cash they can lend out with other people who need to borrow modest amounts at short notice. In practice, the firm is accused of being a predatory lender that has had legal action taken against it in at least five states, and was in the process of being sued by CFPB for allegedly ripping off American consumers when Vought came to its rescue.\n\nAs state regulators concluded in California , Pennsylvania , Massachusetts , Maryland , Connecticut , and the District of Columbia , it does this by recasting extortionate fees as mere \"tips\" and \"donations.\" This lets it claim that the loans it facilitates come with a 0 percent interest rate and APR (even as its founder boasts about its lenders averaging a 20 percent APR and making a better profit than they would on the stock market).\n\nIn reality, this figure allegedly comes out to much, much more. The complaint filed by CFPB charges that these \"tips\" end up producing APRs of more than 300 percent in many of SoLo's loans. They were anywhere between 43 percent and more than 4,280 percent for Connecticut borrowers who used the platform between 2018 and 2021, according to the 2022 cease-and-desist order lodged by the state's banking commissioner.\n\nEven though these \"tips\" and \"donations\" were technically optional, the company allegedly never made this clear to borrowers, and in fact deliberately designed its web interface to make it seemingly impossible to avoid paying them. If that didn't work, it incentivized users to pay them anyway by telling them it would raise the success rate of getting a loan, and hitting them with pop-ups pressuring them to tip the maximum amount to have the best chance.\n\nAs part of that process, SoLo also put together its own internal credit reports, called \"SoLo Scores,\" on its users drawn from their phones and a different firm that collects reams of data from the bank technology it provides to banks, and which was itself the subject of a class-action lawsuit. SoLo did all this without a license to be a lender or requiring any of its members to have one, but tried to illegally collect on loans anyway, usually by badgering and lying to borrowers - such as by threatening to report them to credit rating agencies, which it doesn't actually do. In Connecticut, SoLo contracted with a collection agency to chase up delinquent borrowers that wasn't actually ever licensed in the state.\n\nBut here is the real kicker: SoLo allegedly did all this while presenting itself outwardly as a \"woke\" company that users could trust because of its diversity and commitment to social justice-y sounding concepts.\n\nSoLo never tires of telling people that it is the \"largest Black-owned fintech\" firm and the \"only Black Owned B Corp Fintech in the US and Canada,\" or stressing the diversity of its members. Its top brass and company messaging constantly harp on about how their product is \"equitable,\" complaining that regulators who smacked SoLo down weren't driven by \"empowering equitable solutions.\" Its cofounder and president, Rodney Williams, has slammed tech startups that lean on \"performative rhetoric and put profits above purpose,\" and charged that SoLo is trying to \"right the wrongs and systems\" that have kept \"underserved communities at bay\" in a country that is \"at a crisis economically, racially, and environmentally.\"\n\n\"Big banks and traditional players prioritize making money off cash-strapped communities,\" he wrote. \"They don't put nearly as much value and resources toward empowering them and ensuring their products are inclusive, accessible, and affordable.\"\n\nAmusingly, even the right-wing media that is all in on Vought's supposed purge of \"wokeness\" and \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" (DEI) regurgitates some of this same rhetoric in presenting SoLo in a sympathetic light.\n\nAll of this makes Vought and Trumpworld's enthusiasm for SoLo puzzling. After all, Vought's influential think tank has made it its mission to \"identify, resist, and defeat CRT [Critical Race Theory] wherever it rears its head,\" a theory that we're told holds \"all of society is racialized\" and looks to \"revolutionize society by overthrowing the oppressor's institutions.\" So bent are Trump's people on this purge of wokeness,, that they've taken to targeting for elimination anything that so much as mentions words like \"diversity,\" \"equity,\" \"inclusion,\" or \"underserved.\"\n\nYet SoLo, which leans copiously on these terms as it rips off consumers, has somehow escaped this campaign.\n\nIt's hard not to suspect that the Trump administration, Vought, and their allies aren't genuinely motivated by a distaste for \"wokeness\"; that in fact, what they're really driven by is anger at government regulators stopping predatory firms from ripping Americans off; and that they're more than willing to stomach a little wokeness as long as those firms are allowed to keep pursuing that mission.\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nOne month in, the basic gambit of the second Trump administration seems to be that it thinks you're stupid.\n\nDonald Trump's team seems convinced it can ignore the long-standing problems that have made normal life insecure or impossible for average people in the United States - even that it can make those problem worse and create whole new ones - and that you won't notice it's doing so if it carries out the political equivalent of jangling keys in front of a baby.\n\nIt thinks it can cut regulations that stop corporations from preying on Americans or endangering them by cutting corners; as long as it says it was \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" (DEI) or \"critical race theory\" (CRT), you'll nod along gamely. It thinks that as long as it shouts \"wokeness,\" it can take your health care away, put you out of a job, and turn a blind eye to predatory firms price gouging you, and you won't realize you're being screwed over - that you'll be happy about it, in fact.\n\nLook at US air travel. Earlier this week, Trump - or, technically, DOGE, his \"Department of Governmental Efficiency\" - purged nearly three hundred personnel from the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA), which does the invisible but vital work that ensures you don't have to worry about dying when you fly somewhere.\n\nHe did this even though there have now been four US plane crashes in the month since he took office, including the deadliest aircraft crash in twenty years and one just this week, when a Delta plane that took off from Minneapolis flipped upside down upon landing in Toronto, mere hours after Trump's purge of FAA workers. We're still waiting to find out exactly what caused that incident, but it's inarguable that one of the underlying issues in the spate of major plane accidents we've seen the past few years is both regulatory capture by the airline industry and chronic understaffing in aviation, something Trump's reckless FAA purge is going to make worse.\n\nNot in Trumpworld, though. No sooner had the Delta plane flipped than pro-Trump influencers and press outlets were blaming , without bothering to present even a shadow of evidence for it, the company's commitment to DEI policies. This was the same move they pulled after the DC crash, when Trump himself baselessly blamed workers of poor \"psychological quality\" hired through DEI programs - and admitted , when asked for evidence, that he had none and was simply relying on his \"common sense.\" Breitbart editor in chief Alex Marlow asked , \"Did a diversity hire cause mass death?\"\n\nThe answer to that question was no - even as he asked it, Marlow admitted he had no idea whether the pilot was actually a \"diversity hire,\" even as he insisted that Trump definitely \"knew what was going on.\" (In the real world, DEI has not even come up in the subsequent investigation, which has instead revealed that the helicopter involved in the crash may have had faulty data and had its communication interrupted , potentially leading to the tragedy.)\n\nTo sum up: Trump and his movement distracted from the real, nuts-and-bolts issues at hand by squawking about DEI, provided no evidence to justify it, and moved on without correcting the record. Then, as crashes continue to pile up, they've continued pointing at this pet obsession anyway, while Trump quietly takes steps that will make it much more likely another crash happens in the future.\n\nWhen it does, guess what they'll decide is the culprit before the flames are even put out?\n\nThis is not an outlier. This playbook is central to how the Trump administration and the figures behind it are operating.\n\nTake Trump's demolition of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the consumer watchdog that over the past fourteen years has stopped predatory Wall Street firms from ripping Americans off and getting 200 million Americans more than $21 billion in restitution. That includes billions of dollars from Wells Fargo for wrongly foreclosing on people's homes, illegally repossessing their cars, and using a faulty automated system that froze one million out of their accounts, and millions of dollars from TD Bank for putting false information on people's credit reports.\n\nIn theory, eliminating an agency like this would be a tough sell, especially for an administration that claims to be fighting corruption and \"elites\" on behalf of working Americans. So to square this circle, the Trump White House and one of its media arms simply declared the CFPB \"woke,\" highlighted a handful of its minor actions fitting that description, then lazily attached a misleading accusation that the agency had engaged in \"overreach.\" Specifically, they meant when the agency barred medical debt from being included in credit reports and sharply limited bank overdraft fees - a textbook case of the \"woke, weaponized arm of the bureaucracy\" taking aim at \"industries and individuals disfavored by so-called 'elites,'\" according to the Trump administration.\n\nOne of the voices demanding the CFPB be \"shut down\" for being \"woke and weaponized\" was the Center for Renewing America, the think tank of Russell Vought , Trump's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) director and by all accounts the man behind both Trump's entire second term and Republicans' agenda in Congress. At the very top of the center's list of the CFPB's supposed \"woke\" sins are complaints by two billionaires, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, that the agency was punishing Meta for no reason and simply \"terrorizing anybody who tries to do anything new in financial services.\" In fact, the CFPB had sued Meta for improperly tracking its users' financial information to sell to advertisers, and the list of predatory behavior from financial firms it has punished is a long one .\n\n\"Wokeness\" is pulling double duty here: not only is it the shiny object used to distract you from the fact that the administration is doing the bidding of big banks that want to pick your pockets, but it's also a way to launder the complaints of powerful elites who want to act like they're powerless victims.\n\nSpeaking of Vought, look at what he does when he makes the case for cutting Medicaid, as House Republicans, in line with his own mock budget, are right now preparing to do . This is a move so unpopular, including with the many Trump voters who rely on the program, that Trump himself has had to repeatedly lie to the public that there's no plan to do so. So Vought simply labels it \"woke and weaponized Medicaid\" and talks about how it helps undocumented immigrants and funds gender reassignment - even though his plan is to cut the program for everyone who uses it, no matter what their medical needs.\n\nThis is Vought's standard playbook. Releasing the outline of his mock budget in 2023, his think tank framed it as a matter of \"removing the scourge of woke and weaponized government bureaucracy.\"\n\nBut the actual cuts were aimed at repealing the Affordable Care Act's expansion of Medicaid,  functionally ripping health care from nearly twenty million people and slashing the program more generally by one-third, as well as eliminating rent subsidies for low-income Americans and making it harder to qualify for Medicaid, food stamps, and disability insurance - all while cutting taxes for the rich. When Vought was asked under oath to explain how any of this was getting rid of \"wokeness,\" he refused to answer the question.\n\nThe cynicism involved here is matched only by its obvious disdain for people's intelligence.\n\nOr look at Sen. Ted Cruz's recently released database of thousands of \"woke DEI grants\" from the National Science Foundation, which he claims are pushing \"class warfare propaganda\" to the tune of $2 billion and should be on the chopping block. Actually read through the list, though, and you see Cruz waging class warfare under cover of battling wokeness.\n\nCruz's database has targeted a whole host of worthy research projects that stand to benefit the country, not least the working-class Americans his party now claims to represent. There are research projects, for instance, for better management of aging city infrastructure in Pittsburgh, improving recovery of basement flooding in east Detroit, and dealing with coastal flooding in low-income parts of Long Island.\n\nOther research projects are aimed toward making it easier to diagnose and treat brain aneurysms, to help develop a cheap autonomous wheelchair that can be used for longer time periods and distances, and to advance the care of neurological disorders that are becoming more and more common among the country's aging population.\n\nIt's doubtful many Trump voters, even those who have conservative social views, would agree these projects are a waste of money. But Cruz thinks that as long as he says \"DEI\" or whatever other buzzword has taken off in Trump's inner circle, it'll be enough to fool them that they are.\n\nMaybe the most cynical and dishonest example of this comes in a recent Breitbart hit piece on the Department of Justice's just-departed antitrust chief Doha Mekki, calling her a \"leftist activist\" who pursued a \"woke agenda\" and \"radical actions\" in her brief time in the post. As journalist Ryan Grim pointed out and detailed at length, Breitbart did this by flagrantly misleading its readers.\n\nIt did this first by pointing to a speech by Mekki that's supposed to show how she made civil and social rights, not anti-monopoly work, her top priority, claiming that she argued antitrust laws should be used against racism. In reality, the point of her speech is the exact opposite: that protecting economic rights is the most essential to freedom, because \"when we do not protect economic opportunity - when we allow monopolies to go unchecked - other rights suffer or disappear entirely.\"\n\nMeanwhile, what is the \"woke agenda\" Mekki pursued? Breitbart is infuriated that she sued six enormous corporate landlords over using an artificial intelligence algorithm to jack up their tenants' rents, and \"most significantly,\" that she stopped the largest travel management companies from acquiring their second-biggest rival, which would have undermined competition and led to higher prices.\n\nGot that? According to Breitbart , protecting Americans' economic rights, stopping corporate landlords from rent-gouging, and preventing corporate consolidation - that's \"woke.\"  Stick it to the latte-sipping elite by letting yourself get ripped off instead.\n\nWhat we call \"wokeness\" is a very real phenomenon, and as this magazine has pointed out repeatedly , it is both annoying and genuinely damaging . For the past decade, neoliberal Democrats have been particularly insufferable in wielding it as a weapon to advance pro-corporate politics, whether it's Hillary Clinton saying that breaking up the big banks wouldn't end racism and sexism, or MSNBC anchors and politicians like Barack Obama endlessly complaining about Bernie Sanders being a white man who didn't talk enough about race and gender.\n\nBut what we're seeing take shape in Trump's second term is not the antidote to that; it's that exact same cynical strategy, only flipped on its head. While Democrats turned to woke rhetoric to defend corporations and push neoliberal policies that benefit their bottom lines, Trump and his people resort to equally lazy \"anti-woke\" rhetoric to do the same thing.\n\nIn each case, the basic assumption is the same: you are a gullible rube who will fall for this obvious play and promptly forget that they're working against your interests. Prove them wrong.\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nLast November, conservative commentator Ross Douthat penned a provocative column titled \"How the Right Became the Left and the Left Became the Right.\" \"One of the master keys to understanding our era,\" Douthat wrote in the opening paragraph, \"is seeing all the ways in which conservatives and progressives have traded attitudes and impulses.\"\n\nThe populist right's attitude toward American institutions has the flavor of the 1970s - skeptical, pessimistic, paranoid - while the mainstream, MSNBC-watching left has a strange new respect for the F.B.I. and C.I.A. The online right likes transgression for its own sake, while cultural progressivism dabbles in censorship and worries that the First Amendment goes too far. Trumpian conservatism flirts with postmodernism and channels Michel Foucault; its progressive rivals are institutionalist, moralistic, confident in official narratives and establishment credentials.\n\nDespite some terminological imprecision - Douthat often writes of \"the Left\" when he really means \"liberals\" - the argument speaks to something real.\n\nWhile liberals of the Bush era worried about mass surveillance and government overreach, today's liberal mainstream champions the sanctity of institutions and views the likes of courts, security agencies, and misinformation regulators as a bulwark against the Right. As Donald Trump insulted his way into the executive branch, liberals bludgeoned Bernie Sanders and his supporters with bad-faith social-justice critiques and made prudish appeals to consensus and decency. The Republican affect, by contrast, has increasingly drawn on themes of dissent and rebellion, with a politics of trolling and an aesthetic of 4chan-esque vulgarity supplanting the comparatively upright style once associated with figures like Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush.\n\nThere's a certain elegance in seeing contemporary politics like this: censorious and oversensitive Brahmins sermonizing about institutional authority in one corner and a newly irreverent right pursuing a frenzied and paranoid style in the other. It isn't entirely wrong, but it's not exactly right either. In its tidiness, such a narrative elides the important ways that the Right now engages in its own version of the very politics it claims to deplore. Conservatism, in this sense, has not so much traded places with liberalism as converged with some of its shallowest and most illiberal instincts.\n\nRecently, conservatives launched a crusade against brewing company Anheuser-Busch in response to an innocuous advertising collaboration with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. Breweries have reportedly been targeted with bomb threats, and one right-leaning company has seized upon the situation to launch a service called \"Woke Alerts\" that will warn consumers \" when companies cave to the woke mob .\" The episode is instructive for several reasons, among them that the campaign so obviously mirrors the very sensibility it purports to be resisting. In effect, the Right's go-to reaction to what it imagines are woke mobs is to create woke mobs of its own.\n\nThe incident is merely one example of a wider zeitgeist currently reflected in mass campaigns to get books with black or LGBTQ themes pulled from library shelves, draconian legislation to discipline academics who teach particular subjects, heavy-handed regulation of free expression in public-school classrooms, and sinister directives to state agencies targeting transgender children and their parents. \"Woke capitalism\" has, meanwhile, become conservatism's favorite bête noire, inspiring absurd freakouts about everything from Disney's ostensible promotion of socialism to Pride-themed Oreo packaging . The related concept of \"ESG\" ( Environmental and Social Governance ) is set to be the subject of congressional hearings that will, like Woke Alerts, target investors thought to be undermining profits in pursuit of a \"woke\" agenda.\n\nConservatives, in effect, have recognized the socially liberal bent of modern America - and they absolutely hate it. The result is a politics increasingly indistinguishable from the most exaggerated right-wing caricature of censorious social-justice warrior liberalism.\n\nAnother irony of this posture is that it has seen conservatives embrace a key premise of the shallow social-justice ethos that now pervades the upper echelons of some large corporations. True, they may hate it when leviathans like Amazon and Nike issue statements in support of Black Lives Matter or partner with transgender TikTok stars. But, in lockstep with the marketing teams at these very companies, conservatives accept the corporate alignment with various social-justice causes as something genuine rather than a branding exercise. On this, they agree with an influential section of American liberals: \"woke capitalism\" exists.\n\nYet the whole idea of so-called woke capitalism is absurd on its face. Large profitable corporations are, by definition, driven by cold-market calculus, not the pursuit of social justice in anything but the hollowest sense. Insofar as some corporations bend toward social liberalism, it's mostly because there's a greater market share to be found there - on major issues like trans rights and abortion , conservatism is very much a minority proposition in today's America - and because it can be an effective inoculant when their owners and bosses are caught union busting, running exploitative workplaces, or contributing to climate change. It's a cynical and often nakedly hypocritical branding exercise undertaken by people thinking about their bottom lines and little more. If the Right is wrong to attack woke capital, liberals are wrong to celebrate it.\n\nIt's one thing to find fault with the moralism that pervades some liberal milieus, or to roll one's eyes in the direction of Wall Street banks or entertainment conglomerates trying to cash in on social-justice branding. The fact remains, however, that it is not oversensitive liberals who are crusading against Bud Light, trying to get books banned en masse , or enforcing parochial ideas about gender and sexuality through state legislation. In the narcotic haze of the culture war, it is all too easy to overlook the extent to which America's conservative minority has become a mirror image of the very thing it purports to deplore: a shrill and inflexible mass that not only mistakes consumption for politics but demands protection, at all times, from facts, people, and ideas that make it uncomfortable.\n\nLuke Savage is a staff writer at Jacobin .

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe Democratic Party may have recaptured the White House, but its crisis remains as deep as ever. Though Joe Biden beat Donald Trump by 7 million popular votes, his Electoral College victory came down to 42,000 ballots in Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin. Democrats barely won the Senate, lost seats in the House, and were stonewalled at the state level - of the twelve legislative chambers Democrats had targeted there, they won zero.\n\nFar from celebrating a landslide victory, with hopes of a national realignment on the way, Democrats found themselves once more engaged in a tense debate about the future of a party that seems incapable of decisively winning control of all branches of government.\n\nOn this question, the progressive and centrist wings of the party are more divided than ever. Conservative Blue Dog Democrats like Abigail Spanberger blame radical rhetoric for the party's poor results in Congress: \"we need to not ever use the words 'socialist' or 'socialism' ever again. Because while people think it doesn't matter, it does matter. And we lost good members because of it.\"\n\nIn response, our left-wing leaders like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez contend that the Democrats will fail to mobilize their most enthusiastic voters if big-ticket progressive ideas get dropped from the agenda. They argue that the party's biggest liability was its unimaginative, uninspiring, and thoroughly orthodox economic conservatism. Joe Biden's promise that \"nothing will fundamentally change\" might have won over some moderates disgusted with Trump, but it failed to inspire voters to elect a Democratic majority.\n\nMeanwhile, despite losing a presidential reelection bid, many Republican leaders seem unconcerned with the results. After all, Trump managed to improve on his 2016 performance in nearly every demographic group, save college-educated voters and white men. Biden, however, failed to reverse the Democrats' slow bleeding of working-class voters of all races, so much so that Republican senator Marco Rubio boasts that the GOP is now the party of the \"multiracial working class.\"\n\nDemocrats know they are in trouble, and most of them recognize the problem: their base is too narrow. It is too geographically metropolitan, too educated, and, increasingly, too wealthy.\n\nWhat Democrats most need, then, is a way to build a larger working-class coalition. And this, too, is the crux of the debate between progressive insurgents and establishment politicians: each wing of the party accuses the other of being unable to win working-class voters.\n\nMaybe they're both right.\n\n\"Left but not woke\" was how commentator David Frum once described Bernie Sanders. In his 2016 bid for the Democratic nomination, Sanders's economic platform was decidedly ambitious and his rhetoric indisputably populist. In an era of small-government austerity and technocratic solutionism, Bernie often sounded like a New Deal dinosaur, blissfully unaware that history had ended in the 1990s, or that Democrats had become a party of right-thinking college graduates rather than blue-collar workers. He offered a worker-centered economic agenda, without the alienating cultural aesthetic that dominates liberal media and the universities.\n\nNo one can deny Sanders's influence on the future of the US left. His platform has upended the policy consensus on Capitol Hill, and his talking points are now regularly imitated by down-ballot candidates across the country.\n\nYet many of his most outspoken disciples fail to embody his unique appeal. Instead of the single-minded focus on working-class issues, they often embrace the liberal culture war while peppering in some of Bernie's popular programs. So, if Bernie is the progressive exception, then what is the rule?\n\nConsider Elizabeth Warren's campaign, which even the ultraliberal magazine the Atlantic chided for its \"Excessive Wokeness.\" Warren combined a popular economic agenda with an often awkward attempt at courting Teen Vogue -reading radicals. This approach was admired among activists, media commentators, and some professional-class voters, but almost no one else - especially not the oppressed groups she aimed to attract. Warren came in fourth among black voters in her home state.\n\nWarren is far from unique, though, and the brand of politics she championed is certainly not dead - in deep blue districts, it might even be the norm. The members of the Squad - long thought to be the successors to the Sanders mantle - have welded Bernie's economic agenda to activist demands like \"defund the police\" and political appeals that, whatever their merits, seem best at attracting the hyperliberal and highly literate.\n\nProgressives and socialists are now pairing ambitious and urgently necessary proposals like Medicare for All with wildly unpopular and sometimes counterproductive policy positions. Further, progressives have embraced a racialized worldview that reduces whole populations to their skin color. \"Woke\" ideology has prevented many on the Left from grasping the possibility that a Mexican American may care more about health care than immigration, that a woman might be more motivated by economic promises than electing a first female president, or that Trump might be able to improve his vote share among working-class black voters.\n\nEven the political style of the Left seems designed to turn away potential new recruits. Far from signaling a commitment to vital social causes, being \"woke\" has become synonymous with an embrace of niche cultural attitudes found only in highly educated urban districts and among Twitter users - 80 percent of whom are affluent millennials. The Sanders campaign attempted a break with the new online consensus when it rejected the fringe term \"Latinx\" in its historically successful efforts to court Latino voters. And while Sanders failed to win over infrequent, rural, and small-town voters, he recognized how important it was to craft a majoritarian message that could appeal to them.\n\nIt's unlikely that younger progressive leaders will do the same. Standout representatives like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib sit in districts teeming with young, liberal voters (each seat boasts a Democratic advantage of at least 29 percentage points). For urban progressive insurgents - who are cash poor and enthusiasm rich - the incentives are clear: \"woke\" messaging helps mobilize an activist volunteer base that allows these candidates to overcome their financial weaknesses vis-à-vis established incumbents, and since these districts are so uniformly Democratic, they need not worry about appealing to a broader group in a general election. But even as these progressives have marooned themselves on isolated blue urban islands, they insist more than ever on defining the terms of national debate. And thanks to their unusually strong access to media, they've been quite successful at this.\n\nThe political problem here is not the moral motivation behind the \"Great Awokening\" - there is no doubt that progressive Democrats have the best of intentions. The problem is the way in which that moral conviction is expressed, and by whom. Party insurgents today reflect the sensibilities and interests of a constituency that looks and sounds nothing like the kinds of voters the Left desperately needs to win.\n\nAfter all, professional-class progressives only make up about 13 percent of the electorate, and they almost never vote for anyone other than Democrats. Alternatively, as Peter Hall and Georgina Evans show, about 22 percent of voters dislike cosmopolitan and increasingly out-of-touch liberal cultural appeals but believe in a progressive economic agenda - and these voters are largely working class. Winning the loyalty of the majority of working people in this country will require breaking out of the existing liberal fortresses and appealing to workers across our massive continental democracy. But pairing a popular economic program with alienating rhetoric, chic activist demands, and identity-based group appeals only weakens the possibility of doing so.\n\nIf progressives are trapped by an unpopular political style, many Democratic leaders have carefully distanced themselves from it. You didn't catch Amy Klobuchar gushing about new activist campaigns. And Biden didn't bother to even flirt with woke posturing and academic invocations of \"intersectionality\" the way that Hillary Clinton did in 2016.\n\nBiden presented himself as a reliable and likable moderate - someone to steady the ship after Trump's rocky tenure and the insurgent challenge of the Sanders campaign. And, since the election, establishment figures have seized on every opportunity to tie Bernie's popular economic agenda to the more controversial ideas championed by some of his supporters. Spanberger chided the Left to \"never say defund the police again,\" but the congresswoman was careful to tie the slogan to \"socialism\" and other more popular economic policies. (Bernie himself never embraced \"defunding the police,\" and instead argued consistently for better training and more accountability.) Similarly, Representative James Clyburn insisted that the \"defund\" slogan was as much a liability for Democrats as Medicare for All. Progressives, therefore, have made it easy for moderates to attack an appealing left-wing economic program by simply associating it with the most unpopular pillars of the progressive agenda.\n\nIn contrast, centrist Democrats and conservative \"Blue Dogs\" have combined moderate rhetoric with a mostly orthodox economic program. Their charge to the Left is to \"grow up.\" To win seats, they argue, drop the socialism. But while Spanberger squeaked out a victory in Virginia's rural heartland, dropping socialism - or even attacking it at every turn - hasn't prevented her fellow Blue Dogs from becoming a nearly extinct political breed. The conservative Democratic caucus has only twenty-six members in the House, down from fifty-six under Barack Obama. As alienating as woke rhetoric is, a politics that does nothing to address wage stagnation and general economic and social decline isn't winning many over either.\n\nIt's undeniable that Democrats in rural areas face steeper challenges than their urban and suburban counterparts, but curiously, two outstanding victories for swing-district small-town Democrats were Matt Cartwright in perennially purple Pennsylvania and Peter DeFazio in Oregon. Both are Medicare for All cosponsors; both held on to their seats even as at least seven more Blue Dogs went down to defeat. It should be plain that Spanberger's rage at progressives is at least as much an expression of frustration that the Blue Dog formula also seems to be failing.\n\nThe establishment may credibly argue that hyperliberalism is an electoral liability for the whole Democratic brand, undermining House members who have never claimed any activist bona fides. But what do these Democrats make of the equally credible argument that policies like government health insurance and a $15 minimum wage are widely supported even in districts that make Spanberger's look liberal?\n\nMainstream Democrats are fundamentally unwilling to renew their commitment to the New Deal ethos of social programs and union rights. Consequently, they are unwilling to rebuild the kind of electoral coalition that brought them a half-century of political supremacy.\n\nWorse, the Clintonite commitment to economic \"modernization\" has led the party to a political disaster. The promise was that manufacturing job losses would be offset by widespread economic prosperity, built on Silicon Valley magic and the financial sector's charge-card plastic. The reality was that the elite economic consensus - tax cuts and balanced budgets - resulted in unparalleled economic decline in midwestern \"blue wall\" states.\n\nDisastrous trade agreements only helped accelerate the depression of wages and the inflation of despair in hollowed-out old factory towns and cities. History will judge the Democrats' passage of NAFTA as nothing less than the first signature on their own death certificate.\n\nFor the Democrats to win back their New Deal (or even Obama-era) constituency, they need to credibly appeal to the economic interests of working people. Unfortunately, moderates in the party are unwilling to offer workers much more than a wry smile and a charming affect. Progressives, meanwhile, do promise real solutions - but only after they drench those appeals in a cultural style born in universities that most people will never attend. The effect in both cases is the same: Workers stay home. And the Democrats lose more and more of the country.\n\nOne way of looking at the past twelve years of American politics is to say that, in both 2008 and 2016, workers voted for the \"change\" candidate. They voted for perceived outsiders, and they voted against Washington. Both Barack Obama and Donald Trump argued that, through their personal charisma and skill, they could save workers. In both campaigns, workers voted for a candidate who promised to take on elites, renegotiate NAFTA, rebuild our education system, and stem the poverty, disease, and violence that plague so many American neighborhoods.\n\nFor over a decade now, the electorate has been screaming at the political class that something must be done and that the government must change course. But the government, under both Obama and Trump, largely ignored them. Nothing significant has changed in these last twelve years. Congress remains in a permanent state of dysfunction.\n\nMeanwhile, the issues workers most prioritize are an afterthought in the media and among the political class. The domination of American politics by the affluent and the educated has led to a dramatic rift in the public sphere and a deep cleavage between rural and urban workers and those with and without a college degree. Within the Democratic coalition, in particular, the gap between workers and professionals has grown wide. In fact, the difference in priorities seems at least as significant as the self-identified ideological divide between the establishment and progressives.\n\nAccording to a report from the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group, Democratic-leaning working-class voters ranked their top five issues as follows: health care, social security, Medicare, the economy, and jobs. But liberal professionals listed theirs as: environment, climate change, health care, education, and racial equality. By comparing rankings, we can see great chasms between groups: While crime was listed sixth for workers, professionals' concerns about crime placed way down in position seventeen. And while workers listed the economy as their number-four concern, professionals saw it as twelfth in line. For professionals, climate change was a top issue in this election - for workers, it didn't even break the top ten.\n\nAcross the board, professionals insist on issues far from the kitchen table, while workers vote almost entirely on direct economic concerns. The Democratic strategy of consolidating their urban and suburban electorate has only resulted in a deepening embrace of issues that narrowly reflect the interests of that constituency. After all, if your party is courting wealthy, mostly white, professional-class voters, you will pitch campaigns designed to attract those voters.\n\nWhat's more striking is that - though progressives insist on going much further than centrists on any given policy - the white-collar priorities of both wings of the party were represented in Biden's campaign. In his victory speech, Biden reiterated his ultimate intentions:\n\nTo marshal the forces of science and the forces of hope in the great battles of our time. The battle to control the virus. The battle to build prosperity. The battle to secure your family's health care. The battle to achieve racial justice and root out systemic racism in this country. The battle to save the climate. The battle to restore decency, defend dem-ocracy, and give everybody in this country a fair shot.\n\nNotice that, of the top-priority issues for Democratic working-class voters, only health care was explicitly referred to - coincidentally, it is also a top issue for professionals. If you understand nothing else about American politics, understanding that professional-class issues dominate Democratic appeals will help you make a great deal more sense of the world than incessantly scratching your head during every election cycle about just why it is that workers keep \"voting against their interests.\"\n\nThe fact is, neither workers nor their interests are even on the menu.\n\nThe consequences of neglecting workers' interests are clear: Washington will remain dysfunctional. On the one hand, in order to reverse the bleeding of working class voters - especially in rural areas and small-towns - the federal government must act decisively to reverse the economic decline wrought by decades of reckless shortsighted policy making. On the other hand, until and unless progressive forces figure out how to win outside of large urban areas, the Left will remain legislatively impotent.\n\nCentrism is a dead end that promises nothing but razor-thin victories, divided government, and an ever-shrinking share of working-class votes. But getting \"woke\" also means alienating most voters - of all colors - and handing the Republicans easy layup victories at the polls. Still, it will probably take more than a rhetorical adjustment to regain the confidence of working people.\n\nStruggling Americans want jobs, health care, decent schools, safe neighborhoods, and somebody - anybody - in Washington to listen. But why would they listen? Democrats today represent the richest House districts in the country, and Republicans consistently send the wealthiest individuals to Washington. The median income in Congress is 500 percent greater than that of the nation at large - half of our federal legislators are millionaires.\n\nCongress is richer than ever, yet both parties have gloated about their success in \"diversifying\" the chambers: today, 24 percent of lawmakers are women, 22 percent are racial or ethnic minorities, and more than 5 percent are of foreign birth.\n\nOnly 2 percent come from a working-class background.\n\nThe case for increasing the representation of minorities and women in Congress has rightly been accepted as both morally correct and politically effective. Yet, in recent memory, there has never been a forceful case for improving the representation of workers. But this is exactly what must happen if we are to avoid the two dead ends of centrism and hyper-liberalism examined above.\n\nDepending on your definition, \"the working class\" makes up between  55 and 70 percent of the country. The vast majority of this group shares a great deal in common politically, but in our broader political culture, working people are more often expected to sort themselves into groups euphemistically called \"communities\" than they are encouraged to think of themselves as part of a class. What's more, workers almost never get to vote for other workers on the basis of their shared experiences, aspirations, and interests as workers.\n\nOn almost all major economic questions, lawmakers from blue-collar backgrounds are reliably more progressive than their white-collar counterparts. Working-class legislators are also more likely to come from the districts they are seeking to represent, more likely to come from oppressed groups, and more likely to sound like and speak to the discrete interests of their potential voters.\n\nIn other words, there is no good reason not to run working people for Congress. There is only one very bad reason, and that is the fact that many progressives, moderates, and conservatives alike plainly think working people are stupid and culturally backward. As a result, no one asks them, or creates the material conditions that allows them, to run.\n\nPolitical scientist and author of The Cash Ceiling Nicholas Carnes credits this fact as one major reason working people do not run for office. Democratic socialists have a special responsibility to change this - what does workers' government mean if not workers in government? Doing so would also help us avoid many of the problems outlined here and potentially allow progressives to break out of their blue bubbles.\n\nThe good news is that representatives Mark Pocan, a longtime member of the painters' union, and Donald Norcross, the House's only electrician, have recently announced a new labor caucus in Congress that could provide a means for doing just that. The caucus seeks to advance the interests of organized and unorganized workers alike. Presumably, it will also endeavor to increase the representation of workers in Congress. If these labor legislators can develop a serious program for the recruitment of workers to run for office, financed by local union PAC contributions and buttressed by big volunteer get-out-the-vote campaigns - especially in the small-town and rural districts where liberals struggle - they could provide a path out of the morass.\n\nIn Norcross's home state, the New Jersey AFL-CIO's Labor Candidates Program has to date secured more than a thousand election victories for unionists and could serve as a model for candidate training and campaign development. In close connection with the congressional Labor Caucus, such local efforts could help develop the political arm of the labor movement while also exciting rank-and-file members who are more likely to mobilize and support their union sisters and brothers than they are any Johnny-come-lately Democrat who only shows up at election time.\n\nFor the Left, pivoting toward recruiting worker candidates and retooling a campaign message to speak primarily to the economic interests of wage workers - in rural and urban districts alike - is a function of will. Progressive leaders in Congress are not tied down by corporate donations or deals with party elites that would prevent such a change in direction. And left-leaning Democratic and independent voters are overwhelmingly in favor of the kinds of pro-worker legislation that trade-union candidates might put forward.\n\nOf course, there is no guarantee that working-class candidates armed with a bold economic agenda will break the powerful geographic bias against the Left. At best, the strategy offers only a slow and uneven advance. But it is also true that we have no chance to deliver the reforms we hope to see with a constituency made up of high-earning and highly educated liberals.\n\nUntil then, the Democrats will remain the party everyone loves to hate.\n\nDustin Guastella is director of operations for Teamsters Local 623 in Philadelphia.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

According to Republican lawmakers, Fox News, and self-pronounced experts such as entrepreneur and long-shot Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy , the emergence of \"ESG funds\" (short for environmental, social, and governance) poses the \" single greatest threat \" to capitalism and democracy. Elon Musk suspects a conspiracy \" weaponized by phony social justice warriors \" to bring harm and shame upon the impeccable world of free-market practices - and Tesla's stock-market valuation.\n\nProponents of the increasingly prominent investment paradigm, on the other hand, claim that the growing popularity of ESG funds facilitates and encourages \"socially responsible\" investing. These in turn ought to enhance corporate social responsibility and lead the business world onto a more equitable and sustainable path, especially when it comes to the investments in renewable energy essential to mitigating the worst effects of climate change.\n\nThe fight over ESG funds is part of the broader battle being waged by the American right against bogeymen like critical race theory. Eager to embrace the latest outrage trend, Republicans and their right-wing allies have launched a full-fledged campaign against ESG investing - and it seems to be working. Last year, eighteen US states proposed or implemented legislation prohibiting the government and its associated financial vehicles from investing in ESG funds. Capital inflows into the sector have declined ever since.\n\nBut what does ESG actually do? Does it contain the transformative potential claimed by proponents and critics alike? Is there any truth to the idea that ESG investing will \"destroy capitalism\" by steering capital into sustainable and \"responsible\" business practices? According to our recent research , the answer is: not exactly.\n\nESG constitutes an investment approach, increasingly popular within the financial industry, whereby funds and other investment vehicles incorporate measures of companies' environmental, social, and governance impact into their investment decisions. The antecedents of ESGs can be traced back to religiously inspired investing practices, like Quaker funds that refrain from investing in gambling or alcohol, or the divestment campaigns organized by the anti-apartheid movement.\n\nDivestment has been widely popular in campaigns for human rights as well as in the antiwar, LGBTQ, and environmental movements. Its effectiveness has been widely debated, both in academia and in social movements. Most empirical research identifies some impact , but no drastic changes, and many on the Left have rejected divestment as a market-based approach to inherently political conflicts.\n\nThe contemporary trillion-dollar ESG industry bears little resemblance to these humble, idealistic beginnings, however. Early on, small firms like the London-based Ethical Investment Research and Information Services Ltd. (EIRIS), founded in the 1980s , conducted research for institutional investors keen to shape their investment practices in line with their morals; faith-based institutions and charities were among the principal clients. Research facilitating socially responsible investment began in earnest in the United States in 1988. KLD Research & Analytics was among the so-called first movers in that market, a small agency devoted to its task of pushing the private sector toward sustainability and equity.\n\nOver time, these idealistic, less market-oriented firms were acquired by larger companies, the industry developed, and piece by piece they merged into large ESG fund conglomerates. The earlier, ostensibly ethical values-based approaches for measuring companies' ESG performance were gradually replaced by financial worth-based assessments - which were much more useful for the financial industry.\n\nEstimates of the ESG industry's size vary widely, mostly due to a lack of coherent regulation or definition, and the current state of affairs in the sector has been described as the \" Wild West .\" Despite this confusion, analysts and scholars widely agree that the ESG sector has constantly grown in size and influence since its humble beginnings. This growing importance results from ESG's steering capacity: every time a new investment practice is established in the financial industry, billions of dollars move according to the new criteria - shifting investments to different companies, changing corporate behavior, and impacting societies more broadly.\n\nThe power to define such investment criteria is highly contested. So who actually decides what constitutes an ESG?\n\nThe organization of the investment chain has undergone extensive changes in the last decade. For practically as long as financial markets have existed, it was common practice to actively bet on a limited number of companies that fund managers believed would outperform the market.\n\nSince the global financial crisis of 2007-9, however, we have witnessed a massive shift toward what is known as \"passive investment.\" Passive investment styles do not select particular companies but merely track or replicate indices. These indices are metrics representing particular markets, such as the S&P 500 or the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. The great advantage of passive investing is that it minimizes risks and reduces costs, and asset managers such as BlackRock, State Street, or Vanguard are famous for implementing index-based investment styles at a massive scale and generating huge profits.\n\nWhile these changes might sound like technical adjustments with little importance, they have triggered a far-reaching shift in the balance of decision-making power within the financial industry. Asset managers' choice for or against a particular index, as well as the assumptions and evaluations underlying the construction of indices, have much more influence than the assessments of any individual fund manager.\n\nWith the growing tide of passive investment, even actively managed funds are moving closer to indices, a phenomenon known as \"benchmark hugging,\" because their performance is assessed in comparison to indices. Effectively, there are three index providers whose judgements really matter : MSCI, S&P Dow Jones Indices, and FTSE Russell. They are massively influential, as any change in their assessments of which companies or countries constitute a particular index translate directly into changed investment decisions.\n\nThe overall pattern of this oligopolistic distribution of power is replicated in the ESG industry. While most of the investments carried out under the banner of ESG are still actively managed, a noteworthy drive toward passive investment is underway. Overall, 88.1 percent of all investors in the ESG sector either use indices as a core part of their strategy or to assess their performance in comparison to them. Of the five hundred largest ESG funds in the world, 28.2 percent passively follow an index. BlackRock alone manages 45.5 percent of these funds - only a handful of other asset managers can claim relevant market shares.\n\nWhile this market concentration is astounding, it pales in comparison to the market for index provision. This is the part of the market where index providers, such as MSCI, compete for the asset managers' use of the indices they offer. Here, 93.6 percent of passive assets under management follow ESG indices provided by just five index providers, with MSCI alone. accounting for 67.9 percent. If we want to understand how the ESG market really functions, then, we need to scrutinize the criteria constructed and applied by the index providers, and above all MSCI.\n\nMSCI and other index providers essentially define what counts as an ESG fund. But not all of their ESG indices are the same. In our research, we propose a threefold categorization of indices in order to assess their potential impact. We distinguish between what we call \"broad ESG,\" \"light green,\" and \"dark green\" indices.\n\nCrucially, none of these three categories enforce any sort of mechanism for exerting direct influence on corporations' business practices, like voting behavior at annual meetings or private engagements with management. So ESG funds exclusively rely on their decision-making power over the allocation of capital to shape corporate business practices. The first category of \"broad ESG\" mimics regular indices and barely excludes extractive industries, fossil fuels, or arms producers. The exclusion mechanisms are not very precise; it very often is the case, for instance, that companies like Total or Lockheed Martin are included in broad ESG funds because they achieve a slightly better ESG rating in comparison to other fossil fuel or arms producers.\n\nLight green indices apply somewhat stricter criteria and quite credibly exclude companies whose practices are deemed unacceptable regarding their environmental or social impact. Only dark green indices actively channel capital toward the transformation of the economy, by applying relatively tough exclusion and decarbonizing criteria and favoring investment into sectors producing the necessary means for an energy transition (such as solar panels).\n\nBut of the $189.9 billion guided by passive investment structures in our dataset, merely $9.3 billion follow dark green indices, or about 4.9 percent of assets under management. The bulk of that money, $167.2 billion (88 percent), follows indices that we categorize as broad ESG. So the metrics guiding most global ESG investment differ only very slightly from business-as-usual.\n\nThese findings have major political implications. First, the smear campaign launched to cultivate fear regarding the allegedly far-ranging impacts of ESG funds is the product of an ideologically motivated political project. In stark contrast to the strong impact the Right claims ESG funds have on the economy, we do not observe meaningful material effects. Only very minor segments of the private sector substantially differ from regular investment practices.\n\nThis lack of deviation from regular market practices shows that we cannot expect the free market to rapidly decarbonize the economy or direct capital into the green transition we so urgently need. While this might be common sense on parts of the Left, high-ranking politicians and renowned economists repeatedly express high expectations regarding the steering capacity of private financial markets. Increased public regulation, such as the Securities and Exchanges Commission's climate disclosure rules - the final publication of which, however, has been postponed over and over again - could potentially bring some change in this regard. If regulators live up to their stated ambitions, they could enforce strict exclusion criteria and actively steer capital into business sectors producing clean energy. Our research, however, suggests that regulation will most likely follow the script provided by the financial industry and further increase the market power of index providers.\n\nESG funds are neither particularly \"woke\" nor a threat to capitalism; we need to think beyond private finance in the fight against climate change. If the private sector is unable or unwilling to enact the kinds of changes to production needed to respond to the climate crisis, then the public sector will have to. As economist Daniela Gabor put it, \"Private finance won't decarbonise our economies - but the 'big green state' can\".\n\nThis work has been made possible by the support of the Puffin Foundation .\n\nJohannes Petry is the principal investigator of the StateCapFinance research project at Goethe University in Frankfurt.

Don't be fooled: corporate anti-racism isn't about solidarity - it's just a marketing campaign.\n\nNo matter what they're tweeting, the brand are not your friend. Pepsi\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIn April 2017 the corporate overlords at PepsiCo rolled out a nearly three-minute video clip projecting a vague idea of solidarity toward nothing in particular. Featuring a diverse cast of telegenic young people and starring none other than superstar Kendall Jenner, the segment foregrounds a gathering vaguely encoded as a protest march thanks to a few raised fists and a handful of signs showcasing a series of not exactly firebrand demands such as \"Join the Conversation.\"\n\nAt video's end, the glamorous Jenner glides gracefully toward a phalanx of uniformed police to share a cold can of Pepsi with an officer, to general approval from everyone involved. As the camera fades to the tune of Skip Marley's \"Lions,\" the Pepsi logo appears and viewers are invited to Live For Now®.\n\nVirtually everything about the ad, from premise to staging to sheer existence, is absurd from start to finish. As corporate self-parody, it was nothing short of an Olympic-level performance that the finest satirists at Clickhole or The Onion couldn't have matched if they tried. Tone-deaf and painful to watch even by the cavernously low standards of social justice-themed corporate cringe, and rather shamelessly appropriating imagery from Black Lives Matter, it elicited a fierce enough backlash to be taken down in record time but continues to live on in the popular memory as a kind of gold standard for capitalist wokeness gone awry.\n\nThat may well change in the coming days as crowds of ordinary Americans courageously take to the streets in a series of increasingly assertive protests against police brutality and systemic racism while a chorus of corporate brands offers up vague displays of support on social media. Running the gamut from the poles of well-meaning-but-absurd to downright sociopathic, the comms teams at various corporate HQs are already working overtime to align themselves with the wider cause of racial justice and make known their general commitment to inclusion.\n\nPringles Chips went dark on Twitter for #BlackOutTuesday. The official Star Wars account released a short statement in support of black employees and artists. @Barbie pledged to champion diversity and declared her solidarity with the entire black community. Toronto-based restaurant GarfieldEATS, meanwhile, tweeted an image of the eponymous cat's sullen eyeballs accompanied by the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter, as if to suggest that the infamously lazy and gluttonous feline dislikes discrimination almost as much as he hates Mondays.\n\nTo give the brands their due, some of these efforts seem well-intentioned - after all, if commercial enterprises are offering nominal endorsement of anti-racism, that's obviously better than the alternative. The burlesque absurdity of reading messages of inclusion drafted by the branding specialists at Call of Duty: Warzone and FritoLay aside, there's something less innocuous about the way particular companies inevitably seize on anything social justice-tinged as an opportunity for the most transparently cynical exercises in PR.\n\nThis includes corporate leviathans like Amazon, which proudly touts its commitment to diversity and opposition to discrimination while underpaying its workers and treating many people of color in its employ like less than garbage . It includes McKinsey, which (among other things ) eagerly offered its services to the Trump administration's brutal immigration agenda and advised Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to restrict the caloric intake of migrants held in detention camps while earlier this week issuing a statement that condemned \"racism, hatred, and prejudice\" in every form. It includes NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell , who has evidently developed a severe case of amnesia about his contemptible response when San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick decided to take a knee for civil rights.\n\nHypocritical, sinister, or simply absurd as the case may be, the irresistible reflex of corporate brands to insert themselves into popular causes raises a real issue about the commodification of social justice and the way everything from poverty to racial discrimination is supposed to have a market solution - even, or especially, when the companies themselves are directly complicit in the problem.\n\nPatently ridiculous though it was, the now infamous Pepsi video was a kind of extreme case study in what happens when market forces spend the better part of four decades cannibalizing everything in their path, from entitlements and trade union rights to the conceptual repertoires of social justice and intersectionality. When the very idea of society is corroded in the name of market efficiency, the available lexicon to authentically express anything inevitably shrinks to the point that everything must be bent around the soulless logic of money and corporate brands. It's thanks to this takeover that even the most patently evil companies on earth can display floats at LGBTQ Pride and that big corporate blockbusters are now seen as a central terrain of cultural struggle while genuine or programmatic resistance to inequality and racism is marginalized and ignored.\n\nMore acutely than anything else to date, Pepsi's risible effort to commodify social justice perfectly encapsulated the market ethos that now so inescapably pervades American society, wherein even the iconography of dissent and inclusion is seamlessly slid in right next to the logo of your favorite carbonated beverage, ecommerce app, hookup service, or laser-guided munitions manufacturer.\n\nIn this Pepsi-fied rendering of America, heavily armed police, Black Lives Matter activists, celebrities, and ordinary citizens alike coalesce around an airbrushed imagery of social harmony and frictionless protest, all of it facilitated by a profitable sugary soft drink made by a multibillion-dollar corporation. In the real America, meanwhile, the combined forces of market capitalism and institutional racism conspire to sustain inequality and prejudice while repressing activists and ordinary citizens alike.\n\nBig companies discriminate , union-bust, underpay their employees, and generally treat America's vast and diverse working class like shit. Behind the woke smokescreens of Big Philanthropy and intersectional HR pablum, their corporate political action committees pour contribution after contribution into the coffers of establishment politicians, Democratic and Republican alike, who uphold a morally indefensible status quo, while their armies of lobbyists and consultants ensure that no one's need for health care, housing, or basic dignity ever transgresses against the bottom line.\n\nThis is why, as cops brutalize marginalized Americans and those Americans collectively resist, there will be plenty of vague calls for inclusion from corporate PR departments but very few threats to claw back political contributions or demands on political leadership to carry out necessary measures like the defunding of city police departments gorged on Rambo-esque arsenals of military-grade hardware.\n\nThe ubiquity of a single commodity in any marketplace inevitably brings down its value - and, as the past week has shown, social justice of the brand-washed and trademarked variety is both a cheap and omnipresent commodity in the hyper-marketized, hyper-carceral version of America that exists today. It's hardly incidental that, amid this deluge, the real kind continues to be in dangerously short supply.\n\nLuke Savage is a staff writer at Jacobin .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

It will likely fail - but he's making a lot of money along the way.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy talks to reporters following the FOX Business Republican Primary Debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library on September 27, 2023 in Simi Valley, California. (Mario Tama / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nA fringe corner of the financial market is picking up steam, and it has a rising Republican Party star to thank for it.\n\nWhile most observers were content to write off Strive Asset Management - which launched in 2022 with a declaration of war on \"woke\" investing - the firm cofounded by GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy reached a key milestone earlier this month: $1 billion in assets under management. The influx of cash has made Strive the largest in a set of companies that actively push back against environmental, social, and governance (so-called ESG) concerns, according to data from Morningstar Direct.\n\nStrive's vision is almost certainly doomed, and whether the company and its fellow crusaders are here to stay is uncertain. Yet one thing is clear: it's a great way to make a lot of money.\n\n\"There's a really well-coordinated, large group of dark money political players that have spent the last two years creating this tempest in a teapot around climate issues,\" said Jesse Coleman, a senior researcher at Documented . \"Then you have Ramaswamy and Strive, and to us it looks like they're trying to capitalize on that political momentum.\"\n\nRamaswamy launched Strive after his 2021 book Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam , which argued (persuasively) that companies use ESG and social justice concerns as a cynical smokescreen. His (less persuasive) solution: to remove social justice from consumerism and free the market.\n\nTo that end, Strive manages nine exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that allow consumers to buy stocks in a range of companies, as well as two mystifying bond ETFs that serve no discernable anti-ESG purpose (the firm maintains that they are part of the broader strategy, though bondholders almost never have voting rights).\n\nAmong the portfolios is Strive US Energy ETF, which allows investors to hold energy giants like ExxonMobil and Chevron; its publicity promises \"to unlock value in the US energy sector by mandating companies to focus on excellence.\" Other ETFs give investors exposure to technology stocks, emerging-market stocks, and the US semiconductor market. In all cases, Strive's plan is to vote against ESG proposals and engage with management to sway companies to its position.\n\nYet if the point is to help companies resist the pull of ESG demands, the mission is almost comically hopeless.\n\nThe main problem for Strive and other anti-ESG firms is that in the broader market, they are minnows among whales. Strive's $1 billion in managed assets is impressive for a little-known firm less than a year old, but its capital is dwarfed by BlackRock, Inc.'s $9 trillion, or Vanguard Group, Inc.'s $8 trillion. Both asset managers offer similar ETFs and tend to be the largest investors in most American companies, making any attempts by Strive to vote against them essentially meaningless.\n\n\"I don't necessarily see, at least this year, their voting record meaningfully changing the outcome of any of these things,\" said Alyssa Stankiewicz, associate director of sustainability research at Morningstar.\n\nSo far, Strive can point to very few wins. On the section of the company website dedicated to highlighting \"engagement in action,\" Strive notes that it sent letters to Southwest Airlines, McDonald's, the Walt Disney Company, Apple, and Chevron. With Exxon, the company fared a little better, scoring an actual meeting with the CEO. The only successful outcome of the stern letter-writing campaign was Exxon adding additional board members - an outcome Strive wanted, although the company's actual influence over the decision is unclear.\n\n\"Anti-ESG funds make noise,\" Stankiewicz said. \"I don't have concerns at this point about anti-ESG funds significantly denting demand for ESG.\"\n\nYet changing the game may be beside the point.\n\nWith a large and growing platform within the Republican Party, Ramaswamy's newfound popularity is a major draw for potential investors and a perfect advertising opportunity. The candidate currently holds fourth place in the Real Clear Politics average of polls for his party's nomination and has become a regular television guest.\n\nWhile Ramaswamy officially stepped away from the fund in February to focus on his presidential run, a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 20 listed Ramaswamy as the majority shareholder with between 50 percent and 75 percent ownership of Strive Asset Management through the parent company Strive Enterprises, Inc.\n\nStrive Enterprises, meanwhile, hasn't sat idle. In November 2022, the company's proxy advisory wing, Strive Advisory, LLC, contracted with the Indiana state pension system for a review of its investment policy in a deal capped at $150,000, industry publication Responsible Investor revealed. For ad hoc work from Ramaswamy himself, the state was charged $4,000 an hour.\n\nAs Documented and the Lever have reported , Ramaswamy has used his connections through the dark money group State Financial Officers Foundation to pitch Strive portfolios and products to at least twelve state pension funds. And for pension funds looking for anti-ESG options, Strive is the big dog.\n\n\"We don't see any other fund manager that has those kinds of political connections to get them rocketed up to the C-suite level decision makers,\" said Coleman.\n\n\"For decades, Blackrock, State Street, Vanguard, Invesco, and other large asset managers have educated and discussed the merits of stakeholder capitalism, ESG, and pitched their case for why American capitalism is outdated,\" Strive said in a statement. \"Strive is educating the same pension funds on why shareholder capitalism outperforms.\"\n\nThat means that regardless of Ramaswamy's performance in the race for the Republican nomination, his newfound stature is already paying dividends. At the same time, the push is a boon to a coordinated political strategy worried about money being channeled away from damaging industries.\n\n\"Some are looking to leverage many levers of power to keep money flowing into those industries,\" said Frances Sawyer, the founder of Pleiades Strategy, which focuses on sustainability. \"This is throwing all the spaghetti at the wall to try to thwart a major economic trend.\"\n\nStrive isn't alone, either. Of the twenty-four remaining anti-ESG funds tracked by Morningstar (three shut down earlier this year), only six have seen investor outflows this year. The rest have seen combined inflows of over $582 million.\n\nThe biggest winner in this rush toward anti-ESG ETFs is Strive, with the firm's Emerging Markets Ex-China portfolio raking in $149 million and the Strive 500 ETF pulling in about $144 million. The Strive 500 tracks the five hundred largest US stocks, like the S&P 500.\n\nOther winners include several ETFs managed by Inspire Investing, which offers faith-based portfolios. It's primary offering, the Inspire 100, trades under the BIBL ticker and offers investors exposure to companies like software company ServiceNow, Inc. and oilfield services company Schlumberger NV. Inspire saw total inflows of about $112 million this year, according to Morningstar data.\n\nThen there's the God Bless America ETF, run by Curran Financial Partners, which brought in $11 million. The fund trades under the YALL ticker and boasts an unsurprisingly high exposure to Tesla stock.\n\nThe recent success of anti-ESG funds comes at an inconvenient time for the ESG industry at large as issuers and investors alike grapple with issues of greenwashing and more existential questions of whether it's even possible to use the financial industry to bring about environmental and social change.\n\nYet the future is still uncertain for the anti-ESG push. Even Strive, which Ramaswamy explicitly launched as an answer to \"woke capital,\" has pared down its rhetoric in the face of high demand for ESG products. In a letter to investors reported by Semafor , the company worried that appearing too political could constrain growth.\n\n\"Strive is strictly pro shareholder primacy and argues that the current industry debate is incorrectly focused on the broad ESG vs. anti-ESG categorization,\" a Strive spokesperson said in emailed comments.\n\nThe company's softer stance may reflect the rush to brand and sell ESG products. US SIF, an industry association, estimated the total sustainable investing market size to be $8.4 billion. Against such odds, even the relative success of anti-ESG funds this year may prove fleeting.\n\n\"The huge brick wall of reality is something you can't ignore,\" said Sawyer.\n\nJustin Villamil is a London-based freelance reporter covering the consequences of the financial system.

For all the NBA's liberal pretenses, it's a reminder that the league - and woke capital as a whole - really cares about profits, not principles.\n\nDaryl Morey, general manager of the Houston Rockets speaks during a press conference in Houston, Texas, on July 19, 2012.  Bob Levey / Getty\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nLast Friday night, a man named Daryl tweeted an image that read \"FIGHT FOR FREEDOM/STAND WITH HONG KONG.\" Daryl didn't mention China, nor any specific objections or desired outcomes regarding the Hong Kong protests , a movement sparked by opposition to a Chinese extradition bill that's grown to encompass demands for universal suffrage and an end to police brutality.\n\nBut this Daryl was Daryl Morey , general manager of the NBA's Houston Rockets, one of the league's most celebrated executives for a team that may be the NBA's most popular Chinese export. And his comments ignited an immediate, chilling backlash from the Chinese government, from Morey's billionaire boss, and from the forever faux-progressive NBA, all of which remind us that capitalism and human decency are irreconcilable.\n\nIn the little over three days since Morey's tweet, the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) suspended cooperation with the Rockets, a week after the CBA's Shanghai Sharks played the Rockets in an exhibition game in Houston. Chinese television announced it will no longer broadcast two surefire ratings-grabbing games this week between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets. The government cancelled the Nets' scheduled appearance at a court refurbishment ceremony at a Shanghai primary school. The sports website Hupu halted all coverage of the Rockets and locked their team section on the site. Tencent Holdings, the NBA's official Chinese digital partner, dropped all media coverage of Morey and any reports or streaming of Houston's games. Sporting goods brand Li-Ning said it's ceasing cooperation with Houston due to Morey's \"mistaken remarks.\" Taobao, the Chinese e-commerce platform, now returns zero results for the search term \"Houston Rockets.\"\n\nChina's response was no more disgusting than that of Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta, who managed to simultaneously get on his high horse and grovel before the bottom dollar. \"Listen,\" he tweeted Friday night , \"@dmorey does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets. Our presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the @NBA internationally and we are NOT a political organization.\"\n\nFew bromides are more exhausting than elite dismissals of \"politics\" as if it's some congenital defect the bulk of us suffer that they're blessed with immunity against. It's like the very virus that's killing you complaining about the stench. Appeasing an autocracy because it's profitable is as political as acts get.\n\nFertitta's penchant for money over humanity is well-established. Two years ago the restaurateur - worth nearly $5 billion - kvetched that \"We can't afford to do it\" in response to San Francisco's new employer health care mandate. \"All these states now are doing their own mandates. Why should the city of San Francisco be able to do absolutely whatever they want to do? I feel like all states and cities should have to abide by what the federal government thinks instead of the whim of somebody that is elected for a couple of years.\" Safe to assume the man who has praised Donald Trump would support abolishing term limits so as not to subject Americans to the whim of somebody elected for only four years.\n\nAs for NBA commissioner and progressive cosplayer Adam Silver, he told the media that Morey \"is supported in terms of his ability to exercise his freedom of expression\" while adding, seemingly exasperated, \"I can't ultimately run the NBA based on trying to satisfy everyone on Twitter. For those who choose to engage, they'll see that we are dealing with a complex set of issues.\"\n\nIn 2014, when Los Angeles Clippers owner and longtime racist slumlord Donald Sterling was recorded making bigoted remarks, Silver did not view the scandal as complex; in under a week Sterling was banned for life from the NBA; in just over a month the Clippers were sold to a new owner. In 2017 the NBA pulled the All-Star game out of Charlotte after North Carolina passed HB2, a law limiting LGBTQ anti-discrimination protections. No struggle with complexity then. In each instance, the league's profit margins were secure: Charlotte is no major media market, and replacing Sterling with the wealthier, more charismatic and not slumlord-y Steve Ballmer was an obvious boon, ultimately turning a moribund franchise into one of the NBA's glamour organizations.\n\nYesterday Silver again defended Morey's right to freedom of expression: \"The NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues. We simply could not operate that way.\" Silver added the NBA understands there are consequences to exercising that freedom and that the league \"will have to live with those consequences.\" The commissioner will be in Shanghai Thursday for the Lakers/Nets game, hoping to repair relations with the Chinese government. This is Silver's first great test as commissioner. It'd be unprecedented for the NBA to take any stance that threatens its profit margin. If the league truly wishes for its claims of progressivism to carry any weight, standing up to Beijing's authoritarianism would be a start.\n\nThe Morey tweet fallout has been predictable, dark, and disappointing. Chinese state television announced they oppose \"Silver's claim to support Morey's freedom of expression.\" Rockets' star guard James Harden apologized while offering vague platitudes about China offering \"the most important love.\" Morey issued a follow-up tweet praising \"our Chinese fans and sponsors\"; the term \"Hong Kong\" was noticeably absent.\n\nUltimately, this isn't about China, or the NBA, or a man named Daryl. It's about the people of Hong Kong fighting for their democratic rights. The rush by a superpower and a global business to erase Hong Kong from the discussion is inseparable from the push to erase the protests and protestors, too.\n\nTen years ago, Turkey's autocratic president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said Chinese's Uighir Muslims were suffering a genocide at the hands of the Chinese government. Today more than a million Uighirs are incarcerated in Xinjiang and millions more suffer forced assimilation. Last summer, while visiting Beijing to promote a new Silk Road connecting Asia and Europe, one that would boost Turkey's struggling economy, Erdoğan praised Chinese sovereignty.\n\nEven brutal strongmen will cower for the right price. We can't look to global industry, nor successful businesspeople, nor intelligent, well-meaning executives for models of resistance.\n\nMatthew Miranda writes about the NBA and EPL for SBNation and FanSided , and teaches writing for Stony Brook University.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

      "text": "How the idea of 'wokeness' was bludgeoned beyond recognition\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nIn the year 2023, former President Donald Trump decided he was fed up with the term \"woke.\" At a rally in June, he said , \"I don't like the term 'woke,' because I hear woke, woke, woke. You know it's like just a term they use, half the people can't even define it. They don't know what it is.\" It was a striking admission from a demagogue who had long used the term to whip up reactionary fury over a supposed social revolution. Given that Trump doesn't back away from language because it's unclear or tainted by bad faith usage, his lament hinted at exhaustion, the realization that so-called \"wokeness\" can't be milked for fearmongering the way it once could.\n\nThis is not a prediction that \"woke\" is about to disappear from the popular lexicon. Merely hours after Trump decried the overuse of woke, he used it in a town hall to criticize U.S. military readiness. Even so, Trump's complaint about woke is a useful signpost for understanding the decline of a contentious term.\n\nThe term \"woke\" has been broken.\n\nThe term came out of Black activism and music in the early 20th century , with the phrase \"stay woke\" signifying elevated consciousness or an admonition to be vigilant in response to the insidiousness of white supremacy. In the 2010s it gained broader use, with the term related to but distinct from the criminal justice reform movement that gripped America from the mid-2010s through 2020. The protest movements and associated commentators sometimes used \"#staywoke \" as a slogan to refer to alertness to systemic racism and other systems of oppression. After the murder of George Floyd, the concept was metabolized by the mainstream. First it was taken up by white liberals and corporate America, who saw it as a call to take bigotry more seriously. Shortly thereafter there was a right-wing backlash, and eventually woke became almost exclusively used by people on the right who deployed it as a slur designating the excesses of the left and a bogeyman to organize reactionary energy. Today some people on the right still use the word, but Trump's fatigue hints at a growing sense that overuse has degraded its power as a term of derision.\n\nThe term \"woke\" has been broken. It has been bludgeoned beyond recognition by the right. But that's just part of the story. Before it was completely wrested by the right, liberals and corporations had appropriated and transformed the slogan from an appropriate call for social awareness into a set of beliefs and practices that conflated largely symbolic acknowledgements of inequality with sweeping social change. More people are catching on to how that never amounted to much - and at times was an outright scam when exploitative corporations or enemies of progress like the CIA cloaked themselves in the language of awareness of social injustice. Mainstream commentators this year dissected the limitations of \"woke capitalism.\" And the rare tangible programs of the era - the explosion in DEI and DEI-type initiatives in the private sector - are now receding. Their longer-term legacy might in fact be defined by the backlash to them.\n\nBlack and antiracist leftists have long warned against modes of change that focus on symbolism and are vulnerable to capture by elites . Much of the effort to raise consciousness about oppression was well-intentioned, but it was a far cry from the radical social change needed to create a meaningfully antiracist, egalitarian society. Either way, it's evident that superficial or dishonest actors in liberal and conservative America have gotten most of what they were going to get out of \"woke.\" They have rendered it a dead end.\n\nFirst, let's discuss the current status of the word \"woke\" on the right. That the term has become cloying even to those who delighted in weaponizing it is a sign of how badly it's been abused. Initially, in a bid to build a backlash against rising antiracist sentiment on the left , the right began to invoke the term as a harbinger of the demise of conservative white America. The war on woke was (and still is) being waged through Republican attacks on DEI initiatives and educational curricula and the circulation of books with content focused on people of color and queer experiences.\n\nAt the same time, the meaning of woke was diluted to signal the undesirability of virtually anything vaguely progressive. At one point or another, \"wokeness\" has been used to explain mass shootings , military recruitment woes , the collapse of banks (and for some reason the Titan submersible tragedy ). Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' presidential campaign launch was so packed with anti-woke jargon that it was hard to understand . Some right-wing nationalists also seem to use the term to cloak vulgar racism , such as when Fox News host Laura Ingraham described a predominantly Black Christmas dance performance at the White House as \"woke nonsense\" intended to \"offend,\" but gave no substantive explanation as to what her objection was. Unsurprisingly, a word conservatives used to mean anything made it harder for them to explain and defend their agenda. In March, conservative author Bethany Mandel froze up in an interview when asked to define \"woke,\" despite having devoted a chapter of her recent book to it.\n\nThere are signs of diminishing returns for the right. Several right-wing boycotts of companies adopting inclusive policies or messaging in 2023 failed to make a financial dent. Polling this year indicates that woke is not a strong basis for right-wing messaging, and Republican presidential candidates have begun to cool on it , perhaps in accordance with that realization. Right-wing activist groups animated by the anti-woke agenda hit a wall in school board elections this year. Perhaps the well is drying up.\n\nOutside of right-wing spaces, the term woke is dead. A lot of the reason for that is because the right has successfully made the term radioactive. But some of its collapse is also tied to the way that the slogan was mutated and bankrupted in predominantly white liberal spaces. I am not talking about the criminal justice reform movement, which had mixed results but was focused on specific, tangible policies. I'm talking about the subculture that was spurred by that movement but was oriented toward a broader reckoning with how racism was systemic and deeply embedded in American history and institutions.\n\nIn that moment, particularly in 2020, there was an opportunity for a huge mass of people to join or start organizations, campaigns and sustained protest movements around reparations and fighting racial inequality in housing, in the schooling system, in access to a clean environment, and many other spheres of life. There was an extraordinary opening for collectives to pursue real strategies for addressing racial segregation across American life and the Black-white wealth gap . There was a moment in which it seemed that thinking about the structural nature of racism could inspire thinking about its symbiotic relationship with capitalism - and push certain sectors of American politics in a more left-wing direction.\n\nInstead we got a subculture I call recognitionism. The overarching focus of this subculture was advocating for individuals and organizations to show they that they recognized the existence of systems of oppression. This focus effectively cast aside the issue of taking collective action or pursuing policies that would address the roots of those systems. Instead of seeing \"woke\" as a mandate to do something big, this group remained stuck in the zone of awareness and crafted a culture of intricate signaling.\n\nIronically this subculture's approach to recognizing systemic oppression undermined its claim to understanding how it works.\n\nThe recognitionist set took antiracist educator Robin DiAngelo as their prophet and homed in on approaching antiracism through the lens of awareness, education and DEI-type initiatives. They encouraged placing black squares of solidarity on Instagram, circulated reading lists about the history of racism, and agitated for the adoption of vocabulary like \"privilege checking,\" \"white fragility\" and \"centering BIPOC voices.\" They located the site of change in interpersonal dynamics - avoiding microaggressions, learning how to \"listen\" to people of color (which was always incoherent and patronizing advice since marginalized groups are not monolithic). Most the actions they took were focused on representation - not in a democratic sense, but in terms of  identifying symbolic opportunities to combat white supremacy. They lobbied for diversity and inclusion in professional and elite spaces: leadership and hiring at major white collar businesses, in the arts, on cultural panels, university curricula and at awards ceremonies. There were calls to buy products from Black-owned businesses, but none of it was organized in a durable manner. Offensive depictions of racism were scrubbed from old television shows streaming online, real estate brokers stopped using the term \"master bedroom,\" corporations showed they were woke by using socially conscious themes in advertising fast food and soda. \"Doing the work\" was in fact mainly about reading and becoming better at all of activities.\n\nIronically this subculture's approach to recognizing systemic oppression undermined its claim to understanding how it works. Structural racism cannot be rooted out through one-off voluntary acts and education, but through sustained organizing targeted at political economy and public policy. As the leftist Princeton professor Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor pointed out in 2021 about DiAngelo's work, \"The notion that we will end racism one workshop at a time, one white person at a time really undermines what structural racism really is. Racism in real estate, housing, employment and beyond isn't because there are not enough nice white people in the world. The entire point is that it doesn't matter if you are nice or not nice, capital relies on racism to extract, exploit, accumulate, and profit.\" While many recognitionist rituals were well-intentioned and a net good for society - fewer microaggressions and more diverse film casts are good things - they simply weren't targeted at addressing their own premise of systemic problems.\n\nOne of the problems with a political subculture that focuses on acknowledgement and trafficking in symbolism is that one can establish antiracist bonafides and then carry on with no accountability for action or progress. People and organizations can perform their rituals of showing they're on the \"right side\" and then move on. That's already happening. One of the only concrete things to come out of that era was the explosion in focus on DEI - which was a net good, even if still far too narrowly focused on elite businesses and cultural organizations - and yet there's already plenty of data showing that DEI officers and programs are being slashed now that companies are no longer under scrutiny. The recognitionist emphasis on symbolism made it acutely vulnerable to being co-opted and subsequently ignored. It wasn't built to last.\n\nThe missed opportunity of that moment doesn't mean that the DEI advocates and microaggression educators are villains. The core problem still lies with the right and the capitalist class, and they benefited from the long-term institutional weakness of the left. As Georgetown University philosopher Olúfẹ́mi O. Táíwò put it in an interview, \"You can imagine, counterfactually, having robust community organizations, unions, and affinity groups like the kind of organized [civil rights] groups that SCLC and SNCC represented back in the day, that were holding people to account to hold the agenda on something more poor-focused. But on this side of Reagan a lot of those kinds of institutions have receded in power and influence for a variety of reasons.\"\n\n\"Woke\" remains today as an increasingly strange zombie artifact. And it is sad to reflect on how even the most incremental attempt at recognizing how racism pervades our society elicited such fierce backlash. Hopefully the next time there's a major crisis in race relations in America the left will be more organized, and we will all be more vigilant about the paths that can lead us astray.\n\nZeeshan Aleem is a writer and editor for MSNBC Daily.

      "text": "The narrative that 'woke' politics is why Trump won is nonsense\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nThe Democratic Party is in crisis. In three contests against Donald Trump , it lost one, narrowly squeaked by in another, then lost more decisively than the first time. In Trump's latest victory, over 90% of counties across the country shifted in his direction. Now people across the left are scrambling to diagnose what ails the party and offer a prescription.\n\nA group of center-left commentators and party operatives have converged on a diagnosis that could be summarized as \"the wokes lost it.\" This set argues that social justice activists who focus on oppression tied to identity had too much influence on the Democratic Party and helped torpedo Harris' campaign. Working class people were alienated, they contend, by issues such as defund the police, trans rights, reparations for Black Americans, abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement, campus \"cancel culture,\" diversity, equity and inclusion programs, and the ever-evolving academic-sounding jargon that surrounds these issues. The solution, many of them imply or explicitly say, is for Democrats to become more socially conservative and stop opening their arms to \"identity politics\" or social justice advocacy.\n\n\"The wokes lost it\" narrative relies on describing a fantastical presidential campaign that never existed.\n\nThis narrative is seductive for many veterans in the Democratic establishment, whose instincts have long been to mimic the right when in trouble. But this narrative is mostly wrong. It rests on a fictional account of the past, a handful of indefensible analytic leaps, and easily debunked scapegoating. A more careful reading of the facts helps illustrate how the party would benefit from a wholesale reorientation toward economic populism.\n\n\"The wokes lost it\" narrative relies on describing a fantastical presidential campaign that never existed. Harris did not run on defund the police or identity politics or any niche social justice issue. Harris brandished her track record as a former tough-on-crime prosecutor . She virtually never mentioned her racial or gender identity . On the hot-button issue of immigration, Harris promised to enact some of the most restrictive immigration and border policies in decades . She also distanced herself from the trans community by refusing to take a clear position when asked if transgender Americans should have access to gender-affirming care in this country. Harris ran mostly on a mix of positive vibes , an anodyne \"opportunity economy\" program, a pledge to maintain the international order and a promise to defend democracy, civil rights and normalcy . Harris' efforts came after Biden ran a defensive and visionless campaign that banked almost entirely on fear of another Trump term and never came close to approaching anything \"woke\"-coded. In sum, there was no evidence of niche activists controlling the party.\n\nSome of \"the wokes lost it\" proponents say that the right place to start for understanding where Democrats went astray is 2019 to 2020, when Democratic candidates staked out a number of progressive positions in the Democratic presidential primaries, and the George Floyd protest movement spurred new norms of inclusivity. This is a weak line of argument for a number of reasons. First of all, how can one vigorously argue that a 2024 loss can be blamed on events that happened half a decade ago, when we know that most voters don't even follow current elections closely, voters have short memories , and swing voters are low-information voters ?\n\nSecond, in that era the Democratic Party did exactly what \"the wokes lost it\" camp wanted it to. Most Democrats rejected the social justice movements that tried to influence Democrats at the time or took relatively moderate positions on their issues - and ultimately the party rallied behind a septuagenarian presidential candidate whose very value proposition was that he was a centrist uninterested in newfangled progressive goals. Biden opposed decriminalizing border crossings. He didn't just reject defund the police, he called for more police funding . He told donors that \"nothing will fundamentally change\" and boasted about having worked with segregationist senators . And while Trump made \"cancel culture\" a theme of this 2020 presidential campaign, Biden ignored identity-focused debate and ran on promises of defending democracy, taking Covid seriously and investing in infrastructure, clean energy and manufacturing. Even as social justice movements were highly salient in American life, Biden won. How can one argue that years later, Harris - Biden's vice president and successor who tied herself to his non-identitarian political style and campaigned with neoconservative icon Liz Cheney - lost because of a fading social justice political style she never even embraced?\n\nTo be fair, there is one moment from that era that did arise in this election. Harris, running for the 2020 Democratic nomination, in 2019 responded to a questionnaire from the ACLU, in which she affirmed her support for providing gender affirming surgery to transgender people in prison. (This was already the law , which means prisons were able to provide gender-affirming services under Trump, as Harris pointed out during her 2024 campaign.) Republicans ran attack ads against Harris in the 2024 cycle based on that answer. Even though Harris kept trans issues at arm's length during her campaign and certainly did not run on it as a campaign issue, Republican fixation on it may have affected voter perception of her.\n\nBut the evidence that this one issue is what did the Democrats in is impossible to defend. As my colleague Hayes Brown has pointed out , trans rights ranked low on issue priority surveys; multiple surveys and studies suggest that anti-trans ads do not have a significant effect on vote choice; and moderate Democratic Senate candidates such as Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Rep. Colin Allred of Texas were not saved in their 2024 races by swinging to the right on trans issues. Meanwhile, the overwhelming evidence we have from years of pre-election polling, issue priority surveys, international trends and focus groups is that the Democrats, like incumbents across the democratic world, lost the trust of voters on the economy, mostly due to inflation. The pro-Trump swing across tons of demographic groups nationally is consistent with that line of grievance, as political scientist Thomas Wood, a political scientist at Ohio State University, has pointed out : \"Secular dissatisfaction with Biden's economic stewardship affected most demographic groups in a fairly homogeneous way.\"\n\nTo sum it up, \"the wokes lost it\" proponents revise history so as to not have to admit that the Democrats just ran their playbook, and that it failed catastrophically. Observing their recommendations would either mean repeating the same plan or becoming markedly more socially conservative. (Notably, this set of commentators typically fails to spell out how , perhaps out of nervousness about personally singling out which marginalized groups shouldn't make the cut in 2028.) But Democrats have not reaped fruit from their recent attempts to tack visibly to the right, such as their rightward swing on immigration and policing. And this prescription ignores the reality that the election data tells us the party is failing to hear ordinary people's experience of the economy. Polls indicate that swing voters didn't want to hear about technical management of an economic system they think needs sweeping change.\n\nThere is a way for Democrats to both tap into universalism and into widespread frustration with the economy: aggressive economic populism. Tap into people's class identity through class-first left-wing politics that pits working Americans of all backgrounds against billionaires, corporations and the 1%. Under this paradigm, bigotry of all kinds is framed as a tool by which elites distract and divide Americans from their economic exploitation. Conversely, anti-bigotry should be viewed as a war cry of freedom-lovers and a weapon for keeping the citizenry's focus on class war. Economic proposals would not just be about incremental improvement but bringing down costs and reimagining freedom through the offerings of social democracy and cracking down on corporate greed. This would of course cause a bit of discomfort for an actually influential interest group that somehow the \"the wokes lost it\" crowd always forgets to mention: economic elites. But it would unite and excite the people and pave the path for a life of greater freedom in every sphere of life.\n\nDemocrats ought to stop whining about social movements, which are a fact of political life. They also ought to stop implying that movements and subcultures possess power that they don't, while ignoring how wealthy donors shape the party's economic agenda . The reality is political leaders and parties will always have to manage unruly coalitions and stake out positions that are in dialogue with but distinct from interest groups. Trump fairly successfully distanced himself from the national abortion ban advocates in the Republican coalition, and he successfully deceived many into thinking he would protect Social Security over the instincts of fiscal hawks in his party. Democrats, as the ostensible party of social change and egalitarianism, will always bear this burden of engaging movements even more heavily than the GOP. But a party must have an identity and that identity should be grounded in an economic sensibility. It's time for Dems to wake up and build a real economic centerpiece for a party that has failed to establish a clear sense of self since the Reagan era.\n\nZeeshan Aleem is a writer and editor for MSNBC Daily.

The Vatican's new decree reminds me why I'll never go back.\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nI was about 10 years old when my best friend and I had what my family now laughingly refers to as the \"holy water fight.\" It all stemmed from a dispute over a goal during a recess soccer game in our summer church youth program. The details of the incident that prompted the fight are disputed to this day (it was not a goal) and led to my friend Steve and I brawling and rolling into the long brush bordering the grassy field we turned into our makeshift playing field.\n\nThe church's message this week likely stamped out whatever hope I ever had to come back to Catholic services.\n\nI can still remember the fury on the face of the chaperone who broke us up, a mustachioed man whose name I've long forgotten. Steve and I were still heated with each other as we re-entered the chapel to resume our Bible class. In a moment of frustration - or inspiration, depending on how you look at it - as we passed the holy water font near the entrance to the chapel, I reached out and slapped the water right at Steve.\n\nGood Lord did I get in trouble for that decision, but it makes for a fond memory Steve and I, and my family, still regularly talk about to this day.\n\nGrowing up, my local Roman Catholic was my most important social connection outside of school. Most of my childhood friends were also Catholic, and every Sunday, we'd look forward to seeing each other at church. I knew even then that I was closeted transgender girl, though I did not understand at the time what that would end up meaning for my relationship with the church.\n\nOn Monday the Vatican released a document calling gender-affirming care \"contrary to human dignity,\" throwing my relationship with my faith even further away than it already was. I am a cradle Catholic - I grew up getting all the sacraments, from baptism to First Communion - but the church's message this week likely stamped out whatever hope I ever had to come back to Catholic services.\n\nI first left the church in 2002, not long after my confirmation, when the Boston Globe began exposing rampant church sexual abuse . I was not the only New England Catholic to stop supporting the church at that time. But back then, my deeply closeted trans identity wasn't yet a factor in my alienation from the church.\n\nEvery once in a while, driving past a local Roman Catholic church, I'd reminisce about my youth in the church, of the camaraderie I had with my Bible class friends, of the neighbors I would shake hands with before, during and after Mass, and I'd feel a pull back to my roots. But as it became increasingly clear that I wouldn't be able to suppress my gender identity in my mid-30s, I understood that the likelihood of returning to the church grew ever more remote. Why go back to an institution that so clearly wanted no part of me?\n\nIn place of church services, I have adopted a private spirituality. I still retain the excessive Catholic guilt that so many people who grew up in the church end up with, and I often contemplate my own mortality and how I can leave a positive legacy on the planet after I'm gone. There's none of the pomp and circumstance - or community - of my childhood church, but that's how I've maintained my spiritual health outside of Catholicism.\n\nThere have been a lot of headlines over the last few years about the \"woke pope\" Pope Francis, who has repeatedly called on Catholics to stop persecuting gay and lesbian people. He even met with a group of trans women as part of his so-called message of inclusivity not that long ago. But despite such gestures, the Vatican has always been one of the main players in anti-LGBTQ persecution in the Christian world.\n\nIndeed, even the now-common term \"gender ideology,\" an amorphous phrase that means different things in different Western countries depending on that country's conservative agenda (in Central America it mostly means abortion rights; in the U.S. it refers to trans people), started with the Vatican in 2003. \"Although actors may not be aware of its religious origins, the discourse on 'gender ideology' often resonates with [conservative] ideas and criticisms of gender,\" David Paternotte and Roman Kuhar wrote in their book \" Anti-Gender Campaigns in Europe .\" \"In this context, 'gender ideology' becomes a 'threat' - an empty signifier which allows coalition making with a variety of actors precisely because of its 'populist emptiness.'\"\n\nThe Vatican has always been one of the main players in anti-LGBTQ persecution in the Christian world.\n\nAs I've gotten older, I've thought often of returning to my faith in some form. I miss the community I had as a child. There's still a strange comfort in the scriptures for me, as I think about the Bible stories I grew up with. There are lessons to be learned in the story of the Good Samaritan, and I can't help but cheer along during the story of Jesus flipping tables to drive the merchants out of the temple. I still think about Jesus telling his disciples that eunuchs can inherit the kingdom of heaven, and I smile. But the church's dictate Monday is far removed from the Jesus I learned about who embraced the downtrodden and the eunuchs of the ancient world.\n\nI haven't been able to regain that sense of community I enjoyed in my childhood, and I'm not the only trans person lacking in-person community. According to a 2023 study , trans people are significantly more likely to feel lonely, isolated or excluded compared to the general population. The Jesus I learned about when I was younger would want trans people to find community in church.\n\nBut the Catholic Church has made clear for centuries that we simply aren't welcome, most recently by calling our lifesaving medication a threat to human dignity. But from my perspective, big international religious organizations encouraging their institutions and followers to obsess over the possible genitalia of a small and highly marginalized demographic is completely devoid of dignity.\n\nIt's also rich that the Vatican is so intent on alienating people like me while still struggling with its child abuse scandal. \"He who is without sin among you, let him cast a stone at her,\" Jesus is quoted as saying in the Gospel of John.\n\nI understand that the church has religious beliefs, but trans people aren't even mentioned in the Bible, making it strange that the church would so heavily focus on us as a minority for persecution. Young people in the West are leaving churches in droves in large part because of homophobia and transphobia. It's disappointing to see the Vatican lean in on bigotry against people like me.\n\nI'd love to come home to my church, but its opinions of me and my community make it impossible to do so. I'm not willing to abandon my trans identity or my health care, but I promise not to touch the holy water again.\n\nKatelyn Burns is a freelance journalist based in New England.

Ron DeSantis , but in the process he gave away exactly why so many on the MAGA right - including him - constantly use the term.\n\nTrump's surprising comment came as an aside during a rambling set of transphobic remarks at the Westside Conservative Breakfast in Urbandale, Iowa, during which he referred to trans identity as \"sick\" and deliberately misgendered people. He then detoured into why he is wary of using the word \"woke.\"\n\nIt was also one of those rare moments in which Trump said something true.\n\n\"It's gotten sick, and I don't like the term woke, because I hear woke, woke, woke. You know it's like just a term they use half the people can't even define it. They don't know what it is,\" Trump said.\n\nIt's not exactly clear who was he referring to when he said \"they,\" but it's likely he meant people on the right who use the term to discredit or fearmonger about any policy vaguely associated with the principle of social equality or inclusiveness. It could even be a jab at DeSantis, who has made opposing \"wokeness\" one of the animating principles of his presidential campaign.\n\nIt was also one of those rare moments in which Trump said something true, and maybe even slightly introspective. The term \"woke\" dates back to at least the early 20th century , and was originally used by people who positively affiliated with the term as a shorthand for awareness of social injustice and bigotry. But in recent years, the right has appropriated the term and rendered it unintelligible. First, right-wing users of \"woke\" used it to discredit any attempt at social inclusion as extremist ideology. Over time it evolved into a catch-all culprit for anything that conservatives view as a social problem. The right has blamed \"wokeness\" for everything from the collapse of banks to military recruitment underperformance to mass shootings . DeSantis' 2024 campaign launch last week was so packed with jargon tied to the anti-woke crusade that it was hard to understand what he was really saying. Trump is right: The term doesn't mean much anymore when used by the right.\n\nBut that's precisely why he and his political movement deploy the term so often. It's advantageous for a bad faith movement to make use of language that evokes a strong emotional response from its audience but isn't bound by pesky little things like definitions. Every week there's a new story on the right detailing a new instance of \"woke extremism\" to help keep the political base angry and mobilized; even basic corporate diversity initiatives that were uncontroversial in the pre-Trump era provide fodder for the right-wing fear machine. Leaders of the MAGA right wants the base to believe that phenomena like bank collapses and the military's recruitment woes are all tied to \"wokeness\" because it directs their attention to the chief villains of the white nationalist imagination: people from marginalized communities and their allies. Instead of thinking about issues in policy-specific terms, attention is directed to culture wars and demographics.\n\nTrump's alleged disregard for the term shouldn't be taken particularly seriously. He's used the term many, many times over the course of his career. He's sold merchandise using it. On Sunday he slammed Disney for being \"woke.\" In fact later on the same day that he said he wasn't a fan of the term, he called the military \"woke. \" It's just too tempting of a weapon for him to forgo entirely. And even if Trump doesn't use the actual word as much as DeSantis, opposing social equality will remain a core pillar of his worldview. But for a moment he admitted that the whole thing is a bit of a scam.\n\nZeeshan Aleem is a writer and editor for MSNBC Daily.

Ron DeSantis ' war on \"woke\" went too far for two judges appointed by Donald Trump, who called out the Republican's \"Stop WOKE Act\" for committing a grave First Amendment \"sin.\"\n\nAmong other things, the GOP-backed law bars businesses from holding mandatory workplace trainings if they endorse viewpoints the state deems offensive, including on race and diversity . But a federal appeals court panel noted that, under the law, meetings on those same topics are allowed if they endorse state-approved views.\n\nThe First Amendment doesn't take kindly to the distinction, which Florida tried to get around by claiming that the law controls the conduct of holding such meetings - which would give the government broader authority to regulate them - rather than the speech that takes place at these meetings. But the appeals court rejected the state's semantic maneuver.\n\n\"By limiting its restrictions to a list of ideas designated as offensive, the Act targets speech based on its content,\" Judge Britt Grant of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals wrote Monday. \"And by barring only speech that endorses any of those ideas, it penalizes certain viewpoints-the greatest First Amendment sin.\" She was joined in the unanimous ruling by another Trump appointee and a Bill Clinton appointee.\n\n\"The only way to discern which mandatory trainings are prohibited is to find out whether the speaker disagrees with Florida,\" Grant went on. \"That is a classic-and disallowed-regulation of speech,\" she wrote, calling the provision \"a textbook regulation of core speech protected by the First Amendment.\"\n\nTo illustrate the absurdity of Florida's position, the judge observed that, under it, the state could ban riding on a parade float if the authorities disagreed with the message on the banner, and the state could ban pulling chairs into a circle for book clubs discussing disfavored books.\n\nThe First Amendment is not so easily neutered.\n\n\"The First Amendment is not so easily neutered,\" Grant wrote.\n\nSo instead of getting to impose its views on Floridians, the state got a basic constitutional lesson - and not from some left-wing panel, either. Nonetheless, the state is reportedly contemplating appealing , which it's free to do. In the spirit of freedom, however, I wouldn't mandate that Florida officials instead re-read the Constitution and relevant precedents, but if this Trump-majority panel ruling is any guide, they may want to consider doing so.\n\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for weekly updates on the top legal stories, including news from the Supreme Court, the Donald Trump cases and more.\n\nJordan Rubin is the Deadline: Legal Blog writer.

Whitehouse tells the truth about GOP's anti-'woke' smoke screen\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nBy Ja'han Jones\n\nIt's no secret that the conservative movement's attack on \" wokeness ,\" their appropriated misnomer for virtually any awareness of social inequality, is contrived .\n\nAnyone surprised that the Republican Party would try to repurpose Black slang meant to denote intellect and cultural consciousness into something nefarious clearly hasn't spent much time watching the GOP in action.\n\nPersonally, I've found comedy in the fact that white conservatives embraced the term years after it seemed to have reached its zenith in the Black lexicon. As many Black people can tell you, \"woke\" was dying as a relevant cultural term long before white conservatives came along. And even now, Republicans use the term to describe such a broad range of subjects that it's essentially useless as anything but a dog whistle telling conservatives not to like something.\n\nI thought Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., described this tactic beautifully Wednesday when he referred to it as a \"smoke screen\" used by Republicans when they want to slash funding.\n\n\"From behind this new catchphrase, Republicans want workers and families to line up behind the tax cheaters, behind the polluters, behind the campaign donors, behind the well-connected and the well-off whom they serve,\" Whitehouse said.\n\nHe added: \"Well, their problem is, you can say 'woke' for a while, but then people will notice that they no longer have disability benefits, or that they can't afford their prescription drugs, or that huge corporations are paying nothing in taxes. The 'woke screen' is a smoke screen and people need to see through it.\"\n\nWhile we're on the topic of Black colloquialisms, I have another to describe the senator's remarks: \" BARS! \"\n\n(I can't wait to see what Republicans do with that one.)\n\nJa'han Jones is an MSNBC opinion blogger.

And I want you to keep your ears tuned for one single word: W oke . You've heard it before, and I'm betting you'll hear it a lot more tonight. Or at least enough to rankle your nerves. Or maybe mine.\n\nSee, before it was co-opted by right-wing conservatives , before it became a charged, political, catch-all phrase meaning everything and nothing at once , before it was considered a pejorative, and long before many of you probably ever heard the word, \"woke\" was part of the Black American lexicon, rooted in the fight for equality and justice.\n\nBut America's political theater has erased and overshadowed this necessary context. \"Woke\" in the mouths of some conservative Republicans , the MAGA set and their acolytes, has become a battering ram and a battle cry against liberal policies like bodily autonomy, affirmative action and the teaching of America's true and unvarnished history in classrooms. An anti-woke agenda has swept the country - or at least the parts of the country where such political shenanigans overpower good faith political arguments. Conservative activists and right-wing politicians, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis , have promised to destroy so-called wokeness wherever they find it.\n\n\"Our mission is to leave woke in the dust bin of history where it belongs.\"\n\n- Florida Gov. Ron Desantis\n\n\"We can never, ever surrender to the woke mob,\" said DeSantis , who is vying for the GOP's presidential nomination, said at a campaign stop in May. \"Our mission is to leave woke in the dust bin of history where it belongs.\"\n\nIt's giving McCarthyism, if Joe McCarthy read a dictionary of African American Vernacular English slang and randomly slapped his finger down on w-o-k-e on the book's final page.\n\nLast year, the war against woke made it to policy with DeSantis' Stop W.O.K.E. Act, which prohibits instruction that could make students feel uncomfortable about U.S. racial history. (It has since been blocked by a judicial order, but Florida is fighting the injunction.) Across the state, books have been banned . A.P. African American history curriculums have been white-washed or scrapped all together. Teachers have been jammed between a rock and a ridiculous place, with new standards even for teaching children that slavery was a good thing for Black people. So much for shielding (Black) kids from discomfort.\n\nFor many, \"woke\" has become a slur.\n\n\"It's almost another way of saying 'Black.' It's another way of saying the N-word,\" Ishena Robinson, the editorial director of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, told me.\n\nBut what's the real definition?\n\nRobinson, who's been tracking the political evolution of the word, says to be \"woke\" is \"to be awake to what's happening around you, particularly when it comes to systemic injustice. And it specifically came from Black people.\"\n\n\"It's being aware to what's being done to you and your people,\" she said. \"And being aware about how your people have been demonized or discriminated against or oppressed or framed in a way that takes away your humanity.\"\n\nThe word also can't be fully understood without also understanding its history.\n\n\"Woke\" has become a cannon ball in the latest culture wars.\n\nPost-emancipation, white supremacist violence was a constant threat. Lynching was common. From 1877 to 1950, some 4,075 Black people were lynched across the South, according to the Equal Justice Initiative . So Black folks had to keep their eyes open, literally and figuratively, to white danger. They had to stay woke .\n\nIt was \"half warning, half reminder,\" said Michael Harriot, the author of the forthcoming book, \"Black AF History: The Un-Whitewashed Story of America.\"\n\nFrom there, the word emerged as a common theme in African American vernacular and culture. In the 1930s, blues man Huddie Ledbetter, aka Lead Belly, wrote a protest song, \"Scottsboro Boys,\" in honor of a group of Black teens falsely accused of raping two white women in Alabama. In a coda at the end of the song, Lead Belly warns, \"I advise everybody when they go down there, stay woke, keep their eyes open.\"\n\nSince then, from the blues to hip-hop to the protest line, Black people have used \"woke\" and \"stay woke\" as a Bat Signal: Stay keen. Stay vigilant. White society can be vicious, physically and politically. By the late 1980s, woke was showing up in Black art, like in Spike Lee's classic film \"School Daze,\" where the actor Lawrence Fishburne is seen running into frame, staring dead into the camera, yelling, \"Wake up!\" Decades later, in the post-Trayvon Martin and post-Michael Brown era, \"woke\" was given new electricity by neo-soul artist Erykah Badu in her song, \"Master Teacher.\" Badu sings soulfully: \"I am known to stay awake/A beautiful world I'm trying to find.\"\n\nThen, in 2020, following the murder of George Floyd, \"woke\" crossed over from Black culture to the mainstream.\n\n\"No one was talking about woke as much as we have in the last two years,\" Robinson said. \"I think there was a lot of terror in seeing what was happening in 2020, seeing the multiracial multiethnic coalitions.\" Robinson said the GOP seemed to send out a Bat Signal of their own: \"Wokeness is what we're targeting.\"\n\nThe things that they're afraid of really is progress, equality, the things that will dismantle the systems that historically and currently benefit them.\"\n\n- Michael harriot\n\nWith the 2024 presidential election quickly approaching, \"woke\" has become a cannon ball in the latest culture wars.\n\nHarriot says the weaponization of \"woke\" follows a familiar pattern, as foes of racial and social progress in this country have always attempted to hijack and co-opt the narratives that define progressive movements.\n\n\"They weaponized the Civil Rights Movement and said it was a communist movement,\" Harriot said. \"I like to compare it using a metaphor as a knife. You can use a knife to butter bread to feed yourself, but someone else can take it from you and use it as a weapon to hurt you. And that's kind of what's been done with 'woke.'\"\n\n\"That word has been co-opted to mean what they're afraid of,\" he continued. \"The things that they're afraid of really is progress, equality, the things that will dismantle the systems that historically and currently benefit them.\"\n\nThere was a time when \"woke\" was a warning against white supremacist danger. But now it's being used as a political weapon against the very community that coined the phrase. And that's dangerous in a brand-new way.\n\nIf your eyes aren't open to that, it might be time to wake up.\n\nTrymaine Lee is an NBC News correspondent.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Fifteen years ago, I would have said these topics could divide a small liberal arts campus, not American politics. I would have been wrong.\n\nThis change in American politics is hard to analyze. It's hard to craft clear and incisive questions on these complex and emerging topics for survey research, especially since \"woke\" is notoriously ill-defined. Last week, the conservative writer Bethany Mandel became the subject of considerable ridicule on social media after she was unable to concisely define the term in an interview. She's not the only one. Apparently, there's a \"woke\" part of the federal budget . \"Wokeness\" was even faulted for the Silicon Valley Bank collapse .\n\nBut while the definition of \"woke\" may be up for debate, there's no doubt that the term is trying to describe something about the politics of today's highly educated, young \"new\" left, especially on cultural and social issues like race, sex and gender.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "How 'Woke' Became the 'Woke Right' (and Why It Shouldn't Surprise Anyone)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSubscriber-only Newsletter\n\nBy John McWhorter\n\nOpinion Writer\n\nFor all the workout it's gotten in the past couple of years, you would be pardoned for thinking of the term \"woke\" as relatively new. Chances are you first heard it within the past 10 years and change. I did. However, seemingly novel words often turn out to have a longer history: \"Anyhoo\" may feel relatively modern but is actually attested in the United States as early as 1924 and appears in the Cole Porter song \"Where's Louie\" in 1939. \"Woke\" goes a ways back, too, and it stretches into the future, continuing to evolve in what feels like real time. The way that change unfolds has a lot to teach us about both language and our cultural moment.\n\n\"Woke\" has often been reported (including by me) as first appearing in print in 1962, in an article about \"Negro\" slang published by The Times. But my colleague Emily Berch has recently brought to my attention that in 1940 the Negro United Mine Workers, a West Virginia labor union, issued a statement that included the lines \"We were asleep. But we will stay woke from now on.\"\n\nThe blues singer Huddie Ledbetter gave us the first \"woke\" on record - pun intended - on a 1938 recording of his song \"Scottsboro Boys,\" urging us to \"stay woke.\" \"Staying woke\" meant understanding that there are larger forces operating to keep power unequally distributed in our society, disfavoring especially the poor and people of color. Genevieve Larkin, the wisenheimer social climber in the film \"Gold Diggers of 1937,\" might not have known the term, but she was getting at something similar when she said, \"It's so hard to be good under the capitalistic system!\"\n\nWhy \"woke\" rather than \"woken\"? Black English tends to collapse the past tense and the participle forms of verbs. Textbook English is present tense \"sink,\" past tense \"sank\" and participle \"sunk.\" Black English is just \"sink\" and \"sunk,\" a simplification that's been catching on more broadly for some time. (An example is in an NPR interview from a few years ago: \"Once they sunk that investment into, you know, one of these anchors, they are very reluctant to let go.\")\n\nOr think about people who have been swindled. You could say they had been taken, but one might also hear it described as having been took. \"Spoke\" can replace \"spoken\" even in natively written, formal English texts. \"James gives two more examples of patience,\" I read in a sermon from the First Presbyterian Church of Unionville. \"First, he had spoke of the farmer. Now he speaks first of the prophets, and then of a particular person, Job.\"\n\n\"Woke\" for \"woken,\" then, just follows a general pattern in how verbs seem to want to work in English.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

The viral clip , in turn, yielded an outpouring of arguments about the word itself: Can it be usefully defined? Is it just a right-wing pejorative? Is there any universally accepted label for what it's trying to describe?\n\nThe answers are yes, sometimes and unfortunately no. Of course, there is something real to be described: The revolution inside American liberalism is a crucial ideological transformation of our time. But unlike a case like \"neoconservatism,\" where a critical term was then accepted by the movement it described, our climate of ideological enmity makes settled nomenclature difficult .\n\nI personally like the term \"Great Awokening,\" which evokes the new progressivism's roots in Protestantism - but obviously secular progressives find it condescending. I appreciate how the ‌British writer Dan Hitchens acknowledges the difficulty of definitions by calling the new left-wing politics \"the Thing\" - but that's unlikely to catch on with true believing Thingitarians.\n\nSo let me try a different exercise - instead of a pithy term or definition, let me write a sketch of the \"woke\" worldview, elaborating its internal logic as if I myself believed in it. (To the incautious reader: These are not my actual beliefs. )\n\nWhat is America all about, at its best? Equality and liberty. What is the left all about, at its best? Transforming those ideals into lived realities.\n\nBut this project keeps running into limits, disappointments and defeats. Everywhere you look, terrible disparities persist. And that persistence should force us to look deeper, beyond attempts to win legal rights or redistribute wealth, to the cultural and psychological structures that perpetuate oppression before law and policy begin to play a part. This is what the terminology of the academy has long been trying to describe - the way that generations of racist, homophobic, sexist, and heteronormative power have inscribed themselves, not just on our laws but our very psyches.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Beige is out, red is in . Real fur is back. Eighties maximalism is elbowing aside '90s minimalism. Sean Monahan, a trend forecaster, calls it the \"boom boom\" aesthetic.\n\nAdmittedly, opulence is kind of the point when you are creating and selling beautiful, expensive things. But for the past decade, fashion was trying to be socially and environmentally conscious as well. However sincere the motivation - many people, especially on the creative side of fashion, share progressive values - making the world a more diverse, equitable, inclusive and sustainable place didn't always sit well with luxury, either practically or aesthetically.\n\nNow all that seems to be over, and maybe that's OK. The fashion industry had aligned with liberal-left movements leading up to and after Donald Trump's 2016 victory, but it's hard to argue that the endorsement of Kamala Harris by Vogue magazine and its editor Anna Wintour last year moved the needle for anyone. It might have even made the Democrats seem out of touch to some voters.\n\nActivism and fashion have always been an uneasy mix. Back in 2014, the designer Karl Lagerfeld staged a Chanel ready-to-wear show in Paris where models cosplayed a protest, holding signs that read, \"Women's rights are more than all right,\" \"History is her story\" and \"Make fashion, not war.\" If it felt anodyne and frivolous (it's not as if any of the signs made pointed statements about, say, abortion), Mr. Lagerfeld told the website Fashionista at the time that this was exactly the point: \"I like the idea of feminism being something lighthearted, not a truck driver for the feminist movement.\"\n\nThe next year, the New York show for Kerby Jean-Raymond's label Pyer Moss took on a far more serious tone, opening with a 12-minute film about police brutality against Black men. Family members of victims sat in front, pushing the important fashion people those seats are typically reserved for to the second or third row. They watched models walk the runway in white boots inscribed with Eric Garner's last words, \"I can't breathe.\"\n\nFashion continued advancing political messages as the 2016 election approached. That September, with Hillary Clinton running for president on the Democratic ticket, Maria Grazia Chiuri presented her debut collection for Christian Dior as its first female creative director. It featured T-shirts that read, \"We should all be feminists\" (borrowing the title of a book by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie), tucked into extravagant but by runway standards easygoing tulle skirts. You can still buy the T-shirts for $920 . You can definitely still be a feminist without owning one.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Vought, leader of the Office of Management and Budget, aims to marry extreme austerity with his Christian values.\n\nBy Tony Romm\n\nYears before President Trump returned to the White House, his budget chief, Russell T. Vought, began mapping out a plan to shrink the federal government.\n\nIn Mr. Vought's design, spending would be slashed by about $9 trillion over the next decade. Entire federal programs - from housing vouchers to student loans - would be eliminated. The government would fire thousands of civil workers, including those who investigated tax fraud. And Washington would restrict aid to the poor, requiring Americans to work in exchange for benefits.\n\nThe ideas formed the bedrock of Mr. Vought's plan to end the \"woke and weaponized\" bureaucracy, a policy guide he issued in 2022 for fellow conservatives entering a key budget battle. His full vision did not come to fruition at the time, but the roughly 100-page blueprint has taken on heightened significance since Mr. Trump won re-election - and reinstalled Mr. Vought to his perch - foreshadowing their shared aim to reel in the size and reach of government.\n\nIn the perennial fight over the federal balance sheet, few officials are more important than Mr. Vought. As head of the Office of Management and Budget, he wields vast power over the United States government, its workers and the millions of people whose lives are shaped by the ebb and flow of federal funds.\n\nMr. Vought brings an aggressive style to the job, one revealed in podcast interviews and public writings, particularly in the years after Mr. Trump's 2020 defeat. A longtime budget expert, he sketched out a vision for expansive presidential power in Project 2025, the conservative blueprint prepared by the Heritage Foundation for Mr. Trump. And in 2021, Mr. Vought founded his own organization, the Center for Renewing America, which describes itself as dedicated to \"God, country and community.\"\n\nThere, Mr. Vought refined an ambition to marry extreme fiscal austerity with Christian values, pledging to eliminate federal programs seen as too wasteful, \"woke\" or secular. In scrutinizing the budget, his approach has made him a natural ally of Elon Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

It is a boogeyman, a pejorative epithet, a cudgel used by conservatives like Mr. Douthat to strike fear in people's hearts.\n\nBut I accept his invitation to embrace the label if he agrees that the idea of being \"woke\" means being open to the fullness of truth about our shared past, present and future: the good, the bad, the ugly.\n\nWokeness, if anything, is understanding that our pluralistic, complex democracy must be open to all our voices, perspectives, stories, histories and visions of the future, even and especially those of the most marginalized. In this way, wokeness is a commitment to truth and justice as the American way.\n\nStaying asleep among the ranks of the unwoke is a choice. It may be more comfortable. It is also fundamentally undemocratic and un-American.\n\nPhilip Walsh Cape Elizabeth, Maine\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nRoss Douthat defines \"woke\" for his readers, expressing a lot of progressive hopes, desires and accomplishments. But woke certainly doesn't lend itself to an easily understood or repeatable definition. Mr. Douthat is making it much harder than it needs to be.\n\nForget all the verbal salad. Woke stresses the value and goodness of being human, emphasizing common human needs, and seeking rational ways of solving human problems. It is similar to humanism. \"Woke\" has become and should be called \"neo-humanism.\"\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Voters Tiring of the War on 'Wokeness'?\n\nTrump Administration\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nNew polling shows national Republicans and Iowa Republican caucusgoers were more interested in \"law and order\" than battling \"woke\" schools, media and corporations.\n\nBy Jonathan Weisman\n\nWhen it comes to the Republican primaries, attacks on \"wokeness\" may be losing their punch.\n\nFor Republican candidates, no word has hijacked political discourse quite like \"woke,\" a term few can define but many have used to capture what they see as left-wing views on race, gender and sexuality that have strayed far beyond the norms of American society.\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis last year used the word five times in 19 seconds , substituting \"woke\" for Nazis as he cribbed from Winston Churchill's famous vow to battle a threatened German invasion in 1940. Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor, speaks of a \"woke self-loathing\" that has swept the nation. Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina found himself backpedaling furiously after declaring that \"'woke supremacy' is as bad as white supremacy.\"\n\nThe term has become a quick way for candidates to flash their conservative credentials, but battling \"woke\" may have less political potency than they think. Though conservative voters might be irked at modern liberalism, successive New York Times/Siena College polls of Republican voters nationally and then in Iowa found that candidates were unlikely to win votes by narrowly focusing on rooting out left-wing ideology in schools, media, culture and business.\n\nInstead, Republican voters are showing a \"hands off\" libertarian streak in economics, and a clear preference for messages about \"law and order\" in the nation's cities and at its borders.\n\nThe findings hint why Mr. DeSantis, who has made his battles with \"woke\" schools and corporations central to his campaign, is struggling and again show off Mr. Trump's keen understanding of part of the Republican electorate. Campaigning in Iowa in June, Mr. Trump was blunt: \"I don't like the term 'woke,'\" he said, adding, \"It's just a term they use - half the people can't even define it, they don't know what it is.\"\n\nIt was clearly a jab at Mr. DeSantis, but The Times's polls suggest Mr. Trump may be right. Social issues like gay rights and once-obscure jargon like \"woke\" may not be having the effect many Republicans had hoped.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

It was a mash-up of the many times Spotify's star podcaster, Joe Rogan, had used a racial slur for Black people on his show. I don't need to tell you which slur it was. Unsurprisingly, the video quickly went viral, and a huge uproar ensued.\n\nRogan had already stirred up controversy by airing Covid misinformation and interviews with transphobic speakers. For Spotify, a company based in Sweden (the supposed mecca of social democracy) that serves entertainment to a largely young, socially conscious consumer base and employs a young, socially conscious work force, you'd think it would be obvious - if you were to listen to the characterization common from conservative politicians and \"heterodox\" pundits - what would happen next. The dictates of \"woke capitalism\" would surely require a ritual sacrifice of Rogan, despite the huge sums Spotify had paid to bring his show exclusively to its platform. It wouldn't matter that he was the company's No. 1 podcaster. The woke mob had spoken!\n\nNeedless to say, that's not how things went. Rogan apologized in a long Instagram video, and Spotify's response was not to pull the plug on his show and torpedo the interests of the company's shareholders. Spotify stood by its star (even as several episodes were quietly removed ). It also announced a $100 million fund to support underrepresented artists and podcasters. But, according to Bloomberg , a year later the company had spent less than 10 percent of the money.\n\nBehold, the puny power of woke capitalism!\n\nI have been thinking about this incident as I have watched ferocious campaigns building against companies that take even the most milquetoast stands on social and cultural issues, especially those involving gender and sexuality. It reached a peak last month with Pride, leaving a wake of social media videos of people outraged about things like onesies and koozies emblazoned with rainbows.\n\nThese fights won't stop with the end of Pride month. They are merely the skirmishes in what is likely to be a long culture war fueled by outrage about everything from the casting of a Black actor as Ariel in Disney's live-action remake of \"The Little Mermaid\" to investment funds including a modicum of concern about diversity and inclusion in deciding where to put their billions.\n\n\"Woke capital\" is already a major theme of the Republican presidential race. The threat is apparently so great that Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida invoked Winston Churchill's famous Dunkirk speech, substituting \"woke\" for the Axis powers as enemy No. 1: \"We will wage a war on the woke. We will fight the woke in education, we will fight the woke in the corporations, we will fight the woke in the halls of Congress.\" Vivek Ramaswamy is couching much of his campaign in the themes of his 2021 book, \"Woke, Inc.,\" an excoriation of so-called woke capitalism that is somehow to blame not just for America's social woes, but its economic problems, too.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "White People Are Using \"Woke\" Wrong-on Both Sides of the Aisle\n\nThe word woke is all over our phones, our TV screens, and even the campaign trail, but do people actually know what it means? On Saturday's episode of ICYMI , Slate's podcast about internet culture, co-hosts Rachelle Hampton and Madison Malone Kircher-building on the work of journalists like Vox's Aja Romano -explained how the earliest usages of woke date back to the early 20th century and the idea of Black people \"keeping their eyes open\" to the realities of white supremacist violence. \"Stay woke\" continued as a warning call to other Black Americans through the music of people like Erykah Badu and Childish Gambino, and as a rallying cry through the Ferguson protests, until it started to enter mainstream and lose its original meaning. In this transcript, which has been edited and condensed for clarity, they discuss how white people on both the left and the right developed a misunderstanding of the word woke and spread that version online-and how the same thing is now happening with \"critical race theory.\"\n\nRachelle Hampton: How do we get from the way Lead Belly was using \"stay woke\" in 1931--which is this call to action--to woke as this incoherent political ideology? None other than Saturday Night Live . SNL did a skit in 2017, which was just a year after Childish Gambino's \"Redbone\" came out, and a few years post-Ferguson. SNL decides to lampoon the idea of woke with this sketch called \"Levi's Wokes.\"\n\nThis sketch very accurately sums up what mainstream white society thinks of people who use woke . It's a superficial focus on speaking the right language, and that's it. No connection at all to the actual \"work.\" It's this way to hold the moral high ground just by speaking the right words and saying the right words. To be clear, there is a way social media has accelerated what's happened to woke , and I think the \"Levi's Woke\" sketch is trying to get at this very real dynamic playing out online. Some people might refer to it as \"virtue signaling,\" and that's because social media is inherently performative.\n\nBut social media is also the place where most white people interact with Black cultural production. Since most white people don't have Black friends (there was a 2014 study that said that three-fourths of white people have zero Black friends), if the only place you're seeing Black vernacular is online, you're going to miss most of it because a lot of language in general is contextual and non-verbal. If the only way you're seeing \"woke\" is online, you're going to see it as describing a set of easily repeated behaviors rather than as a way of moving through the world.\n\nMadison Malone Kircher : Right, and if you're only seeing it online as a white person on the internet, it'll be contextualized by the spaces that you frequent, so you're getting the usage of the word woke twice, three-times, four-times removed.\n\nHampton : Exactly. Once content filters up to the top level of popularity, it's generally about six-degrees-removed from its actual creators. And so, you might be seeing something that you may not have otherwise had access to because you don't have any Black people in your life, but that doesn't mean you know what the fuck you're talking about. And it doesn't mean that seeing Buzzfeed calling Hasan Piker or Matt McGorry \"woke bae,\" is the way that we should be using the word woke. What you get from this constant divorcing and decontextualizing of the word woke is this idea that wokeness is a thing that you can aspire towards. Not only aspire towards, but achieve.\n\nYou get this kind of gross performance of racial consciousness that's all posture. In this way, woke basically becomes empty on both sides of the white people aisle: You get white Liberals who think by doing a Pepsi commercial that appropriates protest imagery that they are \"woke,\" and that there's this way to acquire woke points. This side is annoying and actively harmful in a few different ways, but the other side smells a little bit like fascism. Around 2017 or 2018, this is when we start to get white people turning against the word. And not just turning against it, but turning against the idea of it. Because, again, there is no coherent political ideology behind the word woke and there never has been.\n\nBut also, the people who are using \"wokeness\" to capture all these disparate political things happening are mostly writers who should have the ability to tease out what exactly they're talking about. But it is extremely convenient from a culture-war perspective, to be able to use a word like woke to signal at approximately seven different things. Then, there's also just the disingenuousness of it all. When you say that \"wokeness\" is a political ideology, you're not talking about anything. You're talking about people who talk about race. And that just immediately brands them as a member of the wokerati.\n\nThe best of movies, TV, books, music, and more, delivered to your inbox.\n\nKircher : I get hung up on the idea that the people lobbing this around in bad faith are also basically being willfully obtuse to the fact that it's an unattainable state of being. No one is asking anyone to be perfect-to espouse flawless ideology on everything, to have a working understanding of gender, and race, and sex theory at all times. You could still be \"woke\" if you ascribe to how that word works on Twitter in 2021. You could still be woke and say the wrong thing sometimes.\n\nHampton : In fact, you probably will. That is how learning and being in the world works. You're going to fuck up at some point. But obviously the cancel culture cabal has fully glommed on to woke and turned it into this catch-all phrase that gives people a hazy understanding of what you're gesturing at. It is bad for language, perhaps bad for democracy, and definitely bad for the culture wars-the new frontier of which is critical race theory, which is going through the same turn that woke already went through.\n\nKircher : And when you say going through the same turn, you mean being reinterpreted and diluted into a toothless, meaningless set of phonemes?\n\nHampton : Yeah. I mean, no one knows what the fuck they're talking about when they're talking about critical race theory, besides the fact that someone is talking about race. Every kind of discourse about race is now being termed \"critical race theory,\" and critical race theory is unequivocally bad in the modern conservative imagination, as is anything that is termed \"woke.\" Now, we're stuck talking about what the fuck \"wokeness\" means in 2021, when we should have never been here.\n\nFor more, subscribe to ICYMI .\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Supreme Court Just Dealt a Major Blow to Corporate Mandates\n\nThis is part of Opinionpalooza , Slate's coverage of the major decisions from the Supreme Court this June. We're working to change the way the media covers the Supreme Court. Sign up for the pop-up newsletter to receive our latest updates, and support our work when you join Slate Plus .\n\nOn Thursday, the Supreme Court subtly transformed the rights of religious workers in America. Under the guise of \"clarifying\" a nearly 50-year-old precedent, the court held that companies are guilty of discrimination unless they accommodate employees from any policies that burden their religious practices. A company can still defend itself by showing that an accommodation would impose an \"undue hardship,\" but the court has made it more difficult to meet that standard. The result is likely to be a wave of litigation, with employees, especially those with conservative religious beliefs, suing their employers to block corporate policies that they disagree with.\n\nThe court's decision might look like a win for workers' rights, but it's really part of a broader strategy within a conservative legal movement that has soured on corporate America. As private actors, for-profit businesses aren't constrained by constitutional rights like the freedom of speech and free exercise of religion under the First Amendment. In many states, a company can fire you for refusing to complete diversity training, to treat LGBTQ+ coworkers and customers with respect, to get vaccinated, and other conduct that some religious conservatives find intolerable.\n\nLegal conservatives had begun to argue that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the federal law prohibiting employment discrimination, gives workers powerful rights to be exempt from company policies that conflict with their religious beliefs. But until today, conservatives faced a legal obstacle. In 1977, the court interpreted Title VII's prohibition on religious discrimination narrowly. In TWA v. Hardison , Larry Hardison asked his employer, the airline TWA, for a religious accommodation allowing him to take off from work on Saturdays to observe the Sabbath. The court denied Hardison's claim, holding that any accommodation that imposed more than a \"de minimis\" cost on an employer amounted to an \"undue hardship\" under Title VII. In practice, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and many lower courts held employers to a higher standard, giving employees access to reasonable accommodations, but not the even-more-stringent standard conservatives now seek.\n\nFast-forward 46 years, and the court is relitigating its decision in Hardison . In Groff v. DeJoy , a postal worker objected to working on Sunday and demanded to have that day off for religious observance. This time, all the justices agree that \"undue hardship\" means something more than \"de minimis\" burdens. Rather than explicitly overrule Hardison , the court now says what \"undue hardship\" really means is that employers must grant religious accommodations unless they can show \"substantial increased costs\" to their business.\n\nWhat counts as \"substantial increased costs\"? The court doesn't say, but the justices' unanimity on that standard masks serious disagreements about the kinds of workplace policies that can satisfy it. At least initially, those disagreements will be worked out in lower courts, some of which have aggressively applied federal law to privilege conservative religious interests in the workplace. And those courts will be encouraged by Groff 's dicta that Title VII \"gives [religious practices] favored treatment,\" rather than requiring \"mere neutrality.\"\n\nAlthough the issue in Groff is sympathetic-no one objects to giving workers a reasonable accommodation to observe their Sabbath-Justice Alito's opinion for the court invites more controversial cases and provides little guidance about how to resolve them. Employees have previously asserted a right to workplace proselytization and to condemn diversity and inclusion efforts (and their co-workers' behavior). We've seen cases involving refusal to work with women and intentional misgendering of fellow employees . Groff is likely to boost an already robust anti-vaccine campaign, giving health care workers and other employees a legal weapon against ordinary vaccine requirements. As has become typical in the Supreme Court, motivated lower court judges seem likely to ignore the burdens on faceless co-workers and managers-and their families-who will bear the brunt of these accommodations, suffering imposition of religion, sexist behavior, and preventable illnesses.\n\nEven as the rights of religious employees expand, another conservative strategy for pushing back on so-called \"woke\" corporations seeks to allow religious employers to impose their religious views on employees and customers who don't share them. The court has already produced two blockbusters in this series. First, it held that Hobby Lobby was entitled to exercise its corporate conscience to deny insurance coverage for contraceptives. And then the court allowed Masterpiece Cakeshop to turn away same-sex couples looking for wedding cakes. On Friday, the court made it a trilogy by declaring that 303 Creative , a web design company, has a free speech right under the First Amendment to refuse service for same-sex weddings.\n\nBut the case with the most explosive potential was decided just last week by a federal court of appeals. In Braidwood Management Inc. v. EEOC , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5 th Circuit held that a for-profit management services company has a free-exercise right under the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) to fire employees based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. You might have thought that the same federal law, Title VII, that protects the religious postal worker in Groff would also protect LGBTQ+ employees of companies like Braidwood Management. But it turns out that, at least in the 5 th Circuit, Title VII only protects you if your employer doesn't raise religious objections to who you love or how you dress.\n\nCritics of the Supreme Court sometimes say that the justices are pro-business. But when it comes to religion, that isn't quite right. They are pro-business when companies are defending the views of religious conservatives, and they are pro-worker when employees are defending the views of religious conservatives. The common theme-and the underlying strategy-is to privilege the rights of religious conservatives over the rights of others. If a religious company objects to the reproductive rights of its employees, it will find help in the Supreme Court. And if religious employees object to the policies of progressive employers, they know where to turn. But progressive religious employees are unlikely to find help from the courts. And companies with policies of diversity and inclusion or public health promotion will see lawsuits seeking to limit their policies and rights whenever religious conservatives disagree with them. (See also the Supreme Court's other big decision on Thursday in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard and SFFA v. University of North Carolina to ignore the amicus brief pleas of 74 major American corporations-including some of the most blue-chip companies in the country-that the court not do away with affirmative action in higher education.)\n\nConservatives often defend religious exemptions in the workplace as promoting pluralism. In some cases, there are good reasons to grant accommodations. But together, Groff , Hobby Lobby , and Braidwood diminish pluralism by establishing a particular brand of corporate religion . In the hands of this Supreme Court, federal laws-Title VII, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and the First Amendment-favor the religious and moral views of some employers and employees over others and enable them to impose their beliefs throughout the economy. The result isn't so much a loss for big business, but a win for conservative religion.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "What Critics of the \"Woke\" Army Don't Understand\n\nThe Army has recently come under attack by congressional Republicans for committing the crime of being too \"woke.\" The prosecution's exhibit A, waved at a House hearing last week, is a course taught at West Point-the Army's military academy-called \"The Politics of Race, Gender, Class, and Sexuality.\" Also noted, in ominous tones, was a recent daylong stand-down of all Army personnel to discuss white supremacy and extremism within the ranks.\n\nIs this, critics on Capitol Hill and Fox News have asked, what our fighting men and women should be thinking about? If they're taught about racial disparities, won't they cease to regard one another as equals on the battlefield?\n\nHere are some important facts to keep in mind. First, West Point has had a social science department since just after World War II, when senior Army officers realized that military leaders would have to know more about politics, society, and history to function in an expansive, democratic America. Requiring cadets to take some social sciences courses, and even creating a \"Sosh\" major, did not detract from their military drills and training.\n\nSecond, the course at West Point on race, gender, class, and sexuality was created and incorporated into the curriculum in 1999-long before \"woke\" or \"critical race theory\" became buzzwords. It was proposed and designed by a professor of foreign policy at the time, Maj. Isaiah Wilson, who went on to rank first in his class at the Army's Command and General Staff College, was hired by Gen. David Petraeus to be his chief of plans during the Iraq war, and is now president of the Joint Special Operations University. In other words, he's no softie. The professor teaching the course now, a civilian named Rachel Yon, took it over from Wilson in 2012-again, predating the kerfuffle over wokeness and CRT. (Yon was one of Wilson's professors at West Point when he was a student in the '90s; in other words, she's not a fashionable hire.)\n\nThird, Wilson thought it was important to teach such a class at West Point because, like many American institutions, the Army has never been a mainstay of racial or gender equality-and, as more Blacks and women rose through the ranks, the presence of prejudice was emerging as an issue, so the rank and file should at least be aware of it. (Wilson himself is African American.)\n\nNor has the issue vanished in the last 22 years. Senior officers have recently expressed alarm over the finding that many members of white-supremacist militias were once (or still are) in the armed forces. In response, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin appointed a commission to explore how to root out extremism . The daylong shutdown to discuss the problem-which critics have also complained about-was part of the campaign.\n\nA pivotal shift in the open acknowledgment of the problem-and even of a systematic racial bias within the Army and within West Point-came just last year, during the protests over the police murder of George Floyd. These protests coincided with a bourgeoning movement to change the names of 10 Army bases, all in southern states, that bore the names of slaveholding Confederate generals.\n\nIn an article in the Atlantic almost exactly a year ago, Petraeus wrote that, in his years as an active-duty officer, often stationed at those bases,\n\nI never thought much about these men-about the nature of their service during the Civil War. Nor did I think about the message those names sent to the many African Americans serving on these installations-messages that should have been noted by all of us.\n\nNor, when he was a cadet and later a professor at West Point, did Petraeus question the veneration on display toward Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, who was a great commander but also-like all the other Confederate officers-guilty of treason. \"We were not encouraged to think about the cause for which\" Lee had fought, he wrote, \"at least not in our military history classes.\"\n\nPetraeus told me that it was only after he retired from the Army, in 2011, that he \"started thinking about how strange it was that the leaders of the fight against the Union were more widely honored-with their names on federal forts, roads, barracks, gates, housing areas, etc.-than were those who fought for the country.\" These thoughts deepened as he read several biographies of Pres. Ulysses S. Grant, the Union Army commander and later two-term president, who was honored hardly at all either at West Point or at Army bases. Petraeus said that he had \"been mulling for some time\" that the Army should publicly address this dishonor. \"The events of recent weeks,\" he said, referring to the Floyd murder and the subsequent protests, \"were the catalyst\" to writing his Atlantic essay.\n\nThat brings us to Secretary Austin and to Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who were both slammed by congressional Republicans at a House Armed Services Committee hearing last week. Florida Reps. Matt Gaetz and Michael Waltz, the latter a former Army Green Beret, led the charge, citing cadets and their parents who were disturbed by the stand-down to discuss extremism and the divisiveness of classes on race.\n\n\"Thanks for your anecdotal input,\" Austin replied . \"I have gotten 10 times that amount of input, 50 times that amount of input, on the other side that has said, 'Hey, we're glad to have had the ability to have a conversation with ourselves and with our leadership.'\"\n\nMilley dug in deeper. \"I want to understand white rage-and I'm white,\" he said. \"What is it that caused thousands of people to assault this building and try to overturn the Constitution of the United States of America. I've read Mao Zedong. I've read Karl Marx. I've read Lenin. That doesn't make me a communist. So what is wrong with understanding, having some situational understanding about the country which we are here to defend?\"\n\nA few things are worth noting here, as well.\n\nFirst, nether Austin nor Milley would like to be dealing with these sorts of issues. Both have commanded troops in battle. (Austin is a retired four-star Army general.) Milley graduated from Princeton and holds an M.A. in international relations from Columbia, but, a retired officer who knows him told me, \"he likes to portray himself as a guy who got to Princeton by being a hockey player and proceeded to be part of the bottom half of the class that helped the top half achieve what they did.\" Still, they see that race and gender are not merely social issues but national-security issues and that dealing with these thorny problems is part of their jobs.\n\nSecond, their critics, most of whom had never heard of critical race theory a year ago and couldn't define it now, are simply using the debate as a way to score points against Democrats-and, in some cases, to shove race, including suppression of Black voters in elections, off the table as a valid issue.\n\nHowever, third, the critics do have a point. In various institutions, CRT has been distorted beyond all recognition by both sides of the debate; race as a determinative issue has been overstated and has sharpened social tensions. One retired senior Army officer, who asked not to be identified, not wanting to become a part of this debate, told me,\n\nAs a general proposition, I am concerned that, over the years, the military has devoted an inordinate amount of time/attention to social issues of the day and a variety of topics not related to preparation for operations. That said, if we screw up these issues-as we have from time to time-then the aftermath can distract enormously as well... So, it's tough to get the right balance.\n\nIt would be good to have a substantive debate on this issue, but that's become hard, if not impossible, now that it's devolved into a tool of partisan warfare.\n\nMilley and other officers like him have been trained to avoid partisan fights for as long as they're in uniform (and even beyond). But they're not the ones who are indulging in politics. They know the history. In the late 1940s, racial integration of the troops was denounced by many as turning the military into a social experiment, to the detriment of national security. In more recent years, similar objections have been filed against letting women and openly declared gays join the military. In all these cases, the flaps have passed; the inclusion of the once-excluded has become normal-and the nation is still secure (or, to the extent it isn't, our lapses have nothing to do with the presence of Black or gay servicemen and servicewomen).\n\nMilley has his own experience in political exploitation. Last July, he followed President Trump from the White House to Lafayette Square, not knowing that he was being used in a photo-op to legitimize the tear-gassing of protesters just minutes earlier. He soon apologized for his presence and gradually began moving away from Trump's orbit, taking his duties as an independent military adviser more properly. The whole incident has no doubt shaped his actions since-and led him to shed any shyness in firing back at politically motivated attacks from congressmen.\n\nThere is another bit of history that the congressional Republicans should keep in mind. Sen. Joe McCarthy's anti-communist crusade collapsed when he went a bridge too far and accused several Army war heroes of Red treason. In 1954, the defense lawyer for one of the accused soldiers, finally said from the witness stand, \"Senator, may we not drop this?... Have you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, have you left no sense of decency?\" Not long after, McCarthy was censured by his once-cowed Senate colleagues.\n\nToday's congress has long abandoned a great deal of decency on many grounds. Nor do military officers enjoy the same presumptive respect that they once did, in part perhaps because fewer members of Congress-fewer Americans generally-have ever served. (Donald Trump not only suffered no political damage, but still won the election, after deriding John McCain's record as a war hero.) Still, there probably are limits to how far Republicans can go in yelling at decorated generals, or using the military as a prop in their attacks on Democrats. Those limits probably haven't yet been reached; there's more shouting to come.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "In Defense of the New \"Woke\" Scrabble\n\nWell, that's it: They made Scrabble woke. Conservative news outlets have been making a meal the past few days of the news that Mattel is introducing \"Scrabble Together ,\" a cooperative variation on the classic word-making game designed to be more \"accessible\" and \"inclusive\" for younger players. \"Mattel Creates Scrabble Without Scoring for Gen Z,\" declared Newsmax. \"Scrabble is dumbing itself down for the woke,\" Jeanine Pirro proclaimed on Fox News , over a chyron reading \"SCRABBLE FOR SNOWFLAKES.\" Even the New York Times ran a piece claiming, \"Will Classic Scrabble devotees object? You bet\"-although the only actual competitive Scrabble player quoted in the piece sees \"nothing wrong with allowing non-word people to have more fun with the game.\"\n\nWhile it seemed possible to me that Mattel had dumbed down Scrabble for the benefit of phone-addicted, oversensitive Zoomers, I thought I should try it out before I reached any firm conclusions. Having now played Scrabble Together-Mattel shipped me a sample-it turns out that it is a perfectly fun variation on Scrabble that might indeed appeal to some young players, and probably does not presage the end of Western civilization.\n\nI sat down to play Scrabble Together with my teenage daughter, an actual Gen Z person who had not played Scrabble before, and my wife, a person my age who is so good at Scrabble due to playing the app that I refuse to compete with her anymore. Scrabble Together uses the same tiles and a similar board as traditional Scrabble, but the game works cooperatively rather than competitively: Instead of scoring points for each word and trying to defeat the other players, you're working together with them to achieve goals. If you can succeed at all 20 goals without getting stuck, you all win; if not, you all lose.\n\nWe began on a pretty good roll, knocking out a bunch of simple goals (\"Play a three-letter word,\" \"Play a word containing at least two different vowels\"). When it's your turn, you play a word as you ordinarily would in Scrabble-but it must fulfill the task on one of the Goal Cards face up on the table. Instead of scoring your word, you turn over the goal card you've accomplished and everyone says, \"Great job, Dan.\"\n\nEventually, as sometimes happens in Scrabble, I ended up with a rack full of consonants, which made fulfilling any of the goals impossible. For such moments, the game offers six \"Helper Cards,\" \"little powerups,\" as the rule sheet describes them, which give a player a momentary assist. Mine allowed me to draw an extra tile, which thankfully was a vowel, so I played a word and we moved along.\n\nMy daughter asked why I needed her to play this game for work. \"Supposedly it's being marketed to Gen Z, because it's less competitive and more cooperative,\" I said, and she delivered an eye-roll that would have not seemed out of place on the face of Gen X heroine Janeane Garofalo. \"I don't think that's Gen Z,\" she said. \"I just think that's something people like.\" And indeed, she's right that cooperative games-despite the claims of Fox News' Greg Gutfeld that \"playing a game without scoring is anti-human\"-are in fact very popular these days with players of all ages. Even the most popular competitive board game of the past few years, Wingspan , doesn't feel particularly cut-throat, and rewards players for taking actions that help everyone at the table. As Wingspan really is about \"enjoying your birds,\" as its creator, Elizabeth Hargrave, told me, Scrabble Together is really about enjoying your words.\n\nDespite being not a member of Gen Z, I had a good time cooperating with my family to succeed at these various word-making tasks. I wouldn't say Scrabble Together is that hard -we only really got stuck right at the end when our final Goal Card required me to build a seven-letter word, but then I drew a Helper Card that allowed me to trade letters with someone else, and that solved that. It's easy to come up with ways to make the game more challenging if you want: increase the number of Goal Cards, say, or even impose a minimum score for each play. I don't see the lack of scorekeeping in Scrabble Together as a problem. Where traditional Scrabble demands that you play just the right words in just the right places to maximize points, Scrabble Together really encourages you to just play whatever word works as soon as you think of it. That cuts down on a lot of boring waiting around for one player (me) to work out the perfect way to use that triple-letter score. One pleasant result: Our game only took about 20 minutes.\n\nWhat is it about Scrabble Together that so annoys the right wing? The \"wokeness\" claim, for example, makes no sense: On Fox News, Pirro seemed very focused on various additions and deletions from the official Scrabble word list, which mostly affect competitive tournament players and have nothing to do with Scrabble Together. (Indeed, Scrabble Together is not even being sold in the U.S., only in Europe and other territories, since it's not Mattel that possesses the North American license but Hasbro.) The real issue with the game is that it feeds their belief that Gen Zers are soft, weak \"snowflakes\" who need everything handed to them on a platter. They could never handle real Scrabble, they say-they barely know how to look up from their phones!\n\nInstead, I think it's pretty likely that Scrabble Together-rather than somehow endangering \"real\" Scrabble-will serve as the gateway for young people that Mattel hopes it will. They'll master the relatively easy Scrabble Together, and then be inspired to try out Classic Scrabble. (Great news: Not only is Mattel not incinerating every copy of the regular game while dancing around the bonfire chanting they/them pronouns, they're printing Classic Scrabble right on the other side of Scrabble Together's board!) After all, the board game market is blowing up across age groups, though it can be hard to convince any young person that the games of her parents are worth her while. \"Scrabble's pretty old,\" my daughter pointed out. \"I'm sure it was fun when it was brand new, and people were like, 'Oh my God, Scrabble ,' in the 1900s or whatever.\" Did I wither away into a husk upon hearing these words? Yes. But was I happy to have played Scrabble with my teenager for the first time ever? I sure was.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC. All rights reserved."

      "text": "I Asked \"the Woman Who Couldn't Define Woke\" the Same Question Last Year\n\n\"This is gonna be one of those moments that goes viral,\" Bethany Mandel said fatefully this week on Rising , the Hill's daily news show. She was discussing a new book she had co-authored, Stolen Youth , published by the Daily Wire's books imprint, which purports to expose the \"woke agenda\" employed by the left to make kids miserable. But Mandel seemed blindsided when co-host Briahna Joy Gray asked her to explain the term Mandel uses over and over again: \"What does that mean to you? Would you mind defining woke ?\"\n\nMandel fumbled. \" Woke is sort of the idea that, um,\" she says, before stumbling more. The clip is uncomfortable, and naturally it was posted everywhere.\n\nLOL: Briahna Joy Gray BREAKS the brain of Rising guest  Bethany Mandel by asking her to define \"wokeness\" pic.twitter.com/uwRSSH0LaM\n\nWhile many reveled in the moment, others suggested that the reaction was \"kind of gross\" for what was just a stumble on television . As it happens, I spoke to Mandel a few months ago for another story I was reporting, and she hesitated then too:\n\nAymann Ismail: What do you mean by wokeness ?\n\nBethany Mandel: So, in terms of children, it's the idea of turning them-I think my best example is the board book Antiracist Baby , and it is ... hold on. I have it. I have the text somewhere. The idea that you cannot be neutral, that this is a fundamental reshaping of our society. In the lens of anti-racism, in the lens of sexuality, that is not what we've traditionally thought. It's the idea that we're trying to turn our kids into modern warriors in these political battles about CRT and about sexuality and climate change and all of these things.\n\nMandel said on Rising that she and her co-author spend an entire chapter of their book defining the term woke , and, based on the answer she gave me and the show, I might suggest that that's part of the problem. I reached Mandel again on Wednesday, after she tweeted the rough interview herself. \"I had an idiotic flub. It was just a stupid moment,\" she said. \"You know how you see something happening from outside of your body? Like 'This is-why am I doing this? This is terrible!' It was that. But on camera.\" She added, \"My husband made this comparison. You know that GIF of the monkey sticking its finger up its butt and smelling it ? Every day, there's that person on the internet. And today it's me.\"\n\nFor a story last year, I interviewed Mandel at length about Heroes of Liberty , a series of children's books that offer stories about conservative American icons through an \"anti-woke lens.\" I thought it was worth taking a look at what she really believes outside of a \"15-second sound bite,\" as she said on the show. Her longer answers, to me, were more revealing. Our interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nIsmail: What sprung the idea for Heroes for Liberty ?\n\nMandel: If you walk into anywhere where there are modern books, a bookstore or library or whatever-my last count was there are 27 different children's books about Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Fine. I mean, we own one, and my daughter loves it. But in addition to those books, which my kids love, I wanted a book about Amy Coney Barrett. And it doesn't exist. It's frustrating that you look at what's available in like the Scholastic Who Was series, there's a Who Was Che Guevara? and a Who Was Fidel Castro? But it's hard to find well-written books like Who Was Ronald Reagan?\n\nHow did you get to publishing books?\n\nWe're capitalists, and we wanna make money. [ Laughs. ] We home-school, and the philosophy that we follow is very literature-based. And so I'm in a lot of kids books Instagram and Facebook groups. I just noticed that people were really frustrated. Like, \"I want a book about Winston Churchill because we're talking about World War II.\" Winston Churchill is one of my personal heroes, and I think he's a hero of a lot of folks of my political persuasion, and there's not many children's books about him.\n\nI just looked up the Who Was series, and there is one for Winston Churchill.\n\nIs it still in print?\n\nPaperback. Printed in 2015. It's on Amazon for $5.89.\n\nOh, that's wonderful. I don't love the Who Was books that we've gotten, because there are gratuitous swipes at some folks. I think we have one about Alexander Hamilton, or was it George Washington? And they're just really poorly done.\n\nWhat are some examples of those swipes? For Churchill, what would be considered a swipe? What parts of his legacy should be off limits?\n\nI don't know what they would swipe him about. But I just don't trust that Scholastic would be the most generous with a figure like Churchill. Like, are they gonna call him a drunk? They're just gonna be sort of nasty and sow the seeds, like, \"This person was OK, except he was an alcoholic and used to make his secretary talk to him while he was in the bathtub\" and have a cartoon view of who he was instead of this towering hero of freedom in world history. It's the same with Frederick Douglass. You read about Frederick, and you're like, \"Oh, he was actually a piece of shit.\" Same with Benjamin Franklin. Everyone in history is kind of a giant piece of shit. It's just the truth, but it's just not necessary. A lot of these fights are about the innocence of children and violating that innocence and making kids grow up too fast and saddling them with the problems of the world way too early.\n\nHow do you decide what to keep in a book and what to filter out?\n\nOne of the first books that we did was about Alexander Hamilton. We're of the mind that we're not conservative but wholesome. We understand our role is to tell a story and not to take on more than we think is our appropriate place in telling a story to a child. And so, for Alexander Hamilton, we didn't talk about his out-of-wedlock birth. We didn't talk about his infidelity. We try to talk about a character in American history in a way that we would feel comfortable reading that story to our children. We tried to tread as lightly as we could about his childhood because it was incredibly tragic. I hear from a lot of parents that, especially in these social media groups, like, \"my kid was adopted out of foster care. They've had a lot of trauma,\" these individual stories that you might not necessarily think of because they're not your experience, but there's a lot of kids out there who have a lot of trauma that we try to keep in mind. We try to be more gentle and more sensitive to make it a book that we felt a bigger swath of parents would feel comfortable reading to their children.\n\nAs Heroes of Liberty was born, Johnny the Walrus , by Matt Walsh, became a huge Amazon bestseller. Ben Carson wrote a children's book. There's Conservakids , Brave Books , Tuttle Twins ...\n\nI think everyone saw the same hole in the market that we did at the same time. The industry of publishing on the children's side is extremely ideological in one direction. And I think that lots of folks saw a market opportunity the same way we did. And it's just that simple. Tuttle Twins is the original-they've been around for several years. We didn't know about Brave Books or Conservakids . Theoretically, we're all after the same market share, but we all know each other; we're all friendly.\n\nYou must see that at the same time you say you don't want to use kids as child soldiers in this culture war, Tuttle Twins doesn't hide that it's essentially conditioning kids into becoming culture warriors.\n\nI've read Tuttle Twins to my kids, and we've had really good conversations about them. The nice thing about a book that you're reading to your kids is that you can disagree with the book. You can take a pause and say, \"Oh, I personally I don't love that.\" You can debate it with your kids and you can have a conversation.\n\nSome of the Tuttle Twins are over my head; some of them are fantastic. They have an education book that was, like, really, really great. The book is called Education Vacation , and it's about a family deciding to home-school and taking school on the road, going to Europe, thinking about education in a different way. I love that. I don't think it's indoctrination. I think that they're introducing topics and conversations. And for the Tuttle Twins products that get a little bit older, there is a little bit more of that. But I don't think it's like indoctrination.\n\nOn one of the pages from Tuttle Twins' Education Vacation , there's a portrayal of public school as a conveyor belt where kids are being literally factory-brainwashed. Is that a good lesson to teach kids? How do you balance that with wanting to be sensitive toward kids with trauma?\n\nI don't think that that's the message of Education Vacation . It's not how my kids saw it, and it's not how we explained it. It's not like shoving information. It's the conveyor belt system of education. That's really what that book talks about. It treats the modern-day compulsory education as a conveyor belt and kids are cogs in a machine, not individuals.\n\nThe kids are gagged. There's a machine vacuuming a kid's mind out of their head.\n\nIt's a hit against the idea that everyone is the same and we're all on a conveyor belt and we all go from point A to point B. It's a very one-size-fits-all system. The modern education system does feel a lot like a conveyor belt. I mean, speaking to someone who went to public school, everyone learns the same way and everyone uses the same textbook. I had that conversation with my kids. There is brainwashing in the system. But I didn't talk about that with my 8-year-old. I just say, \"Your brain and your brother's brain are different, and the school system would not treat you as different. You would be learning the exact same things the exact same way.\"\n\nCan you tell me about the \" woketopus \"?\n\nIt's basically a campaign that we tried to do that didn't really land super well, because it was trying to draw parents' attention to wokeness in Scholastic books. I have an entire box of Scholastic books in my library room in a box. The content is disturbing. There's a book written for kids 8 and up that talks about puberty blockers and being born in the wrong body and finding pornographic magazines behind their dad's bed. It was called Melissa , but now it's called George . [ It's the other way around. ] It's by a writer named Alex Gino. My friend's kid was recommended this book in her school library by the librarian. It goes back to this whole idea that we're introducing topics that are just not appropriate and not the place of a book or a librarian to introduce to an 8-year-old or a whatever-year-old. Because there's a lot of really sexualized and highly politicized content in Scholastic books that I don't think parents realize. And I think they're starting to realize it, and that's why we're getting more successful and there are alternative book fair companies emerging to counter Scholastic Book Fairs because I think parents are starting to recognize what's going on at Scholastic. It's a powerhouse, and the content that they're publishing is not content that I think more than half of American parents are comfortable with their kids reading.\n\nSo if the solution is more books, what is your position on books like that? Do you believe there should be a rope around them?\n\nI don't think there should be a little rope around it. Because then it's like, \"Don't press the red button!\" But I do think that for parents, when you check out a book at a library or if your kid checks out a book, parents should get an email: These are the books that your kids checked out at the school library. And there's a little ding that pops up with you to check it out of your public library. FYI, other parents have objected to this content on these grounds-if that's fine by you, that's fine. But this has been an issue for other parents, and we just want, you know, full disclosure. We want you to enjoy this product and not feel like you're being hoodwinked. My daughter took out a book in November, and it was a graphic novel about girl soccer players. But there's a scene in it that I don't find appropriate between two girls at a sleepover where they're exploring their feelings about each other. And totally outside of the sexuality stuff, which I don't personally have an issue with, but lots of other parents would. And I think that's totally valid. I don't want my kids to think that they can go explore their sexuality at a sleepover. Bottom line-not appropriate for my 8-year-old to get that idea put in her brain. And I only realized that, thank God, before she read it, because other parents had told me that their kids read it. It would've been nice if, when we took that out, on the checkout screen, for there to be a little ding and say, \"Other patrons have expressed concerns about page 37.\"\n\nI think a lot of the anger that parents are feeling about all of this is that we feel that they're trying to do this behind our backs. They think they know what kids need to be exposed to better than we do. And so they're trying to sneak it in. And that duplicity is animating a lot of our distrust.\n\nI've been trying to cut to, like, the animating force here, and I think that distrust is at the heart of it. But there's something else, this idea of \"wokeness\" and \"woke\" vs. \"anti-woke.\" And I think people on each side use the word differently. In the spirit of just getting on the same page, what do you mean by wokeness ?\n\nSo, in terms of children, it's the idea of turning them-I think my best example is the board book Antiracist Baby , and it is ... hold on. I have it. I have the text somewhere. The idea that you cannot be neutral, that this is a fundamental reshaping of our society. In the lens of anti-racism, in the lens of sexuality, that is not what we've traditionally thought. It's the idea that we're trying to turn our kids into modern warriors in these political battles about CRT and about sexuality and climate change and all of these things.\n\nI feel like I have to tell you: That's not at all what wokeness means to a lot of other people-\n\nI know, but I disagree. If you read Antiracist Baby as the board book, it all sounds nice and good, except there's no such thing as neutral-you have to be actively fighting, and you have to always be aware of your racism, and you always have to be like ... This is just not something that kids need to be doing.\n\nWhy not?\n\nGo play on the playground. They will have their entire lives to talk about these things. But when you make kids so hyper-aware of race, they're not gonna see their friends as individuals. They're gonna see them as Black or white. And I think that's more racist.\n\nI experienced racism on the playground as a kid. And I'm not convinced other kids know they're being racist or even have a good understanding of it. So, isn't a \"neutral\" position on racism also making room for racism? I don't believe that's healthier for the mind of a nonwhite kid. When kids called me a \"terrorist\" as a joke and everyone laughed, that left a lasting impression on me, making me embarrassed by my own family. So while we're talking about protecting kids from racism, I want you to explain how being neutral protects nonwhite kids from racism.\n\nThe kid who called you a terrorist on the playground, their parents aren't reading their kids Antiracist Baby . It's just not a concern for those parents. There are healthy ways to talk about race for all sides. And for me, as a white parent, I don't want my kids to see people as Black or white and I don't want them to see themselves-this is like talking about the American expansion with Native Americans-I don't want my kids to feel like they're responsible for the evils that white Europeans committed in South Dakota. They're not responsible. I don't want them to carry that guilt with them, because it's not theirs to carry. That's the difference here. These differences exist, and these evils exist. And for folks on my side of the aisle, it doesn't mean that an 8-year-old has to atone for them. And I think that that's a difference of opinion between these sides.\n\nI don't know if any side is saying that babies or kids need to atone for that.\n\nWhen you tell kids that they're always racist, even when they don't realize it-in Antiracist Baby , it's, like, No. 8: Everyone does racist or not racist things. And we always have to be aware of them and call it out. It's basically like the idea of communism.\n\nIt's hard for us to discuss terms like wokeness because there seems to be such a wide disparity in what people mean when they say it.\n\nI think that people see it in different ways. I see it as an insidious thing that's happening in America, and other people see it as, um-\n\nAn answer to something that's insidious in America.\n\nCorrect.\n\nYou say you hear that parents in general believe that the pendulum has swung too far. Is the anti-wokeness movement, and the overall production of so many right-leaning books, swinging the pendulum back too far?\n\nWe try not to categorize ourselves that way. We want to see ourselves as more wholesome. But also, our main book of the month was Rush Limbaugh. So, is that characterization necessarily like totally accurate? Obviously not. I'm just being totally honest. We see a hole in the market and I personally think every kid should know who Rush Limbaugh was because he was a very important person in our national discourse and our national dialogue in the media. And you can treat him as Che Guevara, like a saint. I just think it's important for every kid in America to know who someone like Rush Limbaugh was.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Republican War on \"Woke Capitalism\" Is Really Just a War on Capitalism\n\nESG investors worry that unchecked climate change is a threat to human existence. The GOP appears to worry that unchecked ESG investors are a threat to Republican existence. Both sides are right.\n\nESG criteria (for \"environmental, social, and governance\") are a set of standards for public companies' actions that investors use to guide where they put their money. (These criteria could include committing to reduce carbon emissions by a certain percentage by a specific date, allowing employees work-at-home flexibility in light of pandemic safety and child care issues, or requiring that a minimum percentage of the board of directors be female or persons of color.) As more and more investors, large firms, and asset managers have gravitated toward ESG positions in recent years, they have found themselves at odds with a Republican Party that used to count on these institutions as A base of support. Republicans are now striking back, which is why you hear more of them railing against \"woke capitalism\" and ESG. One group recently formed a new right-wing business lobby, the American Free Enterprise Chamber of Commerce, to compete with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a long-standing supporter of mainstream Republican policies that anti-ESG activists now see as corrupted by the left. Another recent anti-ESG initiative has been to push red states to pass legislation to divest state pension fund assets from firms who follow ESG principles. For all the GOP fretting over left-wing \"cancel culture,\" the party is working very hard to cancel ESG.\n\nA typical example comes from former Vice President Mike Pence, who wrote a May 26 op-ed in the Wall Street Journal (\" Republicans Can Stop ESG Political Bias \") full of right-wing fervor. He called ESG a \"pernicious strategy\" from the \"woke left\" including \"an unelected cabal of bureaucrats\" and \"large and powerful Wall Street financiers\" who \"almost never refuse to do business with China or Russia.\" He compared ESG ratings to something from the Chinese Communist Party. He warned that far-left extremists are using ESG to impose a radical agenda and take away our freedoms. In fact, it is Pence who is trying to override the free market, where millions of investors have decided ESG is what they want.\n\nESG investing has become a global trend. The term was coined in 2005, but the concept of integrating nonfinancial considerations into investment decisions has been around for decades. ESG and its variants are also called socially responsible investing, sustainable investing, and impact investing. Since the 1960s, investors have periodically boycotted companies associated with tobacco, weapons of war, apartheid, and other \"sin stock\" issues. In recent years, scientific consensus about the threat of climate change has prompted many investors to consider environmental issues. In 2020, interest in ESG further increased as the murder of George Floyd and the pandemic highlighted racial inequality and workplace issues, and more investors decided they had their own levers to pull in order to agitate for a more just society.\n\nESG has evolved because diverse, broad-based investor groups-including pension funds, endowments, hedge funds, retail investors of all ages (but particularly millennials), investors of color, and women, among many others-have been demanding investments that are both profitable and socially responsible. Studies by Morgan Stanley and Vanguard show that investments based on ESG have either outperformed, or performed as well as, non-ESG investments. What is good for people is generally good for business.\n\nGiven the growing wave of influential ESG investors, most public companies and asset managers have incorporated ESG into their operations to meet investor demand. Incorporating ESG means implementing policies and procedures to measure and accurately disclose the firm's application of ESG principles to its business operations, workforce, and governance. For asset managers, incorporating ESG also means creating financial products that follow ESG principles, such as ESG-based investment funds. That is the free market at work. Customer demand shifts and businesses adjust their operations to meet the new demand. ESG is the product of a free market, not a cabal of pernicious financiers with international sympathies.\n\nPence's performative outrage sounds like something from a far-right radio program. In fact, conservative talk-show host Glenn Beck, who has promoted false conspiracy theories involving hedge fund manager George Soros and former President Barack Obama among others, has criticized ESG using similar arguments and language. Beck hosted a radio show on March 18, 2022, titled: \"Why are woke CEOs using ESG to DESTROY our free market?\" During the show, Beck called ESG \"the opposite of the free market. It is 21 st century fascism.\" In apparent disapproval of U.S. sanctions against Russia, he blamed the sanctions on ESG. Beck said: \"We're not the ones that-that have decided to go to war against Russia. These sanctions, these are not governmental sanctions. This is ESG.\"\n\nMuch anti-ESG ire has been directed at Larry Fink, the billionaire CEO of BlackRock. In January 2020, in his annual letter to CEOs of public companies, Fink said that BlackRock supports ESG principles and expects public companies to do the same. Since BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager, the letter gave ESG credibility. Conservatives were apoplectic. Many saw Fink as a traitor to his class. Some accused him of acting like a socialist, a strange charge against someone who built up a business handling $10 trillion in assets. His support for ESG is clever capitalism because it positions BlackRock to attract business from the growing wave of investors who want profits and to feel good about their investments.\n\nPence dislikes ESG investors because they do not share his views, including his opposition to-if not outright hostility toward-climate change initiatives, LGBTQ rights, corporate board diversity, workers' rights, gun safety legislation, and women's reproductive rights. He is entitled to his views. But so are ESG investors, who should be free to invest based on considerations they deem important.\n\nSome criticism of ESG is fair and justified. In May, for example, Standard & Poor's rebalanced stocks in its sustainability portfolio, dropping Tesla but retaining ExxonMobil. Technical ratings may have triggered the actions, but most felt that the moves lacked common sense and were plain wrong. Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote on Twitter: \"ESG is a scam. It has been weaponized by phony social justice warriors.\" His anger was understandable. Others have criticized ESG for encouraging companies to engage in \"greenwashing\" by making false or exaggerated claims about their ESG practices to attract clients. The SEC recently brought its first enforcement case based on greenwashing and has signaled to the industry that it will look for violations going forward. ESG is still being refined and mistakes can be expected going forward. But good-faith mistakes and honest criticism are different in nature from Republican misrepresentations about ESG as a pernicious effort to take away our freedoms.\n\nThe GOP is on a crusade to discredit ESG by blaming it on \"woke\" extremism. But ESG has more mainstream acceptance than right-wing extremism. Pence, in his Wall Street Journal piece, states that ESG is a threat to American freedom. A more truthful description would be that ESG is a threat to Republican minority control over increasingly unpopular issues. In that sense, Pence's attack on businesses who adopt ESG principles is akin to Florida Republicans who penalized Disney for taking a position on \"Don't Say Gay\" legislation.\n\nPence's proposed solution to his fabricated ESG threat is for the next president to work with Congress to \"end the use of ESG principles nationwide.\" In other words, he wants the government to step in and cancel ESG because he dislikes what the free market came up with. Republicans traditionally have criticized Democrats for imposing government regulations that interfere with free market decisions. Yet Pence is proposing exactly that.\n\nHypocrisy notwithstanding, it is unclear how Pence would cancel ESG from a practical standpoint, since it is widely accepted and integrated throughout the capital markets. Would a President Pence force thousands of U.S. public companies and asset managers to terminate their ESG operations and financial products? That action could harm U.S. capital formation by driving investors overseas where ESG thrives. For millions of investors who now consider ESG an important part of their investment decisionmaking process, would Pence cancel access to ESG information and their freedom to decide how to invest their hard-earned money? His vision looks less like freedom in America and more like something from the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "My Daughter's \"Woke\" Therapist Is Manipulating Her. I'm the Latest Victim.\n\nSlate Plus members get more Care and Feeding every week. Have a question about kids, parenting, or family life? Submit it here !\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nI am a 78-year-old mother and grandmother. My now 55-year-old daughter, the mother of my two granddaughters, age 26 and 16, has not spoken to me for nearly two years.\n\nThere were many periods before this over the years when she kept me at arm's length, or stopped talking to me altogether. My granddaughters are loving and bemused, but I don't expect them to lobby for me. My daughter has also just thrown her husband out, and he tells me that she has cut off most of her old friends, not just him and me. I think she has been influenced by a woke therapist who has told her we are all \"toxic\" and also might be suffering from a vitamin deficiency, as she has been on a no-meat, no-dairy, no-gluten diet for years. She has also become obsessive about working out at the gym-she is now very thin and all muscle (I don't recognize her when one of my granddaughters shows me photos).\n\nI am heartbroken in my old age, and very lonely. She has blocked me from all digital communication; I can only get a message to her through my older granddaughter. I have tried telling her I love her and miss her and that I'm sorry for whatever I have done to cause the total breakdown of our relationship. My granddaughter delivered this message, but she has told me that her mother won't be contacting me. I have always supported her in any way I can-financially, assisting her with schoolwork (she is dyslexic), caring for her daughters. I don't know what else I can do.\n\n-Heartbroken in London\n\nDear Heartbroken,\n\nThere is nothing else you can or should do. I'm sorry you're suffering, but what's happening here is out of your control. Please remember that your daughter is very much a grown-up. Her decision to end her marriage, the choice she's made to step away from many of her old friends, her exercising in a way that you consider excessive, and her food choices are all no one's business but her own. I know you're concerned about her, and I know you miss her. And, as regular readers probably know, I am not a supporter of family estrangement except as a last-ditch method. But you cannot force her to be in contact with you, no matter how hurt you feel. I will also note that your message telling her you're sorry \"for whatever\" you've done-even if that is absolutely true (and I believe you: You have no idea what you did to deserve this!)-is not a useful, effective apology. It's just a slightly dressed-up version of, \"I'm sorry you feel this way.\"\n\nWhether a \"woke therapist\" has any role in this is immaterial. I urge you not to put your granddaughter in the position of go-between. Do not ask for photos. Do not send messages through her. If you continue to do this, I fear you are jeopardizing your relationship with her . Don't force her to eventually choose between you and her mother (you will probably lose). If you want to maintain loving relationships with both of your granddaughters, your best hope is to make clear that your relationship with each of them is a bond separate from your (currently non-) relationship with their mother.\n\n-Michelle\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

The Scottsboro Boys were nine Black teenagers falsely accused of raping two white women aboard a Southern Railroad freight train in northern Alabama in 1931 in a case that lasted decades, according to the National Museum of African American History and Culture.\n\nIn the recording of the Lead Belly song several years after the incident, \"stay woke\" urged Black Americans to be aware of the potential for racist violence in the South.\n\nThe term, in one of its contemporary meanings, began to gain more popularity at the start of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2014, according to Merriam-Webster Dictionary . The Ferguson, Missouri, protests that year spotlighted the social injustices and police brutality faced by the Black community following the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown.\n\nBrown's death was shortly followed by the fatal police encounters of Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, and others -- which continued the growing popularity of the phrase and its use in protest and activist circles for many years to come, according to research from Ohio State University on the rhetoric of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nThe term has since been co-opted by some Republicans as a pejorative term since last year's midterm elections to signify the identity-based social justice issues that some Democrats and progressives push for, representatives from the Democratic Governors Association and Working Families Party tell ABC News.\n\n\"Woke\" has been used by several presidential GOP candidates including former President Donald Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, and Vivek Ramaswamy who penned a book \"Woke Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam.\"\n\nWoke is defined by the DeSantis administration as \"the belief there are systemic injustices in American society and the need to address them,\" according to DeSantis' general counsel, as reported by The Washington Post.\n\n\"We reject woke ideology,\" DeSantis said in his election 2022 night speech. \"We will never ever surrender to the woke agenda. People have come here because of our policies.\"\n\nThe pressure against \"woke\"-ness in Florida has already led to restrictions of race-related content in education, including the rejection of an AP African American history course in state high schools and vows from college presidents against including some race-related content that covers \"intersectionality, or the idea that systems of oppression should be the primary lens through which teaching and learning are analyzed and/or improved upon.\"\n\nFor example, DeSantis has implemented policies in schools that restrict the topics of race, oppression, gender and sex in the classroom through the Parental Rights in Education Law and the \"Stop WOKE\" Act. His administration also banned spending on diversity, equity and inclusion programs (DEI) from public college campuses.\n\nAcross the country, hundreds of conservative-led legislative efforts have restricted programs, classes and trainings that touch on race, diversity and equity in recent months.\n\nIdentity has been at the heart of the so-called culture wars being seen across the country, as Democrats and Republicans go head-to-head on issues such as LGBTQ+ rights , racial education in schools , and more.\n\nSome argue that conservatives are depicting \"woke\"-ness, or being educated on social injustice, as a bad thing. Maurice Mitchell, the national director of the Working Families Party and the Social Movement Strategist with Movement 4 Black Lives, called the use of \"woke\" in that context a racial \"dog whistle.\"\n\n\"Because 'woke' is associated with Black people, it's been a useful club for those who want to beat those seeking justice over the head with white grievance politics to win elections without deploying explicitly racist terms,\" said Mitchell.\n\nDavid Turner, the communications director of the Democratic Governors Association, said Republicans' use of the term can make them appear as \"bullies.\"\n\n\"Republicans, time and again, have overstepped where they think the average voter is and where most Americans are on mainstream issues,\" Turner said. \"This also applies to their hyper-focus on niche cultural war issues.\"\n\nThe Republican National Committee, Republican Governor Association and DeSantis' office did not respond to ABC News' requests for comment.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

For example, Cleveland Clinic does not provide gender-affirming surgeries for patients under the age of 18. For over 100 years, Cleveland Clinic's mission has been to care for life, research for health, and educate those who serve,\" referring to its function as a teaching hospital.\n\n\"We do not discriminate or create preferences based on race, gender, or any other characteristics, and we abide by ethical and legal standards of care with respect to our delivery of healthcare services,\" the statement continued. \"Cleveland Clinic is a nonpartisan organization and we neither have nor promote a political agenda.\"\n\nThe clinic's spokesperson said it would not comment further. Asked how other health systems might respond to such attacks should they become more frequent, the clinic did not say.\n\nIn a statement, Will Hild, the executive director of Consumers' Research, said the \"Cleveland Clinic must reverse course, shun woke radicalism, stop spending resources in the wrong places, and make affordable quality care its only focus.\"\n\nConsumers' Research's website says it \"was founded in 1929 with a mission to educate and protect consumers from harmful products\" but has evolved \"to a broader consumer advocacy organization  --  focused on educating consumers on the policies, products, and services of concern to them and to promote the freedom to act on that knowledge and understanding.\"\n\nAround the country, some hospitals have reacted to President Trump's executive orders focused on eliminating DEI and funding for services or recognition of transgender sexual identification.\n\nAnother Jan. 20 executive order told all agencies to \" promptly rescind \" federal documents referencing transgender equality, intersex students, transgender youth, confronting anti-LGBTQI+ harassment in schools, and other issues because the new administration recognizes only the sex that an individual was born with.\n\nThe American Hospital Association (AHA) was asked if the current administration's policies and attempts to defund certain federally supported programs might inspire attacks on other healthcare facilities across the country. The AHA did not respond.\n\nBut some healthcare organizations have removed from their websites certain references to some programs that the current administration has opposed.\n\nFor example, National Jewish Health in Denver reportedly ended diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts earlier this month in response to threats from Trump.\n\nAccording to the New York Times , employees at some VA hospitals were told to take down any displays of LGBTQ flags.\n\nVanderbilt University Medical Center in Tennessee also reportedly removed from its website and social media any mention of DEI.\n\nChris Van Gorder, president and CEO of Scripps Health in San Diego, said his system is not budging from its previous policies, nor has it been the target of any attacks. \"We are not planning on changing anything we do or have been doing. We are an organization proud of being a high-quality, ethical, and law-abiding organization and plan on continuing that history and legacy,\" he said.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Ron DeSantis' vow against \"trendy ideologies\" in state colleges and universities.\n\n\"We must ensure that our institutions of higher learning are focused on academic excellence and the pursuit of truth, not the imposition of trendy ideologies,\" DeSantis said during his Jan. 3 inauguration speech.\n\nSome faculty members and students say they fear DeSantis' \"anti-woke\" policies will be harmful, impacting school clubs, diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) requirements and committees, as well as courses that touch on racial history , or race-based perspectives.\n\nBryn Taylor, a graduate student at the University of Florida, told ABC News that getting rid of DEI efforts would \"take us back in social progress\" and leave opportunities in higher education for privileged people.\n\n\"It's about lowering barriers ... for any marginalized group,\" Taylor said, adding that it doesn't just affect people of color and LGBTQ populations. \"That includes first-gen students, low-income students, international students, students with disabilities.\"\n\nTaylor is the co-president of the Graduate Assistants United at the University of Florida and a member of a DEI committee at the school.\n\n\"Why don't you want your base to become educated?\" Taylor said. \"Why don't you want your citizens to have the best access to the best schools in the world?\"\n\nThe DEI movement and critical race theory , the systemic racism via the legal system, have been around for decades, scholars have told ABC News.\n\nThe governor's self-proclaimed war against \"woke\" beliefs has begun.\n\nWoke is defined by the DeSantis administration as \"the belief there are systemic injustices in American society and the need to address them,\" according to DeSantis' general counsel, as reported by The Washington Post.\n\nIn December, DeSantis' office requested data on funding, staffing and more for courses and programs that include \"diversity, equity and inclusion\" and \"critical race theory\" in a recent memo to school administrators across the state.\n\nIn response to backlash, his office told ABC News that \"the governor, as chief executive of the state, has every right to ask how public dollars are being spent by public state entities, like state colleges and universities. In fact, that is good government.\"\n\nHowever, DeSantis' \"Stop WOKE\" Act -- which restricts race-related curriculum and conversation in workplaces, schools and colleges -- has been temporarily blocked from being implemented in colleges and universities. The law is still being battled out in the courts.\n\nWOKE in the bill stands for \"Wrongs to Our Kids and Employees.\"\n\nDeSantis has also stacked the board of trustees at Sarasota's New College of Florida -- a college known for its progressive campus culture -- with conservative figures such as Christopher Rufo, who popularized misinformation on critical race theory.\n\nThe governor's office told ABC News that DeSantis made his decisions because \"the public expects their tax dollars to go towards [New College's] statutorily stated mission of 'provid[ing] a quality education.'\"\n\n\"Instead, New College has publicly committed to 'eliminating outcome disparities for underrepresented and underserved groups,'\" a statement from DeSantis' office read.\n\nDeSantis' office asserted that the college's statement \"quite literally admits the institution will adjust outcomes based on non-academic factors of their choosing.\"\n\nAndrew Gothard, the president of the United Faculty of Florida union, said that one of the complaints he's heard from faculty against recent education restrictions is that \"nobody really knows what the governor and the Office of the Governor are looking for here.\"\n\n\"When we listen to politicians talk about this subject matter, they seem to use it as a catch-all for any course or topic or subject matter that talks about people who aren't white,\" Gothard told ABC News. \"In higher education, we know that DEI and CRT are much more specific in their usage, but they also can relate to a larger array of issues.\"\n\nCritical race theory, which is taught in universities and colleges, seeks to understand how racism has shaped U.S. laws.\n\n\"Students in a higher education classroom should be educated on what this is, so that then they can make their own decisions about how they feel about it,\" Gothard said.\n\nEducators and librarians are left to ask themselves: \"How do I know if my subject area is DEI- or CRT-related in the way that the governor thinks those terms work?\" according to one librarian.\n\nKestrel Ward, a librarian at the University of Florida, fears the reaction to the lists being made of the funding, staffing and production of programs and courses relating to DEI and race.\n\n\"People in power creating lists of people they find undesirable has not led anywhere good for the people who are on those lists,\" Ward said.\n\nWard said restrictions on DEI and \"critical race theory\" could be far-reaching -- and could affect their book displays, programs and library selection.\n\nWard has considered leaving the position at the library due to the impending restrictions.\n\n\"It is becoming increasingly untenable, particularly for marginalized people, but for lots of people to work in higher education because there's so much hostility from the government, which is an infringement on our academic freedom, but it's also an infringement on our First Amendment rights,\" Ward said.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "What are ESG and 'woke capitalism'? State treasurers weigh in on fight over where tax money goes\n\nThe divide is over whether ESG investing is socially conscious or partisan.\n\nIn the final month before the midterm election s, much of the attention will focus on high-profile races to choose governors, senators, representatives and more.\n\nBut another debate has been heating up further down the ballot among the officials charged with safeguarding states' money. Some Republican state treasurers are now arguing that \"woke capitalism\" is a threat, and they're taking action to push back against it.\n\n\"Woke capitalism\" is a derogatory reference to ESG, or environmental and social governance, a financial strategy where companies and investors prioritize investments that they believe will create a positive benefit to society in the long-term, often by addressing climate change or issues like diversity or racial inequality.\n\nAdvocacy groups and investors have for years lobbied the financial industry to divest from fossil fuels, and the increased attention on racial injustice and environmental issues has led scores of younger investors to look for more socially conscious ways to manage their money.\n\nThe U.N. climate panel has said that in order to keep warming temperatures down as much as possible, the world needs to stop building new fossil fuel infrastructure as quickly as possible -- and that any new infrastructure could become a financial liability if fossil fuels are replaced by renewable energy in the coming years.\n\nBanks have responded to such factors both by offering funds that they claim only include environmentally friendly industries and by pledging to prioritize finance for industries that have made steps to address their contribution to climate change.\n\nBut Republican critics of the ESG strategy insist it unfairly puts a finger on the scale of the market in a way that benefits Democratic priorities.\n\nSome GOP officials are now arguing that this type of investing creates a disadvantage for industries like coal, oil and natural gas and that banks are giving in to left-wing lobbying when they adopt these policies. Texas and West Virginia have taken legislative steps to curb ESG, adopting laws that say their governments will no longer work with banks that don't support the industries in their states.\n\n\"The environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) movement has produced an opaque and perverse system in which some financial companies no longer make decisions in the best interest of their shareholders or their clients, but instead use their financial clout to push a social and political agenda shrouded in secrecy,\" Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar contended in an August announcement that Texas wouldn't do business with 10 financial firms that, Hegar said, \"boycott\" the oil and gas industries.\n\nA July study from researchers at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and the Federal Reserve of St. Louis found the Texas law cost taxpayers in some parts of the state an additional $300 to $500 million in additional fees and interest from switching municipal bond accounts to smaller banks that were acceptable under the new legislation.\n\nThe study's authors said that their finding was specific to the Texas law and it's unclear how such a restriction would play out in other states, but critics of the laws are concerned that similar extra costs could hurt public pension funds for people like teachers.\n\nDemocrats and climate advocates have accused these Republican treasurers of politicizing the way they manage taxpayer money in their states. In a recent statement through the nonprofit For the Long Term, 13 Democratic state treasurers and the New York City comptroller said states that adopt anti-ESG policies are trying to block progress. (Eleven total state treasurers are up for reelection in November.)\n\nOregon's Democratic State Treasurer Tobias Read, who signed the letter, told ABC News he finds the debate \"maddening.\"\n\n\"Your job as a state treasurer is to look out for the interest of the beneficiaries. In Oregon's case, it's hundreds of thousands of people, and these are people whose livelihood depends on the pension -- that's what allows them to buy groceries and pay the electric bill and make rent,\" Read said. \"And if you can't separate your own personal politics from your obligation to serve those people, I think you shouldn't be treasurer.\"\n\nRepublicans argue that banks have already been politicized and that it's only fair that they push back against what they see as activist investing, in which like-minded shareholders organize to pressure companies to incorporate their values.\n\nSouth Carolina State Treasurer Curtis Loftis, a Republican, said that while he isn't completely aligned with GOP groups on this issue, he thinks the best way to push back on companies that he sees attacking Republican values is to pull money away from their businesses.\n\n\"It's been cast in other media places that we are on this political rampage to stop ESG. We're just pushing back on 'hey, I thought you were gonna leave us alone,'\" Loftis said, adding, \"I want South Carolina to be left alone ... And they're [pro-ESG companies are] not going to just leave us alone, so it's got to be a national thing.\"\n\nThe debate isn't just a state issue. Former President Donald Trump weighed in at a conservative event last week, saying \"woke\" banks should be penalized \"very severely.\"\n\n\"The big banks like Chase and like Bank of America ... They've gone woke and they should be penalized very severely for it. The banks have let the community down,\" Trump said at a \"Hispanic Leadership Conference\" hosted by the America First Policy Institute in Miami.\n\nOther high-profile Republicans like former Vice President Mike Pence and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis have joined in and at least one leading Republican in Congress has signaled that it could become a federal legislative issue if his party takes control after the election.\n\n\"If banks don't cease and desist from weighing in on social and cultural issues, don't be shocked if Republicans, once back in power nationally, pressure banks to pursue their goals,\" retiring Sen. Pat Toomey, the top-ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, said in a recent hearing.\n\n\"I would oppose such efforts, just as I oppose similar efforts by liberals,\" Toomey said then. \"But once the precedent is set, the potential for future abuse is limitless.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Net zero marks the point at which a given firm offsets its emissions by removing the same amount of carbon from the atmosphere.\n\nThe number of companies with net-zero pledges has jumped 40% over the past 16 months, the data showed. However, the vast majority of the company pledges lack credibility, Net Zero said, noting that only one out of every 20 commitments meets United Nations guidelines for what constitutes a quality pledge.\n\nTo meet the U.N. threshold for a quality pledge, a company must adopt a plan to address all forms of carbon emissions, present intermediate goals for emissions cuts by 2030 and align its government lobbying with the objective of net zero, among other criteria.\n\n\"There is unequivocally a massive lack in the quality of these plans,\" John Lang, the project lead at Net Zero Tracker, told ABC News. \"We just haven't seen momentum or movement on that.\"\n\n\"It's easy to set a target,\" Lang said. \"It's much harder to create a robust plan to meet that target.\"\n\nDave White, director of the Global Institute of Sustainability and Innovation at Arizona State University, said the evidence of major companies fulfilling climate pledges is \"mixed at best.\"\n\n\"We've seen important progress but many of these companies are realizing they're meeting only a small fraction of the aspirational goals they've made,\" White said.\n\nExperts who spoke with ABC News attributed the corporate difficulties to a surge of conservative criticism over sustainable business practices as well as high interest rates, which make it more costly for companies to pursue capital-intensive climate initiatives.\n\nConservatives have directed much of their ire at environmental, social and governance investing, or ESG , a type of investing that takes into account non-financial information about a company, such as its climate impact and staff diversity.\n\nProminent Republican politicians, such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, have assailed ESG as a portfolio strategy that prioritizes liberal goals over investor returns. Eighteen states have adopted anti-ESG legislation -- and all but one features a Republican governor, law firm K &L Gates found in July.\n\n\"When it comes to things like these Wall Street banks, what they're doing to try to impose an agenda is something that's very, very troubling,\" DeSantis said last May upon signing a law that prohibits state officials from investing state money to further ESG goals.\n\nSome on the left have questioned the rigor of ESG funds, warning that they establish insufficient standards for companies seeking to qualify.\n\nESG investing, meanwhile, has sharply declined. Funds worldwide categorized as \"responsible investing\" received $68 billion of net new deposits in 2023 through November, according to data from financial firm LSEG Lipper. That amount had fallen dramatically from $158 billion for all of 2022 and $558 billion for all of 2021.\n\nThe backlash from conservatives, White said, has hampered corporate conduct beyond ESG, including carbon emissions commitments.\n\n\"The politicization of this area in some cases is providing cover for corporations to backslide on their commitments,\" White said.\n\nTo be sure, some companies have continued to achieve progress toward achieving net-zero emissions, some experts said, noting that the recent hiccup in climate action owes more to the scale of the task than the reluctance of the corporations.\n\n\"The transition to a carbon neutral economy that we're experiencing is really a transition on the scale of the great industrial revolution,\" George Georgiev, a professor at Emory University School of Law, told ABC News.\n\n\"I don't think it's a retrenchment -- it's more of a professionalization of the function within companies and them being more careful,\" he added. \"We're probably not moving fast enough but that doesn't mean we can't adjust course.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "How 'woke' went from a social justice term to a pejorative favored by some conservatives\n\nThe new season of \"United Shades of America with W. Kamau Bell\" kicks off in Arizona with an investigation into the origins of \"woke\" and the debate over critical race theory in schools. The series premieres Sunday at 10 p.m. ET.\n\nA version of this story appeared in CNN's Race Deconstructed newsletter. To get it in your inbox every week, sign up for free here .\n\nOnce upon a time, many decades ago, \"woke\" was a term used mostly in Black spaces to underscore the importance of keeping a close eye on patterns of racism and oppression.\n\nLanguage evolves, though, and sometimes in sinister ways.\n\nOver the years, \"woke\" has lived other lives: as a rallying cry against police brutality, as an ironic meme and now as an imprecise term used to decry progressive action.\n\nConsider that, just this month, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis' Stop WOKE Act went into effect . Among other things, the legislation is designed to quash instruction about race in schools and in the workplace.\n\nTo chart the transformation of \"woke\" ahead of the return on Sunday of the CNN Original Series, \" United Shades of America with W. Kamau Bell ,\" which in the season premiere explores what's going on with \"woke,\" I chatted with deandre a. miles-hercules, a linguistics scholar at the University of California, Santa Barbara. During our conversation, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity, we also examined how powerful words can be defanged and distorted.\n\nWhat are some of the earliest instances of people using \"woke\"?\n\nOne of the earliest uses of \"woke\" in the adjectival form with which many people are familiar was in William Melvin Kelley's 1962 New York Times op-ed, \" If You're Woke You Dig It .\"\n\n\"Woke\" is tied to the idea of specific awareness of mechanisms of anti-Blackness. It's more about the directive to be awake. In the philosophy and opinions of Marcus Garvey published in 1923, we see the phrase, \"Wake up Ethiopia! Wake up Africa! And let us work towards the one glorious end of a free, redeemed and mighty nation.\"\n\nI don't know if you've seen the Spike Lee movie \" School Daze ,\" from 1988. It ends with Dap, played by Laurence Fishburne, kind of breaking the fourth wall and directly telling audiences to wake up.\n\nIn linguistic terms, the idea of \"staying woke\" is actually just using the African American English aspectual marker \"stay,\" which can be used in any context to signal a habitually occurring event. For example, the salutation, \"Stay up.\" And then \"woke\" being the past tense of \"wake.\" The term is drawing on a broader conceptual model of wakefulness as awareness of anti-Black oppression.\n\nThe 2014 Ferguson uprisings seemed to mark an important change in the life of \"woke,\" in particular \"stay woke.\" I remember reading the writer Kara Brown's moving Jezebel piece in which she encourages people to \"stay angry and stay woke.\" The term really seemed to be everywhere.\n\nI'd say that I saw the change starting to happen around 2016. Many people associate it a little earlier, with the Ferguson uprisings in 2014 and when Black Lives Matter gained a lot of momentum. That was a really important event.\n\nBut like some others, I'd associate the change with the release of Childish Gambino's \" Redbone .\" I say that because of the lines, \"Stay woke / N****s creepin' / They gon' find you / Gon' catch you sleepin'.\" That was the first time \"stay woke\" was broadcast to and consumed by a global audience. You had White people who had never heard the phrase before hearing it everywhere in pop culture.\n\nThey begin to use it in a context in which they don't understand the long history of anti-Black oppression. They don't understand the ways that we've used linguistic mechanisms to name our realities. They use it in weird ways to talk about things such as diversity and inclusion efforts. The meaning morphs and shifts, but it still has a positive valence in people's minds.\n\nBut in recent years, \"woke\" has been co-opted in harmful ways. Could you tell me a bit about how the term is being weaponized today?\n\nI think that this is one of the most important and under-discussed elements of the linguistic life of \"woke.\" The co-optation of \"woke\" - and other terms broadly associated with progressivism - is part of a powerful and understated weaponization of meaning called semantic pejoration, which is a process whereby a word acquires negative meaning or connotation over time.\n\nBy using the term \"woke\" however they want, conservatives have muddied its meaning, have obfuscated it to refer to anything having to do with progressivism they don't like. The same goes for \"critical race theory.\" They've done it with so many terms. \"Identity politics\" is another one. One of the earliest usages of \"identity politics\" is in the Combahee River Collective Statement from 1977. It was a way of describing working to end Black women's oppression - it was a political movement on the basis of identity. Really straightforward. Now, though, \"identity politics\" is often seen as this negative thing that people don't want to participate in.\n\nOne of the things that gets paired with semantic pejoration is what's called semantic bleaching. Semantic bleaching is another linguistic process whereby the denotative content of a word is stripped away. I think that \"critical race theory\" is a good example of that, along with \"woke.\" Once a word gets semantically bleached, it can come to mean anything. \"Woke\" has come to mean anything having to do with race or, more broadly, progressivism.\n\nIt's not used only by conservatives. Barack Obama, in 2019, used it in a way that was kind of pejorative and dismissive . (The former president criticized \"call-out culture\" and \"wokeness\" during an interview) But that's why it's important that we discuss this semantic pejoration as a specifically and an aggressively conservative tactic, because lots of people who use \"woke\" in this kind of pejorative way think that they're doing so in a way that's politically neutral. They don't see themselves as re-voicing a conservative talking point.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved. CNN Sans TM & © 2016 Cable News Network."

The order says the law \"violates free speech rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the US Constitution.\"\n\nWalker first issued the preliminary injunction to block the state from enforcing prohibitions on mandatory workplace activities and trainings in August 2022 , saying the act \"discriminates on the basis of viewpoint in violation of the First Amendment and is impermissibly vague in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n\nThe judge's Friday order came after a federal appeals court in March upheld the injunction, agreeing part of the law infringed on employers' free speech rights.\n\nAt the time , DeSantis' office issued a statement disagreeing with the ruling, describing it as upholding the idea that \"companies have a right to indoctrinate their employees with racist and discriminatory ideologies.\"\n\nThe challenge to the law was brought in June 2022 by several Florida businesses, represented by Protect Democracy , which describes itself as a \"nonpartisan, anti-authoritarianism group.\"\n\nRelated article What federal judges have said about Florida's 'Stop Woke Act'\n\n\"(This is) a powerful reminder that the First Amendment cannot be warped to serve the interests of elected officials,\" Shalini Goel Agarwal, counsel for Protect Democracy, said in a post on X on Friday. \"Censoring business owners from speaking in favor of ideas that politicians don't like is a move ripped straight from the authoritarian playbook.\"\n\nDeSantis has championed the \"Stop WOKE Act\" as standing up against what he called \"indoctrination.\" He frequently referred to the law during his unsuccessful run for president, with the slogan that Florida was where \"woke goes to die.\"\n\nThe term has turned into a polarizing word in the US political climate, describing awareness - particularly about history, oppression and social justice issues - for some, while being a pejorative used to denounce progressive action and certain teachings about race for others.\n\nDeSantis did not oppose the motion to make the March ruling permanent, but during a news conference Monday in Tampa, he reiterated Florida's right to provide protections for employees.\n\n\"If they are doing woke training, which is basically discriminating against folks on the basis of race, you have the right to opt out of that. It's not a question of what the company can say,\" he said. \"They can say whatever they want.\"\n\nCNN's Shawn Nottingham contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

      "text": "What federal judges have said about Florida's 'Stop Woke Act'\n\nFollow:\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis is exploring options for his office to appeal a federal court's decision to block part of the state's Individual Freedom Act , also known as the \"Stop WOKE Act.\"\n\nIn a ruling filed Monday, the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's ruling that parts of the legislation infringe on an employer's free speech rights .\n\nThe law was one of several bills the Republican governor signed in 2022 as part of his war on \"woke ideology.\"\n\n\"Yesterday, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held that companies have a right to indoctrinate their employees with racist and discriminatory ideologies,\" DeSantis' office said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\n\"We disagree with the Court's opinion that employers can require employees to be taught - as a condition of employment - that one race is morally superior to another race. The First Amendment protects no such thing, and the State of Florida should have every right to protect Floridians from racially hostile workplaces. We are reviewing all options on appeal going forward.\"\n\nIn August 2022, US District Court Judge Mark E. Walker issued an injunction that blocked Florida from enforcing parts of the law prohibiting mandatory workplace activities and trainings that suggest a person is privileged or oppressed based on their race, color, sex or national origin.\n\nWalker wrote in the ruling that the Stop WOKE Act, \"discriminates on the basis of viewpoint in violation of the First Amendment and is impermissibly vague in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n\nOn Monday, a panel of three appeals court judges upheld Walker's decision.\n\nEleventh Circuit Appeals Judge Britt Grant, who was appointed by former President Donald Trump, issued the opinion, writing that the court rejects \"this latest attempt to control speech by recharacterizing it as conduct.\"\n\n\"Florida may be exactly right about the nature of the ideas it targets. Or it may not. Either way, the merits of these views will be decided in the clanging marketplace of ideas rather than a codebook or a courtroom,\" Grant wrote. Here's what federal judges have said about Florida's Stop WOKE Act.\n\nIn the opening lines of his August 2022 decision, Judge Walker compares Florida's interpretation of the First Amendment to the \"parallel dimension\" in the Netflix TV series, \"Stranger Things\" - The Upside Down.\n\n\"Recently, Florida has seemed like a First Amendment upside down,\" Walker wrote in the opinion, adding that typically the First Amendment prevents the state from limiting, or \"burdening,\" free speech.\n\n\"But in Florida, the First Amendment apparently bars private actors from burdening speech, while the state may burden speech freely. \"Now, like the heroine in Stranger Things, this Court is once again asked to pull Florida back from the upside down,\" Walker, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, wrote.\n\nRelated article Florida's 'Stop WOKE Act' commits a 'First Amendment sin,' appeals court says in a ruling that blocks part of the bill\n\nWalker ruled that \"the First Amendment does not give the state license to censor speech because it finds it 'repugnant,' no matter how captive the audience.\"\n\nJudge Grant, who authored the 11th Circuit's opinion on behalf of the appellate panel, also found the Florida law infringes on First Amendment rights.\n\n\"By limiting its restrictions to a list of ideas designated as offensive, the Act targets speech based on its content,\" Grant wrote. \"And by barring only speech that endorses any of those ideas, it penalizes certain viewpoints - the greatest First Amendment sin.\"\n\n\"The answer is clear: Florida's law exceeds the bounds of the First Amendment. No matter how controversial the ideas, allowing the government to set the terms of the debate is poison, not antidote,\" the opinion said.\n\nAttorneys defending the Stop WOKE Act have drawn comparisons between the law and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which protects against workplace discrimination.\n\nIn Monday's ruling, Grant described that argument as \"a last-ditch effort.\"\n\n\"According to Florida, because the Individual Freedom Act, like Title VII, seeks to regulate discrimination, the two statutes rise and fall together-if one is unconstitutional, the other must be too,\" Grant wrote.\n\n\"We disagree. Having similar asserted purposes does not make the two laws the same.\"\n\nRelated article Federal appeals court leaves DeSantis' anti-'woke' law blocked in Florida public colleges\n\nThe ruling emphasized that the Florida law was problematic because restricting speech was the point of the law, unlike Title VII, which was not directed at restricting speech.\n\nThe judges also noted the Stop WOKE Act only protects the speech and concepts that are approved by Florida.\n\n\"The only way to discern which mandatory trainings are prohibited is to find out whether the speaker disagrees with Florida. That is a classic-and disallowed-regulation of speech,\" Grant wrote.\n\n\"Banning speech on a wide variety of political topics is bad; banning speech on a wide variety of political viewpoints is worse. A government's desire to protect the ears of its residents 'is not enough to overcome the right to freedom of expression,'\" Grant said.\n\nGrant also wrote that Florida's law would prohibit free speech, \"even when no one listening finds it offensive.\"\n\n\"That is to say, it keeps both willing and unwilling listeners from hearing certain perspectives-for every one person who finds these viewpoints offensive, there may be another who welcomes them.\"\n\nWalker also noted in his August 2022 ruling, \"If Florida truly believes we live in a post-racial society, then let it make its case.\"\n\n\"But it cannot win the argument by muzzling its opponents,\" he said.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "The 'anti-woke' crusade has come to Europe. Its effects could be chilling\n\nIf 2020 renewed calls for racial equality as Black Lives Matter protests exploded throughout Europe, 2021 brought in the backlash as parts of the political establishment waged a so-called \" war against woke .\"\n\nStripped of its original meaning of a person being awake to progressive issues, \"woke\" has been appropriated from the Black vernacular and turned into a political lightning rod in the West's culture wars. It is now used pejoratively by lawmakers and pundits from both left and right, criticizing the perceived excesses of social and racial justice movements.\n\nThe politicization of the word, which has seen degrees of success in the United States, has bolstered political resistance to calls for more equality in Europe. The amorphous term has also been interpreted differently, depending on where it is deployed.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, woke is used to \"describe anything that could previously [be] described as 'politically correct,'\" Evan Smith, a visiting fellow at Australia's Flinders University and author of \"No Platform: A History of Anti-Fascism and the Limits of Free Speech,\" told CNN. The term is \"used to describe a broad range of ideas [and] movements concerned with social justice,\" including anti-racism, intersectional feminism, trans rights and critical histories of the British empire, he said.\n\nCultural institutions and academics have been targeted by members of the ruling Conservative Party for supporting those movements. In September, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesperson accused a charity set up in the name of Winston Churchill of trying to \"airbrush\" the \"giant achievements\" of the former wartime leader.\n\nRelated article The grim truth behind Britain's stately homes\n\nThe charity's mistake? Being accused in rightwing tabloids of being \"woke,\" for changing its name from the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust to The Churchill Fellowship and acknowledging that Churchill's views on race would not be accepted today.\n\n\"The Prime Minister has always been clear that whilst it's legitimate to examine Britain's history and we should aim to educate people about all aspects of our complex past, both good and bad, and not erase them,\" the spokesperson said at the time according to PA Media. \"We need to focus on addressing the present, and not attempt to rewrite the past and get sucked into the never-ending debate about which well-known historical figures are sufficiently pure or politically correct to remain in public view.\"\n\nThese anti-woke government interventions have power. They \"sharpen the public's sense of moral purpose and help to galvanise voters in a country they perceive to be under siege,\" wrote Nesrine Malik in the left-of-center newspaper, the Guardian, in October. \"They include the defunding of academic institutions and museums, and even interfering in the appointment of senior personnel at the BBC.\"\n\nMany in the French establishment view \"woke\" as a heinous US import of theories on race, post-colonialism and gender, which they say pose a risk to French values and identity, Samuel Hayat, a politics research fellow at French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), told CNN.\n\nThe term gained traction among French politicians and its press in 2021, say French observers. In May, Elizabeth Moreno, French President Emmanuel Macron's party diversity minister, told Bloomberg that \"woke culture is something very dangerous, and we shouldn't bring it to France.\" When asked in August whether \"wokism [is] a just cause, in your opinion\" by weekly political magazine Le Point, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, who is the socialist candidate in the upcoming presidential elections, said: \"it is very important that journalists shed light on these emerging movements, but I will not be campaigning on them.\"\n\nWhen a major French dictionary included a gender-inclusive pronoun in its online edition in November, French lawmaker François Jolivet, from Macron's party, called the dictionary's authors on Twitter \"militants of a cause that has nothing to do with France: #wokisme.\"\n\nRelated article EU flag removed from Arc de Triomphe after causing stir\n\n\"Woke is seen as a threat that comes from a society thought to be multicultural and violent and does not have the same values on secularism that France does,\" Hayat said.\n\nThe word plays against the French egalitarian, anti-elitist mindset, said Hayat, placing all the theories someone might struggle to understand, such as intersectional feminism, \"into a single phenomenon that came from outside France.\"\n\nAs Franco-American relations plunged to new lows this fall over a security deal the US forged in secret with the UK and Australia, French Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer opened a think tank to uphold French values against what he described as \"wokeism.\"\n\nSpeaking to France's Le Monde newspaper about his think tank, Blanquer said \"wokeism\" is an ideology that \"fragments and divides, and has conquered certain political, media and academic circles.\" He added that the backlash to \"wokeism\" helped \"bring Donald Trump to power; France and its youth must escape this.\"\n\nAccording to Rim-Sarah Alouane, a French legal scholar from Toulouse Capitole University, woke's arrival in France's culture wars is part of a wider reaction among members of Macron's party, La République en Marche (LREM), against left-wing and progressive views, rearing its head after the brutal murder of teacher Samuel Paty in October 2020 .\n\nPaty's death followed multiple Islamic terrorist attacks on French soil. But the French government's response to his beheading opened up a full-scale culture war over secularism, freedom of speech and Islamophobia as the country's interior minister closed a Muslim group that tracked anti-Muslim hate crime.\n\nThat period also saw \"Islamo-leftism\" - a controversial yet ill-defined far-right term accusing left-wing academics and activists of enabling Islamic extremism or terrorism - enter the mainstream political discourse as Education Minister Blanquer blamed it for \"wreaking havoc\" in universities.\n\nHe was backed by 100 academics who, in an open letter to Le Monde , blamed imported \"indigenist [sic], racialist, and 'decolonial' ideologies,\" in French universities for \"nourishing hatred of the 'Whites' and of France.\"\n\nBy the start of 2021, France's Minister of Higher Education Frédérique Vidal announced the launch of an investigation into French academic research on CNews, a French channel that has been compared to Fox News. It would look \"at everything through the prism of wanting to fracture and divide,\" while singling out colonialism and race studies, according to Agence France-Presse.\n\nThe French research organization Vidal tasked with launching the inquiry agreed to carry out the research. It however noted that Islamo-leftism was not a scientific term and condemned \"attempts to delegitimize different fields of research, such as postcolonial studies, intersectional studies,\" Centre national de la recherche scientifique [CRNS] wrote in a press release .\n\nConflating academics and researchers with Islamic extremism amounts to McCarthyism, said Alouane, referring to the anti-Communist crusade in the early 1950s by US Sen. Joe McCarthy.\n\nWeaponizing woke is another attempt at bringing academics, researchers and human rights activists to heel, say critics.\n\n\"This is a witchhunt against people who question the status quo,\" Alouane added. \"Instead of trying to make things better, to tackle issues related to discrimination, racial profiling, and the history of French colonization ... these academics [and] researchers are considered to be a threat to so-called Republican values.\"\n\nRelated article French dictionary adds non-binary pronoun, sparking anger\n\nIt also raises questions about academic freedoms, Hayat told CNN. France only needs to look at how Hungarian leaders chipped away at its education sector, banning gender studies in colleges and forcing the Central European University (CEU) out of the country for failing to comply with their nationalist worldview.\n\nWhile crude racial stereotypes over genetics and skin color are frowned on in mainstream contemporary discourse, terms like wokeism and Islamo-leftism serve to reinforce dog whistles such as, \"they do not belong to our culture. They do not abide by our Christian values,\" Alouane told CNN. \"It is just neo-racism.\"\n\nThe anti-woke discourse comes just months ahead of France's presidential election, where the main ideological threat to Macron comes from the right and far right, not the supposed woke left, said Alouane.\n\nAccording to some polls , Macron may end up facing off against either far-right National Rally leader Marine Le Pen or the rightwing Les Républicains candidate Valérie Pécresse in the second round of voting.\n\nAnti-woke rhetoric may be part of an effort to neutralize Macron's right-wing opponents. It is an effort Alouane finds ironic. \"The funny thing is, if a far-right candidate makes it to the second round, we will [be told] to save the Republic against the far right - even though this administration has been playing with far-right ideologies the whole time,\" she said.\n\nAs in France, many experts say the British government's anti-woke crusade is aimed at making electoral gains.\n\nAided by right-wing elements of the British media, Johnson's government has used the so-called \"war on woke\" as an opportunity to score points with their mainly English and Brexit-supporting electorate - some of whom switched allegiance from the opposition Labour Party at the 2019 general election .\n\n\"It is fertile territory for the Conservatives as they are pressing a button that has been pressed a few decades now in regards [denouncements of] political correctness,\" Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University, told CNN.\n\nIt also places Labour in a difficult position as its leader, Keir Starmer, attempts to \"shake off the 'far left' tag\" the party gained under his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn, author Evan Smith said.\n\nJohnson's culture war tugs at the split in Labour, between its socially conservative members, who think the party is too preoccupied with identity politics, rather than class, and its younger and more diverse base, who are happy for Starmer to do more, say experts.\n\nRelated article Eric Zemmour, far-right French presidential hopeful, grabbed by neck at heated political rally\n\nHistory has been the main battleground, where the Conservative government pits patriotism against any attempt to reckon with Britain's colonial past.\n\nIt is a narrative that has played out in the education sector, which has seen a government-picked commission release a race report that fended off calls to \"decolonize\" Britain's schooling curriculum. Instead, it advocated for \"a new story about the Caribbean experience which speaks to the slave period not only being about profit and suffering but how culturally African people transformed themselves into a re-modeled African/Britain.\"\n\n\"British history is not solely one of imperial imposition - Commonwealth history and literature reveals a more complex picture, in which ideas traveled in multiple directions, cultures mixed and positive relations formed that today underpin diaspora around the world, which many ethnic minority children in the UK will feel part of,\" the report wrote . Critics accused the report of being a whitewash that puts a positive spin on slavery.\n\nSpeaking to the House of Commons last year, Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch said \"any school which teaches these elements of critical race theory as fact, or which promotes partisan political views such as defunding the police without offering a balanced treatment of opposing views is breaking the law.\"\n\nThe government has not shied away from threats of intervention when cultural institutions follow progressive causes. If they \"go too woke, they risk going broke,\" Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden said in October, reiterating his warning that such institutions could be defunded if they cave to \"an aggressive brigade\" of social justice activists.\n\nIn the last 18 months, heritage charity the National Trust faced threats to its funding from Conservative lawmakers for exploring its properties' links to slavery and colonialism, and the Royal Museums Greenwich, in London, found itself under the microscope when the government reportedly refused to reappoint a trustee who advocated decolonizing school curriculums.\n\nThe Museums Association, which represents thousands of people working in the sector, warned of \"a climate of fear\" among \"museums and museum staff, especially those working on subjects relating to Britain's imperial past,\" in response to a February meeting between museums, heritage bodies and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport [DCMS], which Dowden headed at the time. \"We support the rights of everyone working on these issues to do so free of interference, threats and intimidation,\" the Museums Association added .\n\nThe BBC has also come under scrutiny from Conservative lawmakers calling for the license fee, which funds the broadcaster, to be scrapped .\n\n\"A lot of Conservatives don't like the state funding of a media company, and they think the BBC crowds out sympathetic broadcasters,\" Bale said. \"The whole anti-woke agenda to some extent is cover to move BBC from a license fee model to a subscriber-based one.\"\n\nRelated article Culture wars give Boris Johnson and his government a quick and easy high. They're no substitute for governing\n\nThis atmosphere can have a chilling effect on cultural institutions that may feel compelled to think twice about what programs they support or which people they hire. This is alleged to have played out at the BBC, when media executive Marcus Ryder's job application was reportedly blocked due to his support of anti-racism initiatives . The BBC has strenuously denied those reports.\n\nSupporting anti-racism causes should not be an impartiality issue, Ryder told CNN. \"What the BBC needs to do is re-examine its [impartiality] guidelines and decide how it should define 'controversial' and whether that can be independent of party politics,\" he said. \"And it needs to see how this framing works with people whose very existence sits outside the 'normative standards' - and this can apply to gender, race, sexuality, etc.\"\n\nA BBC spokesperson told CNN that \"impartiality is a core value of the BBC and something we apply to all our news coverage.\" The spokesperson added: \"The BBC plays an important role in informing and facilitating debate about subjects of public interest, some of which are divisive. That being said, the BBC is not impartial on racism or any other characteristics protected by law.\"\n\nThe policing of institutions by culture warriors acts as a way to undermine the real, lived experience of minorities. It allows for concerns about racism, transphobia or violence against women to be framed as not being of material concern to ordinary people, Neema Begum, a British politics professor at the University of Nottingham, told CNN. The long-term effect of this is just \"more polarization,\" she added.\n\nBritain's anti-woke crusade sometimes borders on the farcical - from a \"woke watch\" segment on GB News, a British television news channel critics say was set up to find an audience amid the culture wars, to a lawmaker bemoaning that civil servants are still \"woke-ing from home.\"\n\nNor has every skirmish against social justice movements been a win for the government. UK Home Secretary Priti Patel accused England's national football team of engaging in \"gesture politics\" for taking the knee before its matches in a protest against racism, and refused to condemn those who booed the players for doing so.\n\nBut the tactic backfired when the country rallied around the team after some of its players experienced racial abuse online in the aftermath of England's Euro 2020 final defeat in July . By the end of the Euros, polling showed most England football fans supported the team taking the knee.\n\n\"You don't get to stoke the fire at the beginning of the tournament by labelling our anti-racism message as 'Gesture Politics' & then pretend to be disgusted when the very thing we're campaigning against, happens,\" England footballer Tyrone Mings wrote in a Twitter post responding to a tweet by Patel condemning the post-final racism.\n\n\"It is clear the British public cares quite a lot [about] the equalities agenda, and it is quite easy for that kind of [government] mobilization to backfire,\" Christopher Bertram, emeritus professor of social and political philosophy at Bristol University, told CNN.\n\nRelated article Students are fed up with racist slurs and bullying. Now they're walking out of class\n\nIt also shows that while the anti-woke messaging works with their base, British society is getting more multi-ethnic, tolerant and woke, Bale said.\n\n\"The Conservatives are going to have to make a decision if they carry on railing against the way society is going,\" Bale said. \"There is a long-term risk for them as it alienates [younger] future voters who they need to keep on side,\" Bale added. \"There is a limited number of grumpy, older White men to get off on this kind of stuff.\"\n\nEven the 73-year-old grandson of Winston Churchill, Nicholas Soames, has heard enough, calling the furor over the Churchill Trust \"so sad and so pathetic\" in an interview with the Times. \"Apparently anyone who modernizes anything or does anything to remotely bring it up to date is 'woke.'\" he said. \"It's absolute b****cks.\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Opinion: The fight against 'woke' is really conservative gaslighting\n\nEditor's Note: Clay Cane is a Sirius XM radio host and the author of \" Live Through This: Surviving the Intersections of Sexuality, God, and Race .\" Follow him on Twitter . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion on CNN.\n\nI was at the barbershop recently when Childish Gambino's 2016 track \" Redbone \" popped up on a playlist. Singing about infidelity, Gambino - also known as Donald Glover - belts out, \"Stay woke!\" in the chorus. As we nodded our heads in unison to the song, someone asked, \" How did 'woke' become the new scary term? Do they even know what it means ?\"\n\nWe all had a wry laugh about language that has been misappropriated over the years, but the distortion of \"woke\" has been particularly insidious.\n\nI must give credit to the Silent Majority, the Moral Majority, MAGA, Q-Anon and all the other iterations of conservatism that Republicans have transmogrified into over the past five decades: They are masterminds at coming up with messaging that scares the Jim Crow hell out of their base. \"Woke\" is their latest stunt.\n\nIn the 1960s, it was \"Black Power,\" a term about empowerment and self-reliance popularized by Kwame Ture , also known as Stokely Carmichael. Conservatives rebranded the term, which became a catch-all phrase to scare White voters that \"Negroes\" were taking over. Those two words would then be twisted by \"White Power\" adherents who, according to the ADL , deliberately mimicked the term \"Black Power.\"\n\nSome years later, former California governor and later President Ronald Reagan famously deployed the \" welfare queen \" narrative, framing public assistance as a Black issue, even though more White people than Black have been helped over the years by those federal aid programs.\n\nRelated article 'Ruby Bridges' movie under review by Florida school district after parent complaint\n\nAfter Reagan, George H. W. Bush invoked the name of Willie Horton, a convicted Black man on weekend release from prison to rile up his base, during the 1988 presidential campaign. The Bush team made Horton a symbol of allegedly lenient prison furlough programs that were supposedly sending murderers and rapists into the suburbs.\n\nBush rocketed in the polls, framing his opponent, Democrat Michael Dukakis, as weak on crime. Bush won the presidential election and the Willie Horton television commercial - an ad General Colin Powell described as being \" racist... cold political calculation \" - was a turning point in the campaign. Yet again, Republicans had found a potent symbol of how to effectively manipulate voters' fears.\n\nOver the past several years, co-optation of language by the GOP has been on overdrive, due in part to the advent of social media. Once upon a time, politicians hammered incendiary language in speeches and interviews; Today, they have the ability to disseminate a similarly noxious narrative almost instantly online. Lee Atwater -- the brain behind the Willie Horton ad and other Southern Strategy tactics - would be proud. As he lay dying from cancer in the final months of his life, Atwater reportedly said he regretted the Horton ad, but the legacy of his racist actions lives on.\n\nThe current list of terms that conservatives have weaponized is long and growing: Black Lives Matter. Defund the police. Critical race theory. Intersectionality. Now, add to it the ubiquitous - almost inescapable - word \"woke.\"\n\nRelated article Opinion: I chose New College because I didn't have to leave my identity at the campus door\n\nTo be clear, woke is not political, but it has been politically weaponized by bad-faith actors, mostly on the right. Being \"woke\" is not a term exclusive to the realm of social justice; it's a decades-old slang in Black communities, meaning to \"be aware.\" For example: \"I heard your man is cheating - stay woke!\"\n\nBlues icon Lead Belly, at the end of his recording of the 1938 song \"Scottsboro Boys ,\" talked about the need to \"stay woke \" after Black men and children were wrongfully accused of raping two White women in Alabama.\n\nIn other words, be alert, keep your eyes open and watch your back - figuratively and literally.\n\nThe mangling of \"woke\" cannot be solely placed on politicians. Celebrities and comedians have played a role: Bill Maher, Sean Penn , Russell Brand , Kanye West and Dave Chappelle to name a few, have all misused the word in recent years, contributing to the despoiling of a cherished cultural term. Either out of willful ignorance or arrogance, they deploy the term out of context, often while pouting about \"cancel culture.\"\n\nMeanwhile, pushing back against \"woke-ism\" has become a profitable business model for anti-woke warriors. John McWhorter wrote a 2021 book titled, \"Woke Racism: How a New Religion Has Betrayed Black America,\" this New York Times bestseller was partly popular because a Black writer was denouncing \"wokeness.\"\n\nBethany Mandel recently released \"Stolen Youth: How Radicals Are Erasing Innocence and Indoctrinating a Generation,\" which, according to her, included a whole chapter on \"wokeness\" yet she famously struggled to provide a definition in an eye-rolling television interview . She later complained about being lampooned on Twitter - but also bragged about how many copies of her book that she had sold as a result. Journalist Bari Weiss, meanwhile, who rants incessantly about wokeness , has been dubbed an \" anti-woke warrior \" and is a co-founder of the \"anti-woke\" University of Austin .\n\nWhat's more dangerous than any of the misappropriation, however, is the way that attacks on \"woke-ism\" have made their way into policy.\n\nRelated article Opinion: What parents are really getting from the GOP's 'parents' rights' agenda\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis signed into law the \" Stop WOKE Act ,\" which is wreaking havoc on Florida's colleges, universities, libraries and schools. \"Woke-ism\" now somehow has expanded to encompass sexual orientation and gender identity . It's even being cited as the real reason for prosecuting the former president on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nEven the most anodyne mention of civil rights is suppressed, as seen recently with revered figures like Rosa Parks and Ruby Bridges .\n\nThe boogeyman framing around \"woke\" is intentional. In 2021, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott complained about \" woke supremacy ,\" a term with inescapable echoes of \"White supremacy\"- creating a deeply racist, false equivalency that pandered to a faction of the GOP in his state.\n\nIt was a move that perhaps was not all that surprising coming from the only Black Republican in the US Senate, who is fond of saying that his family had gone from \"cotton to Congress \" when he downplays racism in his party. Not even Lee Atwater could have predicted the Southern Strategy tactics being used by Black politicians.\n\nThere are no \"woke\" villains attempting to take over America. Is there sometimes unnecessary word policing? Can people be oversensitive? Can corporations overreact to the latest scandal or a trending topic? Absolutely, but that is not \"woke-ism.\" Labeling so-called overreactions or something you don't like with a term rooted in Black communities, racializes - and shuts down - discourse many people claim we need.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nHere's what my friends at the barbershop say about right-wing politicians, conservative media outlets, privileged celebrities, Twitter trolls:  You can't have the word \"woke.\" It doesn't belong to you, and never did. Be creative and think up your own dog whistles. What you refer to as \"woke-ism\" is old school, political gaslighting.\n\nI will keep using \"woke\" in its proper context. And if you don't understand it, then maybe the word is not yours to use.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

      "text": "Florida's 'Stop WOKE Act' commits a 'First Amendment sin,' appeals court says in a ruling that blocks part of the bill\n\nFollow:\n\nA federal appeals court upheld a lower court's ruling that part of Florida's anti-\"woke\" law infringes on the free speech rights of employers.\n\n\"The government cannot favor some viewpoints over others without inviting First Amendment scrutiny,\" the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals said in its ruling Monday.\n\nThe Individual Freedom Act, better known as the \"Stop WOKE Act,\" was one of several bills Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed in 2022 as part of his war on \"woke ideology.\" It was intended to prevent teachings or mandatory workplace activities that suggest a person is privileged or oppressed based on their race, color, sex or national origin.\n\n\"The ideas targeted in Florida's Individual Freedom Act are embraced in some communities, and despised in others,\" the ruling said. \"By limiting its restrictions to a list of ideas designated as offensive, the Act targets speech based on its content. And by barring only speech that endorses any of those ideas, it penalizes certain viewpoints - the greatest First Amendment sin.\"\n\nRelated article How 'woke' went from a social justice term to a pejorative favored by some conservatives\n\nDeSantis' office slammed the court's ruling in a statement Tuesday.\n\n\"Yesterday, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held that companies have a right to indoctrinate their employees with racist and discriminatory ideologies,\" the statement said.\n\n\"We disagree with the Court's opinion that employers can require employees to be taught - as a condition of employment - that one race is morally superior to another race. The First Amendment protects no such thing, and the State of Florida should have every right to protect Floridians from racially hostile workplaces. We are reviewing all options on appeal going forward.\"\n\nThe term \" woke \" has turned into one of the most polarizing words in today's political climate. For some, \"woke\" describes awareness, particularly about history, oppression and social justice issues. For others, \"woke\" is a pejorative used to denounce progressive action and certain teachings about race.\n\nThe challenge to DeSantis' \"Stop WOKE Act\" was brought by two Florida-based employers who wanted to require diversity and inclusion training for staff and a consultant. The businesses are represented by Protect Democracy , which describes itself as a \"nonpartisan, anti-authoritarianism group.\"\n\n\"Speech codes have no place in American society, and elected officials have no business censoring the speech of business owners simply because they don't agree with what's being expressed,\" said Shalini Goel Agarwal, counsel for Project Democracy.\n\nRelated article What federal judges have said about Florida's 'Stop Woke Act'\n\nA federal judge had blocked the enforcement of parts of the law dealing with corporate training in August 2022, saying it \"discriminates on the basis of viewpoint in violation of the First Amendment and is impermissibly vague in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n\nThe appeals court agreed, saying, \"Even if we presumed that the Act served the interest of combating discrimination in some way, its breadth and scope would doom it. Banning speech on a wide variety of political topics is bad; banning speech on a wide variety of political viewpoints is worse.\"\n\nOpponents of the \"Stop WOKE Act\" are fighting it on three fronts: the law's effects on K-12 schools, higher education and employers.\n\nLast year, a federal appeals court ruled that a temporary block on part of the law restricting what can be taught in Florida's public colleges and universities will remain.\n\nUS District Judge Mark Walker called the law \" positively dystopian .\" A DeSantis spokesperson said at the time the appeal \"is ongoing, and we remain confident that the law is constitutional.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nCNN's Holly Yan, Joe Sutton, Jack Forrest, Kelly McCleary and Brandon Tensley contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Republicans are crusading against 'woke'\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nWASHINGTON - Republicans, looking to dent President Joe Biden and win back Congress next year in part by rousing a voting base animated by culture war issues , have increasingly settled on a single word to describe what it is they stand against: \"woke.\"\n\nConservatives en masse have blasted \"woke\" companies that spoke out against Republican-led voting restrictions - a move that publicly aligned much of corporate America with Democrats on the issue, even if many of the businesses stressed their beliefs that access to the ballot shouldn't be a partisan issue.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley , R-Mo., promoted his coming book on Twitter by saying \"the woke mob\" - those who called for his original publisher, Simon & Schuster, to drop it in the wake of his efforts to overturn the election - wanted to prevent anyone from reading it.\n\nAnd former President Donald Trump, in a recent interview with Fox News, said the Biden administration is \"destroying\" the country \"with woke.\"\n\nThe word has appeared in dozens of Republican speeches, tweets and other statements of late. Republicans said it is less a coordinated messaging push and more of an instinctive sense that the label would work as shorthand to denigrate a progressive worldview - and it's a word they're hearing from their voters, too, as it buzzes around conservative media.\n\nYet lawmakers and operatives who spoke to NBC News varied in how they define the idea, while others said they didn't know much about \"wokeness\" at all.\n\n\"I guess it's just instinctual - like you know when you see it,\" a Republican Senate aide said of what is meant when something is deemed to be \"woke,\" adding: \"It's more talking about a particular worldview of racial, social hierarchies and social leveling and things like that. If you're using it the right way, it does have a distinct meaning, but there is also obviously a tendency to just call any and everything 'woke' when it might mean 'liberal,' and those don't exactly mean the same thing.\"\n\nThe aide added that anti-woke messaging is \"everywhere now\" because \"it kind of works to say it.\"\n\n\"And I don't think people maybe exactly know why,\" this person said. \"It's just like you see something working and you're just going to keep going with it.\"\n\n\"Woke,\" which has a long history in Black culture , was propelled into the mainstream in 2014 by activists protesting after Michael Brown, a Black teenager, was shot and killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri. \"Stay woke\" was a warning to be vigilant as Black Lives Matter protests were met with considerable police force. It evolved to encapsulate a broader social justice mantra - to be \"woke\" is now defined as to be cognizant of racial and social injustices .\n\nAmong conservatives, \"woke\" has been adopted as term of derision for those who hold progressive social justice views. In particular, the word's right-wing connotation implies a \"woke\" person or entity is being performative or phony. It's directly linked to language like \"political correctness\" and \"cancellation\" - which are also at the forefront of conservative messaging.\n\nCandis Watts Smith, a co-author of the book \"Stay Woke: A People's Guide to Making All Black Lives Matter,\" said the idea of wokeness \"is about freedom, justice, equality, access to voting.\"\n\n\"When people talk about being woke or becoming woke, they're talking about being well-informed and well aware of systemic oppression and injustice,\" said Smith, a political science and African American studies professor at Penn State University. \"And so it's an odd critique on Republicans' and conservatives' part to suggest that being woke is a bad thing.\"\n\nBut, she said, conservatives \"are actually expert at weaponizing language.\"\n\n\"And to say 'being woke' is silly or ridiculous, If you do it enough, it'll work for some people,\" she said of changing the word's connotation.\n\nPolling the idea of \"wokeness\" is difficult, but there are sharp partisan divisions over some racial and social justice issues. For example, a recent CBS News/YouGov poll found that while 79 percent of Democrats agree with the ideas expressed by the Black Lives Matter movement, just 16 percent of Republicans do.\n\nAn NPR/PBS/Marist survey this month asked Americans whether they support or oppose American companies' and professional sports teams' using their platforms to \"influence political, cultural, or social change\" - the main targets of the GOP's recent anti-woke campaign.\n\nJust 36 percent of Americans - 53 percent of Democrats, 32 percent of independents and 17 percent of Republicans - support companies' doing so, while 57 percent of Americans - 38 percent of Democrats, 62 percent of independents and 79 percent of Republicans - said they oppose such efforts. The numbers were only marginally different for sports teams: 40 percent supportive and 55 percent opposed.\n\n\"Wokeness\" - as South Carolina GOP Chairman Drew McKissick defined it - encapsulates socially progressive views that have \"grown off of the campuses, if you will, into first the corners of the Democrat Party, and it's slowly just taking over.\"\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has been at the forefront of anti-wokeness messaging in response to the corporate backlash over voting laws. He has blasted \"woke corporate virtue signaling,\" and, in a recent New York Post op-ed , criticized \"woke talking points,\" \"woke progressive craziness,\" \"woke cultural issues that tear at our national fabric\" and \"woke, toxic nonsense.\"\n\nBut even though his opinion piece called on Republicans to stop supporting \"woke\" corporations, Rubio had only a vague sense of what that might mean in terms of a policy shift.\n\n\"I don't know when I became aware of it,\" Rubio said of the word \"woke,\" adding: \"That's more of a clarion call to Republicans who have been tied to the sort of libertarian view of the economy that we shouldn't be playing a role in that.\"\n\nFor others, \"wokeness\" has been a hot topic with voters. Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kansas, said he hears about the subject at town hall after town hall, describing opposition to wokeness as a backlash to conversations around racial and social issues in the U.S.\n\n\"I think the wokeness is overreacting to a lot of issues,\" he said. \"I think that most Americans, the super-majority of Americans, are not racist, and people were overreacting here.\"\n\nYet some were less aware of the concept. Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., said he doesn't know what \"wokeness\" means when asked whether he agrees with his colleagues that it is a major concern.\n\n\"Concerns about wokeness?\" asked Inhofe, 86. \"I cannot answer that, because frankly I don't know what you're talking about.\"\n\nIt's not just conservatives who have used \"woke\" as a pejorative. It has also been used by more moderate Democrats in describing perceived progressive overreaches. In an interview with Vox , longtime Democratic strategist James Carville lamented \"faculty lounge politics\" and said: \"Wokeness is a problem, and everyone knows it.\"\n\n\"It's hard to talk to anybody today - and I talk to lots of people in the Democratic Party - who doesn't say this,\" Carville continued. \"But they don't want to say it out loud ... because they'll get clobbered or canceled.\"\n\nHe cited as an example some Democrats' use of the term \"Latinx,\" which surveys show most Latinos don't use.\n\nSen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, who said he has \"never understood\" what the word \"wokeness\" means, urged his party to keep its eyes on economic issues.\n\n\"Republicans are going to play to culture issues, and they're going to play to divisiveness, and they're going to play to hate and turning people against one another,\" Brown said. \"And it's up to Democrats to keep the focus on jobs and keep the focus on health care and your kid being able to go to community college.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, rolled his eyes when asked about Republicans' rhetoric about wokeness, saying it is \"just an attempt to distract everybody\" from their lack of economic policy ideas.\n\n\"It's become a catch-all - I don't even know what they're describing, other than it seems to me that they really don't want to talk about the very popular bill that they all unanimously opposed,\" Schatz said, referring to Biden's $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief law.\n\nOn the right, the focus on \"wokeness\" has come hand in hand with an anti-\"woke\" agenda that GOP state legislatures have moved quickly to approve, passing bills to limit public schools' use of The New York Times' \"1619 Project\" - which argued that America's true beginnings date to the year enslaved Africans arrived in Virginia, emphasizing the role of slavery and the Black experience in U.S. history. They have also passed measures to limit the teaching of critical race theory , bar transgender athletes from competing in girls' and women's sports and enhance criminal penalties for people arrested at protests.\n\nSeth Cotlar, a history professor at Willamette University in Oregon, said the fervent adoption of \"woke\" is \"a continuation of these longer trends in Republican political messaging to white voters.\"\n\n\"To me, 'woke' is the idiom of white backlash in the contemporary political era,\" he said, adding: \"It basically takes what is just a kind of normal, usual process of cultural change - which is always happening in modern cultures, especially our own - and it kind of pathologizes it. It gives it a name that you can attach to it that enables you to dismiss it.\"\n\nAllan Smith is a political reporter for NBC News.\n\nSahil Kapur is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

That perspective has stayed almost completely stagnant since the poll asked the same question in 2013.\n\nDigging into those numbers reveals a deep partisan divide.\n\nThree in four Republicans say the country should promote traditional social and moral values, while 67% of Democrats want greater tolerance of diverse lifestyles and backgrounds. Independents are split, with 49% picking traditional values and 41% siding with greater tolerance.\n\n\"The survey revealed a country on fire, seething with anger at our political leaders and too often at each other,\" said Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research, who conducted the poll along with GOP pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies.\n\nThe poll \"revealed a country sharply divided on these questions politically, and often ethnicity and generation,\" he added.\n\nAmericans are also divided on whether their country judges by the content of their character rather than the content of their skin. Significant majorities of Black adults (79%) and Latinos (61%) disagree with that statement, while a slight majority of white adults (53%) agree with it.\n\nOverall, 52% of Americans disagree that the country judges people by the content of their character rather than their skin color, while 47% agree.\n\nWhile this divide is within the poll's margin of error, it's the first time since 2008 the majority of respondents have disagreed with the statement, which evokes the famous declaration by civil rights icon Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. during his \"I Have a Dream\" speech .\n\nAsked if American society is racist, 59% of adults agree, with a whopping 79% of Black adults and 69% of Latino adults saying society is racist.\n\nThese partisan divides come as Republican presidential hopefuls have been leaning into the culture wars as they appeal to the GOP base - the field of candidates (and likely candidates) have largely rallied around rejecting \"woke\" perspectives and promoting restrictions on transgender people, particularly in schools or for gender-affirming care for minors.\n\nFlorida GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is widely expected to run for president, often says that his state is \"where woke goes to die.\" And former President Donald Trump said he'd block any federal agency from trying to \"promote the concept of sex and gender transition at any age.\"\n\nThe poll finds that the term \"woke\" is well known, with 76% of Americans saying they are familiar with the term, while 22% were not familiar with it. But the country is again divided along partisan lines over what exactly \"woke\" means, and if it is a positive or negative concept.\n\nOpen-ended interviews with those polled show that partisans also differ on how to define \"woke.\" Democrats describe it as a personal view that expresses empathy and awareness of systemic injustices, while Republicans, and some independents, were more likely to describe wokeness as an agenda promoting far-left priorities.\n\nBeing woke means being \"filled with empathy and trying to understand other people,\" said one older Democratic man from California. A younger female Democrat from the District of Columbia said it means being \"mindful of historical inequities.\"\n\nBut a middle-aged Republican man from Kentucky described being woke as \"an excuse to run rampant and do what you please under a false pretense that you are for a righteous cause.\" And an older independent woman from Wisconsin described it as \"newfangled gobbledygook\" and \"a bunch of B.S.\"\n\nThe poll also finds 48% of Americans believe the country has gone \"too far\" in accepting transgender people. A slightly smaller share of Americans - 43% - believe the country has \"not gone far enough in ending discrimination against transgender people.\"  It's a divide within the poll's margin of error.\n\nAgain, respondents fell along party lines with 79% of Republicans saying the country has gone too far and 76% of Democrats saying the country has not gone far enough. Fifty percent of independents say society has gone too far, and 36% say it hasn't gone far enough.\n\nThe survey finds that most Americans do not personally know someone who identifies as transgender - just 28% say they themselves, a friend, a family member or a coworker are transgender. Those who fall in that category are more likely to be younger, Democrats and highly educated.\n\nAnd those relationships, or lack thereof, appear to make a big difference in views on society's acceptance of transgender people.\n\nAmong those who say they know a transgender person, 67% say society hasn't gone far enough in accepting transgender people and 25% say society has gone too far.\n\nAmong those who say they do not know a transgender person, 57% say society has gone too far, while 34% say it hasn't gone far enough.\n\nThe NBC News poll was conducted April 14-18 of 1,000 adults - including 861 reached by cell phone - and it has an overall margin of error of plus-minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nBridget Bowman is a national political reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Ron DeSantis, maintaining a block on some of its provisions while challenges play out in court.\n\nDeSantis, a Republican, signed the legislation, passed by the GOP-led state Legislature, in April of last year . Tallahassee U.S. District Judge Mark Walker in November temporarily blocked some provisions in the law - which restricts discussions of race, gender and inequality - from being enforced in public colleges and universities, calling it \"positively dystopian.\"\n\nDeSantis' administration then appealed the ruling and asked the court to lift Walker's injunction. That motion was denied by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday.\n\n\"The Court did not rule on the merits of our appeal,\" Jeremy Redfern, DeSantis' deputy press secretary, said in a statement responding to the decision. \"The appeal is ongoing, and we remain confident that the law is constitutional.\"\n\nThe state has faced multiple challenges to the law.\n\nIn August, the ACLU, the ACLU of Florida, the Legal Defense Fund and a national law firm filed a lawsuit against the legislation on behalf of a group of students and educators.\n\nThey called the legislation racially motivated censorship enacted by the state legislature to tamp down widespread demands to discuss, address and learn about systemic inequalities.\n\nAdam Steinbaugh, an attorney for FIRE, a group that participated in a separate lawsuit against the legislation, said, \"In the college classroom, you're supposed to learn from an exchange of ideas, which means that it's not one viewpoint that's being inculcated to students.\"\n\n\"You don't get to replace one orthodoxy with another, and you're not going to get to freedom of speech through censorship,\" Steinbaugh told NBC News, adding that legislation pushed by DeSantis has a \"chilling effect\" because professors fear harsh repercussions for their teachings.\n\nIssues of how race and gender are taught have become a focus in DeSantis' messaging ahead of a potential 2024 presidential run.\n\nLast month, Rep. Alex Andrade, a Republican representing Pensacola, introduced House Bill 999, which would allow the state Board of Governors to provide direction to universities on removing majors and minors in subjects including critical race theory and gender studies, and bar spending on programs or activities that support such curricula.\n\nDeSantis has pushed for such measures in his remarks to the public.\n\nThe ACLU's suit argued that the law violates the First and 14th Amendments, as well as the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n\"The 'Stop WOKE Act' limits professors to one perspective only that the Florida legislature likes about systemic racism and sexism,\" said Leah Watson, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU Racial Justice Program. \"In many instances, as our professor plaintiffs have shown, this viewpoint isn't even supported by years of research or scholarship on behalf of academics.\"\n\nSupporters of the law contend that it protects against mandatory workplace training or classroom instruction that could lead people to feel guilt or anguish because of their race or sex.\n\nWalker, in his lengthy November ruling, pushed back on such arguments, citing George Orwell's classic dystopian novel \"1984.\" He wrote, \"Defendants' 'argument is like the thirteenth chime of a clock: you not only know it's wrong, but it causes you to wonder about everything you heard before.'\"\n\nManny Diaz Jr., commissioner of the Florida Department of Education, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nRose Horowitch is an intern with NBC News Digital Politics.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

DeSantis\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nST. PETERSBURG, Fla. - A Florida judge on Thursday declared a Florida law championed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis that restricts race-based conversation and analysis in business and education unconstitutional.\n\nTallahassee U.S. District Judge Mark Walker said in a 44-page ruling that the \"Stop WOKE\" act violates the First Amendment and is impermissibly vague. Walker also refused to issue a stay that would keep the law in effect during any appeal by the state.\n\nThe law targets what DeSantis has called a \"pernicious\" ideology exemplified by critical race theory - the idea that racism is systemic in U.S. institutions that serve to perpetuate white dominance in society.\n\nWalker said the law, as applied to diversity, inclusion and bias training in businesses, turns the First Amendment \"upside down\" because the state is barring speech by prohibiting discussion of certain concepts in training programs.\n\n\"If Florida truly believes we live in a post-racial society, then let it make its case,\" the judge wrote. \"But it cannot win the argument by muzzling its opponents.\"\n\nThe governor's office did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. DeSantis has repeatedly said any losses at the lower court level on his priorities are likely to be reversed by appeals courts that are generally more conservative.\n\nThe law prohibits teaching or business practices that contend members of one ethnic group are inherently racist and should feel guilt for past actions committed by others. It also bars the notion that a person's status as privileged or oppressed is necessarily determined by their race or gender, or that discrimination is acceptable to achieve diversity.\n\nThe ruling Thursday came in one of three lawsuits challenging the Stop Woke act. It was filed by private entities, Clearwater-based Honeyfund.com and others, claiming their free speech rights are curtailed because the law infringes on company training programs stressing diversity, inclusion, elimination of bias and prevention of workplace harassment. Companies with 15 or more employees could face civil lawsuits over such practices.\n\nThat lawsuit says Honeyfund - which provides wedding registries - seeks to protect the rights of private employers to \"engage in open and free exchange of information with employees to identify and begin to address discrimination and harm\" in their organizations.\n\n\"Diversity in the workplace is good for business,\" Honeyfund CEO Sara Margulis said on Twitter after the ruling. \"Diversity training often addresses concepts like systemic racism, unconscious bias, and privilege. This is why @Honeyfund challenged this illegal restriction on free speech.\"\n\nAnother lawsuit , which was filed Thursday by college professors and students, claims the law amounts to \"racially motivated censorship\" that will act to \"stifle widespread demands to discuss, study and address systemic inequalities\" underscored by the national discussion of race after the killing of George Floyd , who was Black, by Minneapolis police in May 2020.\n\n\"In place of free and open academic inquiry and debate, instructors fear discussing topics of oppression, privilege, and race and gender inequalities with which the Legislature disagrees,\" the lawsuit says. \"As a result, students are either denied access to knowledge altogether or instructors are forced to present incomplete or inaccurate information that is steered toward the Legislature's own views.\"\n\nConservatives see critical race theory less as academic inquiry into truth and history and more as the imposition of a divisive ideology stemming from Marxism that assigns people into the categories of oppressor and oppressed based on their race.\n\nLike the professors, a group of K-12 teachers and a student claim in a third pending lawsuit that the law violates the Constitution's protections of free expression, academic freedom and access to information in public schools.\n\n\"The Stop WOKE Act aims to forward the government's preferred narrative of history and society and to render illegal speech that challenges that narrative,\" the lawsuit says.\n\nDeSantis is running for reelection as governor this year and is widely viewed as a contender for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination. He has made cultural issues a cornerstone of his administration, particularly snuffing out what he calls \"woke\" entities and philosophies centered on issues of discrimination involving race, gender and sexual orientation.\n\n\"What you see now with the rise of this woke ideology is an attempt to really delegitimize our history and to delegitimize our institutions, and I view the wokeness as a form of cultural Marxism,\" DeSantis said in a December 2021 speech. \"They really want to tear at the fabric of our society.\"\n\nAnother example of this is DeSantis' effort to punish Walt Disney World for the company's opposition to the Parental Rights in Education law, labeled by critics as the \"Don't Say Gay\" law because it limits gender orientation instruction in early grades and chills discussion of the issue overall in schools.\n\nThe governor pushed the Legislature to end Disney World's special independent district that essentially enabled it to run its own private government. That law doesn't take full effect until June 2023 but has already been challenged in court.\n\nOther lawsuits have challenged DeSantis priorities such as a ban on abortion after 15 weeks, a measure to fine tech companies if they \"de-platform\" political candidates over their viewpoints, an \"anti-riot\" law enacting new felonies after Black Lives Matter protests and a law placing new restrictions on elections.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

It's East Palestine versus Silicon Valley,\" said Sam Geduldig, a Republican lobbyist, referring to the site of a recent train crash in Ohio that Republicans accused the Biden administration of ignoring. \"We can't get into a situation where there's red banks and blue banks, and unfortunately, that's exactly where we are.\"\n\nGeduldig noted, for instance, that Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, the chairman of the Banking Committee, faces a tough re-election next year. \"Republican campaign operatives are absolutely going to prosecute the case that Brown gave nothing to East Palestine and everything to Silicon Valley Bank.\"\n\nBank failures aren't especially uncommon - there have been 565 since 2000, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., typically several every year, even in non-recession times.\n\nBut Silicon Valley Bank was uniquely positioned to spark a political firestorm, given its centrality to the tech sector.\n\nAnd the failure pushes several political hot buttons all at once: concerns about the power of Big Tech from both sides of the aisle, populist anger at bailouts, battles over corporate cultures that prioritize issues like diversity and the environment, and traditional economic concerns about regulation, government intervention, spending and inflation.\n\nIt's the biggest bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis, when government bailouts sparked the right-wing tea party revolt - history President Joe Biden seems to be trying to avoid repeating by, this time, saying taxpayer dollars won't be used and insisting that those responsible will be held accountable.\n\nBut Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley still called it a \"Biden bailout,\" warning that while a pot of money that banks pay into may cover costs for now, taxpayers would be on the hook if it runs dry. \"Joe Biden is pretending this isn't a bailout. It is,\" she said.\n\nOthers argued the failure was a result of \"President Biden and congressional Democrats' reckless spending,\" as Alfredo Ortiz, the CEO of Job Creators Network, a conservative business group, put it, which he said drove up inflation, forcing the Federal Reserve to raise rates, which devalued older U.S. Treasury bonds held by the bank.\n\nStill, the most vocal early reaction to the bank failure on the right was more concerned with bank culture than balance sheets.\n\n\"They're so concerned with DEI and politics and all kinds of stuff. I think that really diverted from them focusing on their core mission,\" Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, a likely presidential candidate, said on Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" referring to corporate diversity, equity and inclusion programs that have become a boogeyman on the right, along with environmental, social and governance, or ESG, investing.\n\nDeSantis last month backed legislation to ban what he called \"the woke ESG financial scam.\"\n\nSilicon Valley Bank's chief risk officer drew particular attention from conservatives because she was involved in an LGBTQ employee group. \"SVB is what happens when you push a leftist/woke ideology and have that take precedent over common sense business practices,\" Donald Trump Jr. tweeted over a screen grab of the employee's headshot.\n\nHome Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus, an activist Republican donor, said on Fox News, \"These banks are badly run because everybody is focused on diversity and all of the woke issues.\"\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said he plans to introduce legislation to prevent consumers from paying any fees that might be raised on other banks to pay for the \" woke bailout .\"\n\nFox News host Tucker Carlson suggested Friday that the bank was too focused on hiring \"pioneering glass-ceiling-shattering women\" and \"yammering on about racial equity.\"\n\nOne member of Silicon Valley Bank's 12-person board wasn't white. Fewer than half were women.\n\n\"The WOKE agenda coming from SVB is in a large part to blame for their FAILURE. How much money did they WASTE on financing ESG/CRT CRAP? The insane left-wing agenda is BANKRUPTING our future. Go woke, GET BROKE!\" tweeted Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas.\n\nStephen Miller, a top policy adviser to former President Donald Trump, called on House Republicans to investigate how much money the bank spent on diversity initiatives, \"climate scams\" and allegedly helping Democrats.\n\nHouse Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., was already thinking about a similar line of inquiry Sunday, calling the bank \"one of the most woke banks\" on Fox News.\n\nThe writer of a Wall Street Journal op-ed criticized the bank for tracking the diversity of its board (one Black person, one LGBTQ person and two veterans), concluding, \"I'm not saying 12 white men would have avoided this mess, but the company may have been distracted by diversity demands.\"\n\nThere's little evidence to support the idea that Silicon Valley Bank spent excessively on diversity or environmental policies.\n\nRegulators said the collapse was about its mismanaging bond risk by putting too much of its money in low-interest Treasury bonds purchased before interest rates climbed as the Federal Reserve tried to battle inflation.\n\nMost major banks have diversity, equity and inclusion programs for employees and financial products for customers that take into consideration environmental, social and governance issues, which include, for example, mutual funds that don't invest in fossil fuel or tobacco companies.\n\nLast fall, a new \"anti-woke\" bank shut down after it quickly burned through $50 million in capital from major investors like conservative billionaire Peter Thiel. The startup was billed explicitly as an alternative to mainstream banks for conservatives, but it operated for fewer than three months before it shuttered.\n\nOfficials, economists and even libertarian-leaning tech leaders say depositors at Silicon Valley Bank need to be made whole, because it's not their fault the bank went bust - its executives and shareholders are expected to be wiped out - and because depositors' losing their money could trigger a runaway chain reaction that could result in job losses, defaults, more bank failures and even a recession.\n\n\"There was an absolute need to restore confidence, both to protect against runs against many, many banks across the country and to assure that people could get their payroll checks, businesses could continue to function in Silicon Valley,\" former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, who has been a skeptic of financial regulation and sparred with fellow Democrats at times, said Monday on MSNBC .\n\nSilicon Valley Bank and other regional banks successfully lobbied Congress to be exempted from regulation in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law that may have headed off a failure, some experts say. The exemptions were supported by Republicans in Congress, along with some Democrats, and signed into law by Trump in 2018.\n\nTalk of more regulation, however, worries Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., who called the government's rescue measures \"too much, too fast.\" He argued that Biden set a dangerous precedent by backstopping 100% of uninsured deposits, \"sending a signal to all banks that bad behavior will be rewarded.\"\n\n\"The collapse is clearly a liquidity crisis and not a capital crisis and should have been identified before the panic set in,\" Cramer, a member of the Banking committee, said in an interview. \"Now [Biden] will likely use this failure to increase regulations on small banks, which will only incentivize further consolidation.\"\n\nBut in the same breath, Cramer also knocked what he said was regulators' focus on ESG efforts.\n\nThe episode \"should warn regulators to focus on the main mission for financial institutions, and that is not climate change or management diversity,\" he said. \"It is risk based on financial returns.\"\n\nAlex Seitz-Wald is a senior political reporter for NBC News.\n\nScott Wong is a senior congressional reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

The post has drawn more than 5 million views on X as of Friday afternoon.\n\nThe meme's creator, 24-year-old grad student Miles Goodman, said he'd been thinking for months about how he wanted to answer conservative mockery of his school.\n\n\"It was very impulsive (posting that meme) but at the same time, it also wasn't,\" Goodman told NBC News on Friday night.\n\n\"By taking it on from a satirical lens, I think it let a lot of Cal fans take ownership of that label and allow us to embrace it on our own terms. And simultaneously, it pokes fun at  how other fans across the country have historically perceived the university.\"\n\nEfforts to tag Cal fans and their football team as dangerous leftists have been greeted with glee by Bears backers, who in the last week have flooded social media feeds with memes that poke fun at what some of their rivals think \"woke\" culture is.\n\nCal fans embraced a \" Calgorithm \" challenge by taking to social media to support just about every hot-button issue that'd boil the blood of any conservative culture warrior.\n\n\"Our fan base is so self-aware of how we're perceived, we don't always think that that's correct, but it's just been easier for each of us, especially lately, to not fight against these labels,\" said Cal fan  Nam Le, a 33-year-old high school English teacher who is among the meme posters on X.\n\n\"The reality is Cal football has fans that are anarchist, leftist, left leaning, liberal, centrist, right leaning, probably not any MAGA , but it's a big tent of people here despite these stereotypes that exist.\"\n\nMemes posted by Cal fans have included images of rainbow flags or joked about climate change, gender identity and pronoun use.\n\n\"FSU has announced a Stripe Out this Saturday vs Cal!\" one account on X wrote , sharing an image of the Florida school's stadium edited to add a rainbow across the field and in the stands.\n\nThe post added: \"Check your row number:\n\n60s: Marxist Red\n\n50s: Orange\n\n40s: They/Them Yellow\n\n30s: Capitalism is a Crime Green\n\n20s: Atlantic Coast Blue\n\n0-19: Open Border Purple.\"\n\nSome users have also joked about immigration , DEI policies and critical race theory.\n\nLe, the Cal fan, said he's hopeful the football-fueled meme culture war could lead fans to better understand each other.\n\n\"It's important that the memes are always in a place that is so exaggerated and absurdist that hopefully it'll actually dispel some of it [stereotypes] through meeting us on the ground [at games],\" Le said. \"They'll see we're just polite and normal people, and that we can interact and represent ourselves well across the country. This might do some good to close some of this political gap.\"\n\nCal will face the Florida State Seminoles on Saturday at 7 p.m. ET.\n\nSenior Breaking News Reporter\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Conservative Justice Gorsuch echoes 'woke' historians in railing against historical injustices\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nWASHINGTON - Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch is a dyed-in-the-wool conservative appointed by Republican former President Donald Trump, but in a series of recent cases, he has spoken up about historical injustice in a way that seems at odds with Republican attacks on \"woke\" history's being taught in schools.\n\nThat included his opinion Thursday when the court rejected a challenge to the Indian Child Welfare Act, a law intended to keep Native American families and communities together when children are in the adoption or foster care process.\n\nGorsuch's concurring opinion was part history lesson and part explanation of his full-throated support for Native Americans.\n\nHe wrote about how Native American families were torn apart by federal and state officials' attempts to assimilate them into Anglo-centric American society by eliminating their cultural ties to their tribes.\n\n\"In all of its many forms, the dissolution of the Indian family has had devastating effects on children and parents alike,\" he wrote.\n\n\"It has also presented an existential threat to the continued vitality of tribes - something many federal state officials over the years saw as a feature, not as a flaw,\" he added. His opinion was joined by two of his liberal colleagues: Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nChuck Hoskin, principal chief of Cherokee Nation, one of the tribes that defended the adoption law at the Supreme Court, said Gorsuch is \"going to loom large over Indian Country cases for a long time\" in part because he understands the complexities of Indian law.\n\n\"While he may possess a great range of views on a lot of legal issues, he seems to have the most solid understanding of federal Indian law of any justice of the modern era,\" Hoskin added.\n\nIn other cases, Gorsuch has lambasted the Supreme Court's own rulings that treat people living in Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories as second-class citizens and called out the torture of detainees held at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. He has repeatedly voted in favor of Native American tribes in a series of different legal questions.\n\nThose isolated writings, in which he is often joined by liberal justices, are in stark contrast to the bulk of his votes, in which he is closely aligned with the Supreme Court's conservative majority. Last year he voted to overturn the landmark abortion rights ruling Roe v. Wade and to expand gun rights. He has also joined the majority in curbing federal agencies' power to enforce environmental laws, among other cases in which the conservative majority prevailed.\n\nLast week, Gorsuch dissented when the court on a 5-4 vote upheld a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, a law enacted to protect the rights of minority voters.\n\nSmita Ghosh, a lawyer at the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center, said Gorsuch's opinion Thursday showed a \"robust, historically grounded explanation\" for why the law was enacted.\n\nIt is unfortunate, she added, that Gorsuch \"has not shown the same careful consideration of historical evidence\" on other issues, including the power of federal agencies.\n\nMike Davis, a conservative legal activist who served as a law clerk under Gorsuch, said it is easy to square his former boss' disparate actions.\n\n\"He angers both sides from time to time, but he doesn't care. His job is to figure out what the law is and apply it,\" he said.\n\nOn Native American issues in particular, Gorsuch's tenure as a federal appeals court judge in Colorado, where he handled cases involving tribes, most likely informed his approach, Davis added.\n\nIlya Shapiro, a legal expert at the conservative Manhattan Institute, attributed Gorsuch's approach in part to his love of history and his commitment to the conservative legal theory known as originalism, which involves looking at the original meanings of laws as understood at the time they were written.\n\n\"He calls them as he sees them. A lifetime appointment is a hell of a drug,\" Shapiro said.\n\nGorsuch has developed something of a reputation for a high-handed approach to judging, which has also seeped into some of his actions outside of court cases. He sparked controversy when, during the Covid-19 pandemic, he was the only justice not to wear a mask on the bench when everyone else in the courtroom was required to wear one and all the other justices did.\n\nIn February 2022 Gorsuch was again the center of attention when he barred the media from covering an event he appeared at in Florida hosted by the Federalist Society, a conservative legal group. Other prominent people appearing at the event included Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican now running for president.\n\nIt is for those reasons that his votes with the liberal justices in which he makes statements that echo liberal criticism of the U.S. government's historic misdeeds stand out.\n\nIn the 2022 Guantánamo case involving detainee Abu Zubaydah, Gorsuch wrote a dissenting opinion in which he called out the federal government's insistence on maintaining secrecy about the treatment of prisoners even though it is widely known they were tortured.\n\n\"There comes a point where we should not be ignorant as judges of what we know to be true as citizens,\" Gorsuch wrote. He then outlined in considerable detail how Zubaydah was tortured.\n\n\"This court's duty is to the rule of law and the search for truth. We should not let shame obscure our vision,\" he added.\n\nIn another 2022 dissenting opinion that touched upon the legal status of people living in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, Gorsuch called on the court to overturn a series of rulings called the Insular Cases, which embraced the idea that people in territories could receive different treatment from people living on the mainland.\n\nGorsuch wrote that the rulings \"rest on racial stereotypes\" and \"deserve no place in our law.\"\n\nHis attempts to draw attention to dark episodes in U.S. history also potentially put him in some tension with efforts by some Republican politicians, including DeSantis, to place new limits on how history is taught in public schools. Conservatives have frequently attacked the teaching of \"critical race theory,\" an academic concept based on the idea that U.S. institutions - particularly the justice system - and laws are permeated by racial bias.\n\nCritics of the laws like the one enacted in Florida have said such measures could stymie the teaching of key events in U.S. history, like slavery and the civil rights movement.\n\nBut Davis, the former law clerk, insisted Gorsuch's approach to history was consistent with the approach Republicans favor.\n\n\"It should be taught in schools,\" he said of Gorsuch's writings.\n\nLawrence Hurley is a senior Supreme Court reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Ron DeSantis and House Oversight Chair James Comer of Kentucky claimed that the bank was too focused on policies around diversity and its consideration of environmental and social factors in investments - known as ESG.\n\nBut on Thursday, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., had a twist on this talking point, saying Silicon Valley Bank was actually \"too woke to fail.\"\n\nThe Missouri Republican told NBC News that the bank received the federal government's help because it invested in climate change solutions backed by powerful people.\n\n\"'Too woke to fail' says that they're really politically connected and pursuing an agenda, which I'm sure that they put forward to people here, who see that - 'This is important, we've invested all this stuff, you can't let this go under!' My view is they should be treated like everybody else,\" Hawley said.\n\nThe claims linking Silicon Valley Bank's situation to \"wokeness,\" which lack factual basis, channel a common refrain that has struck a chord with the Republican grassroots in blaming \"woke\" attitudes for a vast array of national problems.\n\nHawley tweeted Monday that SVB failed in part because it was \"funding woke garbage\" like clean energy pursuits.\n\nBut Hawley backed away from that Thursday when asked what his evidence was for saying that \"woke\" or climate-based investments were a cause of SVB's financial failures.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know about that,\" he said. \"It seems like they made bad decisions.\"\n\nFederal regulators backstopped Silicon Valley Bank depositors through the FDIC's existing deposit insurance fund, with President Joe Biden and his allies arguing that the pot of money is covered by fees on banks - and not a taxpayer bailout.\n\nHawley, among others, said it's a bailout.\n\n\"I'm sure they did this deliberately, I'm sure they sold us to retailers: 'We're pursuing an important agenda on climate change,' and whatever, and I just think - that doesn't mean they deserve a bailout,\" he said. \"You can't tell me that if a bank, a community bank in Missouri had failed, that regulators would have rushed to bail them out.\"\n\nSahil Kapur is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Poll: One in five Americans or fewer use âwokeâ terms\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nFew Americans use the so-called âwokeâ terminology that Republicans ran against and that Democrats have walked away from, according to post-election polling conducted by YouGov.\n\nJust 20% of adults said that they regularly used the term âsafe space,â the most popular of the 30 terms tested last week, according to the poll shared first with Semafor. Fifty-six percent of adults said that theyâd heard the term, but donât regularly use it. Majorities said the same about the terms âwhite privilegeâ (64%), âtrigger warningsâ (55%), âgender non-binaryâ (54%), and âwokeâ itself.\n\nOther terms were even less widely adopted. Just 5% said that they used âLatinx,â a term Democrats abandoned years ago but is often cited as a stand-in for unrelatable progressive language; a majority of adults said that theyâd never even heard of âBIPOC,â a term for âBlack, indigenous, and people of colorâ that progressives have used more widely over the last 10 years. (The YouGov poll of 1194 adults was conducted between Nov. 13 and Nov. 15.)\n\nâWhile majorities of Americans are familiar with most of the terms in our survey, very few Americans say they use them regularly, including those who voted for Donald Trump or Kamala Harris â though more Harris voters do,â said Taylor Orth, the director of survey data journalism at YouGov. âWe also observed some differences in familiarity based on age, education, and race, but within all groups, regular usage of these terms is rare.â\n\nUse of these terms was mostly concentrated among Democrats, with few Republicans saying they used or had heard of words popular on the left. Republicans said that they most frequently used the terms âwokeâ (17%) and âsafe spaceâ (17%), both of which have been used by conservatives to mock liberals for years; a 2019 documentary about comedians trying to convince college students to be less sensitive was titled âNo Safe Spaces.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nDemocrats and liberal pundits have warned that activists use language that alienates working-class Americans as they search for changes they can make post-election defeats.\n\nThis isnât a new problem, or a new discussion. Latino Democrats like Arizona Sen.-elect Ruben Gallego said for years that nobody in their communities says âLatinx.â No Democratic campaign ads used it this year â even if some groups on the left still say it internally.\n\nStill, the YouGov data is useful for showing just how little most people use this language, unless theyâre hearing a conservative or Republican candidate denounce it.\n\nJust 15% of Black adults said they used the term âantiracism,â and 47% said they had heard it but donât use it, five years after Ibram Kendiâs book deploying that term made it mainstream in Democratic politics. Forty-eight percent of adults said theyâd never even heard the term âableism.â Go on X right now and youâll find the other 52%, debating whether itâs unsafe to hold meetings without mandatory face-masking.\n\nI watched every paid political message I could over the last year, and can confirm that Democrats use very different language than academics when theyâre trying to sway voters. YouGovâs polling also found just a small, split share of voters with strong opinions on the woke/anti-woke question â 19% defined themselves as the first, 19% as the second, and the rest said they saw themselves as neither or just didnât care.\n\nOhio Rep. Greg Landsman, who won a second term this month and is running to represent Democrats in âbattlegroundâ districts in the partyâs House leadership elections today, said in an interview that his party needs to think clearly about how it speaks.\n\nâIs it language that people use every day, or is it political language?â he said. âIs it Twitter language, is it partisan language, is it politician-y language? Or is it the stuff that you hear when youâre talking to people in real life?â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "What happened to âwokeâ? How the rightâs rallying cry faded away\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nAs his presidential campaign sputtered, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., could sound like a candidate unstuck in time.\n\nIn June, he spent days responding to a dismissive comment from Barack Obama questioning his commitment to racial justice, saying America was a âland of opportunity, not a land of oppression.â In September, he rolled out an âempower parentsâ plan by explaining that children âneed the ABCs, not CRT.â Wherever he campaigned, he invoked his race and biography as the ultimate rebuke to race-obsessed progressives fixated on a âculture of grievanceâ instead of personal achievement: âMy life disproves their lie.â\n\nRepublican primary voters, who liked Scott personally, were unmoved. The conservative backlash to progressive ideas about race and gender â a war on âwokenessâ that powered the rise of Gov. Ron DeSantis and boycotts of some major brands â has faded as an issue in an increasingly uncompetitive primary.\n\nIn three primetime GOP debates, the word âwokeâ was mentioned just twice; once as an aside from Nikki Haley, once when Vivek Ramaswamy plugged his book, âWoke, Inc.â DeSantis, whose early speeches focused on his fight against wokeness â âWe will fight the woke in our legislature, we will fight the woke in education, we will fight the woke in our businessesâ â now mentions it sparingly.\n\nAnd in last weekâs elections, the conservative movement to win control of school boards had more disappointments than victories. Moms for Liberty-backed candidates picked up just 50 seats around the country. In some of their highest-profile races â an Iowa school board whose transgender inclusion policies were opposed by GOP presidential candidates, and another school board in the suburban Virginia county where a 2021 sexual assault powered a political backlash that year â progressives held on to their seats.\n\nâI think that there are other issues that have taken the forefront,â said Tiffany Justice, the co-founder of Moms for Liberty, which hosted Trump, DeSantis and Haley at its summer conference in Philadelphia. âWeâre one incident away from them being at the forefront again.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nThe decline of âwokenessâ as a catch-all Republican message that spoke to intense fears of progressive ideas taking over institutions had been happening for a while . It faded for three reasons â Trumpâs return to the national spotlight, the middling electoral impact of anti-wokeness messaging, and the legislative victories that local Republicans achieved before the presidential race got underway.\n\nIn Trumpâs case, there were strategic reasons to push âwokeâ out of the conservative conversation early. The less seriously Republican voters took the concept as a threat, the less tempted they might be to consider a candidate like DeSantis running to protect them from it. At the end of May, DeSantis entered the race, and within two weeks Trump was using a speech in suburban Des Moines to demean his rivalâs defining issue.\n\nâI donât like the term woke, because I hear woke, woke, woke,â Trump told conservatives in Urbandale. âItâs like, just a term they use. Half the people canât even define it.â\n\nDeSantis saw that for what it was â Trump attacking an opponentâs perceived strength. The Florida governor had defeated what he called âa woke corporation in Burbank, Californiaâ (Disney), which no other candidate could say. Haley, then polling in single digits, was trying to get to his right on âparental rightsâ legislation, saying that Floridaâs âDonât Say Gayâ bill didnât âgo far enough.â But Trump said that the messaging was weird and irrelevant, and plenty of primary voters took their cues from him.\n\nIn many states, Republicans convinced their voters they had already turned back the tide of creeping wokeness with their support. That was a factor in Iowa, where an education bill mirroring Floridaâs passed this summer. In the governments they controlled, Republicans had passed laws against public schools teaching âdivisiveâ ideas about race and gender identity. By the time Scott was campaigning against âcritical race theoryâ in Iowa, it had been banned in public schools for two years.\n\nProgressives werenât talking as much about it, either. After a June boycott of Bud Light, which had done a single promotion with a transgender influencer, and a June boycott of Target, which had displayed LGBTQ pride clothing near the front of its stores, those companies retreated . In June, the conservative Supreme Court majority ended affirmative action, which also bolstered an effort to end diversity, equity and inclusion policies at businesses. The next month, The Wall Street Journal reported companies had laid off thousands of DEI officers since 2020 as their work became more politically divisive and corporate budgets tightened.\n\nâMy sense is that âwokeâ is receding,â said Sohrab Ahmari, the author of âTyranny, Inc.,â whose 2019 criticism of drag queen story hours presaged years of conservative activism. âAnti-woke only really works in a dialectic where woke is a powerful force.â\n\nPolitically, the âwokeâ conversation produced some anxiety among centrist Democrats, especially after Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkinâs 2021 win, but has had few actual consequences at the ballot box. Democrats overperformed in the midterms and a well-financed attempt to weaponize policy debates around transgender minors and athletes flopped in key states like Michigan.\n\nThen came the off-year elections, where candidates backed by teachersâ unions won most of the races they were competing in. In the most contentious races, candidates squaring up against anti-woke conservatives portrayed themselves as the defenders of good school standards, and their opponents as book-banning ideologues.\n\nIn suburban Philadelphia, where a conservative school board had passed a series of anti-woke policies â restrictions on sexually explicit material in libraries, and rules requiring parents to be notified if their child identifies as transgender â Democrats won in a rout. In Virginiaâs Loudoun County, progressives won a majority while defending the systemâs diversity standards. Conservatives, they said, had misread the electorate.\n\nâI understand their fear, but a lot of it is not realizing what the real challenges in the schools are,â said Anne P. Donohue, a Democrat who won a seat on Loudoun Countyâs school board, in an interview before the election. âWeâre facing learning loss. Weâre facing absenteeism. Weâre facing emotional immaturity from kids whose education was stunted. These are big problems that weâre facing, and everybodyâs screaming about bathrooms?â\n\nMoms for Libertyâs Justice said that this was a misreading â teachersâ unions had far more to spend, they argued, an advantage that couldnât be overcome in a couple of years. âThey love the off-year cycle, because they can get their people out to vote,â Justice said. âMore people are waking up every day.

      "text": "Trumpâs MAGA insiders want âanti-wokeâ deal-driven Africa policies\n\nSign up for Semafor Africa: A rapidly-growing continentâs crucial stories. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nAdvisors close to President-elect Donald Trump are pushing for a renewed US-Africa policy which focuses on âdeals and deterrenceâ and rows back some of what they see as overly progressive or âwokeâ diplomacy under the Biden White House.\n\nTrump, who is set to return for a second term in January, is widely expected to be more transactional in his style of leadership, an approach he is expected to apply in his White Houseâs dealings with African states.\n\nBut two people, who spoke to Semafor Africa on condition of anonymity because they were not permitted to speak for the transition team, emphasized that many deals will also be part of an approach to enforce more deterrents to conflicts around the continent.\n\nAnother marked difference will be what one person described as a âGod, gays and gunsâ approach to US-African diplomacy. This would involve promoting evangelical Christian conservative interests and reversing some of the pro-LGBT policies championed by the Biden White House, particularly in its dealings with countries like Uganda which last year passed anti-gay legislation . With regards to guns, the person noted there is also an interest from some who seemed keen on diplomatic postings in eastern and southern Africa for gamehunting opportunities.\n\nIn this article:\n\nTrumpâs first term US-Africa policy was overwhelmed by reports of a dismissive attitude towards Africa and Africans â most notoriously for his reference to âs-hole countries.â But it was also a time when the US began stepping up its focus on rivaling China on the continent. This included an overhaul of the US development finance structure by creating the International Development Finance Corporation, which had a budget twice that of its predecessor.\n\nâThe administration is going to be very pro-business because they see Africa as an opportunity, as Trump himself has said in the past,â explained Cameron Hudson, analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington. The hope is that by doing more deals, the US âcrowds out the competitorsâ and promotes American capitalist values.\n\nThereâs a lot of optimism around the right when it comes to the future of US-Africa relations under Trump, based on conversations Iâve been having. The general feeling seems to be that Washingtonâs relationship with the continent will benefit from a reset. To reinforce their point, they point to a range of issues including the severity of conflicts in Sudan and eastern DR Congo, and the democratic backsliding in the Sahel.\n\nBut itâs important to remember that Bidenâs White House also took off on a wave of optimism in this space leading up to the US-Africa Leadersâ Summit in December 2022. At the time, it was framed as the beginning of a major policy reset which was going to move African affairs up the White Houseâs priority list. That never happened. It probably was the peak, even though there were a number of well-covered high-profile visits during the last couple of years.\n\nPresident Biden is set to visit Angola next month, but as a lame duck president. There are now even concerns the visit could backfire on Angolaâs ambitions. All this to say things can go off the rails very quickly in foreign policy for any country or region. But having a guiding or consistent philosophy might help reduce the impact and allow for a quick reset.\n\nDemocrats push back at the idea that there is cause for much optimism for US-Africa under a second Trump administration. âPeople seem to have amnesia about his last term in office,â said one former official who asked not to be identified to be able to speak freely. âHe fully ignored the continent, hosting the fewest number of Africans in the Oval Office since Eisenhower.â\n\nCritics also point to Trumpâs Muslim travel ban which included several African countries: Nigeria, Eritrea, Tanzania, Sudan, Somalia, and Chad â though Chad was later reinstated.\n\nThere have been numerous reports about Trumpâs desire to cut back the State Department budget particularly closing embassies on the continent, and other international outposts.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor africa"

      "text": "Ciscoâs Chuck Robbins on engaging Trump and finding equilibrium in the woke wars\n\nSign up for Semafor Business: The stories (& the scoops) from Wall Street. Read it now .\n\nThis article first appeared in The CEO Signal. Request an invitation .\n\nHenry Kissinger reputedly asked who to call if he wanted to speak to Europe. If you need to get corporate America on the line right now, Chuck Robbins is your man. For the past year, Ciscoâs chair and chief executive officer has also chaired the Business Roundtable, Washingtonâs premier CEO conclave, making him a key interpreter for a business community looking to navigate Donald Trumpâs return to power.\n\nThe Georgia-born former basketball player has not yet joined the list of CEOs paying court to the new president. But his advice to his peers on how to deal with Trump echoes their strategy: âEngagement, pure and simple.â\n\nDealing with Trump\n\nThe new administration seems to enjoy dealing with the business community, Robbins says, not mentioning the contrast with Joe Biden. âWe wonât always agreeâ¦ but I feel confident that weâll have an opportunity to have that discussion.â\n\nWhat does Trump 2.0 really mean for business? Will he unleash economic dynamism or, as some critics fear, undermine the rule of law on which companies depend? Robbins sees only a âvery pro-businessâ administration that understands commercial success is âthe backbone of what makes this country great.â\n\nThat, he adds, underpins CEOsâ optimism. After the high turnover in Trumpâs first term, he also thinks the like-minded team now stepping into cabinet roles will stick around, giving executives a chance to build a more lasting rapport.\n\nTrumpâs brand is confrontation, but Robbins is projecting calm, citing the new administrationâs less âideologicalâ approach to mergers and acquisitions as cause for hope that it will be open to compromise. At the same time, he is subtly reminding it of what business thinks pragmatism should mean. Even on tariffs, âthe real wild cardâ whose supply chain and inflationary impacts CEOs fear, he urges Republicans to apply them âsurgicallyâ so as not to penalize US manufacturing.\n\nThe tariff debate is more than a routine policy disagreement: given that Biden kept most of Trumpâs first-term tariffs in place, is it also a test of whether the business establishment is losing the argument on trade?\n\nRobbins demurs. âWe will have to think through that when we see whatâs actually implemented,â he says. âYou know, weâve gone through it once, and weâll all react appropriately and deal with it.â\n\nWeathering the wokelash\n\nFree trade is not the only Business Roundtable article of faith that is under attack. Five years ago, it changed its longstanding position that corporations exist principally to serve their shareholders. Its statement galvanized a consensus shift, boosting supporters of ideas like ESG investing or workplace diversity, equity, and inclusion. The backlash has been fierce but Robbins says the group he chairs is not planning a rewrite.\n\nâLook, you go through these waves,â he says. âThere will be times where society will beg us to do things and get and stay involved. Thereâll be times where they want us to stay outâ¦ the pendulum swings too far in one direction, it swings too far in the other direction, and the key is getting it back to equilibrium.â\n\nRobbins has not been a prime target for those who think corporate America went woke. But the wokelash has been one more source of pressure for a generation of CEOs who, he says, have grown used to crises, from a pandemic to geopolitical turmoil.\n\nâThereâs never been a perspective where we say, âWell, we should probably pause until things get back to normal.â This is normal,â he observes. And that, he believes, makes his peer group less likely to slow investments in things like the networking equipment and security services Cisco sells.\n\nRiding the AI wave\n\nOur discussion took place at an AI-themed event Cisco threw for its customers in Palo Altoâs Four Seasons hotel. The AI-powered revaluation of tech stocks has done little for Cisco, which is valued at $240 billion yet trades on much the same earnings multiple as two years ago. Its âAI Summit,â gathering executives from the likes of OpenAI and Groq, was part of a strategy to recast Cisco as an indispensable partner to customers who, its surveys suggest, still feel unsure how to prepare for the artificial intelligence era.\n\nâThe AI revolution is moving into the enterprise. And I think this year is going to be a year where it really kicks in gear,â Robbins says. âWe understand the enterprise very deeply, and so we think we have a unique role to play.â\n\nRobbins is cautious about promising any Nvidia-style transformation of Ciscoâs revenues â he lived through the dotcom bubble when his companyâs stock soared much as the chip groupâs has lately, before falling to earth. He learned then, he says, that âwhen youâre in a market that is just exploding, you can believe a lot of press clippings.â But as his high school basketball coach taught him, âThe only thing that matters is your execution.â\n\nRobbins isnât about to swap his âboring CEOâ suits for Jensen Huangâs leather jackets â but he is playing to his companyâs strengths in networking and security. Externally, itâs a chance to shift the market narrative around Cisco. Internally, there is an urgency to his message: AI is accelerating its core markets âand we canât miss it.â\n\nLeading questions\n\nTransmitting such messages to 90,000 employees is not easy. After almost a decade in charge, Robbins says heâs learned the value of transparent, even blunt, communication. His regular all-hands video calls âcan get pretty animated,â he says, but they build trust.\n\nâIf I have an answer that youâre not going to like, I might say in advance youâre not going to like it, but since you asked, hereâs the answer... I donât think you can run a company effectively and have the trust of your employees if youâre not doing that. They can take the bad news if they just know youâre telling the truth.â\n\nAs CEO, Robbins says he has so many external issues to deal with that âitâs easy to get out of the detailsâ of what is happening in the business. He has made a point lately of spending more time asking questions of customers, engineers, and sales teams.\n\nâWhat Iâve learned is it matters when I go do a review on a product design. It matters when I go sit down with the sales team and talk to them about whatâs going on,â he says. âThose interactions inform the bigger decisions that we have to make.â\n\nRobbins sweats the details, but not much else. âSince I was a kid, I just donât worry about things that are outside my control that much. We plan for them. [But] if you canât control it, thereâs no sense in stressing over it,â he says. âAs much as I love this job, as much as I love everything I do every day, it doesnât define me.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nJoin The CEO Signal network"

      "text": "âThe S&P 500 without the woke sh*tâ: Here come the MAGA funds\n\nSign up for Semafor Business: The stories (& the scoops) from Wall Street. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nInvestors have been scrambling to keep up with the US president-elect, including some capitalizing on the political moment, testing how long the Trump trade will last.\n\nOne of the latest examples: Described in a recent pitch to prospective venture investors as âan S&P 500 fund without the woke sh*t,â the Azoria Meritocracy ETF will shun companies that use diversity quotas in hiring or promotion.\n\nThe fund is a bet on the Trump economy and the broader backlash to diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts that the president-elect tapped into on his way to victory. It will launch early next year under the ticker SPXM, said Azoriaâs co-founder James Fishback. ( MAGA is already taken.)\n\nâThe country just wholeheartedly rejected DEI affirmative action,â he said in an interview. âWeâre going to deliver that mandate to the private sector. These practices are not just unethical but bad business.â\n\nFishback is a 29-year-old college dropout turned Wall Street trader whom Vivek Ramaswamy, himself a pioneer in the anti-woke investment war, has called âa major Gen Z star in our pro-American movement.â Ramaswamy and Elon Musk are now leading Trumpâs government efficiency effort.\n\nFishback is best known for a bizarre and ongoing fight with his former employer, David Einhornâs hedge fund, Greenlight Capital. What began as a spat over Fishbackâs title and contributions to Greenlightâs investment returns escalated into dueling lawsuits and online trolling that has bemused Wall Street since the spring. The dispute is now in arbitration.\n\nAzoria is finalizing a roughly $25 million venture round, people familiar with the matter said. Fishback declined to name its financial backers but said they include âtwo prominent conservative-minded California venture capitalistsâ and several family offices.\n\nThe fund is playing for a slice of the $16 trillion thatâs invested in funds that mirror the S&P 500. It will buy all the stocks in the index except for companies that use racial or gender quotas in hiring, promotions, or pay decisions, which Fishback said will disqualify about two dozen stocks.\n\nâBut we wonât give up on these companies,â he said. The fund will launch public campaigns and seek to engage behind the scenes to pressure companies to drop their DEI policies. Heâs planning an accompanying podcast and livestreams on X, leaning into the wave of very online retail investors whose rightward leanings have been sharpened over the past year.\n\nâWeâll make our case in the marketplace of ideas,â he said. âWeâre also going to make some noise.â\n\nThere are already a handful of ideologically conservative S&P 500 trackers. Theyâve attracted little money and charge high fees. The America First ETF, which invests in the 150 companies whose employees or corporate PACs have donated the most to Republican candidates, has $23 million in assets, charges 24 times what BlackRock charges for its S&P 500 fund, and has performed slightly worse than the index this year.\n\nFishback said heâll unveil his first corporate target at a Mar-a-Lago event next week.\n\nIn this article:\n\nFishback is a Gen Z MAGA avatar: articulate, combative, conservative, and very online. In recent weeks, he has talked up Trumpâs government-efficiency czars, Musk and Ramaswamy, in The Washington Post, and endorsed Trumpâs ultimate pick for Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent. He has spoken out against what he sees as ideological censorship in high school debates and written for The Free Press, Bari Weissâ outlet popular with Silicon Valley and Wall Street conservatives.\n\nAnd heâs thrown his hat in the ring to replace Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, Trumpâs nominee for Secretary of State, and requested a meeting with Gov. Ron DeSantis, who will fill the seat. âYou miss all the shots you donât take,â he said.\n\nAzoria is planning more funds, including one that keeps a sleeve of cash to buy stocks that fall sharply (ticker: BTFD; Google it) and one that invests in companies that should benefit from the economic reforms of Javier Milei, Argentinaâs right-wing populist president and Trump superfan .\n\nFishbackâs fight with Greenlight is essentially about whether he was, or was not, âhead of macro tradingâ at the hedge fund. He says he was responsible for, among other profitable investments, a bet that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates more quickly than the market expected. In our conversation, I pointed out that excluding two dozen companies from an index fund because of their hiring policies is about as far from macro as investing gets.\n\nâMacro means big picture,â he said. âI canât think of something more big picture than ideologues steering some of the worldâs best companies in a way that is entirely inconsistent with the past 100 years of value creation.â\n\nBefore Nov. 5, the MAGA movement looked to be running out of steam. Shares of PublicSquare, an Amazon for the âlife, family and freedomâ crowd, had cratered. Trumpâs crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, slashed its fundraising goal by 90% on weak demand for its tokens. Bill Ackmanâs efforts to parlay his far-right stardom in an IPO of his hedge fund failed .\n\nEven Ramaswamyâs âanti-wokeâ investment firm had dialed back the ideological rhetoric after realizing its image as âpolitical over investment orientedâ was hurting its fundraising, Semafor reported .\n\nYes, conservative activist Robby Starbuck has pressured companies â including Walmart this week â to drop some DEI policies, but the ideological economy that conservatives had been calling for hadnât materialized. As I wrote last year, owning the libs turned out to be expensive, and not that profitable.\n\nBut Trumpâs win has given the movement new energy. 1789 Capital, a venture firm backed by Don Trump Jr. and several conservative donors, is off investing âpatriotic capitalâ in what it calls EIG â entrepreneurship, innovation, and growth. Bitcoin is up 40% since election day. Shares of conservative streaming platform Rumble are up 30%. âBrands cannot ignore this forever,â its CEO said last week, touting new advertising deals in the pipeline.\n\nConservative pitches only really work if theyâre pushing against a perceived liberal establishment. The retreat of BlackRock from progressive politics removes a boogeyman. Trump Jr.âs pitch for PublicSquare â âitâs time to invest in companies that donât hate youâ â may be less effective when those companies are running away from DEI as quickly as they can and their CEOs are cozying up to the new administration.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor business"

      "text": "Jim Banks and his âAnti-Woke Caucusâ have plans for the new Congress\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nLast month, Indiana Rep. Jim Banks founded the Anti-Woke Caucus, calling for âa recorded vote on an amendment to defund wokenessâ on any bill that spends money on âleftist activities.â Days later, he launched a campaign for U.S. Senate, lining up conservative endorsements for a potential race against former Gov. Mitch Daniels, who later opted not to run. Banks, for now, has the Senate race to himself, giving him more time to build the caucus and fight to strip out âdiversity, equity, and inclusionâ from federal agencies.\n\nâWhy does every federal government agency have a taxpayer funded chief diversity officer?â Banks said in an interview with Semafor. âThis does feel like a game of Whack a Mole, but the more members of Congress I have to whack at the moles, the more effective weâre going to be in the committees.â\n\nThe conversation been edited for length and clarity.\n\nDavid Weigel: When did you decide that âwokenessâ was a problem for America?\n\nJim Banks: There was a slow burn of wokeness leading up to Jan. 20, 2021, and then it was everywhere. Joe Biden becomes president and signs an executive order for all government agencies to create an equity plan. The first directive from [Defense Sec.] Lloyd Austin is to tackle extremism in the military. Iâm on the Armed Services Committee, and I start hearing stories from people in uniform about what they were dealing with â they were just overwhelmed with getting woke training, versus military training.\n\nIt was demoralizing to people, especially if theyâd been in uniform for a long time, to recognize that they had become political pawns. College campuses have always been hotbeds of woke-ism, and that gets ramped up after Biden takes over, too.\n\nDavid Weigel: Donald Trump had criticized it in 2020 and called for âpatriotic educationâ â so this was happening, but it wasnât really front of mind then?\n\nJim Banks: It was much more in our face. It was in every bill, whether it was the CHIPS bill creating a chief diversity officer at the National Science Foundation, or the infrastructure bill being filled with woke initiatives and DEI initiatives. A lot of Republicans were willing to go along with legislation on important issues, and maybe overlook that. But thereâs a growing number of us on the right who are recognizing that this is a cancer in the federal government and American culture. We need to identify it and uproot it.\n\nDavid Weigel: Last week, Donald Trump proposed defining âmaleâ and âfemaleâ in biological terms if he won the presidency, and removing gender identity from government language. Do you support that?\n\nJim Banks: I believe that, after the 2024 election, weâll have a Republican president and majorities in the House and the Senate, and President Trumpâs political message over the last 10 days has been spot on. He was strong on these issues as president. As a candidate, he shows that he understands his issues better than anybody else. Heâs really providing a roadmap for the Anti-Woke Caucus, showing Republicans where we should go from here.\n\nDavid Weigel: How did this play out last year? Ron DeSantis won, but in Michigan, Republicans ran on getting back to traditional gender roles, and they lost.\n\nJim Banks: A lot of dynamics were playing out in Michigan. In my state, my governor vetoed a bill that prevented boys from playing girls sports, his veto was overridden by the state legislature, and we made gains. I wish my governor had half the backbone on these issues that Gov. DeSantis does, because you lean in against the political opposition, and take the hits, you come out of it stronger than ever.\n\nDavid Weigel: What federal limits would you want to place on abortion? What should be the law whether youâre in California or Indiana?\n\nJim Banks: I hope that we, at the federal level, pass laws like the heartbeat bill or the pain capable bill. Right now, I donât have a lot of hope that the born alive bill will go anywhere in the Senate or be signed with President Biden, but itâs a good place to start â that, or banning abortions based on sex selection or abnormalities.\n\nDavid Weigel: What role do you see for the federal government in encouraging family formation? Democrats have answers, like the child tax credit; there are libertarians who want to just roll the clock back to 1912, and see what happens.\n\nJim Banks: When we made corporate tax cuts permanent, but sunset the tax cuts for families, that was a backwards approach that I think was misguided for the Republican Party. I think it was the wrong message. I voted for it, and it was good for the economy, especially when we ended up facing a pandemic. But if we couldnât do both, we should have prioritized families.\n\nDavid Weigel: What do you think of Rick Scottâs idea of sunsetting federal spending, getting to some kind of zero-based budgeting by having to vote on every program every five years?\n\nJim Banks: It seems like a lazy approach to talk about sunsets or across-the-board cuts. I think you can fix Americaâs fiscal health without affecting Social Security or Medicare benefits for anyone who relies on it today or tomorrow, while making reforms for future generations. Thatâs the right approach for America.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

Jim Banks, R-Ind. had seen the recent poll : More Americans defined âwokeâ as meaning âto be informed, educated on, and aware of social injusticesâ than âoverly politically correct.â\n\nBanks, the leader of the Houseâs âAnti-Woke Caucus,â didnât buy the result â not based on the energy politicians like himself, Ron DeSantis, and Donald Trump (he was careful to mention both) have seen from voters.\n\nâIt doesnât take a poll to know my constituency,â he said.\n\nBanks had his own definition for the broadly applied buzzword â a âleft wing religionâ as he put it â that conservatives have attached to everything from academia to Silicon Valley Bank.\n\nâI believe wokeness is dividing Americans along racial lines,â Banks said. âItâs divisive; itâs anti-American; itâs a sharp departure from everything that Martin Luther King stood for, when he talked about equality, that we would not be judged by the color of our skin. And wokeness is using the power of the federal government to do just that.â\n\nBanks contrasted it with an âAmerican dreamâ message that emphasized how once-disadvantaged people of all kinds, including himself (he grew up in a trailer park), were able to get ahead in the country.\n\nSemafor asked whether the âwokeâ label applies to government efforts to root out discrimination, like the Justice Department recently finding systematic mistreatment of Black residents by police in Louisville. He pivoted instead to his personal focus on federal âdiversity, equity, and inclusionâ initiatives, especially in the military, that he argues spur resentment and division.\n\nâWhat is the cost-benefit analysis of a chief diversity officer at the National Institute of Health or the Pentagon or Department of Interior? What does that mean? What does that look like? I donât know,â he said.\n\nHis âanti-wokeâ caucus is backing a bill that would bar state and federal agencies from âintentionally discriminating against or granting preferential treatmentâ based on ârace, color, or national originâ in hiring and contractor decisions. It would also ban similar criteria in admissions to schools that accept federal funds, effectively blocking race-based affirmative action. Itâs essentially a direct counter to moves by the Biden administration and Democrats to boost diversity, like trying to raise the share of federal spending that goes to minority-owned businesses.\n\nKADIAâS VIEW\n\nBanks, who sat down with Semafor last week for an interview, seems to be in the middle of just about everything going on in the Republican Party right now.\n\nIn addition to leading the Houseâs âanti-wokeâ crusade, heâs the former chair of the Republican Study Committee at a time when their proposals â like cutting entitlement spending â are under the political microscope in both parties. He ran unsuccessfully for House leadership at a time the GOP leadershipâs never been more in flux. And now heâs running for Senate with a formidable enough profile that potential rivals, including a former governor, stepped aside after exploring runs.\n\nâThe dude is basically a senator now,â is how one source described Banks to me.\n\nâHow is the senator?â Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y. joked when I told him I had just left a meeting with Banks.\n\nFor his part, Banks said his overall top priority as a senator would mirror his current agenda in the House: âRestoring Americaâs strength so that we can fight back against the agenda of the Chinese Communist Party.â\n\nBut being in the middle of the partyâs action can also mean being pulled in competing directions. Heâs running with backing from close ally Donald Trump, whose campaign he has so far held off on endorsing himself, and from Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who Trump has excoriated on a daily basis, including using a racist nickname for his wife Elaine Chao.\n\nâI enjoy the support from many wings of the Republican Party,â Banks said when asked if Trump was getting something wrong about McConnell.\n\nBoth President Biden and Trump have criticized Republican Study Committee budgets that called for raising the retirement age for federal benefits, among other changes. Banks, however, made no apologies for trying to find a âresponsible answerâ to projected funding shortfalls.\n\nâThe Republican Study Committee has stepped into this, and only those who are dishonest or manipulative will suggest that the Republican Study Committee wants to cut Social Security,â Banks said. âLetâs make reforms to it later to preserve those programs so theyâll be around for me and for my kids, and then later generations.â\n\nNOTABLE\n\nSigns of jeopardy are mounting for one Joe Bidenâs judicial picks.\n\nFormer New Hampshire Attorney General Michael Delaney is facing questions over his representation of an elite boarding school facing a sexual assault lawsuit , threatening his nomination to a federal appeals court position. Heâs been accused of using excessive hardball tactics to try and make an anonymous plaintiff reveal her identity or stay silent in public about the case.\n\nâI did my job in that case as an advocate, and I recognize if confirmed as a judge I would be playing a very different role,â Delaney said in a hearing last month .\n\nDelaneyâs home state senators are standing by his nomination. âI think heâll make an excellent judge,â Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., told Semafor. But he has come under recent fire from both progressive groups and Republicans over  the controversy. When Semafor approached four Democratic senators who sit on the Senate Judiciary panel, none committed to supporting him. They instead all said they were still reviewing his credentials.\n\nâI havenât made up my mind yet,â Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, told Semafor. (The other three were Georgiaâs Jon Ossoff, Californiaâs Alex Padilla, and Connecticutâs Richard Blumenthal).\n\nSenate Judiciary chair Dick Durbin scrapped a Thursday hearing on a slate of Biden nominees that included Delaney, partly due to absences. A committee spokesperson didnât return a request for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans on the panel say they believe his nomination is getting turbulent. âI think heâs got trouble on the Democratic side,â Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, told Semafor. Cornyn, a former state attorney general and judge, added he still hadnât made up his mind either.\n\nâI understand when lawyers take on cases they have a duty to advocate for their client,â Cornyn said. âBut not every lawyer should be a judge.â\n\nâ Joseph Zeballos Roig\n\nAs long as thereâs a live debate over how to define âwokeâ this week , we thought weâd throw in a try from Republican presidential candidate and âanti-wokeâ activist Vivek Ramaswamy as well. Here he is talking to Semaforâs Shelby Talcott and David Weigel on Wednesday:\n\nâWhat is âwoke?â The term gets bandied around a lot, you know, and I think itâs important to define. I think it refers to waking up to invisible societal injustices generally grounded in genetically inherited attributes, and going further, calls upon human beings to wake up to those injustices, and to act upon that, by using whatever means necessary to correct for those injustices â most notably by means outside of politics.â\n\nYou can read the full interview with Ramaswamy in Semaforâs national politics newsletter Americana later today.

His father was born in Ireland and immigrated to the U.S.\n\nStories that are being largely ignored by either left-leaning or right-leaning outlets, according to data from our partners at Ground News.\n\nWHAT THE LEFT ISNâT READING: Ron DeSantis announced an effort with 18 states to push back against âwokeâ environmental, social, and corporate governance investing, which takes issues like climate change into account. They framed it as a response to the Biden administrationâs efforts to let retirement fund managers factor in ESG issues.\n\nWHAT THE RIGHT ISNâT READING: New evidence from a group of international researchers links the COVID-19 pandemic to raccoon dogs sold illegally at a live animal and seafood market in Wuhan, bolstering the case that the virus was first spread from animal to human in nature.\n\nIf youâre liking Semafor Principals, consider sharing with your family, friends and colleagues.

      "text": "How Bill Ackmanâs anti-woke crusade paid off\n\nSign up for Semafor Business: The stories (& the scoops) from Wall Street. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nBill Ackmanâs turn as an anti-DEI provocateur has turned the investor, well-known enough on Wall Street but not far beyond, into a culture warrior. Itâs also been very good for business.\n\nShares of his Amsterdam-listed investment firm have been on a tear since Ackman took to X to criticize corporate diversity efforts, support Israel, stump for long-shot presidential candidates, question childhood vaccine schedules , and bash the student protests that have taken over college quads across the country.\n\nAckman owns about 27% of the fund , which means the transformation to a right-wing meme stock has earned him $280 million. Thereâs no obvious explanation other than Ackmanâs political turn: Heâs added half a million X followers over the same period.\n\nPershing Square Holdings, which went public in 2014, lets retail investors own Ackmanâs private investment book. It trades the same stocks as his onetime activist hedge fund, which is now essentially a family office.\n\nDespite posting some of the industryâs best returns , Pershing Square traded at a steep discount to the price of the stocks it owned, a gap that was only partly explained by the hefty fees it charges. It basically boiled down to a âlack of trust in Ackmanâ and worries that heâd pull âanother Valeant,â one investor wrote , a disastrous investment that lost $4 billion and forced Ackman to publicly apologize to his investors.\n\nâGreat story Bill, how about the massive discount on PSH? Seriously frustrating,â one investor responded to an Ackman tweet last year bragging about a recent tennis win. In 2017, activist hedge fund Elliott bought a chunk of Pershingâs shares and tried to pressure Ackman to liquidate it. To fend off the attack, Ackman personally borrowed $300 million from JPMorgan and bought control of the fund, he said on Lex Fridmanâs podcast in February.\n\nThe gap between Pershing Squareâs stock price and the value of its investment portfolio bottomed out at around 35% in September. It began narrowing when Ackman started publicly attacking university presidents at Harvard, his alma mater, and MIT, where his wife works. Today itâs 25%, worth more than $1 billion in market value.\n\nIn this article:\n\nAckman broke out his own activist playbook to close the gap. Pershing Square bought back stock , joined the FTSE 100, and started paying a dividend. It turned out all he needed to do was open his mouth.\n\nAs the meme-stock craze proved, fanboys can prop whole businesses up. Elon Muskâs true believers kept Tesla afloat for years. And the place where Ackman has done most of his recent ranting â Muskâs X platform â is a true amen chorus for the kind of grievance-tinged politics that Ackman has embraced.\n\nEuropean rules prevent Ackman from saying much publicly about his fund (a spokesman declined to comment for this story) but thatâs about to change. Heâs launching a US version that he has hinted could raise $10 billion or more. US rules are stricter in some ways than in Europe â he canât charge performance fees or borrow as freely â but laxer in one important way: Ackman can talk.\n\nDocuments for the new fund say Ackman intends to use his X account to talk about investments âas well as his views on macroeconomic, geopolitical and other developments.â If those views were worth $1 billion to a mostly unknown and unloved Amsterdam-listed fund, imagine what theyâd be worth to madding crowds in America.\n\nMuch of the attention on the vocal new ultra-rich has been on âhow loud billionaires convert their wealth into power,â as a recent New York Times op-ed headline put it. The trade works the other way, too.\n\nThe market hasnât rewarded left-leaning investors the same way. BlackRock has retreated from a progressive boardroom agenda of climate change, diversity, and corporate do-goodery. âSpeak softly and invest money,â executive Mark Wiedman told me last year, when I asked what the money-management giant had learned from its turn through the political wringer.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor business"

Lori Chavez-DeRemer, his pick for labor secretary, is set to go before the HELP Committee, where sheâs likely to be boxed in by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Democrats, Semaforâs Burgess Everett reports . Paul opposes Chavez-DeRemer over her support for the union-boosting PRO Act , so she may need a Democratic assist. But Democrats are not in a cooperative mood. âIâm a hard ânoâ on her,â Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said. âShe didnât bow out of this job when she found out Trump was going to force her to act illegally.â Republicans hope they can sway Democrats â or potentially, Paul â to get her nomination through. âYou can do the numbers,â Committee Chair. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said. âWe need somebody else to vote if Randâs going to vote negative.â\n\nA MAGA investment manager is making the rounds in Washington this week with a proposal to turn Elon Muskâs government cost cuts into âDOGE dividendâ checks for Americans. James Fishback â who launched an âanti-wokeâ fund marketed to conservatives and has been an informal adviser to DOGE â is proposing returning 20% of the initiativeâs savings to tax-paying households. âWhen consumers donât get what they pay for, theyâre entitled to a refund,â he told Semafor. Fishback says he met last week with the offices of Sens. Rick Scott, R-Fla., and Roger Marshall, R-Kan., and will be back on Capitol Hill this week with Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts. Trump relished seeing his name on checks cut to Americans during the pandemic, but even Musk admits that DOGE is unlikely to hit its $2 trillion target, which Fishback says would fund $5,000 rebates to 79 million households.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Michael Waltz, and special envoy Steve Witkoff are representing the US, while Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov is leading the Russian side. The State Department said the talks â which represent the first high-level meeting between the two countries since the 2022 invasion â will determine whether peace negotiations â can move forward .â Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whose country is not participating in the talks, reiterated that his country canât be cut out, which some US leaders have echoed. âOf course they have to be at the table,â Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., told reporters in Kyiv. Meanwhile, Trumpâs Ukraine-Russia envoy, Keith Kellogg, is set to visit Ukraine this week.\n\nOne of the key enforcers of Trumpâs trade agenda will be put in place tonight. The Senate is poised to take a final vote this evening on confirming Howard Lutnick to lead the Commerce Department. Lutnick will oversee Trumpâs trade wars, including the administrationâs time-sensitive âreciprocalâ tariffs, and will be a go-to contact for Senate Republicans worried about Trump going too far. At Commerce, Lutnick will also need to chart a path forward on export controls, as well as the Biden-era CHIPS program. The former Cantor Fitzgerald CEO is likely to receive at least minimal bipartisan support; Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., backed his nomination when it advanced out of committee earlier this month. The upper chamber will also hold a procedural vote on Kash Patelâs nomination to lead the FBI today, teeing up a final vote for later this week.\n\nThe case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams now lies in the hands of a Biden-appointed judge. Judge Dale Ho, nominated for the federal bench in 2023, has yet to respond to the Justice Departmentâs bid to drop corruption charges against Adams, which set off a series of resignations (including four more Adams aides ) and accusations of a quid pro quo. While judges have little power to refuse a government request to drop charges, Adamsâ case âmay challenge those limits and that precedent,â The New York Times writes. Ho could deem the dismissal politically motivated, though any effort to block it would be appealed. Some Democrats have suggested Ho try to keep the indictment alive, while Gov.

      "text": "What does 'woke' mean in politics? How the term is used in the new Trump era\n\nWhen the Trump administration this week put on hold grant, loan and other financial assistance programs , one of the reasons cited was to give White House staffers time to assess them for \"woke gender ideology.\"\n\nThe memo was quickly rescinded after a federal judge paused it, but the new president made his funding priorities clear: Programs that support diversity, equity and inclusion programs, transgender issues and environmental justice will not get White House backing.\n\nThe word \"woke\" gets tossed around in political conversations and its meaning has changed over the years.\n\nWhat does \"woke\" signify today?\n\nThe term \"woke\" used to have a different meaning. It was first used by Pan-African activist Marcus Garvey as early as 1923 . \"Woke\" was meant to acknowledge the struggles of African Americans and was a word of empowerment for some Black people.\n\nWhen the Black Lives Matter movement began after the police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, \"woke\" expanded outside of Black communities into the larger public lexicon and became co-opted or appropriated for various political agendas , the definition of the word has evolved and come to mean different things to different people.\n\nThe term woke has been used by conservative figures as pejorative term to describe the following social justice initiatives:\n\nA USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll from March 2023 demonstrates the varying ideas for what \"woke\" means among Americans between Republicans and Democrats.\n\nOf those surveyed , 56% percent say the term means \"to be informed, educated on and aware of social injustices.\" That includes not only three-fourths of Democrats but also more than a third of Republicans. Overall, 39% say the word reflects what has become the GOP political definition, \"to be overly politically correct and police others' words.\" 56% of Republicans agreed with this view.\n\nThe term will likely continue to be a point of contention.\n\nFor years, conservative activists, lawmakers and politicians have used the term \"woke\" as a slam against progressive values and liberal initiatives.\n\nKnox County Mayor Glenn Jacobs has previously warned Republicans against allowing a \"woke\" culture to flourish. He posted on X to say the \"wokeness is weakness\" and it has no place in schools or military. He didn't detail what he meant.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk said his estranged daughter Vivian Jenna Wilson was \"killed\" by the \"woke mind virus\" and claimed he was tricked into signing documents agreeing to gender-affirming care procedures for her.\n\nUSA TODAY contributed to this report"

      "text": "What is the meaning of 'woke'? Once a term used by Black Americans, it's now a rallying cry for GOP\n\nDuring the 2023 Conservative Political Action Conference , speaker after speaker attacked \"woke\" ideology in their speeches to conservative activists.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Nikki Haley decried wokeness as \"a virus more dangerous than any pandemic, hands down.\"\n\n\"I traveled the country calling out the woke-industrial-complex in America,\" GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy bragged.\n\nElsewhere, Republicans have declared war on \"woke capitalism\" and even introduced legislation like the \"Stop WOKE Act,\" in Florida, an acronym for Stop the Wrongs to Our Kids and Employees.\n\nThe uptick on excoriating \"woke \" ideology has increased in recent years among politicians, including former President Donald Trump, as Americans across the nation battle over diversity, inclusion and equity efforts in the workforce, public schools and in legislation.\n\nBut what is \"woke\"? And what do the GOP attacks mean for 2024?\n\nAmong conservative lawmakers and activists \"woke\" tends to be an across-the-board denunciation of progressive values and liberal initiatives.\n\nSome have used it to attack trans and gay rights while others apply it to critical race theory - a legal theory that examines systemic racism as a part of American institutions - and the teachings of the New York Times' 1619 project in public schools.\n\n\"If you ask people what woke is, I think what they mean is they want to stand against people who are engaging in some type of advocacy for marginalized people,\" said Andra Gillespie, political scientist at Emory University.\n\n\"It's kind of this lumping together of anybody whose views could be construed as being progressive on issues related to identity and civil rights.\"\n\nAt CPAC this year, for example, Daily Wire host Michael Knowles called for the eradication of \"transgenderism.\"\n\nBut Black Americans have used the term \"woke\" since at least the early-to-mid 20th century to mean being alert to racial and social injustice.\n\nA version of the term was first used by Pan-African activist Marcus Garvey as early as 1923 . It was later popularized by Blues artists such as Lead Belly, who used it when singing about the Scottsboro Boys, a group of nine Black teenagers who were falsely accused of raping two white women on a train in northeast Alabama in 1931.\n\nAs the Black Lives Matter movement began after the police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014, \"woke\" expanded outside of Black communities into the larger public lexicon.\n\nBlack artists and entertainers continued to insert the phrase in their music, including Grammy-award-winning artists Erykah Badu and Childish Gambino - a.k.a. Donald Glover-for political causes.\n\nYet \"woke\" has now been hijacked by the political right to mean something far from its original definition.\n\n\"The reason we have to 'stay woke' is because of exactly what these people are doing right now, which is finding very insidious ways to undercut our rights,\" said Terri Givens, a political science professor at McGill University.\n\nGivens called the attacks on the term \"a full-on dog whistle\" and pointed to attempts to limit the right to vote, curtail reproductive and abortion rights and ban inclusive education in schools as examples of the backlash against Black and brown civil rights.\n\n\"Learning history is not about woke-ism,\" Given said.\n\nPolitical experts said the backlash to woke-ism greatly increased after the 2020 worldwide protests against the murder of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor's killing .\n\nConservatives now use the term as a political retort to combat what they perceive as political correctness gone haywire.\n\nBut progressive commentators note that the response also comes in the context of a changing America, which is becoming more diverse racially and ethically and along sexual orientation and gender identity lines.\n\n\"What they're trying to do is make the term a pejorative,\" said Kendra Cotton, chief operating officer of New Georgia Project, a progressive-leaning voting rights group.\n\nAs more marginalized groups are elected into office and exercising their voting power during elections, it can make some Americans afraid, said Cotton.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a possible GOP presidential candidate, has built a persona crusading against ideas and policies conservatives deem as \"woke.\"\n\nIn addition to championing the Stop WOKE Act , he has stated that the Sunshine state is \" where woke goes to die .\"\n\nTehama Lopez Bunyasi, a political scientist at George Mason University and co-author of the book \"Stay Woke: A People's Guide to Making All Black Lives Matter,\" said the legislation is \"perhaps the most explicit way we see the co-optation of the term 'woke' today.\"\n\n\"Right now, we're seeing racially conservative pundits and politicians positioning themselves as adversaries of the multiracial Black Lives Matter movement,\" said Lopez Bunyasi. \"One of the rhetorical tools they are using is the maligning of a term that has been in use by Black people and in Black politics for well over a hundred years.\"\n\nVirginia GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin cruised to victory in 2021 riding a wave of parental anger over teaching inclusive history in public schools.\n\nKeneshia Grant, a political scientist at Howard University, said Youngkin's success was part of an intentional pushback against marginalized communities, which includes misunderstanding terms like woke, critical race theory, and LGBTQ rights.\n\n\"He ends up successfully using the fear that people have about teaching students Black history or American history through the guise of CRT and successfully uses that to motivate a base,\" Grant said. \"They are doing this because they think it will help them win. And we have evidence that sometimes it actually does help them win.\"\n\nWhat's telling is that despite the conservative backlash most Americans don't view \"woke\" negatively heading into the 2024 presidential contest.\n\nA March 2023 USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll found that 56% of Americans said it means \"to be informed, educated on, and aware of social injustices.\"\n\nBut the efforts to re-define \"woke\" have worked with a significant portion of the country. Roughly 39% of those surveyed agree with the Republican definition,\"to be overly politically correct and police others' words.\"\n\n\"Racial resentment and grievance are certainly one of those things that have been very effectively used to mobilize a certain segment of the Republican population for a long time,\" said Gillespie.\n\nReporter Phillip M. Bailey contributed to this story."

Because it's come up a couple of times, and just I want to make sure we're on the same page.\"\n\nMandel: *GULP* ... well, errr, ummm ...\n\nI wish I were exaggerating.\n\nHer actual response was: \"So, I mean, woke is sort of the idea that (long, uncomfortable pause) ... This is going to be one of those moments that goes viral. I mean, 'woke' is something that's very hard to define, and we've spent an entire chapter defining it. It is sort of the understanding that we need to totally reimagine and redo society in order to create hierarchies of oppression. (Another uncomfortable pause.) Sorry, it's hard to explain in a 15-second sound bite.\"\n\nThe social media landscape had a seizure so intense that Elon Musk decided to let everyone keep their Twitter verification checks for free.\n\nFor whatever it's worth, live interviews are tricky, and I hate them, but if I wrote a book in which I dedicated a chapter to defining a term, I would at least read that chapter before bragging about it.\n\nMandel, who writes for the Deseret News (owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) then put together a defense essay for Newsweek that started with this: \"It's a delicate balancing act, promoting a book with six kids at home full-time.\" In the next sentence, she describes the premise of her book as how she believes \"woke ideology is upending American childhood.\"\n\nSo, yeah. She just blew it like a snotty nose during allergy season. (And she never did define the term in the explanation piece.)\n\nNow, there's a scramble across the mainstream media landscape to get linguistics experts and political analysts and anyone else with an opinion and a platform to discuss a word - not the problems that led to the need for such an expression or potential solutions to those problems - but the word itself.\n\nYou see what's happening here? You would if you were \"woke.\"\n\nLet's see whether I can settle this.\n\n\"Woke\" is a colloquial, informal and familiar present tense of the verb \"awake.\"\n\nIt's a common person's way of saying, \"I'm up, and I see what's going on,\" and it was popularized in Black culture by R&B artists Erykah Badu and Donald \"Childish Gambino\" Glover .\n\nIn the context of political discourse, it's a simple warning to stay on top of political, social and cultural developments that can have massive negative effects.\n\nFor example: \"Yo! Pay attention! They want you to see there's a new shopping center coming to the neighborhood, but what's that doing to property values in the area? And do you think the company that opened the location has any Black people on its board of directors? You better stay woke.\"\n\nFrankly, I can't stand it.\n\nWhen I hear educated people use this term, I get the feeling that they're making fun of disenfranchised people who aren't using an affectation when they make nonstandard grammatical decisions.\n\nEither that or it feels like elites are linguistically slumming it to gain support they haven't earned.\n\nAside from that, we have entirely too many other things to focus on, and some of them are even good.\n\nLike, I want to stand on a table and scream about the new moon mission and how NASA has selected a Black pilot as one of the four astronauts for the flight. But we're talking about this, instead.\n\nAnyway, yo, pay attention. They want to keep you divided, but there's real progress being made.\n\nStay woke.\n\nGreg Moore is a columnist with The Arizona Republic, where this column first published .

      "text": "What does 'woke' mean? For conservatives, it's so much more than political correctness.\n\nAs I write this, I am enjoying my morning coffee in a mug that proclaims \"awake not woke.\" A friend gave it to me, and I think it's funny.\n\n\"Woke\" is certainly the word of the moment. But what does it really mean?\n\nI've been asked this numerous times by readers when the term comes up in one of my columns ( and it often does ).\n\nIt's a fair question. Depending on whom you ask, you can get a very different answer.\n\nThat's especially true when it comes to political party. Democrats seem to see the word as a badge of honor, while Republicans have harnessed it as something that must be stopped - and a blanket term for everything they dislike about the left.\n\nA new USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll found a that majority of Americans, including 78% of Democrats and 37% of Republicans , see \"woke\" in a positive light, and define the term as \"to be informed, educated on and aware of social injustices.\"\n\nYet nearly 40% of those surveyed (and 56% of Republicans) say the word constitutes something more negative, \"to be overly politically correct and police others' words.\"\n\nPolitical correctness is part of the right's aversion to wokeness. Yet \"woke\" has come to hit on much deeper societal concerns, and that's why it has become a touchstone for many conservatives.\n\nAt the recent Conservative Political Action Conference, the word was a common refrain among declared Republican presidential candidates, including former President Donald Trump, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy (recently dubbed the \" CEO of Anti-Woke, Inc. \").\n\n\"I'm running for president to renew an America that's proud and strong, not weak and woke,\" Haley said at CPAC .\n\nOthers are getting on board, too. Earlier this year, Indiana GOP Rep. Jim Banks has recently formed the \" Anti-Woke Caucus ,\" with an aim to \" defund wokeness .\"\n\nNo one, however, has elevated the fight against \"woke\" more than Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. He has repeated frequently that his state is where \"woke goes to die\" and that he'll never surrender to the \"woke mob.\"\n\nDeSantis has riled many on the left for pushing legislation that actively seeks to suppress woke ideology in classrooms and workplaces. He even signed a law named the \" Stop WOKE Act .\"\n\nIf he gets into the 2024 presidential race, as expected, you can bet this anti-woke mantra will be central to his campaign.\n\nDespite its frequent use among politicians, it's infrequently defined, leaving most of us to our own definitions. If conservatives are going to keep using \"woke\" as a rallying cry, there needs to be a much clearer consensus about its meaning and what the right hopes to accomplish.\n\nA DeSantis spokesperson has called it a slang term for \"progressive activism\" and a \"general belief in systemic injustices in the country.\" That's pretty vague.\n\nIn an attempt to get a clearer definition, I reached out to several organizations on the right.\n\nZach Goldberg, a self-proclaimed \" wokeness studies scholar \" at the Manhattan Institute, says \"woke\" means more than just left-wing radicalism. He says the essence of woke is \"the belief that outcome disparities between groups - be they races, sexes, or 'genders,' etc. - are largely if not entirely the product of oppressive social forces and structures.\"\n\nI think that hits on what DeSantis and others are worried about. The woke ideology is about more than preferred pronouns and avoiding offensive words. It's a view of America that pits \"oppressors\" against the \"oppressed.\"\n\nCarrie Sheffield, a senior fellow at the Independent Women's Forum, says \"woke\" has evolved over the years, much like feminism. The word originally was used to signal awareness of racism and injustice . But, Sheffield says, its meaning has swung so far to the left,  it now undermines tenets of Western civilization such as capitalism .\n\nShe argues that critical race theory - as it has been adapted at the K-12 level - is teaching schoolchildren to dislike each other .\n\nThat kind of division is dangerous to the future of our country. If that's what Republicans mean when they're talking about \"woke,\" they need to do a better job explaining it.\n\nIngrid Jacques is a columnist at USA TODAY.

      "text": "Think you know where 'woke' comes from? Inside the word's musical history - and influence.\n\nSomeday when the cultural moment that many have called \"The Great A woke ning\" is finally, mercifully, over, Americans of all races should fight to give African Americans their word back .\n\nLess than 10 years ago, \"woke\" was a word so deeply layered with history and meaning it could evoke years of pain suffered by descendants of slaves coming of age in Jim Crow America.\n\nYou don't have to be African American, however, to feel its history. The word woke is seminal to our larger culture in ways most of us have never understood.\n\nIt's one of the great words in American English, and it should be preserved in its purest form.\n\nAt the moment it is being hijacked by politics - first by white liberals then by white conservatives.\n\nThis week the word \"woke\" is igniting a family spat within the 2024 Republican primary for president, pitting Donald Trump against his former apprentice, Ron DeSantis.\n\nDeSantis, the Florida governor, uses the word frequently to describe an ideology steeped in identity politics that has taken over our universities, media, large corporations, medicine, arts, entertainment and sports.\n\nTrump argues he doesn't use the word: \"I don't like the term 'woke' because I hear, 'Woke, woke, woke.' It's just a term they use, half the people can't even define it, they don't know what it is.\"\n\nThere's a good chance none of us would know the word today had the Library of Congress not set out in the 1930s to preserve American folk music in the South .\n\nThat project took library archivists to Louisiana where they discovered a little-known African American blues singer named Huddie William Ledbetter , or \" Lead Belly .\"\n\nThe archivists recorded on aluminum discs Lead Belly and his 12-string guitar, preserving what would become some of the great Blues standards such as \"Cotton Fields,\" \"Goodnight, Irene\" and \"Rock Island Line.\"\n\nIn explaining to The Smithsonian Folkways Collection why he wrote the song \"Scottsboro Boys,\" about the nine African American young men falsely accused of raping two white women in Alabama in 1931, Lead Belly admonishes his listeners, \" Best stay woke !\"\n\nIt's possibly the first recorded instance of the word .\n\nAs Huddie Ledbetter used \"woke,\" it meant that when you're a Black person traveling through a deeply racist state such as Alabama, you need to know what you're dealing with - a highly refined form of evil. Lead Belly would know. He traveled the byways of Louisiana, Alabama and Texas singing his songs and confronting white bigotry and its violence against Black people.\n\nIn a way that history has of surprising us, Lead Belly would become essential to white culture in America and Great Britain. All white people reading this and learning the name Huddie Ledbetter for the first time should know that they have likely felt his influence, far more than they could have imagined.\n\nThe driving rhythms of Lead Belly's version of \" Rock Island Line \" would in the 1950s inspire an early British pop singer named Lonnie Donegan , who adopted the song's musical style called skiffle, a mash of American folk, blues and jazz.\n\nDonegan became \"the king\" of the British \"skiffle craze\" and eventually inspired new skiffle groups across England, such as Liverpool's The Quarrymen, then led by an aspiring singer-songwriter named John Lennon .\n\nBy 1960, the group would evolve into The Beatles, and its lead guitarist, George Harrison, would one day tell an interviewer, \"If there was no Lead Belly, there would have been no Lonnie Donegan; no Lonnie Donegan, no Beatles. Therefore, no Lead Belly, no Beatles ,\" as recounted by Smithsonian Magazine.\n\nLead Belly was inspiring many musical forms of that day. Those same early recordings that preserved his music and the word \"woke\" found their way into the imagination of another young artist of some note .\n\n\"Somebody - somebody I'd never seen before - handed me a Lead Belly record with the song 'Cottonfields' on it,\" recalled Bob Dylan in his 2017 lecture to the Noble (Prize) Foundation. \"That record changed my life right then and there. Transported me into a world I'd never known.\n\n\"It was like an explosion went off. Like I'd been walking in darkness and all of the sudden the darkness was illuminated. It was like somebody laid hands on me. I must have played that record a hundred times.\"\n\nBy the end of the century, Lead Belly's influence on American popular music was its own constellation of stars. Artists covering his songs included Gene Autry, Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Tom Jones, Harry Belafonte, Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, The Beach Boys, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin, Tom Petty, the Grateful Dead.\n\nA young musician in Seattle named Kurt Cobain said he was inspired after hearing Beat Generation author William S. Burroughs tell an interviewer that the new rock 'n' roll kids should just throw away their guitars and listen to Lead Belly .\n\nOur chattering classes, and I include myself among them, have been poor caretakers of the word \"woke.\" When this battle over wokeness is finally over, it would do us well to give the word back.\n\nAnd while we're at it, maybe we could make the name Huddie \"Lead Belly\" Ledbetter, one of America's most important songwriters, as easily recognizable as, say, Ringo Starr.\n\nPhil Boas is an editorial columnist with The Arizona Republic, where this column was first published ."

What are woke policies and what has President Trump done to end them?\n\nPresident Trump's vow the United States \"will be woke no longer \" during his March 4 address to a joint session of Congress continues to reverberate in California and across the country.\n\nWoke or wokeness was a target of the president's campaign during the election season and since the start of his second presidential term, Trump has rolled back federal policies and initiatives that he declared \"woke.\"\n\nBut what is woke, and what are woke policies? And how will the end of woke impact Americans? Let's take a look.\n\nIn a polarized political environment like the one currently in the United States, a charged term like \"woke\" can mean different things to different people.\n\n\"If you ask people what woke is, I think what they mean is they want to stand against people who are engaging in some type of advocacy for marginalized people,\" Andra Gillespie, political scientist at Emory University, told USA TODAY.\n\n\"It's kind of this lumping together of anybody whose views could be construed as being progressive on issues related to identity and civil rights.\"\n\nConservative activists , lawmakers and politicians have used the term \"woke\" as a slam against progressive values and liberal initiatives.\n\nBlack Americans have used the term \"woke\" since at least the early-to-mid 20th century to mean being alert to racial and social injustice.\n\nA version of the term was first used by Pan-African activist Marcus Garvey as early as 1923 . It was later popularized by Blues artists such as Lead Belly, who used it when singing about the Scottsboro Boys, a group of nine Black teenagers who were falsely accused of raping two white women on a train in northeast Alabama in 1931.\n\nAs the Black Lives Matter movement began after the police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014, \"woke\" expanded outside of Black communities into the larger public lexicon.\n\nPresident Trump uses the word \"woke\" to include issues and associated policies that touch on the lives of minority groups, including women, immigrants and LGBTQ+ individuals.\n\nLGBTQ rights: A movement advocating for the equal treatment and elimination of discriminatory policies hurting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people, according to Britannica .\n\nGender-affirming care: Access to services such as mental health, medical, surgical and nonmedical services for nonbinary and transgender people, according to the Office of Population Affairs.\n\nDEI/diversity, equity and inclusion measures: A form of hiring and employee retention meant to reduce biases and improve the accessibility of jobs for disenfranchised minorities. Companies such as Harley-Davidson and Tractor Supply have faced boycotts over these measures .\n\nCritical race theory: A social and intellectual movement that studies the relationship between race, racism and power, as described by theorists Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic in their book, \"Critical Race Theory: The Cutting Edge.\"\n\nSince assuming office, President Trump has signed a number of executive orders and issued directives to federal agencies that are in keeping with his crusade against woke.\n\nThe Trump administration put on hold grant, loan and other financial assistance programs to give White House staffers time to assess them for \"woke gender ideology.\"\n\nThe memo was quickly rescinded after a federal judge paused it, but the new president made his funding priorities clear: Programs that support diversity, equity and inclusion programs, transgender issues and environmental justice will not get White House backing.\n\nPresident Trump has signed executive orders that would bar transgender student athletes from playing women's sports , end DEI initiatives in the federal government and affirmative action in federal contracting , deny federal funding to \"sanctuary\" jurisdictions and withdraws federal recognition for transgender individuals ."

      "text": "What is woke culture? Is Kamala Harris woke?\n\nThe term \"woke\" has evolved significantly from its original meaning. Traditionally, it means being awake or conscious, but in recent years, it has taken on a broader, more political significance.\n\nThe term has become particularly contentious in the political arena. Vice President Kamala Harris, who has advocated for \"staying woke,\" has faced criticism from conservative figures, including former President Donald Trump. As Harris prepares to run for president against Trump, her past statements on being \"woke\" have resurfaced, fueling political debate.\n\nThe Free Speech Center describes woke to suggest \"someone who has been oblivious to social issues, but then awakens to the see the world differently.\"\n\nThe term can be traced back to a 1938 song about the Scottsboro Boys, nine Black teenagers falsely accused of rape in Alabama. Despite clear evidence of their innocence, they were convicted by an all-white jury. According to Human Rights Careers, \"woke\" originally meant being smart and alert to racism within the Black community.\n\nIn recent times, particularly during the Black Lives Matter movement, \"woke\" regained prominence as a call to recognize and combat police brutality and systemic racism. It has since broadened to encompass various progressive political concerns.\n\nHowever, the term has also garnered negative connotations. Merriam-Webster Dictionary notes that \"woke\" can imply political liberalism or progressivism perceived as extreme or unreasonable.\n\nToday, \"woke\" is often used to describe identity politics, with phrases like \"wokeness,\" \"wokeism,\" or \"woke ideology\" entering the lexicon\n\nConservative politicians, including former President Donald Trump, have rallied against the \" woke ideology \" of Americans battling for diversity, inclusion, and equity efforts in the workforce, public schools and in legislation.\n\nA clip from 2017 of Vice President Kamala Harris saying \"everybody needs to be woke\" has resurfaced and caused a stir. It was also posted on her social media at the time.\n\nKamala Harris made the \"woke\" statement during a 2017 conference when she was a U.S. Senator speaking with Laurene Powell Jobs.\n\nThe subject touched on immigration and environmental issues. Harris then spoke out against the Trump administration's drug policies and immigration policies, and then called on Americans to be \"woke.\"\n\nHarris said during the interview that it was \"good for democracy,\" for people on all side to be engaged with what was going on. She called on Americans to be active and \"woke.\" She later posted on her social media , \"We have to stay active. We have to stay woke.\""

      "text": "Letters: White Americans are being conned. There is nothing to fear about being 'woke'\n\nYou might wonder why the likely Republican candidates for president seem so obsessed with the term \"woke.\"\n\nIt's simple: the word's definition is vague and generally unfamiliar to white Americans. Savvy politicians can make it sound un-American and pejorative in the context of their hateful political rhetoric.\n\nThe Black community created that historically informal expression.\n\nThey know that in their everyday lives it means staying aware of what's happening around and to them. But sadly, they also know what these presidential candidates mean when they use it. Republicans have borrowed and are redefining the word to be something dark, frightening, and ugly.\n\nThe very fact that it is not a common \"white\" term makes its meaning easily manipulable for sinister political ends.\n\nRegardless of what these politicians say, their rant about woke has nothing to do with promoting freedom , democracy, education, or social justice. It has everything to do with spreading electoral division, racism, and white supremacy.\n\nOf course they can't say that.\n\nSo, they use this code.\n\nMark Mathys, Columbus\n\nThe city of Columbus missed an opportunity to justify the new law restricting magazine capacity.\n\nHad they catalogued all of the injuries and deaths occurring in Columbus for the last several years, pointing out how many of them involved high-capacity magazines, and how this law would have reduced or eliminated injuries, I am certain all of the objectors would understand the value of this ordinance.\n\nJohn Platt, Arlington\n\nOh, those poor Columbus gunowners who have \"been made to feel like a criminal.\"\n\nThey have to give up a few bullets in order to remain lawful. Never mind that they can still shoot and/or kill anything or anyone they want.  They just can't do it as fast as they previously could.\n\nThey might need to reload. Such a shame.\n\nNow let's look at women and their health care. They have lost all autonomy and lawfulness in caring for their own bodies. Men can still impregnate women all they want (legally or illegally, gently or roughly), yet women have no say in what happens to their bodies from that moment on. Women must break the law to take care of their own bodies.\n\nBut let's feel sorry for men who have lost their right to kill things or people quickly. Forgive me for having no empathy for gunowners.\n\nLibby Wetherholt, Columbus\n\nEverything is saying that the Willow Project will do terrible things to the environment and at 16 I'm already terrified of that.\n\nI've always wanted to have kids in the future but the more that this goes on it seems like that won't happen. I wouldn't want to subject them to a dying Earth.\n\nI don't want to subject myself to a dying Earth.\n\nEvery day I think about how global warming is only getting worse and that my friends and I will suffer for it as adults. Please stop this project, the damage would be horrific, and it scares me.\n\nJillian Jackson, Mason\n\nI read with interest the March 2 guest columns of Colin Gabler (' Is gun violence discrimination against Americans? ') and Amber Estis (\" Gun safety starts at home; too many kids are dying\" ).\n\nGabler's thesis is provocative and probably reflective of the increasing desperation that many of us are experiencing in the face of increasing daily gun violence in America.\n\nEstis is doing extremely important school-based early intervention training to promote gun safety. One critical factor overlooked by both Gabler and Estis - and by most people who report and write about our gun violence problem - is that the perpetrators are almost exclusively male.\n\nMost women appear to be able to responsibly own and manage guns in our society. Perhaps, then, gun violence could be construed as discrimination against women.\n\nBut regardless of the framework we use to describe gun violence, we need to focus on boys and men, supporting them and teaching them that guns and killing aren't the only way to deal with anger and frustration and rage.\n\nIt requires a lot of work, but it can be done. And the first step is to publicly acknowledge and accept that boys and men need help.\n\nOur work should focus on them.\n\nCharles Emery, psychology professor emeritus, Ohio State University\n\nKudos to the Columbus Symphony Orchestra and it's marvelous conductor , Rossen Milanov .\n\nFor those of us who attended March 3 reading of Mahler's Symphony #9, we experienced a world-class, transformative performance.\n\nThe musicians of the orchestra were in top form, producing some truly beautiful, thrilling moments. I was especially moved by the playing of the French Horn section throughout.\n\nIt was in the final minutes of the last movement, however, where Maestro Milanov and the string section shone. Those were sublime moments that have lasted long since leaving the Ohio Theater. Thanks to the CSO for enriching our life in central and southeastern Ohio.\n\nDavid Burton, Athens\n\nI'm responding to the March 4 article \"GOP senators: Chip factories further 'woke' agenda\" regarding on-site childcare at chip factories.\n\nAnti-abortion Republicans don't want onsite childcare despite known benefits to mothers, children, dads, citing a \"woke agenda\" and increased building costs.\n\nThey have yet to step up with care for the child after he/she is born: childcare, school funding, adequate housing and health care. Consider building costs compared to the cost of raising a child to adulthood. I'm becoming increasingly embarrassed to say I'm a registered Republican.\n\nJoan Buffington, Hilliard\n\nThe recent bipartisan cooperation between Ohio senators Sherrod Brown and J.D. Vance, and the comments made by the latter, have swayed my opinion on our junior senator.\n\nDuring the election cycle, I had opposed Vance as I would disagree with any quasi-nativist demagogue. I was under the impression that he would be a mouthpiece for former President Donald Trump, to the expense of local issues.\n\nLast week, Vance and Brown jointly introduced to Congress the Railway Safety Act of 2023, in direct response to the East Palestine train disaster.\n\nThe bill would tighten railway standards and protect our state and country from railway industry profiteering.\n\nRegulations that had been stripped away in previous years can be re-imposed to prevent the negligence of massive corporations from abusing our communities.\n\nWith any luck, further action can be taken to hold Norfolk Southern directly responsible. For now, I can be happy knowing that our elected officials have not yet forgotten where they came from.\n\nZane Protus, Pickerington\n\nNote from Opinion Editor Amelia Robinson: I have heard one phrase time and time again since assuming the Columbus Dispatch opinion and community engagement editor role a little more than two years ago: The Columbus Way.\n\nThe Columbus Partnership describes it as \"the practice of community stewardship, anchored by a set of values and principles that power progress in our region.\"\n\nSmart Columbus describes it as \"the unique community collaborations between the city, the businesses headquartered and located in the region, and nonprofit and academic institutions that make up the Columbus community.\n\nIs that what the Columbus Way means to you?\n\nLet me know your thoughts in a letter to the editor of 200 words or less emailed to Letters@Dispatch.com.\n\nInclude your name, address and daytime phone number.

How the term is used now is far from its original meaning\n\nManage your account\n\nThe word \"woke\" is tossed around a lot in political and social debates all around the country. It's ramping up as Election Day draws near.\n\nThe term carries different meanings and strong emotional connections for people, and it has changed over the years. So what is the history and the meaning of the word \"woke\"? And why you can expect to see it become a frequently used term in the presidential election in November?\n\nThe term \"woke\" used to have a different meaning. It was first used by Pan-African activist Marcus Garvey as early as 1923 . \"Woke\" was meant to acknowledge the struggles of African Americans and a word of empowerment for some Black people.\n\nWhen the Black Lives Matter movement began after the police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, \"woke\" expanded outside of Black communities into the larger public lexicon and became co-opted or appropriated for various political agendas , the definition of the word has evolved and come to mean different things to different people.\n\nThe term woke has been used by conservative figures as pejorative term to describe the following social justice initiatives:\n\nLGBTQ rights: A movement advocating for the equal treatment and elimination of discriminatory policies hurting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people, according to Britannica .\n\nGender-affirming care: Access to services such as mental health, medical, surgical and nonmedical services for nonbinary and transgender people, according to the Office of Population Affairs.\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion measures: A form of hiring and employee retention meant to reduce biases and improve the accessibility of jobs for disenfranchised minorities. Companies such as Harley-Davidson and Tractor Supply have faced boycotts over these measures .\n\nCritical race theory: A social and intellectual movement that studies the relationship between race, racism and power, as described by theorists Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic in their book, \"Critical Race Theory: The Cutting Edge.\"\n\nA USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll from March 2023 demonstrates the varying ideas for what 'woke' means among Americans between Republicans and Democrats.\n\nOf those surveyed , 56% percent say the term means \"to be informed, educated on and aware of social injustices.\" That includes not only three-fourths of Democrats but also more than a third of Republicans. Overall, 39% say the word reflects what has become the GOP political definition, \"to be overly politically correct and police others' words.\" 56% of Republicans agreed with this view.\n\nThe term will likely continue to be a point of contention heading into the November election.\n\nFor years, conservative activists, lawmakers and politicians have used the term \"woke\" as a slam against progressive values and liberal initiatives.\n\nKnox County Mayor Glenn Jacobs has previously warned Republicans against allowing a \"woke\" culture to flourish. He posted on X to say the \"wokeness is weakness\" and it has no place in schools or military. He didn't detail what he meant.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk said his estranged daughter Vivian Jenna Wilson was \"killed\" by the \"woke mind virus\" and claimed he was tricked into signing documents agreeing to gender-affirming care procedures for her.\n\nUSA TODAY contributed to this report\n\nThis article originally appeared on Knoxville News Sentinel: What does 'woke' mean in politics?

      "text": "How the Woke Right Replaced the Woke Left\n\nManage your account\n\nUpdated at 1:19 p.m. E.T. on February 20, 2025\n\nOne of the defining features of the social-justice orthodoxy that swept through American culture between roughly the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012 to Hamas's assault on Israel in 2023 was the policing of language. Many advocates became obsessed with enforcing syntactical etiquette and banishing certain words.\n\n\"Wokeness,\" as it's known, introduced the asymmetrical capitalization of the letter b in Black but not the w in white . It forced Romance languages like Spanish to submit to gender-neutral constructions such as Latinx . It called for the display of pronouns in email signatures and social-media bios. It replaced a slew of traditional words and phrases: People were told to stop saying master bedroom , breastfeeding , manpower , and brown-bag lunch , and to start saying primary bedroom , chestfeeding , workforce , and sack lunch . At the extreme, it designated certain words-such as crazy -beyond redemption.\n\nThis was often a nuisance and sometimes a trap, causing the perpetual sense that one might inadvertently offend and consequently self-destruct. In certain industries and professions, wrongspeak had tangible consequences. In 2018, Twitter introduced a policy against \" dehumanizing language \" and posts that \"deadnamed\" transgender users (or referred to them by their pre-transition names). Those who were judged to have violated the rules could be banned or suspended.\n\nDonald Trump promised that his election would free Americans from ever having to worry about saying the wrong thing again. He even signed an executive order titled \" Restoring Freedom of Speech and Ending Federal Censorship .\" But a few weeks into his administration, we hardly find ourselves enjoying a culture of free speech and tolerance for opposing views. Almost immediately, the president did the opposite of what he'd promised and put together his own linguistic proscriptions. Most of the banned words related to gender and diversity, and this time the rules had the force of the government behind them.\n\n\"Fear that other words could run afoul of the new edicts led anxious agency officials to come up with lists of potentially problematic words on their own,\" wrote Shawn McCreesh in The New York Times . These included: \"Equity. Gender. Transgender. Nonbinary. Pregnant people. Assigned male at birth. Antiracist. Trauma. Hate speech. Intersectional. Multicultural. Oppression. Such words were scrubbed from federal websites.\"\n\nPlus ça change. The government itself determining the limits of acceptable speech is undeniably far more chilling and pernicious-and potentially unconstitutional-than private actors attempting to do so. But what is most striking about this dismal back-and-forth is how well it demonstrates that the illiberal impulse to dictate what can and cannot be said is always fundamentally the same, whether it appears on the right or the left.\n\nAn extraordinary number of conservatives have ignored and even delighted in their side's astonishing hypocrisy. But a few consistent defenders of free speech have not gone along with what they see as the new \"woke right.\"\n\nThe pervasive and nitpicky control of language is a crucial, but far from the sole, component of the woke-right movement. Like its antithesis on the left, the woke right places identity grievance, ethnic consciousness, and tribal striving at the center of its behavior and thought. One of the best descriptions I can find of it comes from Kevin DeYoung, a pastor and seminary professor, in a 2022 article called \" The Rise of Right-Wing Wokeism .\" DeYoung, reviewing a book on Christian nationalism in The Gospel Coalition , argues that the book's \"apocalyptic vision - for all of its vitriol toward the secular elites-borrows liberally from the playbook of the left.\" It \"redefines the nature of oppression as psychological oppression\" and tells white and male right-wing Americans that they are the country's real victims. But \"the world is out to get you, and people out there hate you,\" DeYoung warns, \"is not a message that will ultimately help white men or any other group that considers themselves oppressed.\"\n\nAnother hallmark of wokeness is an overriding impulse to contest and revise the historical record in service of contemporary debates. The New York Times ' \"1619 Project,\" which reimagined this nation's founding, was emblematic of this trend from the left. But similar attempts are happening on the right. Last summer, the amateur historian Darryl Cooper caused an uproar when he made the case, on Tucker Carlson's podcast, that Winston Churchill was the real villain of World War II.\n\nThe compelled politesse of the left has been swapped out for the reflexive and gratuitous disrespect of the right. Representative Mary Miller of Illinois recently introduced Representative Sarah McBride, Congress's sole transgender member, as \"the gentleman from Delaware, Mr. McBride.\" The activist Christopher Rufo, one of the most belligerent voices on the right, endorsed the move: \"We are all tempted to be polite,\" he wrote on X. \"But complicity in the pronoun game is the opening ante for the entire lie. Once you agree to falsify reality, you have signaled your submission to the gender cult.\"\n\nSpeaking of falsifying reality: The Trump administration seems to be devoting a remarkable amount of energy toward making sure people call the Gulf of Mexico the \"Gulf of America.\" In the White House press room last week, the administration went so far as to eject Associated Press reporters because the publication refused to alter its stylebook to comply with the change. \"I was very up front in my briefing on Day 1 that if we feel that there are lies being pushed by outlets in this room, we are going to hold those lies accountable,\" the White House press secretary said . \"And it is a fact that the body of water off the coast of Louisiana is called the Gulf of America.\" European exploration records have referred to El Golfo de México since the 16th century.\n\nTrump supporters fell immediately into line. Representative Mike Collins of Georgia-in a gesture encapsulating the digital-political fusion that has come to define the woke right-tweeted trollingly, \"Stop deadnaming the Gulf of America.\"\n\nJust as corporations genuflected at the altar of wokeness during and after the summer of 2020-posting their identical black squares on Instagram and Facebook and, in the case of Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, and CBS Sports, pausing their content for a symbolic eight minutes and 46 seconds-some of the country's most prominent companies have preemptively submitted to the woke right's new power play. Google and Apple have both relabeled the Gulf of Mexico on their map apps with Trump's risible neologism. And an NPR analysis of regulatory filings found that \"at least a dozen of the largest U.S. companies have deleted some, or all, references to 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' and 'DEI' from their most recent annual reports to investors.\"\n\nSome state leaders are following in Trump's footsteps. In January, Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders issued the \"Executive Order to Respect the Latino Community by Eliminating Culturally Insensitive Words From Official Use in Government\"-a loquacious way to say she ordered state agencies to stop using the word Latinx . Others, including Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, were woke right avant la lettre . The 2022 Individual Freedom Law, paradoxically known as the \"Stop WOKE\" act-developed under Rufo's guidance-imagines the state as one enormous, humid safe space. The legislation aggressively restricts speech in workplaces, K-12 schools, and public universities, and even encourages snitching on community members who dare to advance illicit perspectives.\n\nAll of these moves are ripe for mockery-and they deserve it. The scholar and provocateur James Lindsay gained a large online following in 2018 after he and two colleagues successfully placed a number of outrageously bogus papers in peer-reviewed academic journals focused on what Lindsay called \"grievance studies,\" including one text arguing that dogs engage in \"rape culture\" and another that rewrote Mein Kampf from a feminist point of view. Last year, Lindsay applied the same test to the woke right, cribbing 2,000 words from Marx and Engels's Communist Manifesto and submitting them as a critique of liberalism to The American Reformer , a respected platform in conservative Christian media. The gag ran under the title \"The Liberal Consensus and the New Christian Right.\"\n\n\"What the Woke Right fundamentally don't understand as they make their bid for power now, and why they'll lose,\" Lindsay wrote last week on X, \"is that none of us want more ideological crazy stuff. We don't want another freaking movement. We want to go back to our lives.\" The obligation to call people aliens or unlearn the name of a body of water appears every bit as petty as the prohibition on describing boring things as \"lame.\" More than that, it amounts to a politics of brute domination, a forced and demoralizing expression of subservience that only a genuine fanatic could abide.\n\nVoters in both parties are already signaling that the right's woke antics are unattractive to them. When it comes to its edgelord in chief, Elon Musk, an Economist /YouGov poll found that the share of Republicans who say he should have \"a lot\" of influence has dropped significantly over the past three months, to 26 percent. Seventeen percent say they want him to have no influence \"at all.\" Over the past two weeks, Trump's approval rating has fallen.\n\nThe truth is that most Americans bristle at wokeness from whichever direction it arrives. As the left is learning now, no victory can ever be final. The right's illiberal zeal only creates the conditions for an equal and opposite reaction to come.\n\nThis article originally referred to brave as being on a list of words to avoid. In fact, the list recommended avoiding brave as a noun, not avoiding the word entirely.\n\nArticle originally published at The Atlantic"

Conservative activists claim that it's inappropriate and indoctrinating youth, when it's definitionally a call to think for yourself. It's used against people of color and LGBTQ+ people when it was originally their term.\n\nThat's right - it's time to talk about \"woke.\"\n\nThe term \"woke\" was originally used in Black communities as a warning to be cautious of the potential dangers they face because of their race, such as lynchings or police brutality. Over time, it morphed to become a descriptor for someone who is conscious of social issues in their community, particularly those involving injustice, as defined by Merriam-Webster .\n\n\"Woke\" is used today as a synonym for \"liberal\" or \"progressive,\" though it was never intended to describe a specific political party.\n\nThe first recorded use of the phrase \"stay woke\" was in the 1938 song \"Scottsboro Boys\" by Blues musician Huddie Ledbetter, known by the artist name Lead Belly.\n\nThe song, about a group of nine Black boys who were falsely accused of raping two white women in Tennessee in 1931, features Lead Belly warning at the end: \"I made this little song about down there. So, I advise everybody, be a little careful when they go along through there - best stay woke, keep their eyes open.\"\n\nThe term gained prominence during the Civil Rights Movement as it was used in novels and essays throughout the 1960s, becoming a staple in African American Vernacular English (AAVE). It entered the popular lexicon in 2014 during the beginnings of the Black Lives Matter movement after Michael Brown, an unarmed Black man, was killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\nToday, someone who is \"woke\" is someone who is aware of the social injustices occurring around them. Other advocacy movements co-opted the term after Ferguson , distancing \"woke\" from its racial origins and aligning it with progressivism broadly.\n\nAs more left-leaning people began using the term, conservatives also began using it as an insult. Republican politicians now weaponize \"woke\" as a nonspecific criticism of progressive policies and activism, despite being unable to define it .\n\nConservatives denouncing \"woke\" do not state that they believe it refers to something other than injustice - they incorrectly believe that injustice does not exist, and that any attempts to address it are somehow reverse discrimination .\n\nThe \"woke mind virus\" is an insult used by conservatives to suggest that progressives have been brainwashed, comparing social justice to indoctrination. The term was popularized by Elon Musk, who also could not define it when asked and only vaguely gestured to \"anti-meritocratic\" or anti-free speech values.\n\nMusk is currently leading the so-called \"Department of Government Efficiency,\" despite not being elected by the public nor confirmed by Congress (anti-meritocratic). The Twitter/X CEO has also been accused of censoring those he does not agree with, including LGBTQ+ accounts and terms (anti-free speech).\n\nMusk infamously used the term during an interview where he claimed the \"woke mind virus\" killed one of his children , Vivian Wilson. Wilson is not dead - she is just transgender , and has disowned Musk over his \"cruel\" treatment during childhood .\n\nBeing \"woke\" in the LGBTQ+ community means being aware of the challenges people face because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. The term has been used in advocacy for LGBTQ+ rights alongside racial justice movements, as people of color - particularly Black trans women - have played an instrumental role in queer activism.\n\nWhile there is heavy overlap between queer communities and communities of color, LGBTQ+ people have not been as enthusiastic in using the term as conservatives have been in applying it to them. Republicans across the country have used the vague \"woke\" descriptor to justify censoring content that involves race or LGBTQ+ identities.\n\nDonald Trump recently claimed that the U.S. is \"woke no longer\" while promoting his executive orders denying the existence of trans people and revoking 1960s civil rights protections . Florida's Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, infamously promoted and signed into law two bills, the \"Stop WOKE Act\" and \"don't say gay\" law, which prohibit discussing racism or LGBTQ+ identities in public school classrooms."

While traditional Democrats may still be pushing the idea of reaching across the aisle and finding a way to bring a fractured country together, this online faction is taking the gloves off and going \"Dark Woke.\"\n\nThere aren't strict boundaries in place for what qualifies as Dark Woke, which has likely played into uncertainty about what it stands for, and if it's something to be embraced.\n\nAccording to The Guardian , the idea began trending following an interaction between Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the woman behind the alt-right social media account @LibsofTikTok, Chaya Raichik. Raichik suggested Trump should sue Ocasio-Cortez for saying she didn't want to \"celebrate rapists\" by attending events surrounding the inauguration.\n\n\"Oh, are you triggered? Cry more,\" Ocasio-Cortez replied , throwing a once-popular phrase among the right back at them.\n\nThis type of response has become more common online in recent years, as conservative influencers have had public meltdowns about Pride displays, trans people drinking beer, and anything else that offends their delicate sensibilities.\n\nIn a lot of ways, this feels like the core of what's behind Dark Woke - treating MAGA the exact same way they've been treating everyone else. And if that means kicking civility to the curb, then so be it. Sorry, Michelle Obama, they went low and we're meeting them right there in the dirt.\n\nx.com\n\n\"my Grandma voted for Trump so i made sure she fell down the stairs.\"\n\nx.com\n\n\"my all time favourite #DarkWoke post.\"\n\nx.com\n\n\" #DarkWoke origins .\"\n\nx.com\n\n\"adding this to the #DarkWoke canon.\"\n\nx.com\n\n\"#DARKWOKE\"\n\nx.com\n\n\"i like that #DarkWoke is going mainstream cuz it really vindicates my idea that you gotta force your oppressors into submission.\"\n\nx.com\n\n\"deport everyone until only the native americans are left #DarkWoke\"\n\nx.com\n\n\"#darkwoke financial movement\"\n\nx.com\n\nBut no movement is a monolith, and some people embracing Dark Woke seem to have ditched the \"woke\" part in the process. Instead, they're using this \"gloves off\" approach as an excuse to throw out slurs and uncomfortable mockery , as long as it's aimed at MAGA.\n\nx.com\n\nThis particular approach has already drawn internal controversy and resulted in people losing interest. Not because they believe we need to keep pretending civility is still the law of the land, but because it just doesn't accomplish anything other than othering our own and treating their identities as something to be mocked. Rightwingers already do that for us, so why help them out?\n\nBut it's entirely possible to embrace Dark Woke without becoming a wannabe edgelord who's lost the plot. As one person on X pointed out, it's kind of even an internet-centric repackaging of punk.\n\nx.com\n\nThe debate over the finer points of what constitutes Dark Woke and what may or may not go too far will continue, but getting lost in that right now feels like missing the point.\n\nThe bottom line here is that people are tired of Democrats continuing to act as if we still operate in a society where decorum, rules, and rationality prevail. That's a fantasy world. Whatever has been unleashed with MAGA and the re-election of Trump isn't something that can be dismissed with a vote and a campaign donation. At least not while maintaining the status quo.\n\nSo the question becomes what do we do about it? How do we operate in a world where misinformation spreads like wildfire, fascists and bigots feel empowered by our leaders, and it takes something outlandish and shocking to cut through all the noise and algorithms?\n\nIs Dark Woke part of the answer? Who knows. All people do know is that something has to change."

      "text": "What Does 'Woke' Mean?\n\nManage your account\n\nIn his recent address to Congress , President Donald Trump declared that the United States is \"woke no longer.\" This statement signals a shift in the nation's cultural and political landscape. But what does \"woke\" truly mean, and how has its significance evolved over time?\n\nThe term \"woke\" originates from African-American Vernacular English (AAVE), where it initially meant being awake or alert. In the early 20th century, it began to embody a sense of awareness about social injustices, particularly racial discrimination. For instance, blues musician Lead Belly used the phrase \"stay woke\" in the 1930s. It was a caution to be vigilant against racial violence.\n\nThe term gained renewed prominence during the Black Lives Matter movement in the 2010s. Those using it urged individuals to stay informed about systemic injustices and to advocate for marginalized communities.\n\nOver time, the term expanded beyond its original context. It began to encompass a broader awareness of social issues, including gender equality, LGBTQ+ rights, and environmental concerns. However, this broadened application led to varied interpretations across the political spectrum.\n\nIn conservative circles \"woke\" has often been used disparagingly, critiquing what some perceive as overreach in social justice initiatives or political correctness. This shift is evident in political rhetoric, where \"woke\" is sometimes portrayed as a threat to traditional values or free speech. Similarly the term diversity, equity and inclusion or DEI has also been co-opted by conservatives and others against the practice. They claim DEI initiatives prioritize less-qualified candidates over more deserving ones.\n\nPresident Trump's recent proclamation that America is \"woke no longer\" shows his administration's intent to move away from policies and ideologies associated with progressive social movements. This sentiment reflects a broader backlash against \"woke\" culture, with critics arguing imposes restrictive norms and stifles open discourse.\n\nIn today's complex socio-political environment, it's important to approach the concept of \"woke\" with a discerning perspective:\n\nStay Informed : Engage with diverse sources to understand the multifaceted nature of social justice issues.\n\nCritical Engagement : Recognize the difference between performative activism and genuine efforts toward equity.\n\nCommunity Focus : Prioritize initiatives that directly benefit and uplift Black communities, ensuring that the core message of \"wokeness\"-awareness and action against injustice-remains central.\n\nThe post What Does 'Woke' Mean? appeared first on 21Ninety ."

Jennifer Granholm praised Mr. Kaine on Twitter as someone who \"is as decent, honorable, selfless [a] soul as you will ever meet. A man with the heart of a servant, who is 'woke.' ''\n\nHer endorsement provoked a flood of responses from liberals questioning whether the Virginia senator deserved the label because of his stances that they view unfavorably, such as supporting trade deals.\n\nMs. Granholm's tweet came as various commentators have been trying to explain \"woke.\" The most popular entry in the Urban Dictionary defines it as \"being aware\" and \"knowing what's going on in the community.\"\n\nBut such a definition is \"not quite that simple,\" said Charles Pulliam-Moore, writing in Fusion earlier this year. He noted it was popularized as a call to action associated with the Black Lives Matter movement, but that it \"has taken on a different, more complex meaning\" over time.\n\n\"Like most slang, the meaning of 'woke' changes depending on who's saying it, and to whom,\" he said. \"Among black people talking about Ferguson [Missouri], 'stay woke' might mean something like: 'stay conscious of the apparatus of white supremacy, don't automatically accept the official explanations for police violence, keep safe.' \"\n\nNow that its popularity has spread, he added, the word \"has slowly morphed into something that occasionally comes across as a derogatory jab at the very idea of staying 'woke.' \"\n\nIn another dissection in the New York Times Magazine, Amanda Hess described woke as \"the inverse of 'politically correct.' If 'P.C.' is a taunt from the right, a way of calling out hypersensitivity in political discourse, then 'woke' is a back-pat from the left, a way of affirming the sensitive.\"\n\nBustle's Maddy Foley pointed out that singer/activist Erykah Badu first used \"stay woke\" in her 2008 song \"Master Teacher,\" and that within a few years, \"the phrase had begun to gain popularity as a way of describing an informed, questioning, self-educating individual, which is essentially how we use it today.\"\n\nLike other pop-culture words such as \"cray-cray\" and \"throwing shade,\" it appears to be finding a home in the political realm. At last week's Republican National Convention, Jezebel writer Anna Merlan wrote of encountering veteran GOP strategist Karl Rove and asking him, \"How woke are you?\"\n\nMerlan added: \" 'I don't know what that is,' Rove said, a little irritably as he speed-walked away from us.\"\n\nShe also tweeted about an encounter with radio show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones: \"Alex Jones says he's '100 percent woke' after I explained what woke is.\"\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Chief executive Reed Hastings is a prominent Democratic donor in California and nationally. In 2020, about 98% of political contributions by Netflix employees went to Democrats , similar to outlays at other major tech companies.\n\nBut Netflix's advice to staff members who want to bring their progressive politics to work: not so fast.\n\nIn a wide-ranging corporate culture memo last month, the company said its viewers expected to be entertained by a diverse range of TV shows and movies. \"Not everyone will like - or agree with - everything on our service,\" it noted, an apparent reference to comedian Dave Chapelle's 2021 special that critics called transphobic and that prompted a Netflix employee walkout.\n\nCorporate America faces pressure to engage on social issues from guns to gay rights. But taking stands carries risks in politics and the marketplace.\n\nThe memo, which Netflix said had been under discussion for several months with employee feedback, warns that staff \"may need to work on titles you perceive to be harmful. If you'd find it hard to support our content breadth, Netflix may not be the best place for you.\"\n\nIn an era of polarized politics and social media outrage, American corporations face increasing pressure to take stances on hot-button social and cultural issues. That pressure is coming not just from consumers but also from younger employees, particularly in industries like tech and finance, who expect companies to reflect their progressive values and to speak out in defense of voting rights, LGBTQ equality, and abortion access in states like Texas and Georgia.\n\nBut the attempt by Netflix to tamp down internal revolts speaks to a parallel pressure: growing unease in corporate America that what critics call \"woke capitalism\" upsets some customers, and is increasingly fomenting a backlash from the right. As a result, corporations now face tough choices - at an intersection of both profits and ethics - about whether to be socially activist or attempt to stay neutral on social issues and focus on making money.\n\n\"We're starting to see a reaction,\" says Stephen Bainbridge, a law professor at University of California, Los Angeles who studies corporate governance. \"Companies are having to decide whether they're going to take sides or to market to everybody.\"\n\nAfter Florida Republicans passed a bill in March limiting discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in elementary schools, Disney, the state's largest employer, initially sought to avoid public attention for fear of becoming a \"political football,\" according to CEO Bob Chapek . But that passivity rattled many employees.\n\nThen, when Disney did speak out against the bill, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis pounced. He lambasted Disney for its \"woke\" politics and signed a bill to revoke the special tax district around its theme parks.\n\nMany Republicans had already been fuming at tech companies for censoring conservative voices on their platforms. Now, as the Florida governor's action shows, GOP leaders are broadening their critique to corporations that they accuse of advancing a liberal political agenda.\n\nRepublican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri singled out \"woke corporations like Disney\" as he proposed a federal bill designed to limit the entertainment giant's copyright protections, adding that the age of \"Republican handouts to Big Business is over.\"\n\nThe next flashpoint could be abortion, if an anticipated Supreme Court decision frees states to sharply limit or outright ban the practice. Citigroup, Amazon, and other large employers have already offered to help staff and families in Texas travel for abortion services after Republicans enacted a near-total ban. That raised the hackles of Republicans, who threatened retaliation: In May, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio introduced a bill that would prevent companies from reimbursing travel expenses for such purposes.\n\nGun control also pits GOP-run states against corporations that shun the gun industry. A Texas law - the first of its kind - bars state agencies from doing business with companies that discriminate against the gun industry, a barb aimed at Wall Street banks that previously vowed to cut credit to gun-makers. Texas requires banks to show compliance with its law, which predates last month's school shooting in Uvalde in which 19 children and two teachers were killed.\n\nOn Friday, chief executives of 228 private and public companies wrote to the U.S. Senate to urge \"bold urgent action\" on gun violence, without specifying any policies to enact. (No Wall Street banks signed the letter.) The House of Representatives passed a Democrat-written gun control bill on Wednesday that is highly unlikely to pass the Senate in its current form.\n\nAnd the Republican backlash extends beyond culture-war issues. The finance industry's pivot to sustainability as one of its benchmarks for investments has caused waves in GOP-run states with fossil fuel industries. Arkansas and West Virginia recently divested pension funds from asset-management giant Blackrock in protest of its adoption of ESG (environmental, social, and governance) goals that some Republicans call another sign of corporate overreach.\n\nWest Virginia Treasurer Riley Moore, a Republican, told The Associated Press: \"I don't think we're the party of big business anymore. We're the party of people - more specifically, we're the party of working people. And the problem that we have is with big banks and corporations right now trying to dictate how we're going to live our lives.\"\n\nTo the extent that Republicans wash their hands of left-leaning corporations, the result could be a political opportunity for Democrats.\n\nGreater backing from business could help frustrated liberals offset what they see as structural barriers to political power, given the strong conservative influence within institutions like the Senate and Supreme Court and the near death of major legislative reform.\n\nThat companies are being asked to play this role of Democratic ally on social issues speaks to the political deadlock in Washington and the polarization that has fueled it, says Kurt Ebenhoch, a longtime communications executive and consultant.\n\nIn the past, companies worked with politicians who wanted to appeal to a broad electorate. Today, that option has increasingly been disappearing. Most lawmakers represent safe seats, and their focus is on primary voters and building a national brand among partisans, which for Republicans means getting onto outlets like Fox News.\n\nThis is what makes Disney's high-profile clash with Governor DeSantis so jarring, says Mr. Ebenhoch. \"We didn't see those kinds of actions 20 or 30 years ago. Leaders were more pragmatic and more concerned about the middle,\" he says.\n\nToday, factions within both parties exhibit strong antipathy toward big business. Consider the left's ambitions to tax more corporate profits to pay for social programs, as well as to break up industry cartels, cap drug prices, and enact other regulatory reforms.\n\nThat views of big business have also soured on the right, for different reasons, should concern company boardrooms, says Professor Bainbridge.\n\n\"There's a resurgence of right-wing populism that has very little in common with left-wing populism other than a deep distrust of big business. That's the political dynamic of the moment. For the first time in a long time, you have strong populist wings in both parties that are skeptical of big business,\" he says.\n\nIn February, more than 150 corporations signed a letter to oppose Florida's education bill, dubbed by critics as \"Don't Say Gay.\" Disney was a notable exception. Pressure began to build on Mr. Chapek to join this opposition, which he eventually did on March 9. He also signed the letter and promised that Disney would produce more LBGTQ content, but that failed to assuage staff who organized walkouts at Disney theme parks and studios.\n\nAmong the demands of these employees was that Disney stop all investments in Florida until the education law is repealed. American capitalists historically used comparable get-tough strategies, such as factory lockouts and closures, to defeat local workplace organizers, says Darel Paul, a politics professor at Williams College in Massachusetts. Now the workers, not the shareholders, are urging action against a state and its elected officials.\n\nThat shift in power dynamics, and Mr. Chapek's fitful efforts to find a compromise, are a microcosm of how \"woke capitalism\" operates, says Professor Paul, author of \"Tolerance to Equality: How Elites Brought America to Same-Sex Marriage.\" Companies like Disney must compete to hire and retain young professionals. In turn, those professionals bring progressive values, often from elite colleges, and demand that management steps up on social issues.\n\n\"The professional class is the real driver here. Their values begin to spread to the wider managerial class,\" he says.\n\nIn Disney's case, empowered workers forced Mr. Chapek to go toe-to-toe with Governor DeSantis. Disney now faces the dissolution of Reedy Creek Improvement District, a semi-autonomous area it has run in Florida since 1967. And far from Disney's image being burnished, the row and the company's response led to a sharp drop in its consumer reputation in an annual survey of America's 100 top brands.\n\n\"They're realizing that letting their employees dictate their position is not a free lunch,\" says Professor Paul of Disney's management.\n\nTo be sure, many companies don't feel compelled to join culture wars. Most CEOs who speak publicly on such issues are concentrated in industries like tech, media, finance, and entertainment; not coincidentally, the majority are based in blue states like New York and California.\n\nThe views of these companies shouldn't carry more weight than others, says Vivek Ramaswamy, an entrepreneur and author of \"Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam.\" He reckons firms should focus on making profits and providing \"excellence,\" not using corporate power \"to advance political or social agendas that ought to be settled through free speech in the public square where every citizen's voice counts equally.\"\n\nMr. Ramaswamy recently founded an asset management company, backed by billionaire tech investor and Republican donor Peter Thiel, that eschews ESG goals. To Mr. Ramaswamy, CEOs who genuflect at employee demands to take social stances are only listening to an activist minority. \"There is no such thing as 'The Employees.' They're a diverse base of people with a diverse range of views, just like the citizens of this country,\" he says.\n\nNetflix isn't the first tech company to ask workers to check their politics at the door. In 2020, Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange in San Francisco, said it would become an apolitical workplace and offered severance pay to anyone who wanted to leave; at least 60 reportedly took the offer .\n\nBut that policy is an exception. Most companies recognize that younger employees expect to bring their values to work and want companies to stand for something more than making profits for shareholders, says Michal Barzuza, a professor of law at the University of Virginia who studies ESG investing. \"Millennials' reputation is that they bring their values to their economic activities,\" she says.\n\nResearch she co-authored found that the investment industry has adopted ESG goals in response to actual and perceived millennial behaviors, including a propensity to bring politics to the workplace and to shun companies and investments that breach their values. That these values lean left, and are shaping how CEOs respond publicly to social issues, reflects an asymmetry. \"The right is less inclined to bring these values to the market,\" she says.\n\nThat doesn't mean CEOs need to opine on every controversy, says Paul Argenti, a professor of management and corporate communications at Dartmouth and author of a widely cited 2020 Harvard Business Review article, \" When Should Your Company Speak Up About a Social Issue?\" The article offers a playbook for corporate choices on both words and actions, and how to prepare for when controversies hit.\n\n\"The main thing is to have a way of justifying your actions before things happen,\" he says. But in today's polarized marketplace, \"there are some things where you just can't win.\"\n\nProfessor Argenti predicts that multinationals based in red states will eventually relocate if legislators continue to attack the values these companies want to be seen championing, such as voting rights in states like Georgia. \"Delta doesn't just operate in Georgia, and the same goes for Coca-Cola. These are global companies that are trying to appeal to a wide variety of people, not just in that state,\" he says.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

He's skeptical that liberal-leaning corporations will swing hard to Democrats, despite their alignment on social and cultural issues, given the left's regulatory economic agenda. But that also creates an opening for companies to shape those policy choices.\n\nIn the end, political influence is far from the only yardstick of results after companies engage publicly, says Mr. Ebenhoch, the communications consultant. \"They sent an important message to an audience to show that they're taking a stand ... and spending some political capital.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Even the language is strewn with mines. For some politicians, that makes it easy to weaponize. Our reporter set out to supply some context.\n\nFollow this podcast:\n\nJune 02, 2023, 9:00 a.m. ET\n\nHow can a writer apply fairness to a debate on an issue that one side views as an urgent need, the other as delusion?\n\nMonitor correspondent Simon Montlake headed to Missouri to take a closer look at efforts there and in other red states to restrict gender transition for minors, which is emerging as a key issue in the 2024 campaign.\n\n\"It's clearly an animating point on the right of American politics,\" he says on the Monitor's \"Why We Wrote This\" podcast. At least 16 states now ban or restrict medical interventions such as puberty blockers for those under 18.\n\nThere is also a debate within the medical community on the long-term impact of such treatments - and what may be contributing to the surge of young people seeking them. Some European countries are revising their protocols to ensure adequate mental health care before opting for medical interventions.\n\n\"There is genuine concern and frustration about how quickly transgender issues seem to be pushed into the mainstream,\" Simon says. \"But a more strategic thought I had is that this is a great issue to campaign on. It unites the conservatives; it also divides the other side.\"\n\nBut for the families of trans children, navigating this relatively new issue can be a \"wrenching decision.\" \"I found that talking to the parents gave me a very moving insight into the dilemmas they face,\" he says, \"and also how they feel about their children being made into a political football.\"\n\nHere's the story that Simon and Gail discuss in this episode:\n\nFor more of Simon's reporting across a range of issues, see his staff bio page .\n\nIn this earlier episode of the podcast, politics editor Liz Marlantes discussed fairness in Monitor political reporting:\n\nAnd in this episode, staff writers Christa Case Bryant and Stephanie Hanes discussed progress in the dialogue around climate, another political issue on which opposing sides appear entrenched.\n\nGail Russell Chaddock: Fairness can be an elusive quality in today's media environment. Editors, fact checkers, readers can help, but in the end, it comes down to a commitment by all to be fair, to listen closely, to think deeply. Today's podcast takes up a new frontier in American politics: whether minors should have access to gender-transition treatments.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nChaddock: This is \"Why We Wrote This.\" I'm this week's guest host, Gail Chaddock. Simon Montlake is a reporter for The Christian Science Monitor in Boston. As a Monitor correspondent in Jakarta, Bangkok, and Beijing, he covered political upheavals, economic crises, civil wars, and natural disasters. Born in London, he's now reporting in a former colony, with an eye on national politics. We invite you to listen and think deeply about today's issue, and help us answer the question: What is fairness?\n\nSimon, thank you for joining us today. Why did you choose this topic?\n\nSimon Montlake: This was a topic that both my editor and I saw as worth pursuing, particularly in light of the 2024 campaign. It's clearly an animating point on the right of American politics. And what we're seeing is that how this is playing out, in terms of action, is at the state level, rather than federal. And so I went to Missouri. In Missouri, at the beginning of the legislative session back in January, the leadership of the Republicans made clear that one of their priorities for the session was to legislate on transgender issues.\n\nAnd one of those is the question of medical intervention for under-18s, which is sometimes called gender affirming care, which is a slightly vague term but really comes down to using medical interventions, along with psychiatric treatment, to \"change\" or \"transition\" the gender of the individual. We wanted our readers to understand that there is a debate within the medical community, particularly on the research side, because this is fairly new and it's hard to be clear about the long-term implications, and to understand whether the increase in young people seeking this care is something to be concerned about. We also wanted to put in context for American readers the fact that this is not the only country where this debate is happening. It's happening in many countries in Europe. And in some cases they have chosen to restrict somewhat or rather revise the protocols of how they treat young people who have what is called gender dysphoria, in which you feel that you've been born in the wrong body.\n\nChaddock: Who did you write this story for?\n\nMontlake: In some ways it goes back to when I was in Iowa in March, covering former president Donald Trump, who held his first big rally of the electoral cycle there. And he filled a theater with supporters of his, and gave a very long speech. He talked about ethanol, about corn subsidies, about farm policy, things that, I suppose, he believed would be important in Iowa. But the one sentence or statement that really got people onto their feet was talking about what is taught in schools and also stopping transgender athletes competing in schools, and really a broader sense of like, we've got to stop this \"woke ideology\" of transgender. And people were up on their feet. When I looked around at that crowd, I would say most of them were probably grandparents by this point. Almost 100% white. You might say middle- or working-class people. You know, in some ways, I suppose I was writing for those readers who perhaps don't have a firsthand experience of this issue or exposure, and would also have very different views from how young people see this issue.\n\nChaddock: How did you choose the voices for this story?\n\nMontlake: Well, it was of course important to talk to lawmakers involved in passing the legislation. We also wanted to hear from families of young people who are either accessing this medical transition care or in some cases, perhaps, are too young for it, but already have identified themselves as being transgender. And then there are, also those who are no longer 18, who would not be affected directly by what eventually happened, which is a ban on under-18s receiving this treatment. But it was really the families I found most compelling. It's just such a difficult issue, such a hard and wrenching decision to make for someone who wants the best for their child, and is perhaps confronted by this entirely new issue. And so they're looking for guidance from medical professionals and they're also talking to other families. And at the same time, I also wanted to speak to parents who felt that there should be restrictions or an outright ban on this treatment. And I did talk to a parent of a transgender child who felt that way.\n\nI didn't talk to the children themselves. There was always a question in my mind about their privacy and how it would be for them to be put in the limelight like this. But I found that talking to the parents gave me a very, very moving insight into the dilemmas they face and also how they feel about their children being made into a political football, frankly.\n\nChaddock: You mentioned at the beginning that this is a debate going on not just in the United States, but in a number of countries around the world, including and especially Britain.\n\nMontlake: In terms of the debate in say, the UK, what's happening there is that the one clinic in London, which was the only place you could get transgender transitional care, they are now moving that service to other hospitals. There have been a lot of complaints and concerns about whether the treatment there was following the right protocols and whether there were sufficient guardrails in place before treatment was prescribed. But the UK, I should note, is not stopping this treatment. And in fact all the countries in Europe where you're seeing this debate happening, the regulators will say: \"We want to just increase the screening and make sure that only in exceptional cases do we proceed with medical care, while we also consider psychiatric care, the social situation, and many other things.\" And again, there's this idea or fear that perhaps there is some sort of peer or social pressure, which is leading more adolescents to believe that they want this treatment. But in no countries are we seeing the politics of the United States, in which you have one political party, well organized, with national groups working in all these states, and in many cases passing almost identical laws, which don't just intervene and try to regulate more tightly, but outright prohibit the practice.\n\nChaddock: What's behind this rush to legislate in red states?\n\nMontlake: It's clearly a political strategy on the right. You don't have to go back far to see a parallel. I mean, 20 years ago, the issue was same sex marriage, and on the right it was defense of \" traditional values and traditional marriage.\" And in fact, in the 2004 election, president George W. Bush made this one of his promises, that same sex marriage could not go ahead. In that case, of course, the culture moved on, politics moved on, and same sex marriage is now the law of the land. Some of the same political groups, often conservative and Christian legal groups who were involved in the litigation over that issue, are now heavily involved with the transgender issue, both the medical care, and also the so-called bathroom bills, sports, and other areas for transgender people.\n\nAnd I think, um, there is genuine concern and frustration about how quickly transgender issues seem to be pushed into the mainstream, but a more strategic thought I had is that this is a great issue to campaign on. It unites the conservatives, it also divides the other side. Within progressive or Democratic, or independent voter circles, there is no unanimity behind supporting transgender communities or transgender people or transgender rights. So it is an issue that splits the opposition. And I think that's why we're gonna see it playing out over the electoral cycle for 2024.\n\nChaddock: You know, this issue may also split our listeners and your readers, but one thing that in my experience has always united Monitor readers is a great desire to be fair. You know, supporters refer to \"medical care for transgender children\" or \"medical transition care.\" Critics call it \"experimental medicine\" or even \"mutilation.\" Even the term \"trans\" isn't recognized by both sides as legitimate. How do you navigate this linguistic minefield in a way that's fair to both sides when views are so fundamentally different?\n\nMontlake: In terms of the language, I experience this from both sides of the debate: people trying to push back against how I describe things or my questioning. So there is definitely a linguistic minefield here. What we try to do is to not use emotive or euphemistic language, but to, as clearly as possible, explain what is being debated. And also putting it in a wider context. So when we're talking about gender care, we make clear what this involves, and also how rare it still is. We're talking about maybe a hundred or so clinics across the country serving hundreds or thousands of people.\n\nTake for example, this term of \"experimental medicine.\" A lot of medicines which are used for treatment, for example hormone treatments, which are used by transgender youth and transgender adults, would also be prescribed to menopausal women. It's the same drug, and the same drug has not been FDA approved in terms of certain trials for certain conditions, but the drug is not considered experimental.\n\nIn terms of \"child mutilation,\" which is a very strong term. If you're talking about surgery on transgender youth, those under 18, that is incredibly rare. And in fact, a far more common procedure is cosmetic surgery. This happens widely, and this is again, irreversible. This is an elective surgery. But there's no outcry about those children or those parents approving that kind of surgery. So I think you have to be very careful to acknowledge people's feelings, but also to see the political motivations behind such labeling. And again, to be fair, when the transgender activists talk about \"gender affirming care,\" I don't think that's a particularly helpful phrase because people aren't entirely sure what that means. And I think it's much more helpful to talk about hormone treatment or puberty blockers or counseling or whatever other medical intervention you're actually talking about.\n\nChaddock: When you're talking to people about a very difficult issue with strongly held viewpoints, how do you handle your own sense of fairness in how you ask and process their responses?\n\nMontlake: When I was reporting this story, I interviewed a parent of a transgender child, and that parent had very strong opinions against the Republican legislation in the State House. And at one point said to me, look, this is not a \"both sides\" issue. There aren't two sides of this. And, you know, that may be how people feel in that situation. And I said to him: \"I understand what you're saying, that this isn't a simple \"both sides\" story. The analog I always think about is climate change, which I've also covered. When it comes to climate change, there is an overwhelming scientific consensus that the planet is warming and that we are responsible for that. There is a great deal of debate about the nuance within that, about the pace of change, about the exact mechanisms, about the complex inner workings of the atmosphere. But again those opposed to making any concessions or change to a fossil fuel based economy latch onto that and twist it into a both sides argument.\n\nSo when this parent made that point, I did sympathize in the sense that it isn't a simple, \"both sides\" argument. It's not that one side says: \"We want to have the right to talk to our doctors and get the right care for our children.\" And the other side says: \"No, you're mutilating your children.\" Those are two opinions, but there is a broad spectrum within those two opinions, which actually is where a lot of people would go. I think the Monitor's job is to understand that nuance and to bring it to readers, so that they don't think that this is a simple, A-vs.-B argument.\n\nChaddock: Simon, thank you very much, first of all for taking on this topic, and discussing it with us so thoughtfully.\n\nMontlake: Nice talking to you, Gail.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nChaddock: And thanks to our listeners: You can find more, including our show notes, which include a link to the story we discussed in this podcast, at CSMonitor.com/WhyWeWroteThis.

A single mother who lives in one of the nation's bluest counties, she says some of her favorite items of clothing include T-shirts from both Hillary Rodham Clinton's and Sen. Elizabeth Warren's presidential campaigns.\n\nBut as America enters its third year of the COVID-19 pandemic, Ms. Reesman is actively organizing to vote her local and state Democratic leaders out of office.\n\n\"I can't look my kid in the eye and say I care about your education and vote for the Democrats right now,\" says Ms. Reesman, a pediatric neuropsychologist from Rockville, Maryland. \"I cannot believe that this is where we are - but it feels personal, and it feels painful.\"\n\nPandemic fatigue is hitting Americans hard, particularly parents. They want to see their children happy, healthy, and in school, and are growing increasingly weary of \"never-ending\" COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nIn 2020, Democrats won the White House and Senate in part by pitching themselves as the party that would take the pandemic seriously and get it under control. More than 90% of Democratic voters thought precautions like avoiding group gatherings and closing in-person schooling were necessary in the early months of the pandemic, according to Pew Research . In crucial swing states, a majority of voters said in exit polling that containing the virus was more important than rebuilding the economy.\n\nBut a little over a year later, America is in a very different place. Vaccines are widely available, numerous studies have confirmed the virus poses little risk to children, and public health officials have characterized omicron as less virulent than previous variants. And a growing number of Democratic voters like Ms. Reesman are voicing frustration over the mounting toll of pandemic protocols - particularly those affecting kids and their education.\n\nIn cities where stadiums are packed with screaming sports fans and bars are fully open, many schools are continuing to impose mask mandates, separate children at lunch, and limit their extracurricular activities. Up until a recent change in guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, schoolchildren often had to quarantine for 10 days whenever anyone in their class tested positive, causing a steady stream of disruptions.\n\nWith Democrats already facing head winds going into November's midterm elections, political strategists say being seen as the party of \"never-ending\" COVID-19 restrictions could pose a significant political liability. An early warning sign came with last November's gubernatorial election in Virginia, where Republican Glenn Youngkin won in part by tapping into parental frustration. Post-election polling showed that education was the dominant issue for Biden-Youngkin voters , with almost three-quarters of education-minded voters supporting Mr. Youngkin.\n\nNotably, both Virginia and New Jersey - an even bluer state where the Democratic governor barely eked out reelection in November - were in the bottom 10 states for in-person schooling during the 2020-2021 school year. Maryland, where Ms. Reesman lives, was ranked 47th. She says that at this point, Democratic officials ignore pandemic fatigue at their peril.\n\n\"We are a family that has done everything right,\" says Ms. Reesman, noting that she is boosted, her daughter is vaccinated, and they have conscientiously worn their masks when out in public. \"There is just no end of restrictions in sight, and no one seems to give a damn about it. I think Democrats have really underestimated what this did to families - and our level of anger.\"\n\nAt a recent press conference, President Joe Biden acknowledged that \"there's a lot of frustration and fatigue in this country\" due to the pandemic, but insisted the nation is in a better place than a year ago. He noted that last spring's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan provided $130 billion to keep students and educators safe and schools open.\n\nMany school districts \"spent this money very well,\" the president said, although \"unfortunately, some haven't.\" When asked directly if he thought school closures could be a potent issue for Republicans in the upcoming midterm elections, Mr. Biden admitted, \"It could be.\"\n\n\"There is frustration, because people wanted to see a return to normalcy under Biden,\" says Aliza Astrow, an analyst with the centrist think tank Third Way. \"That's what he promised and what people expected - but things don't feel back to normal.\"\n\nRecent polls show a widening divide among Democrats when it comes to COVID-19 restrictions. When asked in a Monmouth University poll if they agreed with the statement \"It's time we accept that COVID is here to stay and we just need to get on with our lives,\" almost 90% of Republicans and more than 70% of independents said yes. Democrats, however, were almost evenly split - with 47% agreeing and 51% disagreeing.\n\n\"It shows a fracture\" in the Democratic Party, says Jason Roe, a GOP strategist and former executive director of the Michigan Republican Party. And internal divisions are not something a party wants heading into an election - particularly as it becomes harder and harder to please both camps.\n\nSeveral Democratic governors, such as Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf , and even Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who had imposed some of the toughest restrictions in the country early on in the pandemic , have lately been emphasizing the need to \"move on.\"\n\nBut the delay in getting there, and the continued push for restrictions by other members of the party's base, may be enough to fuel a red wave next fall. In Michigan, Mr. Roe says county party chairs are seeing \"swelling participation\" at local meetings with a new kind of attendee: parents.\n\n\"I think the Democrats woke a sleeping giant,\" says Mr. Roe. \"You are reaching a point where people on the left, who maybe were more collectivist about our responsibility, are done with it. They want their kids to be in a normal situation.\"\n\nWhile nearly all U.S. public schools have been operating in person since the fall, periodic closures and other disruptions have persisted.\n\nAccording to Burbio, a data service that tracks school pandemic-related disruptions, more than 7,450 public schools were not open for in-person learning the second week back from winter break. Almost 5,000 were closed the following week. In Maryland, 11 Montgomery County schools went virtual for two weeks in January after more than 5% of staff and students tested positive - a threshold the district has since abandoned after a public backlash.\n\nSome of the disruptions have been the result of pandemic-induced staffing shortages as teachers, bus drivers , and other staff have called out sick. Other districts were forced to close due to protesting teachers unions - sometimes pitting Democratic officials against a loyal component of their voter base. Students in Chicago missed five days of school last month when the Chicago Teachers' Union held a strike after Democratic Mayor Lori Lightfoot opposed its demand to revert to virtual schooling.\n\nIt's the one issue that comes up at campaign events \"without exception,\" says David Blair, one of four Democratic candidates running for Montgomery County executive.\n\n\"The pendulum has really swung from 'Let's be safe and cautious; let's keep everyone home,' to 'Why don't we have enough substitute teachers, masks, and testing? These kids should be in school,'\" says Mr. Blair.\n\nIn some Democratic strongholds, school masking also seems to be a growing point of contention. In Virginia, where Governor Youngkin recently issued a ban on mask mandates, seven school districts are challenging the ban in court. In Fairfax County, which voted for Mr. Biden by a margin of 40 percentage points, some 4,000 people logged into a virtual town hall in which the school district explained its decision to join the lawsuit. And while it was unclear how many attendees were in favor and how many opposed, almost all who spoke testified against school restrictions \"going further\" than they needed to.\n\nMaryland gubernatorial candidate John King Jr., who was secretary of education under President Barack Obama, says Democrats understand the importance of in-person education - and care deeply about children's well-being - but have often faced difficult choices due to the unpredictable nature of the virus.\n\n\"We should do everything possible to keep schools open safely, but acknowledge that sometimes, particularly staffing challenges make it necessary for schools to go virtual,\" says Mr. King, a Montgomery public school parent himself.\n\nHe says officials need to express more empathy about what the past two years have been like for parents: \"It's really important for leaders to acknowledge how hard it's been.\" To help children make up for lost learning, he is pushing for more tutoring programs. He's also advocating for more testing, a vaccine passport system for the state, and free KN95 or N95 masks for all students - tools he believes will help schools stay open and keep students safe.\n\nStill, some Marylanders say that at this stage in the pandemic, they want fewer COVID-19 measures, not more.\n\nLori Trent, an independent voter from Silver Spring in Montgomery County, voted for Mr. Biden but says she's disappointed with the president's term thus far. A mother who works in health care IT sales, she wishes Mr. Biden had spent less time focusing on \"multibillion-dollar bills for child care\" through his Build Back Better legislation and instead just ensured all public schools stayed open - the most basic form of child care for many families.\n\n\"The Democratic Party is saying, 'We are for families; we are for the working class,' but at the same time they are also saying, 'We are going to close down schools - so we're not really,'\" says Ms. Trent, who sent her high school son to live with her sister in Arizona last year so he could attend school in person.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Who wants to see their competitors unable to deliver goods and services to people, so that you get it delivered in your brown Amazon box? Jeff Bezos,\" Mr. Vance said, referencing the riots that broke out in the summer of 2020, amid a wave of racial justice protests. \"The people who are invested in destroying America via our corporate class are also getting rich from it. This is an important piece of the puzzle to understand.\"\n\nMr. Vance has described big business as an enemy of conservative values, accusing many corporations of directly undermining America. It's a view that has gained traction on the MAGA right in recent years, with conservatives attacking companies like Disney and Budweiser for \"woke\" messaging and efforts at diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) - evidence of the Republican Party's transformation in the Trump era.\n\nJD Vance's attacks on \"woke capital\" go beyond ordinary populism: He's said Jeff Bezos sought to fund riots and companies don't want workers having children.\n\nBut Mr. Vance doesn't just think companies are cynically pandering to the marketplace. He's taken his criticisms a step further, painting corporations' motivations in a sinister, conspiratorial light.\n\n\"If you peel back the onion, what you find is that the businesses that are most connected and most devoted to destroying our values are also benefiting financially from it,\" he argued in the speech at a conference in suburban Washington, D.C., hosted by the Claremont Institute, a right-wing California think tank that has emerged as an ally of the MAGA movement.\n\nSince he became a senator last year, Mr. Vance has broken with his party to push a number of populist economic proposals. But it's his pugnacious rhetoric that has drawn significant public attention since former President Donald Trump selected him as his running mate.\n\nIn the same 2021 speech, Mr. Vance argued that companies supporting abortion rights really just want a pool of \"cheap labor,\" with workers unburdened by the cost and time commitment of caring for children. Citing former Georgia Democratic House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams' assertion that a Georgia abortion ban would be \"bad for business,\" he said: \"She was right. When the big corporations come against you for passing abortion restrictions, when corporations are so desperate for cheap labor that they don't want people to parent children, she's right to say that abortion restrictions are bad for business.\"\n\nMs. Abrams had lamented in a 2019 Twitter thread that more business leaders weren't speaking up against a bill prohibiting most abortions in Georgia. She says in a statement to the Monitor that his comments misrepresented her earlier remarks, while saying he and Mr. Trump \"expressed contempt for women's healthcare.\"\n\n\"A woman's access to abortion directly affects her ability to secure an education, find a job and advance and make decisions about how and when to grow a family,\" she says in an email. \"Companies cannot effectively attract and retain talent when half of the available workforce is denied basic human rights to care and self-determination.\"\n\nAt a Thursday press availability after this story published, Mr. Vance was asked if he stood by his comments on abortion and companies - and what evidence he had to back it up. He said the evidence he had was \"what people actually say,\" before pivoting to a broader critique of how companies treat young families, citing his own family's experience in the corporate world.\n\n\"Very often, corporate America is not especially friendly to parents with young children, and especially moms with young children. And I think we have to promote a culture of pro-family thinking and pro-family policy in this country where we see children as blessings and as resources and not as curses, which is how I think way too many companies and frankly way too many of our leaders in Washington think about our young children,\" he said.\n\nThomas Frank, a left-leaning historian and author who has written extensively on American populism, says that Mr. Vance identified a phenomenon that has been going on for years - but took it to an extreme and unsupported conclusion.\n\n\"This combination of liberalism and capitalism, this does exist, and it's real,\" says Mr. Frank. But instead of just accusing companies of virtue signaling, Mr. Vance makes a giant leap in framing their rhetoric and actions as part of a sinister plot. Jeff Bezos wanting Main Street to burn? \"That sounds like a conspiracy theory to me. I would love to see his evidence for that.\"\n\nIn July 2020, Amazon pledged $10 million in donations to a dozen social justice organizations, part of a wave of corporations signaling to consumers and their own employees that they shared their values. The company later offered a corporate match that led to $17 million more. Black Lives Matter's national and local chapters received more than $2 million from Amazon and another $1 million from employee contributions.\n\nThe Trump-Vance campaign did not provide any evidence supporting Mr. Vance's claim that the organizations Amazon donated to had supported the riots that sporadically broke out alongside the widespread, largely peaceful Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.\n\nRecently, Senator Vance has returned to the riots that broke out that summer, claiming that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, \"actively encouraged the rioters\" who caused widespread damage in Minneapolis after George Floyd's murder. Mr. Walz called out the National Guard to restore order, but has faced criticism for not doing it sooner.\n\nMr. Vance achieved fame with a best-selling 2016 memoir, \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" that was at times critical of the people he'd grown up around in rural Ohio. His political rise was also fueled by patronage from his former boss, Paypal founder and venture capitalist Peter Thiel, who spent $15 million to help elect him to the Senate .\n\nMr. Vance's anti-corporate populism isn't just rhetorical. As a senator, he's supported raising the federal minimum wage. After a disastrous train derailment spilled chemicals in East Palestine, Ohio, he teamed up with Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown on a bill to tighten train regulations, over protests from other Republicans. And he's worked with Democrats on legislation to claw back compensation for executives of failed banks and to rein in credit card fees.\n\nMr. Trump broke with big business conservatives on immigration and trade, two major issues where Mr. Vance agrees with him. But at other times the former president's  populist rhetoric clashed with more business-friendly policies, like massive corporate tax cuts and major deregulation efforts. Mr. Trump has also flip-flopped to embrace companies he once criticized, like TikTok and Tesla , after their major investors promised to back him.\n\nMr. Vance appears to be more of a pure economic populist. But it's his aggressive, acerbic rhetoric, rather than his policy views, that have drawn the most attention since Mr. Trump selected him as his running mate.\n\nMr. Vance's comments in recent years calling leading Democrats \"childless cat ladies,\" arguing that people with children should get more votes in elections , and saying that pregnancies caused by rape and incest were \"inconvenient\" have resurfaced since he joined the ticket - and immediately hurt his image with voters.\n\nDemocrats have taken to mocking Mr. Vance as \"weird,\" and it seems to be working: Polls have shown his favorability ratings are now upside down , making him less popular than Mr. Trump, as well as Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate. A recent survey from a Democratic pollster showed that reactions to his rhetoric are driving those numbers: \"Anti-woman\" and \"weird\" were two of voters' leading descriptions for Mr. Vance, with the number describing him as \"extreme\" jumping from 20% in late July to 33% in August.\n\nMr. Vance has sought to downplay some of his previous comments. He insisted in a Sunday ABC News interview that his suggestion that parents should have extra voting rights was just a \"thought experiment\" and not a policy proposal he actually supported.\n\nBut when asked for comment about his 2021 remarks to the Claremont Institute on abortion and Black Lives Matter, a spokesman for Mr. Vance doubled down.\n\n\"Jeff Bezos's companies promoted and donated to Black Lives Matter as BLM protestors destroyed countless brick and mortar businesses across the country - the very businesses that Amazon counts as direct competitors,\" Vance spokesman William Martin says in an emailed statement. \"Woke billionaires like Bezos have taken over corporations across the country and turned them against the American people. Senator Vance is absolutely right to call them out and will continue to do so.\"\n\nThis story was updated in the afternoon on Aug. 15 to include Mr. Vance's response to a question about the abortion comments that the Monitor published earlier in the day.\n\nAs Harris picks Walz, George Floyd riots resurface as election issue\n\nRepublican attacks against Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate, Tim Walz, bring questions of law, order, and the George Floyd protests to the campaign forefront .\n\nSix issues Kamala Harris is campaigning on - and 5 she'd rather avoid\n\nKamala Harris has the opportunity to rebrand herself in the eyes of voters.

Their selection of Kemi Badenoch as party leader locks in that agenda.\n\nMany Conservatives hope that her energy, as well as her staunch \"anti-woke\" platform, will rejuvenate the party's flagging political fortunes - out of power for the first time in 14 years, with a record-low number of seats in Parliament.\n\nYet others fear that her uncompromising, often Trumpian approach will pull the party further to the right, deepening divides and alienating the centrist voters whom the party hopes to recapture.\n\nMs. Badenoch was born in London but grew up in an affluent family in the Nigerian city of Lagos. She lived there until she was 16, when her parents sent her to the U.K. to avoid the increasingly unstable political situation at home. As a teenager, Ms. Badenoch worked at McDonald's to fund her studies, which earned her a degree in computer systems engineering at the University of Sussex.\n\nMs. Badenoch has described these experiences as the bedrock of her political worldview - one which is staunchly right-wing. In an interview with the Daily Mail, she described Nigeria as a country where she \"never felt safe,\" feeding her appreciation for order and security in the U.K.\n\nThe politician says her time at college - surrounded by those she described as \"stupid, lefty white kids\" - also fed her conservative views. \"People often ask what made me a Conservative and there was no one thing,\" she told The Times of London in one interview. \"But part of it was being at Sussex among snotty, middle-class north Londoners.\"\n\nToday, Ms. Badenoch is well-known for her vocal stance on what her supporters call \"culture war\" causes. She has criticized the Black Lives Matter movement, opposed letting people self-identify as transgender, and said that \"not all cultures are equally valid\" when it comes to deciding who should be allowed into the U.K.\n\nThose positions have fired up hopes among Tories that Ms. Badenoch will win back voters who abandoned the Conservative Party in favor of the populist Reform UK , which enjoyed unprecedented success at the general election by running on an anti-immigration platform.\n\nOthers believe that Ms. Badenoch's bluntness will also play well with voters who are tired of politicians trotting out vague platitudes.\n\n\"I think [Ms. Badenoch] is really good at getting her message across in a clear, coherent, and meaningful way,\" says Gareth Lyon, a Conservative local councilor in Rushmoor, in southern England, who voted for Ms. Badenoch in the party members' leadership vote. He says that since Ms. Badenoch's election, a surge of new members have joined his local party branch.\n\n\"She actually reminds me of Ronald Reagan,\" says Mr. Lyon. \"Something about her is inspiring. Reagan was able to build a coalition, not by pandering, not by trying to make everyone happy, but by starting from what he believed in. That's what I've seen in Kemi.\"\n\nThis straight-talking approach could backfire. The \"culture war\" issues that have earned Ms. Badenoch admiration from some voters are bound to alienate others. She is expected to take the party's policies firmly to the right, a move which could put off more moderate Conservative voters.\n\nBut for now, it is a risk that the Conservative Party is willing to take.\n\nMuch will depend on Ms. Badenoch's next steps. Her leadership bid did not reveal concrete policies, but rather self-described \"core principles,\" such as personal responsibility, family, and truth.\n\nAs a result, Ms. Badenoch has a largely blank slate on which to work. She remains mostly unfamiliar to the electorate: Polling by YouGov in the run-up to the leadership vote found that 43% of Britons simply didn't know how they felt about her.\n\nMs. Badenoch may be \"straight-talking\" - but her impact on the electorate will still depend on the issues and policies she chooses to champion, says Ben Worthy, a lecturer in politics at Birkbeck College, University of London. While Ms. Badenoch has built her reputation on \"anti-woke\" issues, topics such as trans rights have little traction with voters, he says.\n\n\"It could be that she's going to be 'straight-talking' on immigration; there is a segment of voters who are very interested in immigration,\" says Dr. Worthy. \"But most of these voters are already Conservatives.\"\n\nTo win back voters, Ms. Badenoch will need to both diagnose and remedy what led the Conservatives to implode at the last general election.\n\nPolling shows that two events in particular damaged the Conservative Party's reputation, says Dr. Worthy: the Partygate scandal , when then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson held a Downing Street Christmas get-together in violation of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, and the tenure of Liz Truss, a prime minister best known for unpopular economic policies and being compared to a lettuce .\n\n\"It's a mixture of immorality and incompetence,\" says Dr. Worthy.\n\nHer strong moral stances may position Ms. Badenoch well to tackle at least some of these problems. But the road ahead is likely to be long. With just 121 members of Parliament compared with 411 from the ruling Labour Party, the Conservative Party is extremely unlikely to be able to reverse its fortunes in a single term.\n\nUnder these circumstances, consistency will be key, rather than simple answers or even fiery rhetoric. Ms. Badenoch must be able to unite rather than divide in a British political scene that is still fractured and unstable. The Conservative Party itself has burned through six leaders in less than a decade.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

The theme of the article (which has the tone of a Sunday analysis piece) is that if Rip Van Winkle had fallen asleep \"shortly after the presidential election of 1860\" and waked up in 1948 he wouldn't find anything much different: \"Election processes in the United States have virtually stood still.\"\n\nWell, have they? There are a lot of mechanical differences and Krock extracts some humor from them, a third of a century ago. Rip would be astonished by what Krock facetiously calls \"the wooden box\" from which voices of candidates emerge (i.e., radio) with \"clarity and volume unaffected by distance.\" Again, somebody would have to explain to him \"the aerial vehicle\" (i.e. airplane) that whisks candidates around; also he would read with \"mixed feelings the results of the advance vote samplings\" (i.e., polls). Otherwise, says Krock in 1948, things hadn't changed much, least of all in the performance of the players -- the \"political game\" itself.\n\nWell, let's see. Thinking back on 1948 I remember about the pleasurable trip I ever had in my life: the 9,000-mile truman whistle-stop journey right across the United States in the armor-plated \"Ferdinand Magellan\" making m3 speeches, mostly rear- platform and sometimes in pajamas. Alas, presidential candidates don't campaign that way any more.\n\nAnd now there's television: Mr. Krock doesn't mention it in his list of things old Rip would marvel about: TV was invented then but it didn't have much force in politics; it was the radio age. As for the \"advance vote sampling\" (polls) they were as wrong in 1948 as the unfortunate Literary Digest poll in 1932 forecasting Hoover's supposed victory. In 1948 all the polls were wrong.\n\nColumnist Krock sounds a bit quaint himself by indirection, citing one aspect of the almost-finished campaign -- \"the belief that an air of mastery is conveyed by never naming your opponent,\" and also in his praise of the Republican vice-presidential candidate for \"the political technique of tolerance toward the opposition. . . Which is being largely followed in this campaign by Gov. Earl Warren.\" Not many candidates follow in the Earl Warren technique today nor did they, I warrant, in Rip Van Winkle's time.\n\nKrock thinks campaigns should be shorter and brisker. That sounds modern and familiar. On the other hand he takes it for granted that candidates are selected by party conventions; it would astonish this noted political writer to discover that today candidates are selected by a series of primaries, numbering 37 in 1980. By the time the conventions met this year there wasn't much for them to do but ratify the choices already indicated.\n\nColumnist Krock thought in 1948 the electoral college should either be abolished, or a proposed amendment by Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. adopted which would make the electoral vote of each state proportional to the popular votes cast, rather than given as a block: In 1980, for example, all of New York's 41 electoral votes will go tone party even though only a few thousand votes separate Messrs. Carter and Reagan. (They have been arguing about the electoral college ever since the Constitution was adopted.)\n\nChanges are needed in the system, Krock argues. Just before the '48 election he urged that \"leaders in every community should unite to bring about a constitutional convention, so that methods and ideas in tune with the great changes that have occurred since 1789 can be effectively considered for the body of the federal charter. These include some phases of the British parliamentary system.\"\n\nThere are cries for reform before every election and they are generally quickly forgotten once the ballots are counted. Modern- day political writer David Broder in a new book, \"Changing of the Guard\" (simon &amp; Schuster), quotes Carter adviser Stuart Eizenstat in the White House:\n\n\"Every day that I'm here,\" Eizenstat said,\" makes me recognize that the most efficient type of democracy is a parliamentary system with a fairly stable set of parties, as in Great Britain. You can get your programs through, and if you can't, you get another government.\"\n\nMr. Krock, meet Mr. Eizenstat.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

It's the first moment of the vigil of Easter at Church of the Most Holy Redeemer in Manhattan's East Village. Worshippers at this historic Catholic church can only hear her stiletto heels, faint and staccato, as she walks to its organ.\n\nShe steps carefully up the old stone steps to the console, flicking on a reading light that illuminates her sharp features. As more parishioners walk in, she begins to play a mournful introduction, marking the last moments of Lent in what is now a quiet cacophony of footsteps.\n\nNew York has long been a haunt for underground artists. A growing number have become more conservative - and religious.\n\nThis is the organist's sixth gig in four days during Holy Week, which she says is \"kind of fashion week for Catholics.\" A classically trained musician, she is also an artist and model. Earlier this year at an uptown literary ball, she walked a runway for Elena Velez, a well-known designer who's been called the enfant terrible of the fashion world, modeling her controversial \"Gone With the Wind\"-inspired clothing line during the actual New York Fashion Week.\n\nThe church is tucked into a street of 19th-century tenements between Avenues A and B in the East Village, a neighborhood that once embodied New York's bohemian clichés. Right next to it is Graveyard NYC, a heavy-metal tattoo parlor. A few blocks away, the legendary CBGB nightclub, shuttered in 2006, was one of the birthplaces of punk. In 1990, local artists and musicians staged a legendary Resist 2 Exist festival in nearby Tompkins Square, then a drug market and homeless tent city, sparking a near riot when police shut it down.\n\nThe neighborhood may have long since gentrified, but Salomé, her confirmation name-turned-celebrity mononym, has been part of a new cadre of young New York artists who have been raging against a different cause: the cultural rot and decadence brought about by \"libtards.\"\n\n\"Leftists see greatness, and they see beauty, and they're threatened by it, and they want to destroy it,\" says Salomé, who says the Tridentine Mass is \"the greatest work of art\" for its superior musical composition.\n\nOriginally from Philadelphia, Salomé has been a devout Catholic since she was young. She wears a \"Make America Great Again\" hat around town sometimes as an act of ironic defiance. And even though she's a transgender woman, she prefers the term of an earlier age: castrato.\n\nBut first and foremost, she says, she's a child of God.\n\n\"I'm just Catholic here. I sort of refuse to identify myself with any other label, gender, sexuality, political,\" Salomé says. \"I'm Catholic, and I'm an artist. And so because I'm an artist, I'm interested in all ideas. And I happen to have been born in a time when that is not OK.\"\n\nClack. Click. At the end of the service, Salomé steps into the vestibule's yellow light, her 3-inch black pumps clearly visible now. It's late in the evening, but she's wearing a pair of chunky onyx sunglasses that hide her piercing blue eyes, eyes that have locked with French creative directors as well as Italian priests during confession. A wrinkleless, stone-colored Prada trenchcoat presses tightly against her frame.\n\nParishioners exit the church making their last signs of the cross, and Salomé click-clacks quickly down Third Street, disappearing into a crowd of 20-something pleasure-seekers in the East Village's array of cannabis shops and street vendors. She's heading toward the heart of lower Manhattan's conservative counterculture, an area near Chinatown recently dubbed Dimes Square.\n\nIn many ways, the Dimes Square scene began when young New Yorkers, skaters and creative types sick and tired of pandemic restrictions, began to rebel.\n\nSome embraced virtual environments and the technology that made them possible, and edgy podcasts and snarky Substack blogs have always been part of the scene's driving force. But a good number of New York youth saw art and literature as something meant to be shared in person.\n\nMaskless parties started up. A playwright and conservative magazine contributor began staging his work in living rooms. A new local newspaper/neighborhood bulletin called The Drunken Canal began documenting the punklike disregard among local youths for Dr. Anthony Fauci's rules.\n\n\"Young people want presence,\" says Tara Isabella Burton, a bestselling novelist and Oxford-trained theologian. \"It's normal, what's going on. It happened in the 19th century where you saw dandies rebel against automation and industrialization, which affected the politics and the aesthetics of the time.\"\n\nThe restaurant Dimes at the corner of Canal and Division streets near Chinatown became a haunt for an array of hip New York creatives seeking to liberate themselves from both social and ideological shackles. As a pun on Times Square, the gritty area at the border of the Lower East Side became known as Dimes Square.\n\n\"I certainly don't need to tell you that this place is also, emphatically, not in Brooklyn,\" wrote the leftist Substack blogger Mike Crumplar in 2022, with a bit of snark. \"You already know how Brooklyn is too political, too woke, too soft, too soy, too consumed by cancel culture to be a fertile climate for artistic expression. You've already heard about how the vibes are shifting back to downtown Manhattan, which is grittier and sleazier. It's a place where older literary men can have younger muses, free from the prudish Robespierres of the North Brooklyn [Democratic Socialists of America].\"\n\nThe podcast \"Red Scare,\" begun in 2018 and hosted by cultural critics Dasha Nekrasova and Anna Khachiyan, was among the first to popularize the term \"Dimes Square.\" Associated with the \"dirtbag left\" - a term that described zealous Bernie Sanders supporters who eschewed civility and prioritized disruption - the hosts later became disillusioned by the movement and explored the ideas of the \"new right,\" the Donald Trump-led movement that also stands against neoliberalism, global capitalism, and corporate hegemony. Their guests have included people such as Steve Bannon and Alex Jones.\n\nMs. Nekrasova is also a devout Catholic, even if she likes to quip, \"Catholic, like Andy Warhol.\" An actor who had a recurring role in the popular HBO series \"Succession,\" she has hosted podcasts on obscure theological topics.\n\n\"People accuse me of being fascist or a cultural conservative,\" she says in an interview. \"I actually feel more like a degenerate artistically. ... I'm a free speech absolutist.\"\n\nBoth she and Ms. Khachiyan have been outspoken against what they see as the godless politics of the left. \"No hell, no dignity,\" Ms. Nekrasova once said.\n\nPartly because of their influence, the Dimes Square scene began to include a number of artists with more conservative and religious visions. Writers, filmmakers, and fashion designers have been dabbling in pre-Vatican II Catholicism. They play the church organ rather than DJ at nightclubs. Instead of free love and polyamory, they espouse commitment and monogamy. And the flip phone is a favorite accessory - a statement against the herd and its iPhones.\n\n\"New York's hottest club is the Catholic Church,\" proclaimed Julia Yost, senior editor at First Things magazine, in a 2022 essay in The New York Times. \"Traditional morality acquired a transgressive glamour,\" she wrote of the Dimes Square scene. \"Disaffection with the progressive moral majority - combined with Catholicism's historic ability to accommodate cultural subversion - has produced an in-your-face style of traditionalism.\n\n\"This is not your grandmother's church - and whether the new faithful are performing an act of theater or not, they have the chance to revitalize the church for young, educated Americans.\"\n\nJordan Castro looks with wonder at the audience gathered here at Earth, a literary salon and gallery on Orchard Street in the Lower East Side. About 300 people, mostly young and many dressed in monochrome cool, have packed the place to hear the young novelist talk about his work.\n\nEarth's literary salon has been attracting large crowds of people drawn to a literary scene known for its critiques of liberal hegemony in the arts. Its readings and discussions often feature writers who present ideas with witty and at times caustic, ironic prose.\n\nMr. Castro has long been an alternative-literature darling, too. He was the editor of New York Tyrant Magazine, an avant-garde publication specializing in experimental writing. Rugged with wild brown hair and kind, dark eyes and wearing an olive fatigue, he wrote an essay in Harper's Magazine on body building that went viral. He's like a Christian Ken Kesey with a neck tattoo of Ohio, his home state.\n\n\"I think for me, the best literature ... can kind of reveal aspects of life or reality or the psyche or the soul that can reveal those things in sort of unique and compelling ways, so that we can kind of become more attuned to our condition,\" Mr. Castro says in an interview. His first book, \"The Novelist: A Novel,\" is considered a work of \"autofiction,\" and has received glowing reviews.\n\nThe room is hot, so the door stays open as the overflow builds just outside the gallery's storefront space. A young woman peers inside on the shoulders of a friend or lover. An imposing figure whose head practically met the ceiling just outside the door scans the crowd looking like Jesus. Some stray voice in the crowd calls him \"LePuff.\" Young people in grunge-inspired fits and fashion-forward couture squeeze into the corner by the refreshments.\n\nOther readers include the doyenne of Dimes Square, Ms. Nekrasova of \"Red Scare,\" and Tao Lin, another autofiction writer. Mr. Castro's wife, the writer Nicolette Polek, hosted a reading a month ago from her new book, \"Bitter Water Opera,\" which The New Yorker magazine called one of the best books of 2024.\n\nTrue monogamy and traditional Christianity are the last taboos to many, says Mr. Castro, who fell in love with the Eastern Orthodox liturgy and converted a few years ago. He explains how true faith and love freed him from moral rot and a past life consumed by heroin addiction.\n\n\"I strive to be undistracted,\" he remarks. \"Christianity has taught me to pay attention to the important things. I love Jesus, man. Especially when he's ranting at the spoiled temple in John.\"\n\nHe reads poems and stories with a charisma that beams through his smile. The crowd giggles at his insights and claps louder at his lyrical flourishes. Often awkward around strangers, he is comfortable on this makeshift stage. \"Trad culture is not bad for you. Neither is having an objective standard of meaning and not wanting to sleep with 10,000 people,\" he says.\n\nAs a writer and artist, Mr. Castro believes the power of literature can be an entryway into deeper faith - the same theme his wife, Ms. Polek, pursues in her fiction.\n\n\"I think that when people get rid of a transcendent standard of meaning - you know, get rid of a sort of idea of a truth that we can all agree on, something that sort of transcends our own individual whims or preferences - I think when you get rid of that power, it's sort of just your will versus my will.\n\n\"And then, you know, if we're going to live harmoniously, harmoniously with each other,\" he continues, \"we have to have something that can unite us, that sort of transcends our desires, which can change at any moment and which are sort of, you know, untrustworthy.\"\n\nC lick clack. Salomé steps into the screening room of Sovereign House, a subterranean loft and underground artists space in Chinatown.\n\nShe's wearing a sheer black gown and an Arctic fur stole, and she holds aloft a bouquet of roses and baby's breath. Fans gather in a circle to greet the musician and model. She's a well-recognized presence in the Dimes Square scene. It's a screening for her most recent creative turn: She acted in a short film titled \"Envy/Desire.\"\n\n\"We're just kind of reinventing, like, how do you make a movie?\" Salomé says. \"It's made by someone who's not a filmmaker, and acted by people who are sort of not actors. Yeah, it's like a new thing. It's not so much like an intentional, 'Oh, we're going to do this because we're going to insert this belief.'\"\n\nThe film recalls the do-it-yourself quality of a John Waters film, and it's about a transgender woman who believes she may have found the man of her dreams. But his interest in her may reveal his own questions about his gender. Afterward, the crowd claps for the creative team as it takes bows under warm stage lights, and many linger for the Q&A.\n\nSovereign House is a salon started by Nick Allen, a New York tech worker who wanted to create a space for more dissident Dimes Square artists. They host parties for newly launched magazines, stage new plays, and even just engage in conversations about art and literature. (The tech entrepreneur Peter Thiel has also helped fund an \"antiwoke\" film festival in Manhattan.)\n\nThe underground event space has rustic columns separating the foyer from the screening room area. Ironically, the patio out back overlooks the headquarters of the Democratic Socialists in New York.\n\nA general vibe in Dimes Square is that no ideas are off-limits - a reaction to what many artists see as the stifling censorship of left-wing \"cancel culture.\" The salon at Sovereign House has hosted speakers such as Steve Sailer, a far-right thinker. In the past, Mr. Sailer has said Black people \"possess poorer native judgment than members of better-educated groups\" and need moral guidance from society.\n\nBut the underground salon in Chinatown has also included a number of religiously conservative artists and thinkers.\n\nOn a cold October night last fall, Stephen G. Adubato was chatting up guests at Sovereign House while wearing a \"Newark\" patched bomber jacket and sporting a freshly cut fade. Around his neck is a gold cross - the writer and professor of philosophy and religion is a devout Catholic.\n\nHe's here to talk about the latest issue of his project Cracks in Postmodernity, which includes a Substack, zine, and podcast. It's been catching on with a downtown set of writers, and a big crowd has gathered to hear him read from his latest issue.\n\nThe master of ceremonies for the evening, Brennan Vickery, a local bartender who is a regular presence at Sovereign House, contributes to Mr. Adubato's project. He warms up the crowd.\n\n\"Alex Jones, who I by no means am a fan of, but he said this thing that kind of stuck with me, and it is kind of true,\" he says afterward. \"He's like, Do you want to go to a house party that's with liberal people or conservative people? If you go to a liberal party these days, it's like, you can't say this, you can't say that. ... It's going to be subdued. No one can be offensive. So who do you want to party with?\"\n\nLike Salomé, Mr. Adubato only accepts the label Catholic. He says he does not consider himself a conservative, per se, but he accepts the full moral teachings of Catholicism. He initially said his project was intended \"to explore the ways that our contemporary culture points us to the truth of Christ.\" He changed it to an edgier description: \"subverting subversiveness through pretentious and ironic cultural commentary that gives precedence to aesthetics and ontology over ethics and politics.\"\n\n\"I don't want anyone to say anything conventional,\" Mr. Adubato says in an interview. \"I don't want anything predictable. I don't want anyone to sound like they're reading off of a script. That being said, I also think there's a certain limit. I like to be risqué. I like to poke fun at conventional discourse. I'm trying to serve a higher purpose. There's a point where it could become self-indulgent. Where you can say something very hurtful to somebody.\"\n\nHe's nervous tonight. Onstage in a pair of white Nikes, he shakes a bit with his eyes glued to the pages in front of him - a short story about a blue-haired liberal \"getting owned\" by a believer in the Almighty.\n\nMr. Adubato has been visiting other downtown venues to publicize his project. At another event at The Catholic Worker Maryhouse on Third Street in the East Village, not far from Church of the Most Holy Redeemer, over 120 people come on a cold Monday night.\n\nHe discusses the growing interest in religion in these downtown Manhattan haunts.\n\n\"People are tired of pure secularism. It's a dead end. It doesn't promise anything,\" he says in an interview afterward. \"There are people who are still into this spiritual thing and not being tied to any institutional religion. Some people are still into the new age stuff, which in a way has a value. I get why people are still drawn to it.\n\n\"But I am seeing more people being drawn to organized religion, whether it's Catholicism or branches of Protestantism or Islam or Judaism, because there is something a little more concrete about the promises that practicing these religions gives you.\"\n\nThe communal spirit at these events focusing on religious issues has been growing.\n\n\"When you go to a church, it's very clear what's being asked of you, and you can share that path with other people. We want that. We want to be together,\" says Mr. Adubato. \"We want to understand what our lives are for. We don't want this vagueness anymore.\"\n\nAudrey Horne hangs her winter coat on the wicker chair before she sits down to a hot cup of coffee at Café Kitsuné in Manhattan's West Village. Her blue eyes scan the Saturday afternoon crowd. In the corner, a man in a two-piece suit adds final touches to a fashion sketch in front of him, an emerald-hued pastry reduced to crumbs beside him.\n\nShe's made a name for herself as a writer and thinker simply by posting on online forums and the social media site X, where she has 32,000 followers, including editors and writers from Harper's and The New Yorker.\n\nShe spends a lot of time in Washington, D.C., where she's become part of a similar scene of religious thinkers and seekers meeting to discuss art and literature. But she remains a voice in the Dimes Square crowd.\n\n\"I kind of grew an audience through fighting people online and telling people how lonely I was, and just being really brutally honest,\" she says. \"People responded to that in a really unprecedented way.\"\n\nSitting upright, Ms. Horne doesn't telegraph \"bohemian layabout.\" But her attendance at downtown readings and literary salons speaks to the curiosity that had remained unquenched in her youth. She spent much of her childhood in the Two by Twos religious sect, witnessing an FBI raid on what has been labeled a cult. She now says she's a nondenominational Protestant Christian.\n\nShe was living in Seattle before the pandemic, and she describes how she became weary and even a bit alienated from the politics of women's marches, liberal arrogance, and political correctness.\n\n\"And then I listened to this podcast from New York, 'Red Scare,'\" she says. \"It was really exciting, because these are women who historically, I would assume, would be totally opposed to me. But they were saying things I kind of felt and agreed with deep down. ... At the time, there was, like, a sense of almost revenge, and it was kind of delicious. Yeah, I was just intoxicated.\"\n\nSo she moved to the East Coast - just before the COVID-19 shutdown. Isolated and lonely, she began to get into arguments online in the style of \"Red Scare.\" As she got noticed, she started getting out and hitting up Dimes Square watering holes, where she met up with like-minded artists rebelling against what they saw as liberal hegemony. For the first time, she felt comfortable in a secular world of artists and bohemian layabouts, bon vivants, and culture vultures.\n\nBut all the aggressiveness and snark and irony now seems to have gone too far in the scene, she says.\n\n\"I've had to learn to hold a lot of complexity,\" Ms. Horne says. \"And that has made me, I think and I hope, far less judgmental, far more open, and far more forgiving of myself and of others and their forms of exploring.\"\n\nPart of this spirit of tolerance, she says, is arising out of many people's earnest search for meaning. And a lot of that has to do with a growing interest in religion. \"There's something in the air right now that does feel much more open to faith,\" says Ms. Horne. \"I think that culture now feels a lot more - a lot softer, like people are curious about it and seeking it. And not just seeking it, but the real truth underlying the life of faith. ... It has made space for me to jump in and express what I believe to be true.\"\n\n\"We want something pure. We want something earnest,\" she continues. \"I hate to say a new sincerity, but it feels like a return to sincerity. I do think that that's what feels most fresh right now [in the arts]. Like, it's not even funny to be anti-irony. Like, just don't even reference yourself; don't talk about postirony, post-culture war. That's what we're kind of tired of.\"\n\nMr. Vickery, Cracks in Postmodernity's emcee, is standing outside the salon, hanging out near Sovereign House with a crew of bushy-haired 20-somethings. The conversation turns to the place of gay men in the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nDespite being gay himself, Mr. Vickery says gay men are not really a part of this \"intersectional\" identity. \"We're different historically,\" he says.\n\nHe never felt he fit in with the other tribes of gay men clustered in Hell's Kitchen and Chelsea on the West Side, those who were onto \"a new cause every week.\"\n\n\"I think the reason that [artists here] are socially conservative - or at least they pretend to be in this punk kind of element - is because they don't want to be told what to do and what to make and what not to say.\"\n\nHe tried his hand at acting and painting and publishing after he left the Florida Panhandle for New York, and he grew at odds with a lot of the decadence and ugliness in the city, he says. But he fits in here with aggressive, free-thinking conservatives.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n\"Because before it was only one community, [authorities could] ignore it,\" says Ronald Goodwin, a history professor at Prairie View A&M University, of earlier protests by the black community. \"Now you can't ignore it.\"\n\nHouston, which hosted a memorial service for Mr. Floyd Monday, has seen daily protests demanding justice for his death. Yet the civil unrest of this moment is different, locals and experts say, in ways that represent not just social progress, but a broader disillusionment with American institutions that could be an even tougher problem to tackle than what the country faced 50 years ago.\n\n\"While we should be focused on police brutality in black communities, what this has brought out is a broad discontent in society. And that's something we need to be concerned about and take seriously,\" says Marcus Casey, an economist at the University of Illinois, Chicago, and the Brookings Institution.\n\nAdding to the urgency of today's response, over the past five years police have killed about 1,000 Americans every year. That number has not changed despite promises of reform after the massive riots and protests resulting from high-profile deaths of African Americans including Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, Philando Castile, and Freddie Gray .\n\nIn the Third Ward, Brother Deloyd T. Parker Jr., who runs a local community center and knew Mr. Floyd, has been protesting police brutality for decades. But this time, he acknowledges, is different.\n\n\"I'm very hurt about what happened to George,\" he says, \"but I'm hurt every time. There's a George every day.\"\n\n\"What happened to George was the straw that broke the camel's back. What that uncovered and unveiled is a lot of injustices that have taken place all over the country, and all over the world,\" he adds. \"He's pretty much a symbol now.\"\n\nWhen 60,000 people demonstrated here last week, one thing stood out to many Houstonians in the crowd: the diversity of the people around them.\n\n\"You see Asians, you see whites, you see Latinos, you see Indians, Native Americans. Everybody is here,\" said Ephesian Fields, a black woman, during the protest.\n\n\"Things may change,\" she added, but \"at the end of the day, all we need is hope. All we have is hope. And the protests show hope.\"\n\nThe need for the protests was bluntly apparent to many protesters.\n\n\"Anybody with the skin color that ain't white, we get treated [expletive],\" said Eduardo Reyes, sporting a Mexican flag bandana around his neck.\n\nHis girlfriend, Kazaree Barnett, was wearing an S.U.C. pullover, the name of the rap group Mr. Floyd belonged to. Through tears she said the objective was to march in peace.\n\n\"It could be my dad, it could my brother, it could be a loved one, or it could be me,\" she added. \"At the end of the day none of us are safe. We just want to be safe.\"\n\nThat diversity is perhaps not surprising for Houston, a majority-minority city. But the nationwide protests over Mr. Floyd's killing have been diverse in another way: geography.\n\nIn Texas, major cities have seen protests, but so have small towns with small black populations. Demonstrators have gathered in downtown New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles, but also in those cities' suburbs. Protesters have turned out in majority-white cities like Salt Lake City, Utah, and Des Moines, Iowa.\n\nThe cellphone video that captured Mr. Floyd's last moments - Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on his neck for nearly nine minutes while he begged for breath - is visceral and horrifying, even compared to other videos of police killings. (Mr. Chauvin has been charged with second-degree murder; the three other officers who participated in detaining Mr. Floyd face charges of aiding and abetting his killing.)\n\nAnd to be sure, racism, police brutality, and the Black Lives Matter movement are the banner issues for protesters. But in this moment of heightened disillusionment there are a host of other issues driving people onto the streets.\n\nThe financial and psychological shock of the COVID-19 pandemic is certainly a factor, whether it be for Gen Zers entering the job market or Millennials still recovering from the Great Recession. (The pandemic has hit Houston's large oil and gas industry especially hard.)\n\nBut more than half the country also disapproves of President Donald Trump's performance . Half of Americans believe that Supreme Court justices don't set aside personal or political views when they make rulings , and have \"very little\" confidence in Congress. Even more Americans are increasingly concerned that issues like the threat of white nationalism and climate change aren't getting enough attention.\n\n\"There's a growing pessimism about the institutions in the United States, the elites,\" says Professor Casey. \"That's what's driving broader participation.\"\n\nPeople of all races \"feel this growing inequality in society, the idea that institutions aren't very responsive to the rank and file,\" he adds. \"They see those things as linked to the police brutality.\"\n\nFor decades, police brutality has rarely not been top of mind in the Third Ward.\n\nIn 1967, protests broke out in Houston after a child drowned in the Holmes Road dump, a landfill in a black community . As protests continued and tensions climbed, Houston police raided the TSU campus on the early morning of May 17, firing around 3,000 rounds into Lanier Dormitory and arresting 488 students. Only five students were eventually charged, and they were all exonerated.\n\nWhile much of the late '60s unrest was racially diverse - the civil rights movement in particular - the riots of the \"long, hot summer\" were characterized by events like that at TSU: unrest sparked by local grievances in black communities over issues like police brutality and poor living conditions.\n\nThis moment is different, and in many ways the Third Ward is different too. When Mr. Floyd was growing up there, Mr. Parker says, the neighborhood - known as \"the Tre\" - had just begun to change.\n\n\"It was blacker,\" he adds. \"You wouldn't see many people of European extraction walking their dogs down the street.\"\n\nMr. Floyd spent time at S.H.A.P.E. Community Center, which Mr. Parker co-founded in 1969. He attended Jack Yates High School - named after one of the area's early Baptist pastors - and, having shot up to 6 feet 6 inches tall, stood out in football and basketball, helping the school get to the state championship in 1992.\n\nAfter dropping out of college, he returned to the Third Ward and helped establish the city's renowned hip-hop scene. After getting into trouble with the law and spending four years in prison, he returned to the Third Ward with a new dedication to improving his community. He would often stop by the S.H.A.P.E. Center and talk to kids.\n\n\"He'd always come with a positive attitude, a positive disposition,\" Mr. Parker recalls. \"He wasn't content with who he was, he wanted to be better.\"\n\n\"He was on the move to doing that,\" he adds, \"but he was robbed of doing that.\"\n\nLast week, as the march was finishing a few miles away, the finishing touches were being put on a mural tucked onto a side street in one of the Third Ward's most neglected housing projects. It's become a landmark for those who want to pay their respects to Mr. Floyd, and a beacon for people who live there.\n\n\"He woke the world up,\" said Leonard McGowen, a resident of the Cuney Homes projects and a close friend of Mr. Floyd.\n\nMr. Floyd left Houston for Minneapolis around 2014, seeking a fresh start. The Third Ward, meanwhile, had been rapidly gentrifying. With black residents moving to suburbs and whites and Latinos moving in, the neighborhood's black population dropped from 79% in 2000 to 67% in 2015. The worry is that it could follow the same path as the Fourth Ward, a historic neighborhood created by freed slaves.\n\n\"Fourth Ward is oldest black community in Houston. It's not there no more. It's nothing but town homes,\" says John \"Bunchy\" Crear, a former Black Panther Party member who has lived in the Third Ward for decades.\n\nFor some black Houstonians marching in protests, they feel just as threatened by gentrification as they do the police - and by the pandemic, which has disproportionately harmed African Americans. One thing that hasn't changed since the '60s: the wealth gap between black families and white families. The average white household in 2016 had the same median wealth as 11.5 black households combined.\n\n\"They're pushing us blacks out so they can gentrify Third Ward and pretty much erase our history,\" Ms. Fields said during last week's protest. \"That's just one more way of them trying to enslave us and not let us have anything.\"\n\nNot everyone in the Third Ward believes this change is wholly negative. Many admit that it is, to a degree, inevitable - the neighborhood used to be mostly Jewish, until after World War II - and community groups have been working to prevent \"unchecked\" gentrification in favor of something more equitable .\n\n\"We can't stop people moving in, that's a lost battle, but we want to make sure we're as much in control of this community as we need to be,\" says Mr. Parker. \"Change is imminent, we know that. But let that change be positive change.\"\n\nMore integration in American society seems to have bred solidarity in the George Floyd protests, says Professor Casey. With more diversity in schools and neighborhoods , and with social media, African American worldviews are more broadly understood than in the 1960s.\n\n\"There's more overlapping spheres. So something that affected a black man in Minnesota might matter to a white person in Arizona,\" he says. \"Along with seeing the institutional issues, it feels much more personal across the country.\"\n\nLooking at protests over Mr. Floyd's death around the world, Mr. Parker thinks it's even bigger than that.\n\n\"This is a global movement,\" he says.\n\nAnd how would Mr. Floyd feel if he could see this now?\n\n\"He'd be excited that black people and people of conscience, and people who love freedom are standing up,\" says Mr. Parker. \"I can see him smiling right now.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

      "text": "What Does 'Woke' Even Mean? How A Decades-Old Racial Justice Term Became Co-Opted By Politics\n\n\"Woke\" is now best known as a negative political buzzword used to describe anything deemed too liberal or progressive-like brands that support Pride Month, The Little Mermaid live-action film and teaching about race in schools-but the word has a long history, originally meaning to be aware of racially motivated threats.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis emerged as a virulent critic of \"woke\" ideology ahead of his presidential ... More run.\n\nConservatives, including media pundits and Republican presidential candidates, have blasted a continually growing list of companies as \"woke\" in recent weeks, mostly for their outreach to the LGBTQ community.\n\nConservative definitions for \"woke\" range from \"a form of cultural Marxism,\" according to Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, to \"a virus more dangerous than any pandemic,\" according to former Gov. Nikki Haley (R-S.C.).\n\nBefore the word was co-opted by the right wing, \"woke\" was a word used within Black communities and social justice campaigns to refer to an awareness of inequality, with some urging others to \"stay woke\"-and picked up mainstream popularity as the Black Lives Matter movement grew in the early 2010s, particularly after the 2014 police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\nBlack activists and academics have also criticized white liberals for co-opting \"woke\" and using it in a performative way to appear progressive, as well as using it to refer to any left-leaning position, diluting its original meaning.\n\nThe use of \"woke\" as a pejorative has extended beyond just the United States: Politicians in countries including Hungary , Switzerland and New Zealand have slammed \"woke ideology\" in recent months.\n\nThe conservative redefinition of \"woke\" has made the term more popular than ever: Google searches for \"woke\" hit an all-time high as of March 2023, according to Google Trends.\n\nThe word \"woke\" has taken center stage on the 2024 campaign trail as Republican candidates use the term as a pejorative to describe everything from LGBTQ-friendly businesses to teaching about race in schools. But former President Donald Trump said at a campaign stop in Des Moines last week he doesn't like the word \"woke\" because \"half the people can't even define it\"-though he used the term while attacking DeSantis just two days prior for failing to stop Disney from going \"woke.\" When asked what the term means by NBC correspondent Dasha Burns on Saturday, DeSantis defined \"woke\" as \"putting merit and achievement behind identity politics, and it's basically a war on the truth.\" Haley, also asked to define the term by CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday, defined it as \"a lot of things\"-including \"biological boys playing in girl sports\" and \"gender pronoun classes in the military.\"\n\nEarly versions of \"stay woke\" have been used as early as 100 years ago. In 1923, as part of a compilation of philosophical ideas written by Jamaican activist Marcus Garvey, he declared : \"Wake up Ethiopia! Wake up Africa!\" as a call for Black liberation. \"Stay woke\" was spoken in the outro of a 1938 song, \"Scottsboro Boys\" by Lead Belly, based on the 1931 Alabama case in which nine Black teenagers were accused of raping two white women. Lead Belly urges listeners to \"stay woke, keep their eyes open\" at the conclusion of the song. The Oxford English Dictionary credits a 1962 New York Times article about how white Americans appropriate Black slang, \"If You're Woke You Dig It,\" written by novelist William Melvin Kelley, as the first citation using the word \"woke.\" \"Woke\" has been further popularized by modern singers, including Erykah Badu, whose 2008 song \" Master Teacher \" contains the refrain, \"I stay woke,\" as well as Childish Gambino's 2016 song \" Redbone ,\" which includes \"stay woke\" in the chorus.\n\nUniversity of California at Santa Barbara, linguistics scholar deandre a. miles-hercules told CNN conservatives using \"woke\" however they want, despite its historical meaning, is an example of \"semantic pejoration\": when a word gains a negative meaning over time. The same happened to identity politics, miles-hercules said, which was used as far back as 1977 to describe ending oppression against Black women but is also now used as a pejorative by conservatives.\n\nSome on the left and right have criticized the negative use of the word \"woke.\" In September, Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Tex.) criticized the \"woke right\" as people who want to \"just scream at the other side.\" Maurice Mitchell, the national director of the Working Families Party, told ABC News conservatives use the term as a dog whistle: \"It's been a useful club for those who want to beat those seeking justice over the head with white grievance politics to win elections without deploying explicitly racist terms.\" Candis Watts Smith, associate professor of political science at Duke University and coauthor of Stay Woke: A People's Guide to Making All Black Lives Matter , told the Washington Post co-opting and weaponizing language is standard practice of undermining social movements, and in this case, a Black political movement.\n\nUse of the term has ramped up in recent weeks as companies have come under fire for marketing toward the LGBTQ community and celebrating Pride Month. Bud Light sparked sputtering outrage among conservatives after it sent transgender TikTok star Dylan Mulvaney a customized can with her face on it, though the can was not commercially available. Mulvaney posted a video with the can and quickly attracted criticism from high-profile celebrities and pundits, including Kid Rock, Candace Owens and Ben Shapiro. Conservatives have since jumped on the momentum to boycott other \"woke\" companies, including Nike, which also partnered with Mulvaney. Adidas and Target came under fire for trans-inclusive clothing, with Target's boycott aided by viral misinformation that a tuck-friendly swimsuit was sold in children's sizes, when it was only made for adults. The North Face and Jack Daniels faced criticism for using drag queens, who have recently been targets of legislation threatening to restrict where they can perform, in advertisements.\n\nThe New 'Anti-Woke' Crusade Targets DEI-And Chick-Fil-A?

      "text": "Why Has \"ESG\" Become \"Woke?\" - Environmentalism can be Nonpartisan\n\nBy Saleem H. Ali\n\nBy Saleem H. Ali ,\n\nContributor.\n\nESG - Environmental, Social, and Governance concept vector icons set.\n\nThe decision of the Texas Schools investment fund to withdraw more than $8 billion worth of investments from the multinational investment company Blackrock can be traced back to a 2022 state \"anti-woke\" law against \"ESG Investment.\" Until a few years ago, this acronym was an esoteric label. It has now become a rallying cry for many Republicans who have conflated \"Environment, Social and Governance\" with a Liberal \"Awakening\" - hence \"Woke\" movement. In particular, the marginalization of fossil fuel companies by investment houses like Blackrock has been at the heart of this strident move against \"ESG.\"\n\nDuring the time when the late Jack Welch was the CEO of General Electric more than 25 years ago, I worked as a Technical Leadership Program associate at the company. In those days the acronyms of choice in this domain were \"Environmental, Health and Safety\" (EHS) or Safety Health and Environment (SHE). Much of the EHS department's work was confined to compliance with specific laws on environmental and occupational health performance. This was largely handled through audits and monitoring of complaints and the occasional lawsuits against the company. While there was occasional rumbling of discontent among the profit-watchers about the expense of compliance, in general this was not a politically charged matter.\n\nThere was a time when Republicans prided themselves on having established the Environmental Protection Agency under Richard Nixon. Even during the divisive years of \"Republican Revolution\" in the 1990s, the environment used to be a unifying issue in American politics. The Speaker of the House during this time, Newt Gingrich, an otherwise polarizing Republican politician , wrote a book titled Contract with the Earth (to mirror his Contract with America ) , with a foreword by leading Harvard ecologist and doyen of environmental thought E.O. Wilson !\n\nSo what has happened to cause this sudden revulsion to environmentalism among Republicans? The simple answer is that climate change has become the touchstone of twenty-first century environmentalism in such a consequential way that most other environmental issues have been eclipsed by its prominence. This is a pity because important efforts like \"ESG\" which expanded the purview of environmental health and safety to also include community development are now being dismissed. Politicians with vested interests in the fossil fuel industry have successfully stigmatized \"ESG\" because it includes an emphasis on reducing consumption of fossil fuels. No doubt we need fossil fuels for the foreseeable future but some tough love to incentivize the industry diversify should be seen as an opportunity rather than a threat, as exemplified by recent statements from British Petroleum (BP).\n\nThe social development attributes of ESG actually benefit many Republican constituencies, particularly in Appalachia - which have not seen much poverty alleviation despite a major reliance on the coal industry for employment. Communities that initially benefited from hydraulic fracturing for natural gas (Fracking), have seen a steady deterioration of quality of life in the absence of ESG pressure on companies. Labeling ESG as \"Woke\" to conflate it with social activism on more personal \"belief\" issues is a major disservice to predominantly Republican constituents in these areas. At the same time, environmentalists need to decouple climate activism from broader ESG goals. While ideally, we should have an earth systems approach to considering all such issues together, decoupling is needed for pragmatic reasons to ensure environmentally responsible investing on other matters."

      "website": "https://www.forbes.com",
      "text": "What Everyone Gets Wrong About The 'Woke' Movement, According To A Psychologist\n\nBy Mark Travers\n\nBy Mark Travers ,\n\nContributor.\n\nWhy is being \"woke\" considered both an insult and a praise, depending on who you ask? Here's what ... More you need to know about the phenomenon of wokeness.\n\nThe term \"woke\" finds its roots in African American Vernacular English (AAVE). Originally, it was a colloquialism that meant being alert or \"awake\" to societal injustices, especially those related to racial prejudice. It was a term used to highlight the systemic prejudices Black Americans face daily. It emphasized the need to stay informed, vigilant and proactive in the face of such adversities.\n\nToday, it has been adopted-and often co-opted-by a vast demographic, far removed from its original context. Particularly on the internet, terms that once held significant cultural importance can become memes in the blink of an eye. And this is precisely what happened to wokeness within certain alt-right circles. For many, it became a way to mockingly reference individuals who are perceived to be \"social justice warriors\" or \"SJWs.\"\n\nIn the social media age, activism has evolved. The internet amplifies awareness but also fosters \"slactivism.\" Many champion causes online but fall short in following through with real-world action. And, while hashtags often trend worldwide, they often miss lasting commitment for genuine change.\n\nA recent study published in Men and Masculinities delved into the trending South African hashtags: #MenAreTrash and #WomenAreTrash. While they intended to spotlight gender-based violence, these tags ignited profound debate and widespread controversy.\n\nThe study found that although many South Africans resonate with feminist values, the confrontational tone of #MenAreTrash often deters alignment. The study further underscored the historical context, noting the heightened insensitivity of the #MenAreTrash hashtag, given the enduring stereotype of Black South African men as dangerous. And, while some men endeavored to bridge understanding and champion the feminist cause, their messages were often overshadowed by a deluge of defensive #NotAllMen posts.\n\nThis dynamic mirrors a broader skepticism of \"hashtag activism.\" A 2020 report by Pew Research found that 76% of Americans believe social media activists think they're effecting change, when in reality, their impact is often minimal. Moreover, 79% of Americans think that such activism distracts from graver concerns.\n\nWhile hashtags raise awareness, there's growing consensus globally that their efficacy in driving tangible societal change is limited.\n\nInterestingly, the phenomenon of being woke has even permeated the world of dating . This highlights the lengths to which individuals might go to fit into a narrative they believe is desirable, even if it means feigning knowledge or passion for topics they know little about.\n\nSo, where do we go from here? How can we be \"woke\" without turning ourselves into memes? Here are two things to keep in mind.\n\nIn a constantly evolving society, democracy is essential to counterbalance unchecked power, as those in authority don't always prioritize the public's interest. A robust democracy depends on alert citizens ensuring accountability. Being woke is about recognizing and upholding this vigilance.\n\nHowever, in the pursuit of wokeness, it's easy to fall prey to confirmation bias. Our desire to be informed sometimes ironically makes us susceptible to misinformation, especially when we lean too heavily on a singular source.\n\nA 2023 study published in Thinking and Reasoning looked into the cognitive science behind misinformation and revealed a spectrum of responses: some instantly accept false data based on gut feelings while others might rationalize it after contemplation. Yet, a few, after diligent thinking, can discern the falsehoods.\n\nAs Shane Littrel, the lead author of the study astutely advised, each one of us must practice \"productive doubt,\" a skeptical mindset that encourages verification of claims. This intellectual humility (i.e., accepting that you could be wrong in your beliefs), especially in online spaces where information is democratized, safeguards not just our wokeness, but our overall well-being, decisions and actions.\n\nWhile global movements capture headlines, the roots of genuine change often lie in grassroots activism. It's comfortable and convenient to share a post about faraway issues while sipping coffee in a cozy home.\n\nHowever, consider this: just around the corner, there might be schools struggling for resources or a once-beloved park now marred by litter and neglect. Not every cause will earn you social media brownie points, but they can reshape your community's daily life. Attend town hall meetings, volunteer at local shelters or support neighborhood initiatives. Your immediate environment holds countless opportunities to effect change. Make a difference where you can see, feel and experience the impact.\n\nWhat's the catch, then? As it turns out, there is some merit to online activism. A 2020 study published in the journal Current Opinion in Psychology found that online and offline activism go hand in hand to effect change. So, even if something you are passionate about is not \"cool\" enough for social media, post it. Get the conversation going so more like-minded individuals will take notice and replicate your efforts in their own social environments. While real change often happens in the real world, virtual spaces are great accelerators of discourse.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with being \"woke.\" Embracing wokeness means championing awareness, empathy and activism. In a world inundated with information, it's crucial to discern fact from fiction, to move from mere online discourse to tangible actions and to recognize that meaningful change often starts at our doorsteps. Ultimately, genuine wokeness is about translating heightened awareness into actionable, impactful endeavors in the real world."

      "text": "What The 'Woke Capitalism' Critique Gets Wrong: Gen-Z, Brands And Social Impact\n\nBy DeNora Getachew\n\nBy DeNora Getachew ,\n\nFormer Forbes Councils Member.\n\nDeNora Getachaw is the CEO of DoSomething.org , the digital hub for youth-centered activism since 1993.\n\nAs we all immerse ourselves in the latest corporate speak, \"woke capitalism\" has emerged as a phrase that is raising eyebrows and ruffling feathers. Where did this phrase come from? And why does it feel like a massive distraction from what's really at stake?\n\nFor one, woke capitalism isn't a new concept. Similar terminology, like corporate activism, has been around for over a decade to refer to companies developing business strategies that marry environmental, social and governance (ESG) interests. \"Woke capitalism\" is just the latest addition to the lexicon, a phrase initially coined by Ross Douthat in \"The Rise of Woke Capital.\"\n\nHowever, following the reckoning for equity and justice of 2020, the term gained traction with naysayers who felt that the corporations publicly responding to that moment were doing so without the intention to follow through on commitments or buy-in from shareholders. Over time, this chorus of critique argued that social impact factors should not play a role in business.\n\nOne of the latest brands to face the wrath of these critics is The North Face, which recently offered customers a 20% discount for completing a racial equity training to build allyship for people of color in the outdoors community. Critiques of the initiative include some immediately dismissing it as dogmatic for simply addressing the concept of white privilege and others wishing they had gone further to confront the cost barriers contributing to inequitable access to the outdoors.\n\nOther brands that have recently had their social impact initiatives called into question include Disney's advocacy against Florida's Don't Say Gay bill, the MLB relocating the 2021 All-Star Game in protest of restrictive voting laws in Georgia, and the cadre of companies-from Salesforce to Citigroup -covering expenses for employees crossing state lines to seek reproductive healthcare after Roe v. Wade was overturned.\n\nSo why do I dare wade into these testy waters? As CEO of DoSomething, the leading hub for youth-centered activism for over 30 years, I do so on behalf of and alongside young people, many of whom are Gen-Z employees or will soon enter the workforce.\n\nDoSomething Strategic, our social impact consultancy that partners with brands and organizations to develop their youth engagement strategies, sought to uncover what Gen-Z thinks about brands engaging in social impact to understand how their expectations of brands square with the critiques of woke capitalism. In our \"What Gen Z Wants\" report , we asked 1,200 young people: Are brands responsible for addressing the issues that society faces? The results overwhelmingly showed that Gen-Z not only thinks brands should be making a social impact, but they also want brands to do more.\n\nOf the 15 social causes that respondents ranked on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being \"not important at all\" and 5 being \"most important,\" 73% had a mean score of 4 or higher (\"important or very important\"). Conversely, only 12.4% of young people said they felt brands were meeting their expectations when it comes to making a social impact. Perhaps the root of this discontent is that, as is so often the case in our democracy, young people don't feel they have a seat at the table. Only 13% said they felt fully included in shaping a company's social impact commitments.\n\nOur findings are consistent with a growing body of research demonstrating the importance of aligning business and social interests. The PWC Customer Loyalty Index found that ESG builds loyalty, with Gen-X, Millennials and Gen-Z more likely than older generations to intentionally support brands that share their beliefs. SP Global correlated positive business outcomes in over 2,000 studies examining triple bottom-line models , finding that nearly two-thirds of these studies show a positive correlation between ESG and financial performance. Lastly, ESG investments are still predicted to grow, with forecasts pointing to $1 for every $5 by 2026 .\n\nWhere I agree with some of the \"woke capitalism\" critics is that there should be a healthy dose of skepticism about the intentions of brands engaging in this work. Corporate leaders may choose to engage in social impact strategies through the lens of self-interest, be it keeping prohibitive legislation at bay or for the vague hope of a halo effect on their brand. To effectively connect with young people or any stakeholders, initiatives must be undertaken and communicated in a truthful and authentic manner. Young people want to understand not only the what, but the why and the how. Why is your brand taking on a social mission, and how are you following through in ways that are clear and measurable to them and their colleagues? They also want to know how they can get involved in those efforts.\n\nOur mission is to fuel young people to change the world by educating and equipping them with skills and resources to be more civically engaged leaders in all the ways they show up in the world-as citizens, consumers and employees. With trust in brands and employers among Gen-Z eclipsing that of political institutions, brands play a vital role in partnering with them in realizing that change.\n\nRegardless of what we may call it today or in five years, young people are clear that this isn't about being \"woke;\" it's just good business. As one of our Gen-Z survey respondents shared, \"Social impact is no longer just a good-to-have element of a company's success, it is a necessity in today's world. Not only does it help build a better reputation for your brand, but it also attracts more consumers who are willing to pay a premium for companies that they believe are doing their part to make a difference.\"\n\nSo let the haters hate. There will always be those who poke holes and politicize the bold efforts of businesses leading with purpose and values as their North Star. We'll be here cheering on those innovative companies and connecting them with new generations of consumers and employees who have their back.\n\nForbes Nonprofit Council is an invitation-only organization for chief executives in successful nonprofit organizations.

      "text": "'Anti-Woke' Author Who Can't Define 'Woke' Goes Viral\n\nBy Dani Di Placido\n\nBy Dani Di Placido ,\n\nSenior Contributor.\n\nBethany Mandel on The Hill's online program Rising\n\nThe word \"woke\" is thrown around absurdly often, from college campuses and M&M candies , to Silicon Valley Bank , but what does it actually mean?\n\nDuring an interview on The Hill's online program Rising, conservative author Bethany Mandel became visibly flustered after co-host Briahna Joy Gray asked her to define the word \"woke.\"\n\nMandel was promoting her new book, \"Stolen Youth,\" which proposes that the youth of today are being ideologically poisoned with leftist theories about race and gender. According to Mandel, she and co-writer Karol Markowicz spent an entire chapter defining what \"woke\" means. Despite all of that research, Mandel wasn't able to define the word.\n\nMandel, discussing America's education system, claimed that it had undergone \"a woke re-imagining that is very, very, far-left,\" and stated that \"only 7% of Americans consider themselves very liberal, and probably fewer of them consider themselves woke.\"\n\nGray then asked: \"What does that mean to you? Would you mind defining woke? It's come up a couple of times. I just want to make sure we're on the same page.\"\n\nMandel seemed stunned by the simple question, stammering: \"So, I mean, woke is sort of the idea that ... um ...\" After a few seconds of silence, Mandel predicted: \"This is going to be one of those moments that goes viral.\"\n\nTo her credit, Gray allowed Mandel to sit with the question, waiting patiently for a coherent answer from her uncomfortable guest. Mandel continued to struggle, saying: \"woke is something that's very hard to define, and we've spent an entire chapter defining it. It is, sort of, the understanding that we need to totally reimagine and reduce society in order to create hierarchies of oppression. Umm. Sorry, I ... it's hard to explain in a 15-second soundbite.\"\n\nGray then assured Mandel that she could take her time.\n\nFortunately for Mandel, Grey's co-host, Robby Soave, jumped in to save her, and offered a definition of \"woke\" that many would recognize, defining it as \"the tendency to punish people formally or often informally for expressing ideas using language that is very new, that no one would have objected to like five seconds ago.\"\n\nAfter Soave's interjection, the interview continued to spiral, as Grey turned her attention to one of Mandel's examples of supposed educational indoctrination, revealing it to be an anecdotal tweet that Mandel had seemingly misconstrued.\n\nThe tweet relays the story of a five year-old girl who tells her teacher that \"she likes girls,\" and the teacher responds by saying \"that's ok.\" Mandel retweeted the anecdote with the caption: \"Make talking about sexuality with young children weird again.\"\n\nWhen questioned by Grey, who pointed out that there didn't seem to be any mention of sex in the exchange, simply an acknowledgement that lesbians exist, Mandel made a vague allusion to parents' frustrated by \"constant messaging\" from schools, and suffering \"death by a thousand cuts.\"\n\nWithout citing an example, Mandel repeated that there was \"constant, constant messaging about sexuality,\" and clarified that she wasn't advocating against teaching children that LGBT parents exist.\n\nAs per Mandel's prediction, her clip from the interview went viral.\n\nTwitter users cited the interview as an example of how the word \"woke\" is used less as a description, and more of a signal, that could potentially contain extremely racist implications.\n\nSome users helpfully provided a definition of the word, pointing out that once articulated, the word takes on an overtly positive meaning.\n\nMany pointed out that the word was originally coined by the Black community to signal social awareness, and had been tainted by conservatives.\n\nMandel, rather bravely, logged onto Twitter for some damage control, claiming that Grey had been \"demeaning parenting in general in colorful and nasty terms\" before the interview started and that Grey's comments threw her off.\n\nMandel then took another shot at the question, and defined \"woke\" as: \"A radical belief system suggesting that our institutions are built around discrimination, and claiming that all disparity is a result of that discrimination. It seeks a radical redefinition of society in which equality of group result is the endpoint, enforced by an angry mob.\"\n\nNote the strategic use of the word \"all,\" and the phrase \"angry mob.\"\n\nMendal's disastrous interview inspired other conservatives to try and define the word, which led to a range of interpretations.\n\nThe whole debacle seems to illustrate that right-wingers are fighting a losing battle, growing increasingly incoherent in their efforts to smear social justice as a form of tyranny.\n\nIndeed, a recent poll found that a majority of Americans view the word \"woke\" positively, and understand it to mean being \"informed, educated on, and aware of social injustices.\"\n\nHowever you define \"woke,\" simply using the word unironically, in its current context, says a lot."

      "text": "Wake Up, Be Woke And Lead The Change: Overcoming DE&I Opposition\n\nBy Aniela Unguresan\n\nBy Aniela Unguresan ,\n\nForbes Councils Member.\n\nAniela Unguresan is the Founder of EDGE Certified Foundation and Founder & CEO EDGE Strategy.\n\nI believe the U.S. is in the midst of its most significant culture war in recent history. Deep divisions and intense clashes of ideology, values and beliefs characterize this ongoing conflict. It encompasses various business , social, political and cultural issues and has far-reaching implications for the nation's identity and future direction.\n\nCompeting visions of America's past, present and future are at the heart of this culture war. The issues at stake are wide-ranging and multifaceted, spanning race, gender, identity, religion and immigration. When it comes to business, I see diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) as serving as the flash point. And the term woke has become emblematic of the cultural divide. I think it is important for business leaders to be \" woke \" and support DE&I initiatives.\n\nAs an economist and company leader, my analytical self recognizes DE&I's significance and beneficial impact on the economy and business landscape. My business side is where my \"wokeness\" lies. It is where I draw on my empathy, compassion, flexibility, mindfulness, forward-thinking and dedication. My two halves enable me to combine my passion for data with my ability to understand and appreciate the diverse perspectives , experiences and challenges individuals from different backgrounds face.\n\nThe culture war's divisive nature can create challenges for businesses, particularly when it intersects with issues of DE&I. By now, you probably have read enough articles and essays that talked about the benefits of DE&I : Boosting innovation, retaining and attracting employees and elevating the bottom line. There is abundant data confirming its benefits. Still, Pew Research found that \"There are wide partisan differences in views of workplace DEI. Most Democratic and Democratic-leaning workers (78%) say focusing on DEI at work is a good thing, compared with 30% of Republicans and Republican leaners.\"\n\nI know that resistance to DE&I is not always a deliberate act of defiance, although the culture war brings that out in some people. In general, I have observed five reasons people oppose DE&I.\n\n1. Fear of change . Many people are uncomfortable with change, and DE&I initiatives can be perceived as a threat to the status quo.\n\n2. Lack of understanding. Some people may resist DE&I because they do not fully understand what it entails and how it could benefit them personally. They may view DE&I as an attempt to give special treatment to specific groups at the expense of other groups.\n\n3. Bias and prejudice. Bias and discrimination can also contribute to resistance to DE&I. People may hold negative beliefs or stereotypes about certain groups, leading them to misunderstand efforts to promote diversity and inclusion.\n\n4. Fear of losing power and privilege. In many cases, resistance to DE&I is motivated by a desire to maintain control and privilege. People who have traditionally held positions of power and influence may feel threatened by the idea of sharing that power with others.\n\n5. Lack of a clear way to measure positive impact. Without clear metrics and accountability, organizations may not see the value in investing in DE&I initiatives.\n\nDespite these reasons, turning a blind eye to DE&I has profound consequences on businesses, the economy and all employees. Here are strategies I've employed to counteract resistance to DE&I.\n\nA politician once said , \"We are all entitled to our own opinions, but we are not entitled to our own facts.\" We are all entitled to our own opinions on DE&I as each one of us has very personal experiences with different aspects of our own or others' identities. However, particularly in an area that is perceived as \"soft\" and \"subjective\" in nature (wrongly so, in my opinion), it is important to stick to facts.\n\nYes, workplace DE&I is about equal opportunities and treating people with dignity. No, investments in workplace DE&I do not cause companies to go bankrupt. As Paul Krugman puts it, claiming that companies fail because of being woke is \"only marginally less ludicrous than claiming that wokeness somehow causes train derailments.\"\n\nAddressing resistance starts with providing education and raising awareness about the importance and benefits of DE&I and the negative impact of exclusion and discrimination.\n\nThe phrase \"walking a mile in another person's shoes\" holds particular relevance in the context of DE&I. It emphasizes the importance of empathy and understanding by encouraging individuals to consider the experiences, challenges and perspectives of others from different backgrounds. By sharing personal stories and perspectives, individuals can gain insight into the challenges faced by others and develop a deeper appreciation for their unique journeys, which in turn, builds stronger teams.\n\nOpen and honest communication is crucial in addressing resistance and creating opportunities for dialogue and fostering collaboration, inclusiveness and ownership. I believe leaders should clearly articulate the goals and rationale behind DE&I initiatives, emphasizing how they contribute to a more agile, resilient and successful organization.\n\nEstablish measurable goals and metrics to track progress on DE&I initiatives. Transparency in reporting and accountability mechanisms help demonstrate the impact of DE&I efforts and hold individuals and the organization responsible for their actions.\n\nData-driven insights can also help address misconceptions and biases by presenting evidence of the positive outcomes of DE&I. Solicit feedback from employees and stakeholders to ensure that initiatives are effective and responsive to their needs. Adapt and refine strategies based on feedback and changing dynamics to create a more inclusive and equitable environment.\n\nWhile the culture war poses challenges, it also presents opportunities for business leaders to lead by example to drive positive organizational change. Millennials and Generation-Z account for nearly half of the U.S. workforce and about two-thirds (68%) of workers ages 18 to 29 and 56% of 30 to 49 workers. This group overwhelmingly believes focusing on DE&I at work is good . I say, it's time to wake up, be woke and lead the change.\n\nForbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders. Do I qualify?"

More on September 7, 2021 in Jersey City, New Jersey. (Photo by Gary Hershorn/Getty Images)\n\nWhat do you think is the biggest issue facing America? According to recent polling , Americans in both parties are apprehensive about inflation, political division, and the future of our nation. But if you ask several outspoken Republican politicians what the central crisis is, you'll get a different answer: It's wokeness.\n\nIt sometimes seems you can't run in the Grand Old Party this cycle without attacking the woke mob. In an op-ed on ESG investing , Mike Pence decried \"woke capitalism\" as a nefarious scheme through which \"the woke left is poised to conquer America.\" Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida has made defeating wokeness the centerpiece of his campaign. In a pitch to Iowa primary voters , he positioned himself as the Winston Churchill of the War on Woke. \"I recognize that the woke mind virus represents a war on the truth, so we will wage a war on the woke,\" he exclaimed. \"We will fight the woke in education; we will fight the woke in corporations, we will fight the woke in the halls of Congress!\"\n\nThe \"War on Woke\" isn't just rhetoric. It's unfolding in many policy arenas, from Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) and Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) efforts to anti-LGBTQ legislation.\n\nDeSantis and other Republicans have been attacking DEI programs wherever possible. To fight \"woke indoctrination,\" DeSantis signed his \"Stop Woke Act ,\" setting limits on what can be taught about race in schools and workplace training . He has also banned DEI initiatives at Florida public colleges, claiming that \"DEI is better viewed as standing for discrimination, exclusion, and indoctrination.\" According to the Chronicle for Higher Education , 37 anti-DEI bills have now been introduced in 21 states nationwide, and four have become law. In Texas, for example, the Senate passed a bill forcing colleges to close their DEI offices by a 19-12 party-line vote.\n\nWith their decision to gut affirmative action programs (which I addressed earlier this year ), the conservative majority of the Supreme Court has paved the way for even more attacks on DEI. Last year, nearly seventy major companies warned this decision could close the \"pipeline of highly qualified future workers and business leaders\" needed to facilitate a diverse hiring pool. Now, many expect that corporate diversity initiatives will be the next domino to fall as they become subject to reverse discrimination suits enabled by this rash decision. \"The days of racial discrimination in hiring, especially through these DEI programs, are numbered,\" predicted one conservative advocate . \"I'd expect we're going to see a pretty large wave of litigation.\"\n\nESG, or sustainable investing, has also become a target in the War on Woke. Across the country, Republican state legislators have introduced 99 anti-ESG bills in 2023 - up from 39 last year. Seven have already become law. In May, DeSantis signed a law banning ESG bonds in Florida and barring state officials and pension funds from promoting ESG goals. In North Carolina, the Republican legislature overrode the Governor's veto of a similar ESG ban.\n\nOne of the most troubling fronts in this War on Woke has been the push to strip LGBTQ Americans of their fundamental and hard-won human rights. The ACLU is currently tracking nearly 500 anti-LGBTQ bills in play across the country - more than twice as many as last year. They include everything from bans on drag shows to restricting gender-affirming medical care to DeSantis' \"Don't Say Gay\" bill , banning any instruction about sexual orientation or gender identity in Florida primary schools. The House GOP also recently moved a Defense budget out of committee , including a Pride flag ban and transgender medical care at Veteran Administration facilities.\n\nBecause a \" woke military \" is also a concern, Republicans have been attacking DEI programs in the Armed Forces. Aghast at an Army ad that featured a soldier with two mothers, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) argued that the \"woke cancer\" perpetuated by \"Dem politicians and the woke media\" is creating a \"woke, emasculated military\" and \"turning them into pansies.\" Meanwhile, DeSantis and Mike Pence declared they would stand against military wokeness by reverting Fort Liberty back to Fort Bragg , the name of a Confederate general. Apparently, even taking arms against the United States is less noxious than wokeness.\n\nIt once seemed that Republicans were pivoting away from endless culture warmongering. George W. Bush famously ran as a \"compassionate conservative.\" While he didn't follow through , Donald Trump seemed relatively agnostic about LGBTQ issues in 2016. (\"If two people dig each other, they dig each other,\" he once wrote.) But the War on Woke has reawakened a vicious streak in the party, and many Republicans seem happy to rail against Disney and Bud Light for promoting LGBTQ inclusion. When Target moved Pride displays in their stores for fear of right-wing violence, Cruz hoped it would \"make a real impression on [other] executives...we want to stop corporate America from going woke .\"\n\nAfter all this, what is woke, exactly? When asked by a reporter to define the term he loves to hate so much, DeSantis said: \"It's a form of cultural Marxism. It's about putting merit and achievement behind identity politics, and it's basically a war on the truth.\" That bit about cultural Marxism is the tell. To DeSantis and his counterparts, woke is the new \"Communism\" or \"Socialism,\" or the new \"Clinton\" or \"Obama\" - It's the big, scary word to rile up people and hold the fractious GOP caucus together.\n\nBut here's the thing: most people don't seem to define woke in that way. Per a March 2023 USA Today poll , the majority of Americans (56%), including most Independents and a third of Republicans, believe the term means \"to be informed, educated on, and aware of social injustices.\" Only 39% - not nearly enough to win an election - think it means \"to be overly politically correct and police others' words.\" In addition, 56% of workers support DEI , and six in ten Americans won't work for a company that doesn't speak out against racial injustice.\n\nIn short, the War on Woke is not only a political loser, but it's also seriously damaging the fabric of our country."

      "text": "Here Come The Anti-Woke Venture Capitalists\n\nBy David Jeans\n\nE arlier this year, a little-known company called New Founding made headlines when it announced plans to build a Christian enclave in Kentucky - an \"aligned community'\" where owners could \"disappear from the cultural insanity of the broader country.\" But building a village was just the beginning.\n\nNow, New Founding has launched a venture capital fund to invest in what it calls \"aligned companies,\" startups that oppose progressive ideologies and are intent on both \"cultural and economic disruption.\" It's one of a small but growing number of VCs vocally rejecting 'wokeism' and building their investment thesis on core conservative values.\n\nNew Founding's investments are one tentpole of a broader goal: to remake society with a largely MAGA, tech-driven, Christian worldview. It decries leftists as \"anti-human,\" celebrates technology as a singular force that will define a new era of prosperity, loves crypto and sees the internet (\"deeply American in ethos and design\") as a means to its ends. \"Our project offers a powerful avenue,\" a manifesto on its website published in July reads, \"both to develop the class of people who can ultimately challenge the incumbent regime and to acquire the resources, territory, and institutions that will enable this effort.\"\n\nSo far, it's raised $3 million for its venture fund, a modest start. But it has made 10 investments in seed stage and series A companies, among them an education startup to help teachers start their own 'micro schools,' and an ad-tech company that helps gun manufacturers target consumers. For Presidio, a startup that recently raised a $4 million seed fund led by New Founding to provide Christian-branded, pro-life health insurance, the group has been an effective ally. \"They are initiators of a pro-American, Christian movement,\" CEO Daniel Cruz told Forbes , adding the group is \"well connected and have helped us in formulating our strategy.\"\n\nNew Founding CEO Nate Fischer told Forbes these investments are the beginnings of a \"parallel economy\" offering conservative versions of mainstream services it views as too liberal, like Google's ad-tech products. \"There's a large share of people who feel that their views are almost entirely absent from the institutions that are shaping the future,\" Fischer explained. \"And there's a real acute need and hunger for alternatives.\"\n\n\"More than half the country are not being catered to by the normal corporate world.\"\n\nAt least one Silicon Valley leader is on board. Marc Andreessen - a cofounder of the venture giant Andreessen Horowitz, or A16z, who has also railed against \"wokeism\" - is among those backing New Founding's venture fund. He's taken a small stake, investing a \"six-figure\" sum as a limited partner, according to three people with direct knowledge of the fund. Andreessen didn't respond to a comment request.\n\nMeanwhile, a rotating cast of prominent Silicon Valley voices have appeared on New Founding's buzzy podcast. A16z partner Katherine Boyle, who leads the outfit's high profile American Dynamism fund, has been a guest - along with multiple other mainstream defense tech bigwigs, including Founders Fund partner and Anduril chairman Trae Stephens, and Blackwater founder Erik Prince (none responded to a comment request). They are part of a growing tech counterculture movement that emphasizes patriotism, restoring an American manufacturing base and building weapons for the U.S. military. \"We're not only going to see, you know, interesting companies emerge from this sort of this vibe shift,\" Boyle told New Founding's podcast in March. \"But I think we'll see new political movements.\"\n\nPolitical movements with a message that will translate into solid returns, as some investors see it. Vivek Ramaswamy, the billionaire former presidential candidate and DOGE cofounder, launched an investment firm in 2022 to push companies to abandon 'woke' ideals, after lambasting \"stakeholder capitalism\" in his book Woke Inc . More recently, others are stepping in: Investor Azoria Capital said last week its ETF would shun companies that support DEI, and embraced the 'anti-woke' moniker. \"If you commit to hiring on race and gender and not merit, your stock will continue to underperform,\" CEO James Fishback told Fox News. \"Our ETF will call you out.\"\n\nAnother firm, 1789 Capital, recently hired MAGA First Son Donald Trump Jr. as a partner after its debut. It has raised more than $150 million for a growth equity fund - according to a person with knowledge of the fund - to implement its anti-woke blueprint: investing in companies that reject environmental, social and governance principles, globalization, and bureaucracy. Like New Founding, 1789 sees its portfolio companies as part of an emergent 'parallel economy.' The firm has backed nine startups, including Substack, video platform Rumble and the Tucker Carlson Network .\n\nOmeed Malik, 1789's president, told Forbes he believes other venture firms, like Sequoia, long ignored a clear cultural and political shift, including a move away from globalization. \"That's the firm that went out of their way to create China-only funds and invest in China,\" he said. \"And it wasn't until the winds were blowing the other way, as recently as about 20 months ago, that they stopped doing that. So it was me observing their conduct that made it clear to me, we needed an alternative.\" (Sequoia didn't respond to a comment request).\n\nIt's too early to see how the anti-woke thesis will pay out, and compared to Wall Street and mainstream Silicon Valley investors, these funds have raised a \"pittance,\" said Neil Patel, who leads the Tucker Carlson Network, and negotiated 1789's investment. But momentum is building, particularly with the arrival of a venture capitalist, J.D. Vance, in the White House. Pointing to the number of people who elected Trump, Patel added that \"slightly more than half the country are not being catered to by the normal corporate world, and there's a huge opportunity there.\"\n\nS ilicon Valley cemented America's tech dominance largely on progressive ideals like free trade, immigration and social justice, spawning world-changing companies and a powerful class of new billionaires with culture-shaping reach - people like Andreessen, who built one of the first web browsers and was an early backer of Facebook and Twitter. He is among the most prominent of a coterie of Silicon Valley leaders who have in recent years turned against many of those same ideals, taking aim at \"woke\" agendas, which they now claim have stalled innovation, hamstrung business and limited American prosperity . \"In the 2010s through 2024, being woke and repressive was the height of cool,\" Andreessen proclaimed on X last week. \"Starting in 2025, resisting wokeness will be the height of cool.\"\n\nWith that view, Andreessen's investment in New Founding isn't particularly unusual: He is a prolific angel investor, and often backs emerging funds . What's striking is how his ideas about American tech supremacy - freeing innovators from regulation and government intervention, among them - align with the firm's mission.\n\n\"Many people are looking for something that has been censored by the mainstream.\"\n\nIn his Techno-Optimist manifesto, a 5,000 word screed published in 2023, Andreessen wrote, \"technology must be a violent assault on the forces of the unknown, to force them to bow before man.\" Once a self-professed Democrat, in recent years he has moved to the right, publicly endorsing now President-elect Trump. And he has been vocal about his frustration with government and American culture, which he says has evolved into \"a left-wing reactionary scream\": \"radicalized rage that's sort of fundamentally anti-capitalist... fundamentally communist...and then fundamentally anti-technological.\"\n\nA response to this - Andreessen and New Founding have both suggested - is already underway, a so-called \"vibe shift\" in Silicon Valley and beyond. Legacy institutions are in accelerating decline and new cultural movements are rising to replace them, they claim.\n\n\"The old ways of cutting and slicing the world have broken down,\" wrote New Founding's head of venture, Santiago Pliego, in a widely-shared blog post earlier this year, \"and now the most unexpected groups have found themselves as co-belligerents in an existential war.\" On Tucker Carlson's X show , Pliego said Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter was the first major step toward altering society: \"A lot of people are sensing that things are changing.\"\n\nB ehind New Founding is Fischer, a Harvard Law graduate and active member of various conservative groups, including the Claremont Institute and the Society for American Civil Renewal, a male-only Christian fraternal group that hopes to train young leaders to replace the U.S. ruling class with \"a renewed American regime.\" He appears to have made a small fortune from managing a multi-billion dollar real estate portfolio. Another of his companies, Trustwork - an online marketplace for maintenance workers - was shuttered in 2019, and is the subject of an ongoing lawsuit accusing Fischer and a business partner of embezzlement; They have denied wrongdoing and countersued, claiming they were extorted. Then, in 2021, he started New Founding with other Claremont alumni.\n\nOn the phone, Fischer is pensive and pragmatic. He is also very much focused on New Founding as a business opportunity built on its alignment with three social groups: Trump's MAGA followers (\"the new right political movement\"), the dissident tech world (those fighting \"the Google, Facebook, Salesforce woke culture\"), and the Christian right (\"would-be Christian thinkers who are focused on a more assertive political vision\"). \"Our thesis was that those would be three components of an emerging movement,\" he said.\n\nBut in New Founding's manifesto, he strikes a darker tone. \"We are at the end of a civilizational cycle,\" he wrote. \"Coming years will bring turmoil and peril, but also great opportunity-perhaps the first in nearly a century-to forge new models and institutions that can shape the direction of Western civilization.\"\n\nHe concludes with a nod to an \"inflection point,\" an upcoming upheaval, and a call to action. \"Even another Trump presidency will not change the current system's underlying fragility or end the Left's grip on most legacy institutions,\" he wrote, before finishing with: \"It is our birthright to lead Western civilization into the digital age.\"\n\nSuch language appears to share parallels with Accelerationism, a philosophy that claims societal collapse is impending, and measures to hasten its arrival will allow something better - and more aligned - to be built in its place, said Jason Blazakis, a professor at Middlebury College who focuses on extremism. \"It's implied that there needs to be change, there needs to be potentially a blood letting, without saying that there needs to be violence,\" he said. \"Because there's no other way to change the fabric of the country in the way that they would like, without having some level of violence or upheaval.\"\n\nFischer insisted this isn't as grim as it might sound, and said it is not a subtextual call for unrest or civil war. Societal upheaval \"could be widespread violence\" or it could be \"like the financial crisis of 2008 where you saw the collapse of major institutions,\" he said. Or the fall of the Soviet Union. \"We're in a world where political volatility is high, meaning, it's very hard to predict any sort of outcome, and you have a wide array of possible outcomes,\" he said. \"And I tend to avoid the business of prediction.\"\n\nNew Founding started as a \"dissident\" organization, Fischer said, acknowledging that he has leaned into provocation. He even launched a venture last year with an online personality who has a history of posting swastikas and other Nazi imagery (which he has previously described as \"ironic trolling\" as opposed to \"genuine Nazi belief\"). \"My thesis from the beginning was to be public and be online, and that would attract people,\" he said. \"Many people are looking for something that has been censored by the mainstream and by being public about our interest in that, we will have something attractive that is scarce in the world.\"\n\nIt's still early, but the group is gaining traction. New Founding's talent network, which promises to place candidates at companies that support the organization's mission, is 3,000 members strong and growing. It submitted several dozen people for roles to be considered by Project 2025, the alleged far-right blueprint for Trump 2.0 (Trump, notably, distanced himself from its more extreme ideas). With increasing momentum spanning Silicon Valley royalty to the White House itself - one staffer posted a group photo with Vance after he was chosen as Trump's VP, calling him \"our guy\" - the firm plans to close its first fund at $6 million, before raising another in 2025.\n\nNow that Trump's headed back into office, Fischer said he's thinking about toning down the rhetoric around New Founding's message, articulating its vision on its own terms, rather than as an anti-woke reaction. \"We've been progressively defining what the positive vision we aspire to is.\"\n\nWill Yakowicz contributed reporting."

      "text": "'The Acolyte' Sparks Anti-'Woke' Criticism Over 'Pronoun' Scene - Drawing Rebuke From Writer\n\nAnti-\"woke\" critics have slammed a scene from the newest episode of the \"Star Wars\" TV series \"The Acolyte\" in which a character appears to ask about another's pronouns, prompting the writer to clarify the joke on social media as the controversial series continues to face a review-bombing campaign.\n\n\"The Acolyte\" has been subjected to a review-bombing campaign on Rotten Tomatoes. (Photo by Kate ... More Green/Getty Images for Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures UK)\n\nEpisode 4 of \"The Acolyte,\" a series praised by critics but controversial among some \"Star Wars\" fans and conservative critics who feel the show is too \"woke,\" premiered on Tuesday evening.\n\nAnti-\"woke\" critics circulated one scene from the episode in which actress Amandla Stenberg's character asks another: \"Is he, or they, with us?\" referring to Bazil , a small rodent-like animal creature.\n\nThe Daily Wire , a conservative media outlet, and right-wing X account End Wokeness , frequent critics of \"The Acolyte,\" posted the scene on X, with the latter slamming the series for including a \"a they/them pronoun scene.\"\n\nClaire \"CK\" Kiechel, co-writer of the episode, clarified in an X post that the line was \"obviously a joke about pronouns because she's referring to a strange lil animal creature.\"\n\nThe viral clips posted by conservative critics on social media are short and do not include a shot of Bazil-possibly misleading viewers of the clip to believe Stenberg is asking about a person's pronouns, rather than the animal creature.\n\n\"The Acolyte\" has attracted controversy throughout its run and sparked criticism from anti-\"woke\" critics who have launched a review-bombing campaign of the series. Though the series has an 83% score on Rotten Tomatoes from television critics, the audience score is a dismal 14%. Amid the series' launch earlier this month, an interview of Stenberg and series creator Leslye Headland went viral as the interviewer joked they made the \"gayest\" entry in the \"Star Wars\" franchise, prompting Stenberg and Headland to laugh. Stenberg said, \"Star Wars is so gay already-I mean, have you seen the 'fits?\" while Headland joked R2-D2 could be a lesbian. The third episode, which premiered on June 11, rattled fans who felt the episode clashed with \"Star Wars\" lore. In the episode, Stenberg's twin characters, Mae and Osha Aniseya, are implied to have been born by their mother using the Force-causing some fans to lament that may conflict with the accepted canon of \"Star Wars\" character Anakin Skywalker's status as the \"chosen one,\" as he was also born by the Force. Other fans defended the episode, including ScreenRant's \"Star Wars\" editor Thomas Bacon, who wrote Skywalker was born through the will of the Force itself, while Mae and Osha's mother manipulated the Force to create them.\n\nThe fourth episode sparked another fan debate over whether \"The Acolyte\" broke accepted \"Star Wars\" canon because of a cameo appearance from Ki-Adi-Mundi, a Jedi character who appears in the \"Star Wars\" prequel films. Some fans alleged the character's inclusion did not make sense, as the events of \"The Acolyte\" take place a century prior to the prequel films, while others felt his true age was never actually known. Kiechel addressed critics of the character's cameo on X, joking: \"We offered the part to Yoda but he wasn't tech avail so a young Ki Adi Mundi stepped in for the part.\"\n\n'The Acolyte' Creators Joke About Making 'Gayest' 'Star Wars' Series And Lesbian R2-D2-Angering Right-Wing Critics (Forbes)\n\nFans Think New 'Acolyte' Episode Changes 'Star Wars' Lore As Supposed Lesbian Witch Plot Goes Viral-But Others Say It Makes Sense (Forbes)\n\nOne Community.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nMost Americans are failing to adopt so-called woke terms like \"Latinx\" and \"cultural appropriation\" in spite of their use by some prominent lawmakers and activists, a new survey suggests.\n\nThe poll by YouGov shows that only one in five Americans regularly uses terms such as \"safe space\" and \"white privilege \".\n\nWords like \"antiracism\" were understood by the majority of respondents, the poll found, but only a minority used social justice-oriented language regularly.\n\nRepublicans are less likely than Democrats to use these phrases, the survey showed.\n\nOf the 30 terms in the survey, \"safe space\" was the most widely used, with 26 percent of Democrats and 17 percent of Republicans saying it featured in their vocabulary. Safe Spaces are locations not seen as a threat or a challenge to minorities.\n\nSome 17 percent of Republican voters regularly use the term \"woke\", which became more widely used during the Black Lives Matter movement and means being alert to injustice. The poll, taken between November 13 - 15 from 1,164 U.S. adult citizens, does not disclose the context in which the words might be spoken, and whether they are used pejoratively or in the advancement of social justice.\n\nA separate YouGov poll earlier this month found that 57 percent of Americans believed that political correctness played a role in November's election and many of the terms cited in the survey regularly feature in America's culture wars.\n\nDanica Patrick, the former race car driver and vocal Trump supporter, recently posted a photo of Admiral Rachel Levine, Biden's Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), beside RFK Jr., Trump's pick for the job , captioned: \"Woke bullsh*t, to no bullsh*t.\"\n\nMarcel Roman, a professor at Harvard University, has argued that the Democrats' use of \"Latinx\", a gender-neutral replacement for Latinos and Latinas, harmed their chances with voters who viewed the term as a \"bourgeois, coastal, white imposition\".\n\n\"The Democratic Party at the national level recognized it may do more harm than good,\" he told Commonwealth Beacon , adding that neither Biden nor Harris has publicly used \"Latinx\" since 2021.\n\nAmericans were least familiar with \"BIPOC\" (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color), with 55 percent of respondents saying they had \"never heard\" the word.\n\nAs reported by Newsweek , some Black campaigners reject the umbrella term on the basis that it erodes the distinctions between anti-Black racism in America and the experiences of other racial groups.\n\nAndrea Plaid, author of Penning with the People, and Christopher MacDonald-Dennis, Chief Diversity Officer at Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts, said in a recent Newsweek opinion piece : \"As America has come to understand finally, the police are disproportionately killing Black people . To use the term \"people of color\" or even the newly popular BIPOC, which stands for Black and Indigenous people of color, to speak about police brutality obscures Black people's specific struggle against police brutality.\"\n\nDo you have a story we should be covering?

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nIt's a delicate balancing act, promoting a book with six kids at home full-time. My book Stolen Youth -about how I believe woke ideology is upending American childhood-was released a week ago. To give me the time and space I needed to do various television shows and appearances, I arranged childcare for three of my kids.\n\nOn Tuesday, March 14, my husband was working from home while my 7-year-old and 9-year-old children worked through their homeschool checklists. I put my newborn down for a nap while I logged on for an appearance on The Hill's YouTube show, Rising .\n\nRight before we went on air, I heard one of the hosts speaking about parents in what I perceived to be a negative way. I panicked. Over my career as a loud and proud \"breeder\", I have often felt attacked by the left, and braced myself to be ambushed on air about my own life choices as a mother of six children.\n\nThroughout the entire interview I felt a panic attack growing, but just tried to get through the duration of the appearance without an incident. As we talked, I was stammering and trying not to set traps for myself. I did not want to open up questions about my own personal life.\n\nFinally, I was left speechless at one question-the basic definition of the word \"woke.\"\n\nIt was a fair question; after all, it's the centerpiece of my book's premise. But by that point, the panic attack had arrived and I was rendered speechless. Eventually, I sputtered out what I thought was a decent definition of the word, but by then it was too late.\n\nI knew the momentary brain freeze would go viral, and I was right. The clip has been viewed millions of times, and a dozen articles have been written about the most humiliating seconds of my life.\n\nAs soon as we hung up, I broke into a sob. My husband and kids immediately surrounded me. I'm not usually a crier. In fact, the last time I got a bit tearful was two months ago towards the end of my home birth, during the worst stage of labor called transition.\n\nWatching me cry and panic was not a sight my kids were used to seeing, yet for the next day, they saw it a few more times. For the next day, I visibly struggled emotionally. But I also kept plugging on with more appearances on radio and podcasts, albeit without the confidence I normally exhibit and enjoy.\n\nThough I've become more self-conscious of my pauses, I haven't stopped working to promote a book I spent a year and a half researching, writing, and editing. I'm proud of that work and our final product, and won't let a short period of anxiety detract from it or define it, or me.\n\nMy kids are all home with me on a regular basis and have had a front row seat for this show, my lowest and most frustrating professional experience to date. But I'm glad they were.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, as the clip was going increasingly viral, I felt compelled to sit my older kids down and be honest with them. I told them I was on edge, and that daddy was working from home in order to help me juggle, but also to be emotionally supportive.\n\nI told them a lot of people were sending me unkind messages and comments, and that I would do my best to not let my feelings affect my mood, but that it might, and if it did, that I'm sorry. Saying this out loud made me more conscious of trying to keep that promise.\n\nI wouldn't have planned this experience, but it was a valuable one for my older children. They saw their mother fail, and they saw her get back on the horse. They saw their mother humiliated, but they also saw my confidence in myself remain intact.\n\nThey are also watching me try to win back my confidence on camera, working hard not to let one moment give me permanent stage fright. They saw what an emotionally healthy marriage is: My husband silently taking on the tasks that I usually do to give me a break. They saw him give me pep talks and hugs when I needed them, and they saw him joke with me as I moved on enough to be able to laugh at my own misfortune.\n\nWe homeschool our kids, and a lot of the time that looks like math or phonics lessons. But sometimes it looks like this; real life lessons in resilience, humility, and perseverance.\n\nBethany Mandel is a columnist, political commentator and co-author of Stolen Youth: How Radicals Are Erasing Innocence and Indoctrinating a Generation.

It's Not About the Free Market | Opinion\n\nAdvocates for ideas and draws conclusions based on the interpretation of facts and data.\n\nNewsweek AI is in beta. Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nIt's undeniable at this point that American corporations have embraced left-wing \"woke\" ideology. They largely do this under the guise of adhering to ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) standards, but often go even further by explicitly promoting left-wing ideology in their product lines and advertising, contributing to controversial left-wing causes like Black Lives Matter and Planned Parenthood, and threatening to withdraw business if state legislators dare to pass bills they deem too conservative.\n\nMany who support corporate politicking say this is the free market at work, but that's not really accurate. ESG policies certainly aren't popular among consumers. Most Americans don't want to see energy prices go up domestically so the U.S. can continue to subsidize China's carbon emissions. They don't support late-term abortion or sex changes for kids. They're not enamored with diversity quotas-in fact, they find affirmative action to be abhorrent.\n\nIt's hard to imagine that these same consumers would be inspired to give money to companies that go out of their way to emphasize their support for unpopular ideas. While some companies might lean into left-wing politics as a niche marketing strategy-Ben & Jerry's comes to mind-in most circumstances it's not ideal to alienate sizable portions of your customer base. And at least recently, as some of these companies have made the mistake of \"going woke,\" traditional market forces have negatively impacted the companies' bottom lines.\n\nMuch has been written about the collapse of Anheuser-Busch's Bud Light brand after conservatives decided to boycott the beer when it brought on controversial transgender activist Dylan Mulvaney in an online advertisement. But other corporations have felt similar pain in recent months. Target came under fire recently due to its array of \"Pride Month\" LGBTQ-themed products that appeared to be targeted towards children. When conservatives launched a boycott in May, Target's stock price quickly cratered 20 percent-and it still has not recovered. At the same time, the valuations of competitors like Walmart have surged. (Anheuser-Busch's competitor Molson Coors experienced a similar boost.)\n\nDisney has also dealt with backlash for its LGBTQ activism. In March 2022, conservative activist Chris Rufo released footage from an all-hands video conference where various Disney executives committed to advancing all aspects of the LGBTQ agenda. Notably, corporate president Karey Burke expressed support for having \"many, many, many LGBTQIA characters in our stories\" and promised to ensure that at least 50 percent of the characters were \"sexual and racial minorities.\" The executives also committed to going to war against Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for signing the Parental Rights in Education Act.\n\nThis didn't play very well in the traditional market. Last year turned out to be a disaster for Disney shareholders: the company's stock lost nearly 45 percent of its value. Moreover, recent attempts to inject left-wing ideology into Disney film franchises have ended poorly: Lightyear , Indiana Jones , and The Little Mermaid all bombed at the box office, with the live-action Snow White remake lining up as the next bust candidate.\n\nSo why do corporations go \"woke?\" What is this really about? Why are companies publicly embracing radical left-wing politics when it is so obviously unpopular (and potentially dangerous) to do so?\n\nIt's possible these corporations really are acting in their rational self-interest-pursuing a path they believe is best suited for success-but it is certainly not being driven by what consumers want. Rather, they are seeking to placate a highly motivated, vindictive elite class that likely poses a greater threat to their long-term stability than the short-term frustrations of the consumer.\n\nAccording to one study, nearly 70 percent of America's CEOs affiliate themselves with the Republican Party. But because our education system almost exclusively produces loud, angry left-wing zealots, these CEOs have no choice but to surround themselves with these kinds of people-both in the C-Suite and throughout their companies. Failure to please these ideologues would pose an existential threat not only to the well-being of the corporation, but also to the CEO's livelihood. And should the CEO manage to convince staff to reject (or at least not participate in) left-wing ideology, wealthy shareholders (i.e. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street) can weaponize their immense power to set him or her straight. It's happened before , and it will certainly happen again.\n\nIn other words, this is part ideology, part price of admittance to an elite club, and part protection racket-doing everything one can to avoid upsetting the mob. If BlackRock CEO Larry Fink tells you to do X, Y, and Z to improve your rating with the Human Rights Campaign, you had better do it, or else. A decline in sales is far easier to overcome than a decline in reputation among the rich and powerful.\n\nAnd let's not forget the ever-important relationship between so many of these corporations and the government. With Joe Biden in the White House and Democrats running the Senate , you had better believe corporations are looking to advertise their progressive bona fides. Step out of line, and you risk losing your subsidies and your contracts. Show your pride, Raytheon! Save the Earth, Exxon-Mobil!\n\nBut in the end, the claim that companies are taking any of these stances due to \"market forces\" does not hold water. In truth, they aren't conforming to consumer preferences; they are conforming to elite culture. And sadly, despite the occasional effective boycott, it's the rest of us who are all too often stuck bearing the consequences.\n\nJon Schweppe is the policy director at American Principles Project.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, that he would ensure future programming would no longer be \"woke.\"\n\nOn Monday, West Virginia delegates introduced House Bill 2406, which seeks to eliminate \"woke words and agendas from state government documents, websites, literature, and in person,\" the bill said.\n\nThe bill also said that in official government documents, websites and literature as well as in person, certain \"exclusionary and sexist terms\" should be replaced with \"accurate, female-affirming alternatives.\"\n\nThese are the terms:\n\nThe state delegates sponsoring the bill are Crouse, Sarah Drennan, Patrick Lucas, Lisa White, Eric Brooks, Michael Hornby, Ian T. Masters, Michael Amos, Mickey Petitto, Marshall W. Clay and David Cannon.\n\nHouse Bill 2406 said : \"All state offices, departments, boards, and commissions are prohibited from using exclusionary, sexist language in state government business, effective immediately.\"\n\nWest Virginia Delegate Kathie Hess Crouse told Newsweek : \"I introduced HB 2406 to eliminate 'woke words' from all West Virginia state agencies because words matter-and so does the truth.\n\n\"Biology is not a debate. Women are women, and their unique differences should be recognized, not rewritten. Our state government should reflect truth, clarity, and reality-not political agendas. I will not allow our women to be demeaned, and I will not allow common sense to be replaced with ideology. It's time to restore honesty in our language and ensure that West Virginia stands for truth.\"\n\nDelegate Kayla Young, a Democrat, told Newsweek : \"Banning words and phrases is government overreach at its finest. I find HB 2406 to be a waste of time bill that is floating around many states. You'd be hard pressed to find a West Virginian who has seen any of the terms this bill seeks to ban in any official government business. We've got real problems to solve, and this just takes up energy unnecessarily.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump told reporters in the Oval Office earlier this month about the Kennedy Center : \"It's not gonna be woke. There's no more woke in this country. This woke has cost us a fortune and cost us our reputation, but the reputation's coming back very, very rapidly.\"\n\nIf House Bill 2406 is approved and becomes law, it will take effect on June 1.\n\nUpdate 2/21/25, 10:30 a.m. ET: This article has been updated with a comment from Kathie Hess Crouse.\n\nUpdate 2/24/25, 6:24 a.m. ET: This article has been updated with a comment from Kayla Young.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nKhaleda Rahman is Newsweek's National Correspondent based in London, UK.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nDisney's live-action remake of Snow White is set to hit theaters on Friday, featuring significant changes from the original animated classic.\n\nNewsweek reached out to a Disney spokesperson via email for comment.\n\nThe original 1937 film, based on the famous fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm, follows the story of a princess named Snow White, who flees into the forest to escape her evil stepmother and befriends seven dwarf miners: Sleepy, Dopey, Doc, Sneezy, Grumpy, Bashful, and Happy. Ultimately, the stepmother is defeated, and Snow White falls in love with a handsome prince.\n\nHowever, leading up to its 2025 release, the live-action Snow White has sparked debate over the creative liberties taken with the story , with some labeling the changes as \"woke.\"\n\nRachel Zegler, who stars as Snow White in the film, has a mother of Colombian descent and father of Polish origins. The 23-year-old's casting drew both praise and criticism, with some conservative figures and social media users questioning the decision to cast a Latina actress in the role , as Snow White is traditionally associated with the phrase \"fairest of them all.\"\n\nZegler expressed her excitement about the role, stating, \"Never in a million years did I imagine that this would be a possibility for me.\"\n\n\"You don't normally see Snow Whites who are of Latin descent, even though Snow White is really a big deal in Spanish-speaking countries,\" she said in a 2022 interview with Variety .\n\n\"But you don't particularly see people who look like me or are me playing roles like that. When it was announced, it was a huge thing that was trending on Twitter for days, because all of the people were angry,\" she added.\n\nHer comments, along with criticisms of the original film, contributed to the controversy.\n\nZegler previously criticized the 1937 animated version, describing it as \"extremely dated when it comes to the ideas of women being in roles of power.\"\n\nIn a 2022 interview with Extra she remarked: \"The original cartoon came out in 1937 and very evidently so. There's a big focus on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. Weird. Weird! So we didn't do that this time.\"\n\n\"People are making these jokes about ours being the PC Snow White, where it's like, yeah, it is - because it needed that,\" she added in another interview with Vanity Fair .\n\nZegler has also come under fire from conservatives after posting a string of messages attacking Donald Trump on social media in the wake of Trump's election victory in November. In a series of Instagram posts, Zegler said \"May Trump supporters and Trump voters and Trump himself never know peace,\" and that there is a \"deep deep sickness in this country.\" She ended her post by saying \"f*** Donald Trump.\"\n\nShe later apologized, writing on Instagram: \"I would like to sincerely apologize for the election post I shared on Instagram last week. I let my emotions get the best of me. Hatred and anger have caused us to move further and further away from peace and understanding, and I am sorry I contributed to the negative discourse.\"\n\nIn January 2022, actor Peter Dinklage criticized the remake for what he saw as contradictory messaging . During an appearance on the WTF with Marc Maron podcast, the Game of Thrones star, who has a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia, said:\n\n\"Literally no offense to anyone, but I was a little taken aback when they were very proud to cast a Latina actress as Snow White-but you're still telling the story of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs . Take a step back and look at what you're doing there. It makes no sense to me.\"\n\nHe continued, \"You're progressive in one way but then you're still making that f***ing backwards story about seven dwarfs living in a cave together, what the f*** are you doing, man?\n\nIn response, Disney released a statement: \"To avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film, we are taking a different approach with these seven characters and have been consulting with members of the dwarfism community.\"\n\nThe controversy resurfaced in October 2023 when Disney revealed that the dwarfs would be depicted using CGI rather than live-action actors.\n\nAdditionally, the film faced boycott calls over Gal Gadot's casting as the Evil Queen due to her outspoken support for Israel during the Israel-Gaza war.\n\nGadot, an Israeli actress, served in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for two years. Zegler also added to the controversy with a social media post in August 2024 stating, \"And always remember, free Palestine.\"\n\nHere are five substantial changes that the new Snow White makes to the original.\n\nIn the original, Snow White's name comes from her pale complexion. In the remake, it is attributed to her being born during a blizzard.\n\nIn the original, Snow White is in search of a husband. In the remake, she is part of a rebellion against the Evil Queen.\n\nIn the original, her love interest is a rich prince, but in Snow White , he is a poor thief.\n\nIn the original, Snow White sings \"Someday My Prince Will Come.\" In the remake, she sings a new song titled \"Waiting on a Wish.\"\n\nIn the original, there are seven dwarfs. In the live-action, the dwarfs are magical creatures animated with CGI. Meanwhile, the prince has his own group of seven bandits, in which people with dwarfism are represented.\n\nDespite all this, one controversial aspect of the original has been kept.\n\nIn the original, Snow White is in a death-like slumber after eating the poisoned apple from the evil Queen. The prince finds her in her comatose state and kissing her, breaking the spell and awakening her.\n\nThe moment has been criticized in modern times for portraying an unconscious character receiving a kiss without consent. A 2021 SFGate op-ed reviewing Disneyland's updated Snow White's Enchanted Wish ride noted: \"Haven't we already agreed that consent in early Disney movies is a major issue? That teaching kids that kissing, when it hasn't been established if both parties are willing to engage, is not OK?.\" the op-ed wrote.\n\nIt seems in this instance the true love's kiss, a classic trope in fairy tale storytelling, was one element that Disney was happy to keep.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\n\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\n\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\n\nMegan Cartwright is Newsweek's Deputy Entertainment Editor, based in London, U.K. Her focus is on U.S. pop culture and entertainment news stories.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is apparently distancing himself from the conservative trend of extensively using the word \"woke.\"\n\nTrump suggested that the term was overused by Republicans during a 2024 presidential campaign stop in Iowa on Thursday, complaining that \"half the people\" who use the term do not even know what it means.\n\n\"Woke\" has become a culture war buzzword among the political right in recent years. While definitions vary, it is often used as a catchall term to describe political positions or issues of which conservatives do not approve.\n\nNotably, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis -Trump's bitter rival in the 2024 GOP presidential primary race-has extensively used the term \"woke,\" introducing the \" Stop Woke Act \" in his state last year and campaigning on an \"anti-woke\" platform.\n\n\"I don't like the term 'woke,'\" Trump said during his speech at the Westside Conservative Club in Urbandale, a suburb of Des Moines. \"I hear the term 'woke, woke, woke.' It's just a term they use. Half the people can't even define it, they don't know what it is.\"\n\nTrump went on to suggest that his own definition of \"woke\" involved transgender athletes, or a hypothetical scenario of men pretending to be transgender women to compete in women's sports.\n\nThe former president said that he would have \"the greatest\" women's basketball team if he could convince NBA star LeBron James and \"four or five other big guys\" to \"become a woman.\"\n\n\"I'll go down as the greatest coach in history,\" said Trump. \"They'll say I was the greatest ever ... and that's all 'woke.' That's all ... I guess they define that as woke, but that's all woke.\"\n\nThe Merriam-Webster dictionary defines the term \"woke\" as being \"aware of and actively attentive to important facts and issues (especially issues of racial and social justice).\"\n\n\"It originated in African American English and gained more widespread use beginning in 2014 as part of the Black Lives Matter movement,\" Merriam-Webster's website states .\n\n\"By the end of that same decade it was also being applied by some as a general pejorative for anyone who is or appears to be politically left-leaning,\" it continues.\n\nRyan Newman, general counsel for DeSantis, defined \"woke\" as \"the belief there are systemic injustices in American society and the need to address them\" during a court hearing last year, according to Florida Politics.\n\nDeSantis, whom Trump often refers to with derogatory nicknames like \"Ron DeSanctimonious\" or \"Meatball Ron,\" has not explicitly defined \"woke\" himself, despite using the term extensively.\n\nDuring his second inaugural address in January, the governor told supporters that he rejected \"woke ideology\" and proclaimed that \"Florida is where woke goes to die.\"\n\nTwo Axios Engagious/Schlesinger focus groups conducted in January suggested that Florida residents had significant difficulty in defining what \"woke\" means .\n\nRegardless of Trump's apparent rejection of the term on Thursday, the former president has recently and repeatedly used \"woke\" to attack his political opponents.\n\nIn a Truth Social post on Sunday, Trump blasted DeSantis over his war against Disney , arguing that the company had \"become a Woke and Disgusting shadow of its former self \" due to the governor's policies.\n\nNewsweek has reached out to the office of Trump via email and the DeSantis campaign via its website for comment.\n\nAila Slisco is a Newsweek night reporter based in New York.

      "text": "'I Was a Teacher, I Abandoned Being \"Woke\" For My Students' Sake'\n\nUser-generated content. Lightly edited.\n\nNewsweek AI is in beta. Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2009, I was a New York City Teaching Fellow on a mission to close the achievement gap for students who endured what George W. Bush called \"the soft bigotry of low expectations\" because they were Black and Latino.\n\nFar from the deadbeats I expected to encounter at the Washington Heights high school where I taught English, my colleagues were dedicated, passionate and hard-working. They were also unabashedly leftist. The teachers' lounge was an echo chamber of adoration for Michael Moore documentaries, diatribes about America's hunger for war-accompanied by the refrain \"Bush lied, people died\" repeated ad nauseum -and promises to move to Canada. I suspected that this ideology seeped into the classroom.\n\nA couple of my colleagues showed their students documentaries like Why We Fight, which I believe portrays America as a prison industrial complex with no redeeming qualities. Others repeatedly said that their students couldn't pass Advanced Placement exams even when they'd taken AP classes.\n\nIn the Herculean effort to prepare students for college, work and life, I believe there is no room for the unchallenged belief that our country is irreparably broken and the system is rigged against people of color. Especially in the school where I taught, where the student population was mostly Hispanic and African-American.\n\nTherefore, I told my students that they were architects of their own destiny, hard work and good choices matter, and America is the only country in the world where you can grow up without electricity or hot water and become Oprah Winfrey .\n\nWhile there were many \"culturally responsive\" books in my independent reading library that students read in their own time, as a class we focused on the classics. So-called \"anti-racists\" may be surprised to learn that Thornton Wilder's Our Town , set in the fictional rural town of Grover's Corners, New Hampshire in the early 1900s, was especially popular with my urban sophomores.\n\nTwo of my students played George and Emily when we read the play aloud, then students wrote heartfelt stories set in towns of their choosing that incorporated the play's universal themes of family, love, sacrifice and mortality, which we published in an anthology.\n\nMy sophomores' brilliance convinced me to start preparing them to take the New York State English Regents exam early. They began studying in January for the exam that's typically given to juniors in June. Instead of succumbing to the popular notion that standardized tests are racist because Black and Latino kids don't do well on them, they embraced the challenge of mastering how to write analytical essays.\n\nWhen they took the test in June, 2008, 90 percent of them passed in an English department whose pass rate was 60 percent. I'll never forget the pride on their faces when I told them that their scores were comparable to scores in much wealthier and whiter schools.\n\nIn class, we talked about the specific steps they could take to become successful, such as attending Columbia University's Double Discovery Program or Minds Matter, which help low-income, first-generation students get into college.\n\nThrough casual conversations that we had a few minutes before class, most of my kids also developed their own version of the \" success sequence .\" It looked something like this: Graduate from high school and college, find a career you like that pays well, and don't have kids until you're married and/or can support them without handouts.\n\nA couple of my colleagues side-eyed me for my anti-wokeness . They thought that when I said things like \"don't have kids until you can support them without handouts\" I was being judgmental about my students' families' lifestyles, as some were on public assistance. Some of my colleagues thought that I lacked empathy, but I think I was just encouraging common-sense behavior.\n\nI didn't talk to my students about politics explicitly until the 2008 presidential election when \"hope and change\" posters adorned our school's walls, and the teachers' lounge resounded with breathless chatter about the charismatic young senator from Illinois who would hopefully become the first Black president.\n\nIn preparation for a pre-election assembly, I had my students research both Barack Obama and John McCain 's positions on issues, as well as their strengths and weaknesses as candidates, making sure to read the Wall Street Journal , American Spectator and National Review -not just the New York Times . They then wrote persuasive essays on the candidate of their choice.\n\nI picked Amalia's piece about McCain's decades of public service and numerous military awards to represent our class at assembly. But shortly before the curtain went up, I heard that some kids from another class were planning to \"jump\" her after school if she read her essay aloud. I instantly cancelled her presentation, which upset her, but I wasn't going to sacrifice a child for even the inalienable right of free speech.\n\nI believe culture wars have hijacked the classroom. On the left, schools are training \"anti-racists\" by creating \"affinity groups\" for students and parents of certain ethnicities, while also teaching Critical Race Theory (CRT) and concepts such as white privilege. On the right, some politicians are limiting discussions of race in the classroom, trying to rewrite curriculum standards to align with a \"patriotic\" mindset and banning books. The left accuses the right of fascism while the right accuses the left of indoctrination.\n\nTo me, both extremes crush learning, free expression and critical thinking. In my opinion, students should learn about CRT and \"antiracism,\" but as ideas, not truths, and these ideas should be balanced with other perspectives. For example, if students read Ibram X. Kendi's How to Be an Antiracist and Robin DiAngelo's White Fragility , they should also read John McWhorter's Woke Racism and Shelby Steele's White Guilt . If they read The 1619 Project , they should read historians' criticisms of it as well. Students should learn about America's sins as well as its exceptionalism.\n\nWhile I'm proud of instilling ambition, agency and grit in my students, I wish I'd been a little more measured in my approach. When I left the school and my students graduated, we became friends. One of them opened up to me about the fact that I'd been so set in my mission and confident in my beliefs that she was hesitant to disagree with me. She believed that I should have recommended more kids for opportunity programs that helped them get into college, not just the kids who had A's, as some students are late bloomers. She said she didn't tell me this at the time as she was afraid I would no longer like her. That hurt to hear.\n\nI have since left the teaching profession, in order to focus on my writing career. But I believe I would find today's conditions untenable because of the extreme positions on the left and right.\n\nSome say that politics doesn't belong in the classroom and maybe they're right, but it might be impossible to keep it out completely because teaching is a values-driven profession. I believe we can, however, heed Margaret Mead's advice, and teach children \" how to think, not what to think.\"\n\nFlorina Rodov is a former public and charter school teacher whose work has been published at CNN , The Atlantic , Shondaland and others.

Conservatives certainly seem to think so-and for some it's a purposeful strategy.\n\nBut some progressives are acknowledging the phenomenon, as well, due to an increasing number of left-wing college students and other progressives who are siding with Hamas-ruled Gaza after attacks on Israel that began October 7 resulting in the death of 1,400 Israelis and the kidnapping of some 200 men, women and children.\n\nIsrael launched air strikes on Gaza and a ground offensive that have killed more than 10,000 Palestinians, the Associated Press reported, citing the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.\n\n\"Hamas killed my woke-ness,\" wrote self-described progressive Alex Olshonsky in Tablet last month. He noted that he had previously embraced the writings of controversial Critical Race Theory (CRT) activists Ibram X. Kendi and Robin DiAngelo and passionately supported Palestine for decades.\n\n\"I have heard no American Jew wish violence upon Gazans; I've witnessed many American so-called progressives who wish violence upon Jews,\" Olshonsky wrote. \"That's not progressivism. That's bloodthirst.\"\n\n\"Woke\" is defined as being alert to social inequities, and its cousins are so-called \"cancel culture,\" diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and environmental, social and governance (ESG). Critics say it amounts to identity politics and all have been dominant and destructive forces in academia, the media, entertainment, corporate America and on Capitol Hill since the police killing of George Floyd erupted into Black Lives Matters (BLM) protests in 2020.\n\nSeven months prior to October's Hamas-Israeli conflict, a USA Today/Ipsos poll found that 56 percent of American voters deemed the term \"woke\" to be positive, associated with being informed and educated, while just 39 percent deemed it negative, likening it to censorship and being overly politically correct.\n\nBut since Hamas attacked Israel, \"The woke movement has had some setbacks,\" said John Pitney, a professor of American politics at Claremont McKenna College, though he also acknowledges it remains entrenched in educational bureaucracies.\n\nOn October 26, Gallup reported that President Joe Biden 's job approval rating among Democrats tumbled 11 percentage points in one month to 75 percent, the worst of his entire presidency. Gallup said the poor showing \"comes in the wake of the October 7 surprise attack on Israel by Hamas\" and Biden's pledge of \"rock solid and unwavering\" support for Israel.\n\nAnd a Trafalgar Group poll taken October 15-17 that asked, \"Who is most to blame for current violence in Israel?\" revealed that 38.5 percent of Democrats but only 12.5 percent of Republicans blamed Israel.\n\nJames Lindsay, a critic of so-called \"cultural Marxism\" who has 444,000 followers on X, posted on the platform formerly known as Twitter that climate activist \"Greta (Thunberg) and Hamas and the trans activists and BLM are all part of the same global revolution.\"\n\nLikewise, Christopher Rufo, the New College of Florida board member who is one of the nation's foremost critics of CRT, posted on X: \"Hamas, BLM, DSA (Democratic Socialists of America) and 'decolonization' theorists are bound together by the chains of intersectionality. It's time to drive a wedge between them and the establishment left.\"\n\nHe also posted on X that conservatives need to create a strong association between those groups. \"Connect the dots, then attack, delegitimize, and discredit. Make the center-left disavow them. Make them political untouchables.\"\n\nRobert Cahaly, chief pollster and strategist at Trafalgar Group, says his firm's data indicates that cancel culture and being woke is \"cute and cool, until they minimize something you care about,\" and Israel is akin to abortion and the Second Amendment in terms of passion among voters.\n\n\"People have woken up to the fact that woke-ness is way more important than they thought it was. It puts a dent in it,\" he said. \"First, it was tearing down statues and declaring your pronouns, but now its antisemitism. Now they've got your attention.\"\n\nIranian-American columnist Sohrab Ahmari wrote that \"woke is dying-long live the new center,\" noting that the same crowd that promoted defunding the police are either refusing to condemn the actions of Hamas or celebrating them. He called it a \"punctuation mark on a longer process of decline for the complex of ideas and practices that came to be known as 'woke'.\"\n\nBrian James Godawa, who has written about the culture wars in several books, including his latest novel, Cruel Logic: The Philosopher Killer , said wokeness \"has infected all realms of study in academia ... This is not a passing cultural fad, or a conspiracy theory dreamed up by paranoid right-wing triumphalists.\"\n\nThe goal of the woke is to create chaos, Godawa said, and conservatives are correct to be hammering that narrative.\n\nMark Penn, the chairman of the Harris Poll and a former chief strategist to Bill and Hillary Clinton , said the right's effort to \"connect the dots\" will fail because the divide over Palestine-Israel is more generational than political.\n\nIndeed, a Harvard CAPS/Harris poll conducted October 18-19 found that 52 percent of voters ages 18-24 believe that Hamas' attacks on Israel \"can be justified by the grievances of Palestinians,\" compared with 24 percent of voters of all ages.\n\nThe young have had a \"strong awakening to climate change and race relations that most people thought was good, but now they're saying things that verge on antisemitism so it takes the shine off their purity,\" he said.\n\nHe predicts, though, that it's a short-term problem for progressives.\n\n\"Young people have no connection to the Holocaust or terrorism, so they're susceptible to narratives that I don't agree with,\" he said. \"The question is: where are they getting these narratives from? And if the left supports Hamas back in power in Gaza, it will lose a lot of supporters.\"\n\nHe also notes the \"contradiction\" of some in the LGBTQ+ community, such as Queers for Palestine, who have been critical of Israel. \"How can they square that given the human rights abuses by Hamas?\"\n\n\"The Hamas terror attack should have caused many on the hard left to rethink their views of the regional conflict,\" said Pitney, the political science professor. \"But they are trying to shift the focus to the suffering of people in Gaza, which they blame on Israel instead of Hamas. And when Israeli ground operations lead to more civilian casualties, they will amp up their criticism of Israel.\"\n\nAn incident involving Amy Schumer, a comedian who skewers Donald Trump in her standup routines and is a passionate supporter of Hillary Clinton and other Democrats, recently illustrated the rift on the left. She posted on X a cartoon with protesters holding signs like, \"Beheading is resistance\" and \"Gazans rape Jewish girls only in self defense,\" and added the text: \"Yeah yeah totally Cease fire. But mind if we get the babies back? Can y'all give that a shout too? And also try not to kill all the Jews again?\"\n\nThe backlash included social media posts calling her a \"Zionist liar,\" \"white supremacist\" and \"stupidest b**** on the face of the f****** planet,\" thus she removed her post. This incident took place shortly after she used her social media account to call for the top editors at several mainstream news outlets to resign for initially reporting the \"propaganda lie\" that Israel bombed a hospital in Gaza killing 500 Palestinians.\n\nIsrael blamed a failed rocket launch by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group for the blast at al-Ahli hospital in October.\n\nShe told her 13 million followers on Instagram that, \"I'm so sad to have lost so many friends these last few weeks ... Im (sic) a proud Jewish Woman and have every right to be.\"\n\nLikewise, actor Josh Gad, best known as Olaf in Disney 's Frozen, posted that he has \"always called myself a Progressive. The past 2 weeks have made me feel so desperately alienated & disheartened by what that seems to encompass.\"\n\nHe also noted that in many cities young, allegedly progressive activists have been ripping down posters with the names and photos of Israeli hostages who have been kidnapped by Hamas, and he laments that those behind that effort are \"people I've always identified with.\"\n\nAlso, actor-comedian-sports commentator Michael Rapaport, who routinely uses social media to bash Trump and his supporters, has instead been bashing proponents of a ceasefire.\n\n\"Hamas doesn't give a f*** about anything except for the destruction of Israel and the destruction and death of all Jews,\" he said a week ago in a video posted on X.\n\nSuch sentiments led to an online war of words between him and reliably progressive actor John Cusack. After the latter posted on X on October 18 that taking Israel's word for it that it didn't bomb a hospital in Gaza \"won't cut it,\" Rapaport posted: \"Hey @johncusack do me a favor and focus your voice on freeing the Israeli hostages captured by terrorists 10 days ago.\"\n\nCusack's lengthy response included, \"I've known you a long time ... do I look like a f****** rube? Don't lecture me on morals-yr gonna loose (sic) ... Don't tell me to condemn Hamas again-or how to focus my voice-you f****** fool. I want everyone to stop killing and dying.\"\n\nDemocrat representatives Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar , Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush each voted against a House resolution dubbed, \"Standing with Israel as it defends itself against the barbaric war launched by Hamas and other terrorists.\" And political commenter Briahna Joy Gray, a former national press secretary to Bernie Sanders , posted to social media: \"The decapitated baby lie, the lies about rape-it was all to establish some moral distinction between the pile of bodies killed by Israel & the pile of bodies killed by Hamas.\"\n\nAfter a joint news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu where Biden said the U.S. \"will continue to have Israel's back,\" Tlaib issued a statement saying Biden \"has not expressed one bit of empathy for the millions of Palestinian civilians facing brutal airstrikes.\"\n\nMembers of Congress known as the Squad, a group that is usually to the left of the president, weighed in with similar sentiments, and even Democrat Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, a usually reliable supporter of Biden, told NBC , \"I am certainly concerned about his approach to this.\"\n\nOn October 16, more than a dozen Democratic lawmakers deviated from Biden by issuing a resolution that calls for an \"immediate de-escalation and cease-fire in Israel and occupied Palestine.\"\n\nAfter Thunberg , the climate activist, posted online a photo of herself with a sign that read: \"Stand with Gaza,\" the Israeli Education Ministry said her views disqualify \"her from being an educational and moral role model,\" and removed references to her from text books.\n\nThus, conservatives maintain that cancel culture is rightfully also under the microscope now that the shoe is on the other foot.\n\nAfter more than 30 campus groups at Harvard University authored a letter saying, \"We the undersigned student organizations, hold the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence,\" alumni like hedge fund managers Bill Ackman and Ken Griffin said they'd never employ the signatories, ditto for a federal judge.\n\nAfter Ackman, the billionaire founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, was criticized for engaging in cancel culture, he responded on X by writing: \"If you were managing a business, would you hire someone who blamed despicable violent acts of a terrorist group on the victims? ... It's not harassment to seek to understand the character of the candidates you are considering for employment.\"\n\nA conservative group called Accuracy in Media (AIM) went so far as to drive a billboard truck around Harvard's campus with photos of some of the students who signed the letter along with the caption: \"Harvard's leading anti-Semites.\"\n\nProgressive defenders of \"cancel culture\" call it \"consequence culture,\" but those consequences rarely apply to left-wing speech, notes Sasha Stone, a self-described \"former Democrat and Leftist who escaped the bubble.\"\n\nRyna Workman, the president of the Student Bar Association at New York University Law School, had a job offer publicly rescinded after they (the student's preferred pronoun) wrote that \"Israel bears full responsibility for the tremendous loss of life\" for creating the \"conditions that made resistance necessary.\"\n\nThis episode, and others, caused Stone to write, \"For one brief moment, the social justice warriors, the fanatics, the pitchfork mob did get a small taste of their own medicine.\"\n\n\"Woke moral reasoning justifies rape and murder, even of children, and there's no reason to think it would never be applied here at home,\" said Seth Dillon, CEO of the Babylon Bee , a parody news outlet that pokes fun at wokeness.\n\nHe uses the example of BLM protesters who were praised in progressive circles for riots that caused an estimated $1 billion in damage and caused the death of an estimated 25 people in 140 cities two years ago.\n\nWokeness, said Dillon, was never about suppressing hate speech or keeping people safe, but ensuring that left-wing students were free to say what they please without consequence while right-wing students were largely shut out of debate.\n\n\"Universities thought misgendering and microaggressions were dangerous just days ago,\" said Dillon. \"But now-when it comes to defending literal terrorism and hatred for Jews-they've suddenly decided it's critically important that people have the freedom to say outrageous, offensive things.\"\n\nHe said that wokeness has taken such a hit that brands are distancing themselves from BLM, citing Coca-Cola as an example. In October, after BLM's Chicago chapter posted an image of a paraglider-reminiscent of the Hamas paragliders who flew into an Israeli music festival and killed more than 200 people-with the text, \"I stand with Palestine,\" the maker of soft drinks deleted from its website the boast that it has donated money to BLM.\n\n\"Caught red-handed. @CocaCola's website deletes its support for BLM,\" Republican Senator Ted Cruz posted on X. \"Editing your website is not enough. Americans demand an apology.\"\n\nCoca-Cola didn't respond to Newsweek's request for comment.\n\n\"This is significant,\" said Dillon, \"and could ultimately unravel the entire woke agenda. That's the goal of conservatives, to tie it all together and see it collapse.\"\n\nLike others, Cahaly said that, anecdotally, there's been a backlash against woke that predates the Hamas attack on Israel, perhaps beginning in 2015 when Jerry Seinfeld revealed that many comics won't perform at colleges because students are too politically correct. \"They just want to use these words: 'That's sexist. That's prejudice.' They don't know what the hell they're talking about,\" he told podcaster Colin Cowherd.\n\nBelittling wokeness was front and center in an October 28 episode of South Park , which Paramount describes as such: \"Cartman has a nightmare that all of his friends have been replaced by a diverse group of women who express their grievances about the patriarchy.\"\n\nAnd prior to Hamas attacking Israel, Kendi's Center for Antiracist Research at Boston University laid off half its staff, despite raising up to a reported $55 million in the past three years, including $10 million from Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey. While Kendi has blamed COVID and said he's scaling down for strategic purposes, the college has launched an investigation into the center's culture and grant management.\n\nAlso, Fireside Campaigns, a progressive communications firm with former high-profile clients like BLM and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, laid off the bulk of its employees on October 31. CEO Brad Bauman declined to comment beyond noting that the firm is still in business.\n\nLarry Elder, whose latest book, As Goes California: My Mission to Rescue the Golden State and Save the Nation, is in part about how destructive woke ideology has been, told Newsweek that \"there's a never-ending search for a villain guilty of oppressing minorities, women, gays and transgenders.\"\n\nAs an example, he cited Florida State University criminology professor Eric Stewart. According to an August report in the New York Post , Stewart was fired, and at least six of his studies published over a 16-year period were retracted after he was accused of faking data to prove that Americans, especially conservatives, are racists who want longer sentences for Blacks and Hispanics who commit the same crimes as whites.\n\nLong before Hamas attacked Israel, the right was attacking wokeness for a plethora of perceived injustices, mostly tied to transgenderism. They objected to biological men competing with women in sports and using female locker rooms, and to the ease with which progressives recommended life-altering drugs and surgeries for teens who claimed to be born of the wrong sex.\n\nBut it's the Hamas attack on Israel that conservatives are hoping is the nail in the coffin of wokeness, and Cahaly, the Trafalgar pollster, says they could be onto something.\n\n\"The Republicans should get their act together, because the Democrats have never been so split. It's huge,\" said Cahaly.\n\n\"It's not just college kids, it's young people in general,\" he said. \"Being for Hamas is trendy, in the same way it's trendy to be on board with transgenderism. If you're pro-Hamas, you're part of the cool crowd. But being for Israel makes you a 'Boomer.' You're old. That's what they're telling us.\"\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nPaul Bond has been a journalist for three decades.

      "text": "The Democratic Fork in the Road and the Woke Repudiation Imperative | Opinion\n\nNewsweek Senior Editor-at-Large and host, \"The Josh Hammer Show\"\n\nAdvocates for ideas and draws conclusions based on the interpretation of facts and data.\n\nNewsweek AI is in beta. Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nYogi Berra, the mid-century New York Yankees Hall of Fame catcher known for his pithy and often humorous life observations, once famously quipped: \"When you come to a fork in the road, take it.\" It was sound advice, perhaps, for a traveler on the go and in search of a quick meal. But the modern Democratic Party , rudderless and confused and reeling from a pitiful collective performance during Tuesday evening's presidential joint address to Congress , now confronts a fork in the road that's no joke.\n\nOn the one hand lies the path of least resistance: doubling down on the status quo-the progressive culture-warring, woke/identity politics-driven agenda that has dominated the party ever since Barack Obama upset Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary. On the other hand lies the more difficult but ultimately more promising path: repudiation of that post-2008 legacy and a conscientious return to a politics of the prudential center. Which path Democrats choose from here will go a long way toward determining their relevance as a national political party for the foreseeable future.\n\nObama's shocking upset over the madam-president-in-waiting was an inflection point for the institutional trajectory of the Democratic Party . Voters rejected the cultural centrism that was a Clinton-era hallmark in favor of the \"hope\" and \"change\" promised by Obama's \"coalition of the ascendant.\" Initially, perhaps, that may have looked like a smart bet: Obama trounced John McCain in the 2008 presidential general election. But the one-time \"coalition of the ascendant\" transmogrified into an identitarian and deeply off-putting \"coalition of aggrieved interests.\" Culturally militant wokeism eventually reached its pernicious apex during Joe Biden's presidency -which saw the first explicitly \"DEI\" Supreme Court justice selection (Ketanji Brown Jackson, after Biden vowed to nominate a black woman) and a DEI vice presidential running mate (Kamala Harris, after Biden was pressured to choose a black woman).\n\nThis version of the Democratic Party, which featured the progenitor of wokeism, Obama himself, as the leading presidential campaign trail surrogate for Harris, was thoroughly rejected in November by the American people. It turns out that voters didn't really know what they were signing up for when they embarked on an extended political journey of \"hope\" and \"change.\" They weren't interested-and aren't interested-in legitimizing the juvenile genital mutilation and chemical castration that has been euphemistically sold as \"gender-affirming care.\" They weren't interested-and aren't interested-in assenting to wide-scale importation and resettlement of foreigners whose cultures and customs are antithetical to our own.\n\nSome leading Democrats do finally seem to get the memo. Former Clinton strategist James Carville, for instance, has called for Democrats to distance themselves from the excesses of woke civilizational arson. But many others disagree. There is no indication at all, for instance, that the ladies of \"The View\" have done any introspection: Shortly after November's electoral shellacking, cohost Sunny Hostin attributed Harris' loss to Donald Trump to \"racism\" and \"misogyny.\" Surveying the left-of-center punditocracy scene, it often seems that there are far more Hostin-like voices of escalation than there are Carville-like voices of sobriety.\n\nDemocratic elected officials are also deeply split. California Gov. Gavin Newsom made headlines this week by repudiating certain facets of wokeism during an interview with Charlie Kirk, but congressional Democrats attending Trump's joint address to Congress on Tuesday evening took the opposite approach, well beyond merely refusing to applaud: Rep. Al Green (D-Tex.) obnoxiously heckled the president and was kicked out of the House chamber within the speech's first few minutes-deservedly so. In general, their conduct was positively buffoonish.\n\nIn what world do Democrats think they do themselves any political favors with these antics and, more important, these underlying substantive political stances? One guest of Trump on Tuesday, Payton McNabb, is a female former high school athlete who was grievously injured during a match against a team with a biological male player. On this issue, recent CNN polling indicates that roughly four-fifths of Americans oppose biological male participation in female athletic competitions. Even Newsom, in his podcast episode with Kirk, called the practice \"deeply unfair.\"\n\nNewsom seems to be reading the tea leaves-unlike congressional Democrats. There is a similar divide on the issue of illegal immigration and so-called \"sanctuary\" jurisdictions; consider, for instance, New York City Mayor Eric Adams' high-profile flip on the issue, which has brought him into line with Trump.\n\nTo make matters even worse, a majority of Democratic elites too often now come across not merely as schoolmarmish and excessively self-righteous-but as heartless and lacking compassion, to boot. Party leaders undoubtedly think of themselves as \"compassionate,\" especially for those perceived as being \"oppressed\" (on the neo-Marxist intersectional scale of victimization status). But where is the compassion for McNabb? Where is the compassion for the family of Laken Riley, the Athens, Georgia student whose life was tragically cut short by an illegal alien who never should have been on our soil?\n\nIn order to recover their standing and regain lasting relevance as an electorally feasible national political party, Democrats are going to have to repudiate the entirety of their post-2008/post-Obama cultural legacy. That is the simple truth. The American people want a stable pocketbook, a stable border, and a stable world stage. They're not interested in the Obama-Biden-Harris Democratic Party's idiosyncratic conception of waging a culture war.\n\nAre Democrats up to such a challenge? The intraparty civil war is on-but I certainly have my doubts. Unless and until they do repudiate their cultural militance, however, Democrats will continue to flounder about in irrelevance. Perhaps they'll need to get their clocks cleaned at the ballot box a few more times. That wouldn't be the worst thing.\n\nJosh Hammer is Newsweek senior editor-at-large, host of \" The Josh Hammer Show \" and \" America on Trial with Josh Hammer ,\" a syndicated columnist, senior counsel for the Article III Project , a research fellow with the Edmund Burke Foundation , and author of the forthcoming book, Israel and Civilization: The Fate of the Jewish Nation and the Destiny of the West (Radius Book Group, March 18) .

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nDisney's new live-action Snow White film had a soft box office opening this weekend with just $43 million in ticket sales amid criticism that it's too \"woke.\" But analysts told Newsweek that's just one factor for its disappointing opening.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Disney for comment via email.\n\nThe remake of the 1937 film found itself at the center of the ongoing culture war about the direction of the film industry, with critics saying remarks made by lead actress Rachel Zegler , as well as some of the creative changes taken to modernize the story, make the film too \"woke.\"\n\nThe film, starring Zegler as Snow White and Gal Gadot as the evil queen, faced criticism on several fronts prior to its theater debut.\n\nConservatives slammed the film for being too \"woke\" or too \"feminist,\" pointing to remarks from Zegler that \"it's no longer 1973\" and that Snow White is \"not going to be dreaming about true love,\" but the \"leader she knows she can be\" in a 2022 interview with Variety. Some critics also argued Zegler, who is of Columbian descent, should not have been cast for the role of Snow White.\n\nZegler also faced scrutiny over her comments about President Donald Trump after his victory in last year's presidential race, including writing in an Instagram post, \"May Trump supporters and Trump voters and Trump himself never know peace.\"\n\nThe use of CGI for the seven dwarves also stirred criticism; others took issue with the casting of Gal Gadot, who previously served in the Israeli army (prior to its latest conflict with Hamas ).\n\nThese politically-charged issues played a role in the film's underperformance, but are only a small piece of that puzzle, Daniel Loria senior vice president of content strategy & editorial director at the Boxoffice Company, told Newsweek.\n\n\"I think it's part of a number of factors that didn't let the film break out,\" he said.\n\nHe said a remake of any 88-year-old property would have \"natural challenges,\" and that Disney's decision to \"take the foot off the gas in marketing\" over the last few weeks the film has been underdiscussed as a reason for the film's low box office numbers.\n\nA later ticket presale period and the decision not to have press at the premiere events delayed and muted discussion of the film.\n\n\"You didn't really see a full-on marketing push in the way the studio gives a lot of family titles. I think that's a huge impact, especially for families that might be traveling on spring break,\" he said.\n\nDavid A. Gross, who runs movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research , told Newsweek that re-casting a classic story has a \"counterfeit quality\" picked up on by audiences, but that has more to do with the movie not \"connecting on the level of a big Disney hit\" than whether it's too woke.\n\n\"I think this was a creative choice that looked like it might add something, but it isn't,\" he said.\n\nJeff Bock,a senior analyst with Hollywood data firm Exhibitor Relations Co., told Newsweek the \" subpar reviews \" and \"years of negative press\" are to blame for its poor showing.\n\nThe story itself just doesn't resonate with viewers these days, he said.\n\n\" Snow White hasn't exactly aged well. The story itself is a bit outdated and certainly doesn't have the hero factor of, say, Moana or Frozen . These are the types of Disney stories that current audiences gravitate towards. Snow White 's expiration date was decades ago, unfortunately,\" he said.\n\nThe overall state of the film industry is also a key factor, Loria said. The movie market has been depressed throughout the first few months of 2025 after the \"Christmas corridor,\" Loria said, noting that the first quarter of the year is on track to be the worst first quarter in 25 years because there have only been a handful of major films have been released so far this year.\n\n\"If you look at trends and cycles in moviegoing, moviegoing begets moviegoing,\" he said. \"It's the sort of the situation when you go to the movies, there's a big movie, and you're exposed to trailers, you're exposed to marketing material, you get sort of in the groove, and that helps frequency. It's hard to will that out of nothing.\"\n\nInside Out 2 is a recent example of a film that was able to bring people out to the theaters who haven't been in a while, he said.\n\nSimilar movies, such as the 2019 Dumbo remake, performed about the same at the box office, Loria said.\n\nLoria also noted that Snow White sold a lower percentage of premium tickets than other recent movies-only about a third, compared to an average of 40 percent.\n\nThe audience of family-tailored movies don't always turn out opening weekend, Loria said, pointing to 2024's Mufasa as an example of a film that didn't necessarily perform well opening week with only $35 million but went on to \"find its audience\" later on.\n\nSnow White could be a similar scenario, he said.\n\n\"Family audiences aren't an opening weekend crowd consistently. Family audiences, they're either traveling or a kid gets sick. Family audiences will show up within the first month; in three to five weeks is the window to gauge family films.\"\n\nA key difference is that Disney's \"no press response\" to the criticism has turned week two of Snow White into a question mark.\n\nGross also said the film's success will depend on whether it will receive the \"babysitter effect\" and performs well for a few months like Mufasa .\n\n\"Disney knows how to support their films and this is a good corridor. A 3x to 4x multiple from here would be a respectable number (that is, if the film finishes with 3x to 4x the domestic opening weekend),\" he said.\n\nGross also noted that Disney will have the opportunity to profit from Snow White by digital sales, premium rentals, streaming and merchandise in their theme parks.\n\nThe film's underperformance may have less to do with fatigue with live-action remakes of classic films, which Disney has increasingly relied on in recent years.\n\nThe performance of Disney's remake of Lilo & Stitch , set to premiere on May 23 , will be a better sign into whether these remakes are still performing well, as the film's trailer is doing well online and it had a Super Bowl peak.\n\nBock predicted Lilo & Stitch will prove that viewers can still be interested in live-action remakes.\n\n\"Fatigue isn't a factor, as we'll soon see when Lilo & Stitch overwhelms theatergoers this summer. It's more about the right project that appeals to the multiplex masses. Snow White has aged out, while Lilo & Stitch , like Moana , are just hitting their cinematic stride.\"\n\nShawn Robbins, director of movie analytics at Fandango and founder and owner of Box Office Theory, told Newsweek : \"I imagine the film will bring out some families in the weeks ahead as exit polls from family audiences aren't as negative as the other discourse surrounding the film. It will face some competition from Minecraft but otherwise will have spring break in major markets and no additional direct competition until late May.\"\n\nPaul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore, told Newsweek: \" Snow White as a PG rated family film still had baked in appeal for kids and families looking for a new Disney movie to enjoy at the multiplex, but no question a bit of live action re-make fatigue coupled with the negative impact the politically charged controversy had on marketing efforts plus mixed reviews offered up a whole unwanted set of challenges for the film\n\nHow Snow White performs over the coming weeks, and whether its numbers will rebound, fall or hold steady, is yet to be seen.\n\nUpdate 3/26/25, 9:05 a.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nAndrew Stanton is a Newsweek weekend reporter based in Maine.

      "text": "'Woke Capitalism' Does Not Advance Social Justice\n\nCulture War\n\nVeronique de Rugy | 5.26.2022 4:49 PM\n\nMany people on the right fear \"woke capitalism\" and the idea that corporate executives will bend to pressure to advance a vision of the world that replaces their values with progressive ones. To those who are worried, I say, be grateful for the profit motive. To the progressives pushing for such practices, I say, be careful what you wish for.\n\nRegular free-market capitalism has no conflict with companies spending their own money in pursuit of whatever goals they choose. Milton Friedman himself wouldn't raise an eyebrow over a devoted LTBGQ baker who bakes cakes only for same-sex weddings or a company that only hires workers from underrepresented minorities. But woke capitalism gets more controversial when the likes of Delta Air Lines, JPMorgan Chase, and Apple use inflammatory and questionable talking points against Georgia's voting-reform legislation, or when Major League Baseball pulls its All-Star Game from that state in protest.\n\n\"Woke\" is a loaded, political term. The passion it triggers obstructs the fact that behind the whole concept there is a genuine set of values, and many of them-like tolecurance and equality of opportunity-are worth promoting. However, when practiced by corporations under pressure from vocal customers, employees, or even investors, woke capitalism often incentivizes high-noise, low-cost signaling rather than actual cultural changes.\n\nThere is some evidence, for instance, that some companies are more likely to be woke when it won't cost them many customers. I don't know whether that was on Delta executives' minds when, in 2018, they used a very public announcement to end a travel discount for NRA members flying to its annual convention. But with only 13 customers benefiting from the discount, Delta lost almost nothing. The company's wokeness didn't increase its share prices, according to at least one analysis, and there's no reason to believe it decreased gun violence.\n\nOther companies talk a big game but make no actual changes to their business models. A case in point is the group of 136 companies that first signed on to the Business Roundtable's statement on the \"Purpose of a Corporation,\" which boasts a commitment to deliver value not just to shareholders, but to all \"stakeholders,\" including customers, employees, suppliers, and communities. Yet two years after the signing, the companies' updated corporate governance guidelines showed no real change or attempt to elevate stakeholders. Most of them even reiterated their commitment to shareholders' primacy. Eighty-five percent didn't even report signing it in a proxy statement sent to their shareholders. The ones that mentioned it didn't add how they would change their business models.\n\nMore dispiriting examples include Wells Fargo employees interviewing \"diverse\" candidates even though positions had already been filled. The same thing seemed to happen to former Miami Dolphins head coach Brian Flores, who interviewed for the New York Giants' top coaching job three days after they allegedly promised it to a white candidate. Flores argues in a discrimination lawsuit that the team circumvented the NFL's diversity-driven Rooney Rule.\n\nDisheartening, too, are the recent firings of low-level employees at various companies for minor offenses following Twitter mob campaigns.\n\nBehind this whole mess is the progressive belief that demanding that a company sell you some mayonnaise with a side of social justice will be profitable for the cause and business. Both are unlikely. Attempts at measuring the profitability of wokeness reveal that many companies that build politically correct actions into their strategies could lose serious income and turn off large chunks of their consumer bases. Lost profits are bad for business sustainability, as Netflix's CEO seems to have finally understood.\n\nAnd who benefits from displays of woke virtue signaling? While they may not realize it, it's not those who hope and demand that companies be used as agents of change. It's not communities or members of underrepresented minorities, either. Nor does this theater bestow much benefit on the companies who do the virtue signaling.\n\nThis explains why some on the left are now speaking up against woke capitalism. As Helen Lewis wrote in The Atlantic a few years ago, \"If you care about progressive causes, then woke capitalism isn't your friend.\"\n\nThe path forward is for CEOs and other company leaders to drop the culture warrior pretense and return their focus to supplying quality outputs to all their customers. Just as important, though, is for woke warriors to stop demanding that companies produce outcomes they aren't designed to deliver and instead focus on persuading people that their values are worth adopting.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2022 CREATORS.COM .\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Wittgenstein vs. the Woke\n\nLanguage\n\nCrispin Sartwell | From the July 2021 issue\n\nLast summer, protesters from Baltimore to Bristol defaced statues and dumped them into rivers in an iconoclastic spasm, providing a momentary diversion from what the new progressives take to be the real agents of oppression: words. Words matter, they say, plausibly enough. Words have power and consequences, and there must be accountability, they add. These generalities are supposed to settle such matters as whether President Donald Trump calling the coronavirus the \"kung flu\" caused anti-Asian sentiment, which caused the Atlanta spa shootings, with no factual evidence required. That words have power is a commonplace, but then again so are observations that talk is cheap and that you'd better put your money where your mouth is.\n\nThe view that words drive events is the spiritual orientation of youthful leftism. But it's hard to think of a view that would more directly contradict Marxist ideas about history, according to which words are frippery or ideology, concealing the material conditions of production. That sort of realism, which presupposes that we inhabit a physical universe, seems passé. Contemporary social justice movements focus on semiotic injustice, on the alleged violence perpetrated in and by words and images. We appear in this conception to live in a world that we are making with symbols, in a history driven by the production of signs and sentences rather than widgets.\n\nThe current censorial atmosphere raises philosophical questions. You start by asking about the effects of somebody's rhetoric and end up trying to figure out whether language reflects reality or reality reflects language. In order to know what sort of power words could possibly have, we'll need to reflect on what they are and how they mean. Fortunately, philosophers such as Charles Sanders Peirce, Gottlob Frege, and Ludwig Wittgenstein spent much of the late 19th and early 20th centuries trying to deal with general questions about linguistic meaning in a systematic way. Some of the central insights they developed have come to be foundational in philosophy and may even constitute something of a toolkit: Wittgenstein vs. the woke.\n\nFirst, we need to distinguish what words mean both from what the speaker intends and from what the hearer or reader understands. After an imbroglio at The New York Times , the practical necessity of doing some philosophical reflecting became obvious. The Daily Beast in January revealed that longtime Times science reporter Donald McNeil, who was conducting teenagers on a trip to Peru sponsored by the paper, had uttered the word nigger in a discussion about whether the use of that term on social media should lead to a child's suspension from school. Editor in Chief Dean Baquet and Publisher A.G. Sulzberger then successfully pressured McNeil into resigning.\n\nTimes columnist Bret Stephens wrote a column, which the paper spiked (and Stephens subsequently placed with the New York Post ), attacking his employer for McNeil's removal. Stephens staked the whole question on McNeil's intentions.\n\n\"Intention,\" he wrote, \"is the difference between murder and manslaughter. It is an aggravating or extenuating factor in judicial settings....A hallmark of injustice is indifference to intention.\" In this case, of course, the focus isn't on whether someone committed murder or manslaughter, but on what words mean and what people mean by them , which is quite a different matter. Stephens' defense of McNeil rests on the connection of meaning and intention. McNeil, Stephens argues, didn't intend to use the slur-of-all-slurs to attack anyone; he intended to talk about the word and its history.\n\nBut merely appealing to McNeil's intentions will not clear his name. We often say something that reveals what we mean or even who we are without intending to. The words I utter or write can fail to mean what I intend; they can even mean the opposite. So, for example, if you ask me for directions somewhere and I tell you to take a left when I meant to say right, still I told you to go left; the sentence I uttered meant that you should turn left, whatever my intentions. What I said was wrong; it didn't mean what I intended it to mean. The meaning of left , like the meaning of a slur, is a public matter, and it would be a lame defense to say that when I spewed a bunch of hate, I had love in my heart. If words actually meant whatever anyone intended them to mean, as opposed to what we mean by them together, we couldn't communicate at all. Meaning, as Wittgenstein argued, is not \"in the head\"; it's in the public language.\n\nOn the other hand, and for the same reason, the meaning of a word or sentence is also definitely not whatever the hearer or reader takes it to be. Otherwise, misunderstandings would be impossible. So if I say \"take a right,\" and you mistakenly take me to have said \"left,\" what I said was correct; you just misheard me. That words can be misinterpreted is also a precondition for any linguistic communication; if words mean anything, then people can get their meanings wrong. You can be responsible to some extent for some of the unintended consequences of your actions, but you can't be held responsible for misapprehensions of your words.\n\nIt is possible to hear something as a slur, for example, and maybe even be traumatized by the experience, due only to a misapprehension. A classic example of this is provided by the experience of Greg Patton, a business professor suspended by the University of Southern California for using a Chinese word meaning \"that\"- nèige -in a Zoom class. At any rate, neither what the person thinks her words mean nor what her hearers think they mean determines what they do mean. This is useful, because otherwise the discussion starts slipping into a netherworld of mental states hiding in people's heads, whether these states are intentions or traumas. That you were traumatized by hearing nèige because it sounds something like nigger cannot itself be used as a basis for determining what Patton said, what his words meant, or whether he ought to be sanctioned.\n\nWe need to distinguish using words from talking about them, quoting them, paraphrasing them, and defining them. The philosophy of language rests on what is termed the use/mention distinction: the difference, for example, between hurling an insult at someone and quoting or talking about the insult that was hurled. Queen Latifah starts her song \"U.N.I.T.Y.\" by asking \"Who you callin' a bitch?\" She obviously does so not to call anyone a bitch but rather to criticize the word's routine use in the hip-hop of that era. Amazingly, the word was cut out when the video first aired on MTV; banning the mention of the word made it impossible for Latifah to make her point.\n\nGottlob Frege's \"On Sense and Reference\" is often considered the foundational text in modern philosophy of language, and it pretty much begins, as it must, with the distinction between directly using words and talking about them: \"If words are used in the ordinary way, what one intends to speak of is [the things they refer to]. It can also happen, however, that one wishes to talk about the words themselves or their sense. This happens, for instance, when the words of another are quoted. One's own words then first designate words of the other speaker....We then have signs of signs. In writing, the words are in his case enclosed in quotation marks. Accordingly, a word standing between quotation marks must not be taken as having its ordinary reference.\"\n\nWithout this distinction we cannot talk about the meaning of words at all; there could be no dictionary, for example. We employ this distinction all the time. A politician might quote or paraphrase her opponent and then attack what he said. Jake Tapper might describe the ridiculous doctrines of QAnon with a scowl on his face. But without the use/mention distinction, people who are quoting their opponents must also be endorsing their views.\n\nThe McNeil situation seems to turn on this distinction, and an even clearer case is provided by Slate 's former sports reporter, Mike Pesca, who, in an amazing nadir for the philosophy of language, was suspended from the podcast The Gist for drawing the use/mention distinction. In a workplace Slack discussion in which he was defending McNeil, Pesca said, \"The question is: Is an out-loud utterance of that word, in a work environment, fireable, censurable....Even as a point of clarification to a question exactly about the use of that word.\" Just raising the question turned out to be a suspendable offense, if not a fireable one.\n\nThe reference of a directly hurled slur is the person slurred, and it derides or devalues her for her membership in a particular group. But the reference of \"slur\" (with the quotation marks) is the word slur . \"A pig\" is composed of four letters, but a pig is composed of flesh and bone. \"A pig\" is a phrase, but a pig is mammal. Now, McNeil's case and many others are cases in which, quite explicitly, the slur is mentioned, but not used. In Pesca's case it is not even mentioned; Pesca uses \"the n-word\" to refer to the word at the center of the McNeil controversy. In these cases, the slur is not directed at anyone, in the very literal sense that it does not refer to anyone; we're talking about a word or a phrase, not an ethnic group. Randall Kennedy's book, Nigger: The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word , is a history of the use of the term, not a history of the people at whom it was hurled. If a history of the African diaspora were published under this title, it would be a racist text rather than a book that sheds light on the history of racism and the use of racist language.\n\nIt's true that someone could work offensive terms into conversation by routinely talking about the words as words. But prohibiting even talking about certain words begins to smack of superstition by attributing magical powers to sounds-as does censuring the use of words that sound similar: niggling , for example. Banning sounds starts to create an obviously irrational taboo, registering a fear not of racist or sexist abuse but of phonemes or little squiggles on screens. Making certain sounds taboo might even make it impossible to express the taboo clearly.\n\nIn March, NBA player Meyers Leonard was traded by the Miami Heat to the Oklahoma City Thunder, who promptly cut him, perhaps ending his career, because he used an antisemitic slur (\"kike\") on the streaming video game site Twitch. But you could read many news accounts and not know what slur was used. If one does not know what the slur was, and if the video is deleted from social media, it becomes impossible even to form a reasonable opinion on the whole matter. In other words, you'll need the use/mention distinction to tell us what you're against or why someone was fired.\n\nWe need to distinguish between words themselves, which are abstract objects, like numbers, and the soundwaves, inkstains, or pixels in which words appear on particular occasions. We can burn all the copies of Huckleberry Finn and redact every appearance of the word nigger that we can find, but we cannot destroy the word itself, which, as the philosopher Arthur Danto pointed out, is \"logically incombustible.\" The same word can be written or spoken here and there, now and then. It's an abstract structure, realized or represented by concrete soundwaves or squiggles. This is true not only of each letter and each word, but of each sentence and each novel, too. Anything that has the right structure or form, the right words in the right order, is a copy of Huckleberry Finn .\n\nThe inventor of semiotics, C.S. Peirce, wrote that a word or a text is a type, while its physical realizations are tokens. Each copy of Huckleberry Finn is a token of the same type, which is the novel itself, and every spoken slur is a token of the word that's being uttered. Tokens are particular physical things consisting of vibrations in the air, pencil lead on paper, pixels on a screen. But the novel itself, or the slur, is the structure that all these copies have in common, what makes them all copies of the same book or utterances of the same slur.\n\nBy social pressure or outright censorship, it's obvious that you can reduce the number of tokens of a word; every time you pulp or edit a copy of Huckleberry Finn , you've reduced the number of tokens of the word nigger in the world. But you have not done anything at all to the word itself, which is invulnerable. And unless you can destroy the letters of which it consists, which are also abstract types, the word can always be reconstituted, like Iran's nuclear program. However, the fact that a word is an abstract object means that, unlike Iran's nuclear program, it can't be blown up-and also that it can't be used to blow up anything else.\n\nWe should think rationally about what sort of power words could possibly have; they definitely cannot have the sorts of powers currently being attributed to them. The current flavor of language-oriented activism explicitly confuses words with things. It treats them as though they are supernatural weapons, and suggests that words themselves give rise directly to the concrete forces that drive oppression. But an abstract object cannot accomplish violence in the physical world.\n\nYou can deface a statue or dump it in a river or melt it down, but you can't vandalize, drown, or melt a word. You can cancel a person by trying to get him fired or forcing him to recant, but you can't cancel a phrase. Indeed, you might want to keep even the worst word in the world around so that you can mention it-so that you can give a realistic picture of the devastating history of racism, for example. For the word has many uses, not only in expressing but, as Kennedy's book shows, in exposing bigotry. Fearing the abstract structure itself, which is everywhere and nowhere, which has no meaning in itself but only in particular things people use it to express on particular occasions, is merely some sort of superstition.\n\nWords are a lot harder to suppress than one might wish, and their suppression is far less desirable than it might appear to be. Trying to suppress them cannot have the sort of concrete effects in ameliorating injustice that the woke anticipate. The picture of the nature, meaning, and effects of language behind the current wave of speech repression is not defensible.\n\nRarely has philosophy, in its millennia-long history, provided firm or useful results, but these are some that are relatively firm and fairly useful for showing that the current arguments against free expression rest on untenable or incomprehensible claims about the power of words.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Why the Conservative War on Woke Capital Is Doomed To Fail\n\nCapitalism\n\nRobby Soave | 4.21.2021 4:20 PM\n\nConservatives feel besieged in the culture war. Large corporations that previously seemed at least somewhat ideologically more sympathetic to Republican views have moved openly left. Amazon, Starbucks, American Express , and countless other big businesses criticized Republican efforts in Georgia to restrict voting rights, and Major League Baseball (MLB) moved the All-Star Game out of the state.\n\nIn response, conservatives are considering retaliation: Republicans might strip the MLB of its antitrust exemption and repeal certain tax breaks . The intellectual leaders of the new political right also occasionally discuss loftier schemes: breaking up large companies like Amazon entirely , taking away the broad liability protections enjoyed by Facebook and Twitter, and various legislative remedies .\n\nThe problem for the opponents of \"woke capital\" is that many of these proposals would either fail outright or cause worse problems than the ones they intend to solve. For instance, vesting the federal government with enhanced power to split apart massive tech companies on antitrust and anti-monopoly grounds-an approach favored by Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)-would do little to tackle the issue of social media sites censoring conservative users. But it would expand the state, empower traditional media, and in general harm the profits of private businesses, which is probably why it's a strategy beloved by progressives in the mold of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) .\n\nIndeed, the Senate held a hearing today to confirm Columbia University law professor Lina Khan to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Khan, who was nominated to the post by President Biden, is a Warren progressive who thinks Amazon is anticompetitive in nature and should be split into several different entities. It is the Democratic Party that's truly coming for woke capital-not because of the wokeness, but because of the capitalism part.\n\nRichard Hanania, an expert on partisanship and ideology, has an excellent Substack post , \"Why Is Everything Liberal?\" exploring the subject of how woke capital came to be. Hanania's post is essentially an extended rumination on Robert Conquest's Second Law of Politics: Any organization that is not explicitly rightwing will eventually become explicitly leftwing. Hanania points out that the U.S. is roughly split between conservatives and liberals as evidenced by our national election outcomes, but liberals dominate in terms of who donates to campaigns, shows up for rallies, and becomes extremely active in politics. He presents some evidence that the least invested and most invested people tend to be liberals; conservatives are moderately invested, and vote for Republicans, but otherwise prioritize things like making money and having families.\n\n\"Those who identify on the right are happier , less mentally ill , and more likely to start families ,\" writes Hanania. \"But in the end, the world they live in will ultimately reflect the preferences and values of their enemies.\"\n\nThat's because their enemies are highly interested in capturing influential positions in politics, government, the media, universities, and even within corporations. In order to force Coca-Cola to take a progressive stance against Republican positions on voting, climate change, and antiracism, a person who cares about those things doesn't actually have to take over the entire company: Consumer or low-level staffer, they simply have to make a lot of noise. A small number of employees at media companies have managed to leverage human-resources-adjacent concerns about safe workplace environments against their ideological foes, replicating a process that is already well underway on university campuses.\n\nThus far, the conservative opposition to this phenomenon has largely taken the forms of complaining and then threatening vast government action. Hanania explains why this is impractical: \"Do you want to give government more power over corporations?\" he asks. \"None of the regulators will be on your side.\" The people who staff the regulatory bureaucracies are Lina Khan types: They're there to battle capitalism, not woke-ism.\n\nThere clearly is something that can be done about woke overreach, to the extent that part of the problem is caused by bad government incentives. Republicans would probably benefit from a strategy of freeing businesses from the regulatory burden of appeasing their most easily offended employees. And lawmakers should stop forcing taxpayers to subsidize baseball stadiums-not because the government needs to punish the MLB, but because it is not the role of the government to fund private stadiums.\n\nThe conservative war on woke capital will fail because the weapons of the regulatory state are progressive by their very nature. Conservatives should consider strategies that actively shrink the state, if they ever take power again.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "The Problem With DeSantis' 'Stop WOKE' Act\n\nFlorida\n\nZach Weissmueller and Danielle Thompson | 10.11.2022 11:00 AM\n\nOur institutions have been infected by \"the woke mind virus,\" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) told an audience at the National Conservatism conference in Miami this September. \"Some of these big corporations are now exercising quasi-public power.\"\n\nIs it time to fight fire with fire? To wield government power to stop a dangerous ideology from destroying America's vital institutions? DeSantis thinks so.\n\n\"We're not just going to sit idly by if you're trying to circumscribe people's freedoms,\" he said in the same speech. \"And that's true if it's government. It's also true if it's big business.\"\n\nDeSantis, a likely presidential candidate and favorite of the conservative movement, seeks to jettison the libertarian idea that the government shouldn't meddle in the affairs of private business.\n\nEarlier this year, DeSantis and Republicans in the Florida Legislature retaliated against Disney for opposing a state law prohibiting the discussion of sexuality and gender identity in kindergarten through third-grade classrooms. Critics attempted to make the new education law a national issue and dubbed it the \"Don't Say Gay Act,\" and DeSantis' communications team responded by routinely calling the law's critics \"groomers.\"\n\nNow DeSantis, who declined our interview request, has signed into law the Individual Rights Act , which he formerly referred to as the Stop WOKE Act.\n\nA U.S. District Court judge struck down part of the law on First Amendment grounds. That portion of the law prohibited private companies from holding any mandatory training that \"espouses, promotes, advances, inculcates, or compels [employees] to believe\" eight concepts, such as that \"members of one race, color, sex, or national origin are morally superior to members of another race, color, sex,\" and that your inherent characteristics make you \"inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive.\"\n\nIt also banned trainings that promote the idea that these characteristics determine one's moral status as privileged or oppressed or mean that you bear personal responsibility for past injustices, that concepts like \"merit, excellence, hard work, fairness, neutrality, objectivity, and racial colorblindness are racist,\" or that trying to be colorblind and treat people without regard to race is wrong.\n\nBanning workplace trainings that tell people that their race or sex makes them morally culpable might sound reasonable to many Americans. A recent Rasmussen poll found just 29 percent of Americans think corporate diversity trainings actually improve race relations.\n\nBut opponents say laws banning a broad set of ideas set a dangerous precedent.\n\nThe state made the concepts \"seem terrible,\" says Jerry Edwards, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida , who is challenging a separate part of the law that applies to universities. He calls the bill a \"wolf in sheep's clothing\" because anytime a government bans broad categories of speech, it gives politicians the ability to define the terms of acceptable discourse. This, he says, should be concerning to Americans of all political stripes.\n\n\"If you're a person who's conservative and you agree with the idea that that affirmative action is wrong, if you give the state the power to say that you can only hold that belief, you also give them the power to say that you can't hold that belief,\" says Edwards. \" We can't allow the state this power to regulate speech.\"\n\nThe left also craves state power to impose its cultural preferences. Nation writer Jeet Heer recently tweeted that we should use state power \"for good,\" like expanding the scope of civil rights law and defending the LGBT community. \"The only objection to DeSantis,\" Jeer wrote, \"is that he wants to use state power to push big business to do bad things.\"\n\nOf course, from the perspective of DeSantis and his allies, the Individual Rights Act is an expansion of civil rights law meant to force businesses to do what they think is \"good\" for Americans, in this case by removing identity politics from mandatory workplace trainings.\n\nBut the more power politicians have to determine which type of speech is good and, therefore, legal and which type is bad and, therefore, illegal, the more the sphere of acceptable discourse is likely to shrink as both sides of the political spectrum hem in those boundaries to promote their subjective notions of the \"common good,\" a phrase that's become a guiding principle of the new brand of national conservatism that's aiming to both refine and expand upon the populism that former President Donald Trump injected into the GOP.\n\n\"The state should not be banning ideas,\" says Edwards.\n\nLeRoy Pernell, a law professor at Florida A&M University (FAMU), a historically black college and plaintiff in the ACLU's case challenging the higher education component of the law, says that this amounts to the state attempting to \"control thought.\"\n\n\"That [kind of control is] reminiscent of societies and governments that we supposedly fought wars against,\" says Pernell.\n\nThe part of DeSantis' law that hasn't been struck down pertains to universities that receive state funding. It bans college professors at such colleges from promoting any of the eight forbidden concepts.\n\nPernell is afraid that the law will outlaw discussions of systemic racism, which he says is part of FAMU's institutional history. The state created the law school in 1949 to accommodate two black law students who applied to the racially segregated University of Florida. In 1966, the state forced it to cease admitting new students until former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush signed a law to reopen it in 2000.\n\nPernell worries that if instructors were to characterize that history as \"systemically racist,\" they'd run afoul of the law's restrictions around teaching the concept.\n\n\" I do now live with the idea that at any moment, the state can come and take negative action against me because of my thought,\" says Pernell.\n\nPernell also worries that the law would prohibit him from teaching material from his own book about systemic racism in the U.S. legal system, a book that denies the premise that racial \"color blindness\" is a useful concept.\n\n\"It is impossible to understand criminal procedure and understand the issues that arise in criminal procedure w ithout understanding that the history has not been colorblind,\" says Pernell.\n\nBut the state has argued that it does have a say over what's taught at taxpayer-subsidized schools.\n\n\"Teaching kids to hate their country and to hate each other is not worth one red cent of taxpayer money,\" DeSantis said in March 2021.\n\nPernell's response to the criticism of race-conscious instruction is that it's\"just silly\" and that \" to understand that there are racial differences\" is not \"a negative thing\" because \"different races, different communities bring different things to the table.\"\n\nYou might disagree with Pernell. Maybe teaching law students to celebrate racial identity and differences isn't the best use of classroom time. But the relevant policy question is not what goes on in the classroom, the boardroom, or the break room, but who gets to decide?\n\n\"Diversity is good for business in many ways,\" says Sara Margulis, who co-founded with her then-husband Honeyfund , a business that administers online cash wedding registries in Clearwater, Florida. She is a plaintiff in the case against Florida, which argues that the law restricts the freedom of business owner to provide diversity training seminars to his or her employees.\n\nDeSantis' office declined our interview requests, but a press representative responded by email that because the concepts covered in mandatory trainings are \"forced on employees as a condition of employment,\" they are \"designed to force individuals to believe something\" and \" adopt a certain proscribed ideology\" and, therefore, \"the law is designed to prohibit forced indoctrination in these concepts because doing so is discriminatory \" under Florida civil rights law.\n\nBut Honeyfund's attorney Shalani Agarwal of the nonprofit Protect Democracy says the existence of civil rights law implies the opposite: Anyone who feels personally targeted by a diversity training workshop is already protected.\n\n\"Our current employment discrimination law that preceded the Stop WOKE Act already covers hostile work environments,\" says Agarwal, whose argument was supported by the judge who ruled against the state. When an employee faces persistent, offensive comments related to his or her identity in the workplace, that employee can file a harassment claim under current civil rights law. But Agarwal believes \"t he Stop WOKE Act creates a whole set of pretty flimsy and vague standards that make it kind of impossible for an employer to figure out how to proceed.\"\n\nIn practical terms, the state can't really banish ideas. It can make people more hesitant to speak openly and honestly through threat of punishment, which might be an effect of the Florida law. But hampering real communication that way makes solving hard problems even harder. And there are a lot of hard problems left to solve.\n\nSome so-called \"woke\" ideas really are pernicious because reducing every injustice to an identity-based formula flattens nuance, cultivates grievances, and can create tension where none existed before, as borne out by studies that find diversity training quite often makes people more prejudiced. This simplistic and counterproductive approach only further clouds our view of real solutions and real progress.\n\nBut is the situation really so dire as portrayed by political operatives like Chris Rufo, who stood beside DeSantis as he introduced the law and who calls critical race theory and similar teachings \"neo-Marxism\"?\n\nEven some libertarians have come to look at the issue as a high-stakes fight against communism. The Libertarian Party's official account tweeted that \"Soon, parents will be required to help enforce the state's Marxist, queer theorist, critical race agenda at home. Parents who fail to adequately indoctrinate their kids will have them taken away.\"\n\nAnd when you believe you're fighting an existential domestic threat, it can justify all sorts of very un-libertarian, authoritarian behavior. The party account defended Joseph McCarthy while approvingly quoting anti-woke academic James Lindsay saying it's \"time to deal with American communists for real.\"\n\nCommunism was a serious enemy of human prosperity throughout much of the 20th century, and politicians were right to be concerned about Soviet infiltration of the U.S. government. But McCarthy in the Senate and the Committee on Un-American Activities in the House went overboard in their hunts for communist spies, eventually expanding the scope of the search to target actors, writers, poets, musicians, and teachers.\n\nAnd we're not even talking about Soviet espionage here, which is what kicked off McCarthy's crusade. We're talking about professors teaching what they believe college students need to hear, and employers training their workers in ways they think will help create a more harmonious workplace, virtue signal to customers, and, ultimately, help their bottom line.\n\nWe're talking about a state government regulating the free exchange of ideas. That is a bigger threat to our liberty and to American values than \"wokeness\" ever will be.\n\nThis isn't the way to \"stop woke.\" Does that mean opponents have to just roll over and take it? After all, as conservatives will point out, the progressive left has no problem using civil rights law to push its ideas into the workplace and onto the college campus. Why shouldn't the American right pick up that tool and use it for its own ends?\n\nOne reason for caution is that sharpening a legal tool can be fatal once your opponents have the opportunity to turn it against you. Instead, you could be blunting or even dismantling it. If existing laws are part of the problem, limit or repeal the laws. Also, build, improve, and support alternative institutions, ones that reflect your values. Don't work for or buy from companies that disrespect you or attend colleges that spend a lot of time on issues of little value. They'll get the message. Some already are.\n\nIf you think woke ideas should be stopped, be wary of shortcuts. The long, hard path is the one more likely to bring enduring change: Criticize, resist, and, when need be, opt out.\n\nCorrection: The text has been edited to note that Sara Margulis co-founded Honeyfund with her \"then-husband\" and that they are no longer married.\n\nProduced by Zach Weissmueller; edited by Danielle Thompson; graphics by Thompson.

      "text": "Federal Court Rules Against Florida Law Banning \"Woke\" Workplace Training\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nFree Speech\n\nIlya Somin | 8.21.2022 10:40 AM\n\nLast week, a US federal district court ruled that a key element of Florida's recently enacted \"Stop Woke Act\" is unconstitutional, because it violates the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. The relevant part of the act bars employers from requiring workers to attend trainings or engage in any other \"activity\" that involves promotion of any of a long list of prohibited ideas.\n\nAs Judge Mark Walker of the Northern District of Florida notes in his opinion , this is part of a pattern in which Florida has enacted a series of laws that violate the free speech rights of private organizations on the pretext that doing so somehow prevents them from undermining freedom of speech themselves:\n\nIn the popular television series Stranger Things , the \"upside down\" describes a parallel dimension containing a distorted version of our world.... Recently, Florida has seemed like a First Amendment upside down. Normally, the First Amendment bars the state from burdening speech, while private actors may burden speech freely. But in Florida, the First Amendment apparently bars private actors from burdening speech, while the state may burden speech freely. Compare NetChoice, LLC v. Moody , 546 F. Supp. 3d 1082, 1084 (N.D. Fla. 2021), with § 760.10(8)(a)-(b), Fla. Stat.\n\nNow, like the heroine in Stranger Things, this Court is once again asked to pull Florida back from the upside down. Before this Court is a motion for a preliminary injunction, asking this Court to enjoin a host of Government officials from enforcing portions of the Individual Freedom Act-a law that prohibits employers from endorsing any of eight concepts during any mandatory employment activity. Because the challenged provision of the Act is a naked viewpoint-based regulation on speech that does not pass strict scrutiny, Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction.... is GRANTED in part.\n\nThe earlier case Judge Walker refers to is the litigation against Florida's social media law, which bars social media firms from engaging in most content moderation on their sites. That law was recently blocked, on First Amendment grounds, in a decision issued by the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, and authored by Judge Kevin Newsom, a conservative Trump appointee. In May, the US Supreme Court reinstated a lower court injunction against a similar Texas law.\n\nThe \"Stop Woke Act\" has similar problems. It bars mandatory workplace trainings and other required activities that advance a wide range of concepts:\n\n(a) Subjecting any individual, as a condition of employment, membership, certification, licensing, credentialing, or passing an examination, to training, instruction, or any other required activity that espouses, promotes, advances, inculcates, or compels such individual to believe any of the following concepts constitutes discrimination based on race, color, sex, or national origin under this section:\n\n1. Members of one race, color, sex, or national origin are morally superior to members of another race, color, sex, or national origin.\n\n2. An individual, by virtue of his or her race, color, sex, or national origin, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously.\n\n3. An individual's moral character or status as either privileged or oppressed is necessarily determined by his or her race, color, sex, or national origin.\n\n4. Members of one race, color, sex, or national origin cannot and should not attempt to treat others without respect to race, color, sex, or national origin.\n\n5. An individual, by virtue of his or her race, color, sex, or national origin, bears responsibility for, or should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment because of, actions committed in the past by other members of the same race, color, sex, or national origin.\n\n6. An individual, by virtue of his or her race, color, sex, or national origin, should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment to achieve diversity, equity, or inclusion.\n\n7. An individual, by virtue of his or her race, color, sex, or national origin, bears personal responsibility for and must feel guilt, anguish, or other forms of psychological distress because of actions, in which the individual played no part, committed in the past by other members of the same race, color, sex, or national origin.\n\n8. Such virtues as merit, excellence, hard work, fairness, neutrality, objectivity, and racial colorblindness are racist or sexist, or were created by members of a particular race, color, sex, or national origin to oppress members of another race, color, sex, or national origin.\n\n(b) Paragraph (a) may not be construed to prohibit discussion of the concepts listed therein as part of a course of training or instruction, provided such training or instruction is given in an objective manner without endorsement of the concepts.\n\nPoint 4 on this list is especially broad, as it appears to ban virtually any training involving advocacy of affirmative action on the basis of race, ethnicity or sex. I am no fan of such racial and ethnic preferences . But advocacy of them is pretty obviously legitimate discourse on an important issue.\n\nIronically, point 4 may even ban employee training sessions that promote conservative views opposed to accommodation of transgender individuals. After all, such positions almost unavoidably involve advocacy of the idea that people  \"should not attempt to treat others without respect to...sex.\" Rather, they necessarily require treating transgender people in accordance with their biological sex when it comes to such matters as deciding which bathrooms they are allowed to use.\n\nJudge Walker effectively explains why these provisions of the law necessarily target speech, and thereby violate the First Amendment. They are not merely regulations of conduct:\n\nTo start-though trainings are admittedly at the center of this case-the IFA does far more than ban mandatory trainings. It bars \" any . . . required activity\" at which the eight forbidden \"concepts\" are discussed and endorsed. § 760.10(8)(a), Fla. Stat. (emphasis added). Conceivably, that includes trainings, phone calls, assignments, discussions-anything that is required and endorses the concepts.\n\nMore to the point, the IFA does not ban all mandatory employee trainings. Nor does it ban mandatory trainings addressing certain concepts. No, the IFA only prohibits trainings that endorse the covered concepts. Indeed, the IFA grants employers free rein to hold mandatory trainings addressing any of the eight concepts so long as those trainings condemn or take no position on those concepts.\n\nTake that idea further. Because the IFA covers any required activity, an employer could require every employee to read Woke, Inc., Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam but could not require employees to read The Color of Law . Worse still, a nonprofit corporation devoted to promoting the idea that white privilege exists could not hold a required meeting at which it endorses the concept of white privilege. But a nonprofit holding the opposite view could freely hold meetings criticizing the concept of white privilege.\n\nThe bottom line is that the only way to determine whether the IFA bars a mandatory activity is to look to the viewpoint expressed at that activity-to look at speech. Plainly, the IFA regulates speech.\n\nNot only does the law target speech; it singles out speech that advocates particular viewpoints on disputed issues, while giving more favorable treatment to speech that supports the opposite positions. Such targeting is a blatant violation of the First Amendment.\n\nPerhaps the strongest possible defense of this part of the Stop Woke Act is by way of analogy to sexual harassment law. Under the Supreme Court's interpretation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, harassment - including that based solely on speech - is illegal, so long as it creates a \"hostile environment\" based on sex, that is \"severe or pervasive.\" Florida's reliance on this analogy is another example of conservative efforts to appropriate anti-discrimination law for their own purposes . If free speech can be restricted in order to protect employees against sexual harassment, why not to protect \"anti-woke\" employees from workplace trainings that advocate positions they dislike?\n\nPersonally, I think sexual harassment law has gone too far in restricting speech, and some of it is unconstitutional. Co-blogger Eugene Volokh has written extensively on this point . But, as Judge Walker explains, the Anti-Woke Act goes even further than sexual harassment law does, and thus is unconstitutional even if the former is not:\n\nTitle VII does not regulate speech. Rather, it targets conduct-discriminating \"with respect to . . . compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment\"-and only incidentally burdens speech. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1); see Wisconsin v. Mitchell , 508 U.S. 476, 487 (1993) (calling Title VII \"a permissible content-neutral regulation of conduct\").... That prohibition on conduct includes a bar on \"requiring people to work in a discriminatorily hostile or abusive environment.\" Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc. , 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993). In turn, to be sure, it can be mostly speech that creates this environment, but only when such speech is both objectively and subjectively offensive and when it is sufficiently severe or pervasive.\n\nThis \"severity or pervasiveness\" requirement-\"that is, a requirement that the conduct objectively and subjectively creates a hostile environment or substantially interferes with an individual's work\"-provides \"shelter for core protected speech.\" DeJohn v. Temple Univ. , 537 F.3d 301, 317-18 (3d Cir. 2008).\n\nThe IFA is the inverse. It targets speech-endorsing any of eight concepts-and only incidentally burdens conduct. Even the slightest endorsement of any of the eight concepts at any required employment activity violates the statute; the IFA requires no evidence that the statement be even subjectively offensive. Nor does the IFA require that the statement create a severely or pervasively hostile work environment. Thus, the IFA, by design, \"provides no shelter for core protected speech...\"\n\nIn drawing this distinction, this Court need not identify the line at which an antidiscrimination law crosses from incidentally burdening speech to directly restricting speech; the IFA sits comfortably on the direct-restriction side of that line and Title VII sits comfortably on the incidental-burden side. Thus, whether the IFA passes constitutional scrutiny has no bearing on whether Title VII passes constitutional scrutiny.\n\nLitigation over this issue is likely to continue. The state will almost certainly appeal Judge Walker's ruling. But I would be surprised if the state ultimately prevailed. The targeting of speech here is too blatant for courts to overlook.\n\nConservatives who cheer on the Florida law should consider what liberal states - or, for that matter, a Democratic-controlled Congress - could do if allowed to engage in similar regulation. The same powers that Florida uses to target \"woke\" employer speech can just as easily be used against conservative employers. For example, it could be used to ban any required workplace training or \"activities\" that involve advocacy or promotion of any ideas that might be considered racist, sexist, culturally \"appropriative,\" or otherwise offensive to left-liberal sensibilities. If you think courts should rule that kind of left-wing regulation unconstitutional, the same goes for the Stop Woke Act.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Go Woke, Get Tired\n\nNature is healing.\n\nThis isn't going to be more musing about whether America has reached \" peak woke .\" But that is part of the story, so let's start there.\n\nAbout a decade ago, many on the left embraced the word \"woke,\" a term with roots in African American culture and activism . It originally meant staying awake-that is, \"woke\"-to the dangers facing the black community. But in the hands of the broader, and whiter, academic and journalistic left, it soon became a kind of cool catchall for progressive politics, alongside other buzzwords like \"intersectionality.\"\n\nThe combined effects of the Trump presidency, the death of George Floyd, and the COVID-19 pandemic pushed wokeness into overdrive. This was the era of \"defund the police\" and other radical inanities.\n\nThe right soon took up the word, using \"woke\" as a catchall for everything-woke or not, real or not- it hated about the left . The novelty of wokeness as a concept lent an equal edginess, for a time, to anti-wokeness. It's a familiar tale, really: The same thing happened with \"political correctness\" in the early '90s.\n\nRepublican politicians declared war on wokeness. Erstwhile presidential candidate and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was at the anti-woke vanguard, even pushing the \" Stop WOKE Act \" through the state legislature. It didn't work out too well for DeSantis or his imitators.\n\nAnd that's the point: Both wokeness and anti-wokeness have lost their transgressive edge. Now they're both kind of \"cringe,\" as the kids say.\n\nAnd that is a sign of healing.\n\nOne of the worst annoyances of polarized politics is the way the fringes symbiotically feed off each other. Like bootleggers and Baptists both benefiting from blue laws, the extreme left and extreme right need each other to justify their catastrophizing. The worst thing that could happen for Republican House fundraising efforts would be for the \"Squad\" of far-left members of Congress to be replaced by sensible Democrats. And the last thing the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee wants is for Marjorie Taylor Greene to be primaried by an intelligent Republican who doesn't talk about Jewish space lasers .\n\nSo is woke over? Probably not. The term might be in terminal decline as anything other than an epithet, but the ideas are going to be around for a while-as will anti-wokeness-because both are just stand-ins for the culture wars left and right.\n\nBut it does seem as if many on the left are starting to realize they went too far. Most Democrats don't talk about \"defunding the police\" anymore because it is a wildly unpopular idea, including among black people. Nor do they use the term \"Latinx\" as much now that they have learned that it repelled more Latinos than it pleased.\n\nIt was recently reported that MIT will no longer require applicants for faculty jobs to submit \"diversity statements\" confirming their support for \"diversity, inclusion, and belonging.\" University President Sally Kornbuth told UnHerd , \"We can build an inclusive environment in many ways, but compelled statements impinge on freedom of expression, and they don't work.\"\n\nA slew of elite schools have reversed course by requiring standardized tests again. Big corporations are paring back their diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) departments, which surged under Trump.\n\nAnd, of course, the explosion of lawlessness and antisemitic rhetoric on elite campuses has been a lesson for academia, the left, and Democrats. The country isn't that into disorder and bigotry. The public, parents, and university patrons are siding with police more than protesters .\n\nThere's a lesson here for the right, too. For a decade, the populist right has been whining about losing every battle in the culture war to rationalize its embrace of radical and authoritarian politics. But the premise is wrong. The right doesn't always lose-or win-any more than the left does.\n\nTrump and his supporters insist that America can't survive without him in the White House. Bill Barr, who was attorney general under Trump, says his former boss is utterly unfit to be president but that he will still vote for him because a second Biden term would amount to \" national suicide \" because of wokeness or something. Never mind that wokeness surged under Trump and has been receding under Biden.\n\nObviously, the right and left still have plenty to complain and worry about. The point is that there's always plenty to complain and worry about. Tides come and go. And people learn, eventually, from their mistakes.\n\nJonah Goldberg is editor-in-chief and co-founder of The Dispatch, based in Washington, D.C. Prior to that, enormous lizards roamed the Earth.

      "text": "The Origins of the Term 'Woke' Had Nothing to Do With Today's Identity Politics Wars\n\nIt comes from an essay that is a work of cultural description rather than a battle cry.\n\nWhen in 2017 the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary added \"woke\" to their list of new words , they defined it as \"alert to racial or social discrimination and injustice.\" The earliest modern citation of \"woke,\" according to the OED, was a 1962 article , \"If You're Woke You Dig It,\" written for the New York Times by the African American novelist William Melvin Kelley. Coincidentally, Kelley passed away the same year \"woke\" was recognized by the OED . In a 2018 profile of the late author , The New Yorker 's Kathryn Schulz drew her readers' attention to the same Times article.\n\nWhat neither the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary nor Schulz did, however, was provide a close reading of Kelley's important essay, and as a result they lost an opportunity to dampen the culture wars now being waged in public and in private in the name of \"woke.\" \"If You're Woke You Dig It\" is an essay that deserves rescue from the obscurity into which it fell for many years. But above all, it deserves to be seen for what it is-a work of cultural description rather than a battle cry.\n\nI knew Kelley for many years as a Sarah Lawrence College faculty colleague. He enjoyed provoking readers with his fiction. His debut novel, A Different Drummer , published three weeks after his NYT essay, more than lives up to the title it borrows from Thoreau's Walden . A Different Drummer tells the story of Tucker Caliban, a black farmer living in an imaginary Southern state who by his example persuades every African American living in the state to leave it.\n\nBy contrast, \"If You're Woke You Dig It\" is not designed to set readers on edge. It's an expository essay about the richness of black idiom that comes with a series of whimsical drawings that illustrate Kelley's text. Written a year before the 1963 March on Washington, \"If You're Woke You Dig It\" reflects its time (to the point where he uses the term \"Negro\").\n\nThe essay begins with Kelley commenting on a New York City subway poster that advises train riders to keep the cars clean in 21 different \"languages.\" Among them is a variation telling train riders, \"Hey cats this is your swinging-wheels, so dig it and keep it clean.\" Kelly has no quarrel with the message. What he objects to is how the poster labels the message as \"Beatnik.\" Kelley's point is that the language the New York Transit authority is calling Beatnik is really black idiom.\n\nWhat follows is an account of the role in American life played by black idiom.  \"It is not only a language of vocabulary, but of context and inflection,\" Kelley writes. Black idiom takes its meaning from those using it as well as those to whom they are speaking, Kelley argues. The language is constantly changing.  The men and women using it take \"pride in something that belongs completely to the Negro.\"  Whites who try to use black idiom, Kelley adds, are invariably going to be behind the learning curve, and for blacks that situation is, he acknowledges, often a source of pleasure. \"The Negro's pride in this idiom is that of a man who watches someone else do ineptly what he can do well.\"\n\nKelley's contention is not that the black idiom he describes can't be widely appreciated. It translates well, he believes. \"The American Negro feels he can, on the spur of the moment, create the most exciting language that exists in any English-speaking country today,\" Kelley writes. Kelley even provides his non-black readers with an alphabetized lexicon that starts with \"ace\" and ends with \"woof.\"  The entry for woke defines it as an adjective meaning \"well-informed, up-to-date.\" Nothing in the definition Kelley supplied suggests a code word for identity politics.\n\nKelley, who was just 24 when \"If You're Woke You Dig It\" was published, saw himself taking the role of a friendly cultural guide in his essay, and he assumed goodwill on the part of his readers. He was not asking them to take an ideological stance but to attune themselves to a language filled with a complexity and wit they might not have fully grasped on their own.\n\nToday, it is increasingly rare to see \"woke\" being used in a way that doesn't reflect our racial divisions.  Even the term's defenders concede as much. In an op-ed headline \"In Defense of Woke,\" Damon Young, the author of What Doesn't Kill You Makes You Blacker , notes that \"woke\" can no longer be said unironically.  \"What was a compliment just a few years ago has become, at best, an eye roll,\" Young observes.\n\nIt's worth revisiting \"If You're Woke You Dig It\" to understand that for Kelley analyzing black culture also meant celebrating it. His essay doesn't deserve to be burdened with our current cultural battles. The last thing Kelley imagined when he used \"woke\" in the title of his essay was that the word would be weaponized.  If he can be faulted all these years later, it is for being too optimistic.\n\nNicolaus Mills is professor of literature at Sarah Lawrence College and author of Like a Holy Crusade: Mississippi 1964-The Turning of the Civil Rights Movement in America .\n\nPhotograph by Carl Van Vechten Collection/Getty Images.\n\nYour membership includes the ability to share articles\n                with friends.

      "text": "The Left and Woke\n\nWill Democrats heed the biggest lesson of their electoral loss?\n\nThere are many reasons Democrats lost. They suffered from an unpopular incumbent, were punished for the high inflation of the last years, and fielded an uninspiring candidate who never managed to put forward a clear governing agenda. But the most fundamental reason why so many voting groups that had long been supposed to buoy blue fortunes have turned red-and the one that is most likely to dog Democrats' chances in upcoming electoral cycles, when they no longer bear the burden of incumbency-lies in the fact that they are seen as being far outside the cultural mainstream.\n\nDemocrats now speak with the inflections and the vocabulary of the coastal, college-educated upper crust of the American meritocracy. This is rapidly alienating a multiracial coalition consisting of everyone for whom there is no space in that upper crust-plus those who resent the constant self-monitoring and self-censorship that is required to remain a member of it.\n\nTo overcome the damage to their increasingly toxic brand, Democrats need to change how they talk and what they say. This includes jettisoning some of the most unpopular elements of the left's identitarian thinking, popularly known as \"woke,\" that they took on over the past decade-the emphasis on equity and DEI, the vocabulary of BIPOC and LatinX. But it goes much further than that. Democrats need to convince Americans that they are willing to speak the truth even when that truth shocks the activist groups that make up a big part of their base; that they sympathize with ordinary citizens who are fed up with crime and chaos rather than with the petty criminals who disturb public order; and that they have figured out how to stand up for inclusion without violating common sense.\n\nWill the American left be able to effect such a profound self-transformation?\n\nIt is tempting to believe the left is finally turning away from wokeness. Back in September, for example, The Economist reported a modest decline in the frequency with which terms like \"intersectionality\" and \"microaggression\" were mentioned in mainstream media or scholarly articles. The magazine duly concluded that we had passed \"peak woke.\"\n\nNow, the open disavowal of some identitarian positions to which Democrats seemed deeply committed until a couple of weeks ago has seemed to validate that prediction. Since Trump's victory, elected officials like Gilberto Hinojosa , the outgoing chair of the Texas Democratic Party, and Rep. Seth Moulton, a moderate Democrat from Massachusetts, have sensibly urged Democrats to ditch their most unpopular positions on cultural questions. \"Democrats spend way too much time trying not to offend anyone rather than being brutally honest about the challenges many Americans face,\" Moulton acknowledged last week. \"I have two little girls, I don't want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat I'm supposed to be afraid to say that.\"\n\nMany Democrats I have spoken to in the last few days are hopeful that the vibe shift on the left will prove real. According to New York Times opinion columnist Maureen Dowd , \"Some Democrats are finally waking up and realizing that woke is broke.\" Longtime Democratic strategist James Carville seems to share the same opinion. Democrats, he told Dowd, are fleeing identitarian positions \"like the devil runs away from holy water.\"\n\nBut I am skeptical that this is how things will ultimately turn out.\n\nThe first indication that Democrats will find it hard to pivot away from their toxic brand of identity politics in any meaningful way is that those who called for a repositioning are already being punished for speaking their minds. Hinojosa, for example, was quickly forced to apologize for his remarks; a day later, he resigned from his position. Moulton even attracted fury from inside the house: Matt Chilliak, his campaign manager, quit in apparent protest at his comments. Some of his former staffers called on Moulton to apologize . The chair of political science at Tufts University said the department would no longer send interns to his office (though the university quickly walked back his comments).\n\nFar from agreeing with the diagnosis offered by Hinojosa and Moulton, many parts of the party are in outright denial about the extent to which what Carville has aptly named \" faculty lounge politics \" is harmful to its electoral prospects. Jon Stewart, who for all of his affected irreverence is usually a reliable spokesperson for the Democratic mainstream, summarized the emerging consensus on his show last week. Kamala Harris, he claimed , did not run on identity politics, and so identity politics was not responsible for her defeat. \"They didn't do the woke thing,\" Stewart quipped. \"They acted like Republicans for the last four months.\" Some progressive journalists with big platforms were even more dismissive. According to one , the election was decided not by the hope for \"a better life for your family and future for your community,\" but rather by a widespread \"desire to dominate and inflict cruelty on outgroups.\"\n\nMoreover, each of the party's fractious wings is insisting that Harris lost because she did not follow its preferred policies and political style. Sen. Bernie Sanders and his allies have been blaming the defeat on the unwillingness of Democrats to fight for more economically progressive policies . Meanwhile, other wings of the party have blamed the defeat on the fact that Democrats were insufficiently radical on cultural issues or did not change course on the conflict in the Middle East . Nearly all senior Democrats believe that the party should change; it just so happens that most of them think it should come to agree with what they have said all along.\n\nIt is so difficult for Democrats to coalesce around a real course correction in part because many of their most unpopular positions are downstream from their fundamental view of the world. For decades, Democrats have conceptualized the country in a way that is deeply suffused in identity categories. Rather than addressing voters who happen to be Latino, they believe that they need to mobilize \"the Latino community.\" Rather than recognizing the fluidity of American identity, they believe that the country is fundamentally divided between whites and \"people of color.\" And rather than believing that the solution to the undeniable fact of persistent discrimination and disadvantage lies in the realization of universal ideals, they increasingly assume that the rights and responsibilities of each citizen should fundamentally depend on the identity group into which they were born.\n\nCommentators who think that Democrats are about to ditch wokeness usually assume that doing so would take a course correction only on a few hot-button issues. Avoid using the term LatinX, stop saying that you want to defund the police, acknowledge (if you are really brave) that it isn't entirely obvious whether trans women who have undergone male puberty should be allowed to compete in women's sports, and you've fixed the problem. But Democrats' unpopular stances on these issues are merely a symptom of a much more deeply rooted way of seeing the world -and unless they undergo a fundamental transformation in that worldview, they will quickly embrace new positions on cultural issues that will turn out to be just as unpopular.\n\nThis finally brings us to the most fundamental obstacle to a real course correction: the staffers, the donors, and the activists who are the real decision-makers in the Democratic Party. Democrats are disproportionately dependent on young staffers who have recently graduated from prestigious colleges. Many of these staffers have been socialized in the hothouse culture of campus activism in which one supposedly offensive remark can lead to lasting social ostracism. And since they stand at the beginning of their careers, they often have a greater incentive to demonstrate ideological purity than to win the next election.\n\nCampaign finance poses another structural problem. Many people assume that (to use the lingo of professional fundraisers) the \"high net-worth individuals\" and \"ultra-high net-worth individuals\" who now provide Democrats with a big percentage of their cash tend to pull the party to the center. But while some of them do have more moderate views on economic questions than the average Democratic primary voter, there is also ample evidence that their view on cultural issues tends to be far more progressive.\n\nFinally, Democrats have over the past years become increasingly deferential to the many well-funded activist groups that now make up a key segment of the left. Their attempts to target particular demographic groups in particular heavily lean on activist organizations whose affluent and highly ideological leaders claim to speak on behalf of millions of ordinary Americans. As the New York Times ' Ezra Klein recently pointed out , when leaders of the Democratic Party want to get a sense of what various demographic groups want, they ask the constituent members of its \"nonprofit complex\"-but the answers these give have turned out to be \"really, really deceptive.\"\n\nThe composition of the Democratic coalition is a big part of the reason for the party's ideological intransigence, as has been obvious over the course of the past days. The profile of the average Democratic staffer helps to explain the revolts that Hinojosa and Moulton faced as soon as they tried to ditch a small part of the party's identitarian orthodoxy. The cultural commitments of its donor class help explain why progressive district attorneys who turned out to do significant damage to the party's brand could count on lavish campaign contributions. And the overreliance on astroturfed activist groups with little organic connection to actual voters helps explain the wide gulf between the positions Democrats take on immigration and the view of actual Hispanic voters .\n\nAmerican political parties don't have a real leader unless they hold the presidency or are in the middle of a presidential campaign. As a result, it is highly likely that the Democratic Party will continue to be cacophonous until the next presidential primaries. This Democratic cacophony may well include a few more voices that are openly critical of the party's identitarian dead end than before-but it will also feature many politicians who want the party to continue deferring to the donors, activist groups and young staffers who remain deeply immersed in those same identitarian ideas.\n\nThe Democrats' fight over wokeness will last for at least another four years. Their disastrous defeat this year suggests that, if it does eventually end, it will likely be in one of two ways: Either a representative of the party's small anti-woke faction manages to win the 2028 primaries on a new and more inclusive vision for the future of the country-or a hand-picked successor to Trump inflicts an even more decisive loss on the Democratic Party that fall.\n\nYascha Mounk is the founding editor of Persuasion, the host of The Good Fight podcast, and the author (most recently) of \"The Identity Trap: A Story of Ideas and Power in Our Time.\" He writes a weekly column about big ideas at yaschamounk.substack.com.\n\nYour membership includes the ability to share articles\n                with friends.

      "text": "Culture Wars End With Consequences\n\nReality always gets a vote, and reality always wins.\n\nI've got two cautiously optimistic thoughts to share. First, I think we've passed what you might call \"peak woke.\" Since I now hate the word \"woke\"-it's a term twisted by the right to basically mean, \"any thought even one inch to my left\"-I need to define my terms. By saying that I mean that we've passed \"peak woke,\" I think we've seen the peak (for now) of left-wing institutional intolerance and illiberalism regarding race, sex, and religion.\n\nPart of this feeling comes from the demonstrated inability of cancel culture to truly \"cancel\" most of its targets. My friend Bari Weiss, for example, is now far more influential and widely read than she was before her New York Times ordeal . Andrew Sullivan is thriving at Substack after being forced out at New York .\n\nMoreover, key institutions are opening themselves up to dissenting voices. It's incredibly heartening to see my friend Tish Harrison Warren, a devout orthodox Evangelical, now share space in the Times with Ross Douthat. In many spaces there is actually a hunger for a diversity of views.\n\nI don't want to paint too rosy a picture (and my optimism could be misplaced), but whereas intolerance once seemed ascendant, it now faces opposition, and that opposition is not coming only from the \"anti-woke\" right. No one would credibly call Dave Chappelle or Joe Rogan right-wing (emphasis on credibly) , yet they've been among the most potent and influential American voices in support of a culture of free speech.\n\nAt the same time, I also think we're seeing an emerging sexual counterrevolution. The consent culture of \"sex positive\" feminism, combined with ubiquitous porn, is starting to take an undeniable human toll, and more women (and men) are speaking out, including in the most elite outlets in the land.\n\nToday's New York Times features an incredibly poignant essay by Emma Camp, a recent graduate of the University of Virginia and an assistant editor at Reason. She focuses on the emptiness of consent alone as the touchstone of sexual morality. Consent is, of course, absolutely necessary, but it is not sufficient for human happiness and human flourishing. These are the key paragraphs:\n\nWhen my friends and I talk about our love lives, we tend to share the same kinds of stories, almost ritualistically. Usually, we'll be sitting on the floor of a dorm room or cheap apartment, drinking discount hard seltzer or boxed wine. As the night wears on, a little buzzed, we share the gory details of our fledgling romantic encounters. Between tales of bad Bumble dates, dance-floor make-outs and Olivia-Rodrigo-worthy breakups, almost all of us have had the same experience - a time we were asked explicitly for consent, and we wanted to say no, where we could have said no, and just didn't.\n\nInevitably, someone will ask, \"Well, did you say yes?\" The answer is almost always that we did, but despite that, we're left with an unshakable uneasiness. We said yes, but we don't know why. These experiences are so confusing to talk about because, on paper, everything went perfectly. If you consent, you shouldn't feel terrible after, right?\n\nCamp joins Christine Emba in the Washington Post , Michelle Goldberg in the New York Times , and Helen Lewis in The Atlantic (among many others) who are writing to express the thoughts they hear from countless other women. Sex isn't merely transactional. A consent culture both oversimplifies and oversexualizes human relationships. Here's Emba in her Post essay this March:\n\nEven when it goes well, sex is complicated. It involves our bodies, minds and emotions, our connections to each other and our deepest selves. Despite the (many, and popular) arguments that it's only a physical act, it is clear to almost anyone who has had it that sex has vast consequences, some of which can last long after an encounter ends. Over the past several decades, our society has come to believe that consent-as a legal standard and a moral requirement-could somehow make our most unruly activity more manageable. But it was never going to be that easy.\n\nIndeed it wasn't. I've written about the inadequacies of consent culture and the challenges of ubiquitous porn many, many times, but there is something undeniably more powerful about reading critiques of contemporary sexual morality that arise not from traditional religious spaces, but from within secular feminism and and from elite media. That's when you know the tide might be turning.\n\nI'm reminded a bit of the argument about the decades-old argument about single parenting. Remember the dustup between Dan Quayle and the television show Murphy Brown ? In a speech, Quayle critiqued the title character for bearing a child out of wedlock, and accused the show of \"mocking the importance of fathers, by bearing a child alone, and calling it just another 'lifestyle choice.'\"\n\nThe firestorm that followed led to a huge New York Times front-page spread . And while single-parenting is complicated (every child is a blessing, and our nation and culture should do its best to help single-parent families flourish), there was once a live debate over whether single parent households were no better or worse for kids than two-parent families.\n\nThat debate is now about as over as any debate can be. While there are many, many children of single-parent households who do flourish (and there are many, many kids from two-parent households who flounder), in the aggregate kids tend to do much better when mom and dad stay together.\n\nEven as early as 1993, outlets like The Atlantic were running pieces with the headline, \" Dan Quayle was right .\" In 2012, on the 20th anniversary of the controversy, the Washington Post ran a comprehensive piece with a similar headline , making the same case.\n\nI bring this up because in every single argument and controversy under the sun, reality gets a vote. Culture wars are ultimately won or lost not by online arguments but through their real-world consequences, and the position that leads to greater human misery tends to lose.\n\nTo connect with the issues at the start of this piece, when speaking about the wave of intolerance that's swept the academy, philanthropy, Hollywood, and much of mainstream media, I've told conservative friends that they have no idea how miserable it was making most of the people in those organizations. Something had to give, and the immiserated majority is going to be intimidated by the motivated minority for only so long.\n\nWhen speaking of the reality of porn-influenced consent culture, there's a similar dynamic in play. It's immiserating people by the millions.\n\nBut the consequences of bad ideas-and the bad ideas themselves-persist long after the tide has turned. While Americans left and right are largely united in believing that we need to foster, encourage, and protect two-parent families (and indeed prosperous blue America often features the most stable families in America), it is very, very hard to recreate a family culture in communities after that culture has collapsed.\n\nIn other words, bad ideas-once set loose in a society-are hard to contain even when there's a consensus in favor of containing them. The tide can turn against intolerance, but intolerance can still proliferate. The tide can turn against casual sex (even to the point where declining sexual activity leads to talk of a \" sex recession \"), and yet millions of young men and women can suffer the consequences of morally bankrupt actions and ideas.\n\nI don't mean to claim that cultural arguments have no effect. We shouldn't simply stand by while bad ideas do their terrible work. Good faith engagement can both mitigate the damage when a misguided cultural trend is ascendant and provide a robust alternative moral framework when frustrated and alienated citizens seek a different path.\n\nThe key phrase above is \"good faith.\" When human beings turn from the broken path, they don't want to be greeted by a taunting crowd that's drinking their tears, but rather by a compassionate community that humbly recognizes its own mistakes. Peak woke should be replaced by tolerance and pluralism, consent culture by love and respect.\n\nTwo powerfully destructive cultural movements may now be on the decline. Hard lessons are being learned again. You can fight reality, but reality always wins.\n\nDavid French is a columnist for the New York Times. He's a former senior editor of The Dispatch.

      "text": "How 'American Fiction' Satirizes Wokeness\n\nA thoughtful new comedy skewers progressive pieties around race.\n\nWhat do you think about when you hear the phrase \"black cinema\"? If you were to base your answer off of how Rotten Tomatoes has described some recent Best Picture nominees, it'd be hard not to notice a pattern.\n\nTake Lee Daniels' 2009 film , for example. \"Precious is a grim yet ultimately triumphant film about abuse and inner-city life.\" Or 2011's The Help : \"In 1960s Mississippi, [a] Southern society girl ... turns her small town on its ear by choosing to interview the black women who have spent their lives taking care of prominent white families.\" Or the 2014 Best Picture winner : \"It's far from comfortable viewing, but 12 Years a Slave 's unflinchingly brutal look at American slavery is also brilliant-and quite possibly essential-cinema.\"\n\nSlavery. Segregation. The inner city. Repeat.\n\nThese aren't bad films by any means, but their repetitive themes do reflect a reductive sense of what \"black stories\" should be. That's the main gripe that writer-director Cord Jefferson explores in his thoughtful new film, American Fiction . It's a hilarious and often cathartic watch for those frustrated by progressive pieties of race-but it also falls short of handling them as fully as it could have.\n\nAmerican Fiction stars the ever-composed Jeffrey Wright as Thelonious \"Monk\" Ellison, a Los Angeles-based college professor who writes novels inspired by Ancient Greek plays. He's brainy, aloof, and kind of pretentious-but he hasn't sold many books in a while. As his agent tells him, publishers don't see what a modern retelling of Aeschylus' \"The Persians\" says about \"the black experience.\"\n\nMonk has no patience for that sort of thing. \"They have a black book!\" he quips. \"I'm black, and it's my book!\" Early in the film, he's voluntold to take time off after a classroom incident involving Flannery O'Connor and the notorious racial epithet. A student says she's not \"comfortable\" seeing or hearing the word. \"With all due respect,\" Monk jabs back, \"I got over it, Brittany, I'm pretty sure you can too.\"\n\nSo Monk returns to his childhood home in Boston and reunites with his sister Lisa ( Black-ish 's Tracee Ellis Ross), his mother (Leslie Uggams), and-following an untimely tragedy-his recently out brother Cliff (Sterling K. Brown at the top of his game). He suddenly finds himself responsible for an array of comfortably boboish concerns: childhood hangups, messy divorces, an Alzheimer's diagnosis, and financial pressures that might force them to sell their beach house.\n\nAmid these personal and professional stressors-and frustrated by the notoriety of We's Lives In Da Ghetto, a new release by the Oberlin-educated black author Sintara Golden (Issa Rae) that affirms the stereotypes he so loathes-Monk puts on an elaborate literary joke. Over a few glasses of liquor, he composes My Pafology , an overwrought mockery of the \"black\" books replete with \"deadbeat dads, rappers, [and] crack\" that publishers crave. He slaps a pseudonym on it, sends it to his agent, who sends it to publishers who ... offer $750,000 for the rights. A $4 million movie deal soon follows.\n\nThe suits didn't get the joke. They think they found the next \"gritty\" or \"urgent\" race-conscious hit.\n\nPart of the ingenuity of American Fiction is how it manages to blend and reinforce Monk's two main storylines. Monk's family drama is often interrupted by his fake-novel narrative, much like how cliches about race overshadow other aspects of \"black\" books or movies. In this case, however, that same obfuscation develops the film's narrative. Precisely because of his frustration over the success of My Pafology -which gets an outlandish and profane rebrand in one of the movie's funniest scenes-Monk shuts off those closest to him. Race, once again, intrudes on the personal.\n\nMoreover, this interplay between the racial and personal storylines helps us understand our protagonist. After writing for years with little notice, Monk's long-awaited success doesn't really feel \"his.\" It's a lucrative farce, but a farce nevertheless-pseudonymous and emblematic of racial trauma porn that flattens black individuals. \"I'm not saying these things aren't real, but we're also more than this,\" he tells Golden. Late in the film, in one of its most heartfelt scenes, Cliff laments that their late father never knew that he was gay. \"Well, what if he had known and rejected you?\" Monk asks. Cliff replies, \"At least he'd be rejecting the real me.\" That lands for Monk.\n\nAt its best, American Fiction shows how much harder our persistently race-conscious mindset makes it to see the real individual behind a black character. It's an essential idea to explore, one that's only begun gaining mainstream cachet . For all the worries on the right about woke excesses, it should give us some comfort to know that one of the year's most critically acclaimed movies-which snagged the Toronto Film Festival's People's Choice Award, a slew of industry prizes, and three very deserved acting SAG nominations just this week -openly scoffs at these habits of mind.\n\nWhich is why the main drawback to American Fiction seems like it could have been so easily prevented. The film's spot-on criticism of wokeness ends up turning its white progressive characters into caricatures.\n\nTake a scene when Monk and four other writers (three of whom are white, the other is Golden) are judging his pseudonymous book for a literary award. Golden, to Monk's surprise, thinks the book is \"pandering.\" The three white authors, however, are all enthralled by it. \"Personally, I adored it-it was like gazing into an open wound,\" says one. \"This is a gutsy piece of work, and necessary for the times,\" another adds.\n\nIt's unclear why the film chooses to make the white publishers, studio heads, or authors so simplistic. Perhaps it's an intentional role reversal; after all, black characters are often reduced to a few traits or characteristics. Perhaps it's just satire doing its thing. But it's also easy to imagine the film making its point with more complexity. To take the literary award scene, the film could have shown the white writers feeling conflicted about Monk's fake book-recognizing it as bad literature, feeling guilty or worried about not rewarding it, and ultimately rationalizing their praise. Instead, the film leaves the motivations of its white progressive characters largely incomplete, and that's a pretty unmissable drawback for a movie about incomplete stories.\n\nNevertheless, American Fiction has so much more going for it. (The onscreen chemistry between Wright and Brown is especially effective, depicting brotherly love with a proper dose of jabs.) If the film's main objective had been only to depict a \"black story\" that subverts black stereotypes, it would have succeeded. But it attempts to do something more: to use those very stereotypes to deliver a fresh, slice-of-life movie. In that regard, American Fiction feels incredibly real.\n\nLuis Parrales is an assistant editor at The Atlantic.

      "text": "Hitting Rewind on 'Woke'\n\nThis isn't the first time a slogan became a tool for sowing cultural confusion.\n\nDear Reader (except for those of you tired of office life ),\n\nRoses are red, violets are blue, I'm schizophrenic and so am I.\n\nIt's an old joke and not really politically correct anymore. Schizophrenia is a serious mental condition and it doesn't actually mean \"double-minded.\"\n\nI'm fine with mothballing the word to mean double-minded. The problem, as with so many words that are interred or reinvented, is that we don't have a good replacement to mean what the old word meant. The whole \"language evolves\" tribe of linguists insists we can now use \"literally\" figuratively -to mean \"I really mean it.\" I object, but I'm not in charge. Still, I'd like a good replacement for the literal meaning of literally.\n\nI'm not a zealot about this. For instance, we're not supposed to care that \"decimate\" no longer means \"kill or destroy one tenth.\" I don't really need another word for that because it's not a heavy lift to say, \"they killed one out of 10 soldiers\" if that's literally what happened.\n\nBut here's the thing both of us are double-minded about.\n\nOn the one hand, I don't like slogans and cliches very much. Indeed, I wrote a whole book about the problems with slogans and cliches. But even in that underrated book, one of my first targets was the anti-slogan slogan \"No Labels.\"\n\nIn his 1962 Yale commencement address President Kennedy explained that \"political labels and ideological approaches are irrelevant to the solution\" of today's challenges. At a press conference the previous March, Kennedy insisted that \"Most of the problems ... that we now face, are technical problems, are administrative problems.\" These problems \"deal with questions which are now beyond the comprehension of most men.\"\n\nIn other words, all your existing arguments and ideological commitments are now inoperative and you should simply defer to us and our expertise.\n\nFDR made similar arguments, insisting he was simply a \"pragmatist\" engaged in \"experimentation,\" so any ideological or other historically or economically informed objections should not get in the way of treating the American people as guinea pigs in various experiments.\n\nYou can see this mindset in the original slogan of the No Labelers: \"Put the Labels Aside. Do What's Best for America.\" Get it? We know what's best for America, so put your labels aside and sign on to what we think is best. It's a lot like the phrase, beloved by climate change activists and others, \"The time for debate is over. It's time to act.\"\n\nNobody ever says, \"The time for debate is over! Therefore, since I can't convince you that my way is correct, I'm going to do what you propose instead.\"\n\n\"The time for debate is over!\" is almost always code for, \"Shut up and do what I say.\"\n\nI think the No Labels group has grown up a lot, so I'm not criticizing them as they exist today. But, man, did I hate No Labels 1.0. From The Tyranny of Clichés:\n\nThe No Labelers believe that labels get in the way of problem solving. Taken at its plainest meaning, this argument is incandescently stupid. Label is another word for word(s). And without words-i.e., language, communication, the sharing of complex ideas-we are back in the trees. I love people who say, \"I don't believe in labels,\" as if labels are like unicorns or the tooth fairy or good flan. Everything we associate with civilization, decency, and progress depends on labels. If we cannot label something poisonous, people will die. When we label evil behavior with the word evil, we signal to the world that that is something you should not do. If a criminal rejects the label murderer, that doesn't make him any less of one. But if we accept that murder is just a meaningless label we go a long way toward being a party to murder. If you cannot understand why having a blanket policy against labels is such a terrible idea, I urge you to march into your kitchen and peel the wrappers off all of your cleaning supplies, prescription drugs, and canned goods. Natural selection will take care of the rest in due time.\n\nBut even here you can see my schizo- ... double-mindedness. I'm crapping on labels while insisting that labels are in fact good.\n\nWords, man. Words.\n\nThat's because words are all we've got. As humans, among all our comparative evolutionary advantages-opposable thumbs, walking upright, evaporative sweat, omnivorous teeth, etc.-words have to be near the top. Words turn experiences into transferable lessons and rules; they let us explain how to do things-or avoid doing other things-without actually having to do them first. Words are crucial to explaining where the sabretooth tigers are. And man, when we figured out how to put words in books, we really took off as a species. We use words to tell ourselves who we are and who we should be. Try explaining how to build a nuclear reactor without words-take my word for it, it's hard. Longest game of charades, ever!\n\nAnd this points to the only way to reconcile my conflicting approaches. Words matter a lot, but they are a tool for thinking , not a replacement for it.\n\nForever woke.\n\nWhich brings me to the brouhaha over \"woke.\"\n\nI don't like the term, but no one consulted me. And now it's the word we've got for a real thing.\n\nIt's weird that I feel compelled to say \"woke\" is a real thing. But because many on the right have made it the new enemy ideology, many on the left feel compelled to say it's all made up or is simply code for racism.\n\nAt the same time, I do not believe that \"wokeness\" is the novel and sinister threat that many on the right say it is. And I think it distorts our politics and conservative doctrine to pretend that it is. \"New threats require new responses\" is the thinking on the right these days because it gives the champions of the new responses an excuse to abandon traditional arguments that are perfectly suited to combating wokeness, by any name.\n\nOh, I believe wokeness can be sinister, but it also can be harmless, silly, ridiculous, or, in some instances, perfectly fine. Like political correctness before it, some attempts to treat people with respect are entirely defensible, even if they seem unsettling.\n\nSpeaking of political correctness, I didn't like that term either, but it was a real thing too. In fact, it was mostly the same thing as wokeness.\n\nFor the original adopters of the term, being woke meant being \"aware of racial or social injustice.\"\n\nThe original meaning of political correctness derived from Marxism, and referred to holding the official, approved, positions of the Soviet Communist Party. Following the \"party line\" was synonymous with being politically correct.\n\nStarting in the 1980s the term was revived to convey sensitivity to minorities, marginal groups, social justice concerns, etc.\n\nAmusingly, before political correctness, the terms \"cultural sensitivity,\" \"social justice,\" and \"multicultural,\" all served more or less the same function that woke plays today-for the left.\n\nAnd, guess what? Such terms played more or less the same role for the right then as woke does now. Cranky rightwingers-at times, me included-would gripe about political correctness, social justice, cultural sensitivity as an effort to force us into taking positions we did not hold. Harvard's Christopher Rhodes writes in defense of wokeness, that \"Right-wing attacks on 'wokeness' are part of a wider campaign to undermine social justice and equality advocacy.\" And he's right-to a point (we'll get to that point in a moment). Wokeness isn't new and neither is anti-wokeness.\n\n(Political movements, particularly progressive ones, have a habit of adopting popular labels and then making them unpopular by using those labels to promote unpopular policies. People forget, but the whole reason we switched from \"progressive\" to \"liberal\" and then back again to \"progressive\" is because the left-with some help from the right-made these labels radioactive to the point where they needed to change the brand. Woodrow Wilson and his band ruined the word \"progressive\" so they dropped it, allowing Henry Wallace and his fellow communist fellow-travelers to pick it up.  FDR started calling himself and his cause liberal, and that label stuck for the next 70 years or so. Then, about 20 years ago, liberals switched back to progressive because the passage of time had allowed the stink to dissipate.)\n\nNow, there are some interesting differences between woke and P.C. For much of the 20th century, the left saw politics primarily (though by no means entirely) through the lens of class and economics. Starting early in the 21st century-I'd pin it to around 2010-the left changed its primary emphasis to race, sex, and gender. You could argue that political correctness was the bridge between the old class-based talk to the new identity-based talk. It's the difference between arguing that poverty produces the causes of racism versus arguing that poverty is the result of racism.\n\nObjectively woke.\n\nThere are a zillion definitions out there of wokeness. Freddie DeBoer has a good one. Wesley Yang has another interesting entry . But I don't think we need too much terminological precision because most people can recognize bad wokeness or benign wokeness when they see it. That's because, while there are all sorts of ideas and arguments that fall under the rubric of wokeness-slavery reparations, anti-racism, the abolition of the gender binary etc.-I think the way to actually understand the issue is essentially neo-Marxist. Wokeness is the enabling ideology of one elite faction that wants unrestricted institutional power, and anti-wokeness is the credo of another elite that really doesn't want the former elite to have any power. Marxists used to love to describe inconvenient or rival ideas \"objectively fascist\" or \"objectively racist.\" The modifier \"objectively\" was their way of saying, \"I don't care what your actual arguments are, they are indisputably bad because they're in our way.\"\n\nWhatever your orientation to various \"intersectional\" questions of race, class, or gender, the first thing that binds the priests of wokeness together is the assumption that if the retrograde, the unwoke, or the politically incorrect could just be made aware of the problems they see so clearly, they-we-would see them the same way.\n\nIndeed, as a matter of public opinion, the people who think positively of the term \"woke\" see it as descriptor for those who are \"informed, educated on, and aware of social injustices.\"\n\nWhich bring us to the second thing that unites all of these flavors of leftwing engagement. Implicit within the idea of \"raising awareness\"-just a rebranding of \"consciousness raising\"-is that if people could just be made aware of problem X they would agree with the proposed solutions to the problem pushed by the awareness-raisers. Think of it this way: There are good arguments for getting rid of the SAT, but it is indisputable that one of the reasons elite schools want to get rid of it is to remove an objective standard that constrains their ability to do whatever they please.\n\nThis is my longstanding gripe with climate change activists. I can agree that they've identified a real problem, but that doesn't require me to agree with their preferred solutions or acquiesce to them having free rein to impose them. And if you'll indulge an additional gripe: When conservatives oppose these environmental initiatives-or pretty much any other-the response from the left is to claim they're under attack. Not long ago, we were told that conservatives laughably made up the idea that the left wants to ban gas stoves as a way to open a new \"culture war\" fight. But it turns out that the left not only started this campaign, once the controversy died down, they went right back at it.\n\nOr to pick a more relevant example, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors has backed the idea that every black resident be paid $5 million as reparations for slavery, despite the fact slavery never existed in the city and the even more relevant fact that this idea is incredibly stupid.\n\nNow, I believe you can be aware of the problems of slavery and its legacy while at the same time opposing the idea that every non-black family in San Francisco-a huge number of them immigrants-be taxed to the tune of $600,000 apiece to atone for a practice they have no responsibility for. I can give you a host of reasons why such opposition is reasonable-starting with the fact that all of those families would flee the city before paying a dime-but you can be sure that supporters of the idea would respond that I \"really don't understand the issue.\"\n\nThis is my problem with the whole mantra of \"raising awareness.\" It's not that I'm against awareness, education, etc. It's that the people who say such things work from the illiberal assumption that disagreement is a kind of intellectual or moral heresy. Say you're against racial quotas in college admissions and the response is \"You're against diversity and inclusion.\" The policy remedies of the social justice crowd-whatever label you put on them-are the only safe harbor if you want to \"prove\" you're a good person.\n\nThis is what connects today's wokesters with the Marxist political correctness 1.0 of the early 20th century. If you weren't a plutocrat and disagreed with Marxist orthodoxy, you suffered from \"false consciousness.\" The idea being that if you really understood reality, your \"class consciousness\" would be aroused and you'd be down for liquidating the kulaks or nationalizing the railroads.\n\nNow I want to be clear, so I am joining the Church of Scientology. Just kidding. I want to be explicit: I don't think 1 person in 10,000 who speaks the language of wokeness knows jack about the Marxist understanding of false consciousness. (Marx never used the term and Engels only used it once in a private letter. The term was popularized first by Georg Lukacs in the 1920s, then put on steroids by Herbert Marcuse in the 1960s.)\n\nIt's a fool's errand trying to prove that Marxism is responsible for this pathology masquerading as an idea, because the underlying phenomena-of accusing dissenters of being ignorant or moral blinkered-is an all-too-human dynamic whenever large numbers of people become enlisted in a divinized cause or ensorcelled by what Ernest Gellner called enchantment creeds. I have no doubt that analogues to false consciousness exist in every religion and every serious political and national movement.\n\nIndeed, parts of the anti-woke right play the same game. Disagree with CRT bans? You must have gone woke. True story: A little over a decade ago, I used to regularly receive emails from anti-Islamist activists who would accuse National Review of \"going dhimmi\"-i.e., we had secretly accepted the sovereignty of Islam over Western societies in general and National Review in particular. I'd respond, \"Wait, you got all that from a mildly negative book review?\"\n\nWhich brings me back to the beginning. I have no problem using slogans and labels to describe people and ideas. As Samuel Huntington once observed, \"When people think seriously, they think abstractly; they conjure up simplified pictures of reality called concepts, theories, models, paradigms. Without such intellectual constructs, there is, William James said, only 'a bloomin' buzzin' confusion.'\"\n\nBut using slogans and labels in order to sow confusion and to think unseriously is what vexes me. This is where Rhodes' point hits the wall. It's axiomatically true that racists are anti-woke, but that doesn't mean being anti-woke is racist, any more than opposing San Francisco's reparations scheme makes you okay with slavery or its negative consequences (indeed, one could argue that some woke ideas about racial essentialism are, in fact, racist themselves). Calling bad ideas woke or anti-woke doesn't make them any better or worse. The ideas should stand or fall on the merits, not the power of the label or slogan. But we live in a time when people would rather be loyal to slogans than to ideas.\n\nVarious & Sundry\n\nCanine Update: So sometimes Pippa doesn't want to go out in the morning because it's dark and she's afraid of bad dogs or gremlins or something. But sometimes Pippa just doesn't want to go out because she's really, really, comfortable and the only way I can convince her to get up is to give her extended belly rubs. This isn't anthropomorphizing, projection, or conjecture. I'll say \"Let's go for a walk, Pip.\" And she'll respond by rolling on her back and presenting me her belly. If I walk away she rolls back into her prior position, if I walk towards her she's returns to her back, like I'm a repelling magnet that flips her over. This morning, after I spent a good five minutes rubbing her belly, with Zoë chuffing and arooing her impatience, I gave up and went downstairs and rang the doorbell. She immediately jumped up and ran downstairs to ward off a would-be intruder. She was not happy with me when she discovered the subterfuge. Other than that, the girls are great . They spend a lot of time in TFJ's orbit . And, yesterday, I filmed what it's like when they hear Kirsten is coming for the midday walk. Happy doggies.

      "text": "Wokeness Is Awful. Nationalism Is Far Worse.\n\nConservatives and libertarians need to reassess their priorities.\n\nMany conservatives and libertarians today lament the rise of \"wokeness,\" even to the point of believing it to be the greatest political danger facing America. Some of these fears are well-taken.\n\nBut concerns about wokeness have distracted many on the center-right from a more serious danger, one far more likely to gain widespread support and cause great harm: nationalism. Terrible woke ideas should be criticized. However, their impact is limited by the smaller numbers of their proponents. Nationalists are far more numerous. And if nationalists acquire the power they seek, they would implement an agenda that does great harm to the lives, freedom, and well-being of millions of people.\n\nWokeness should neither be neglected nor treated as harmless. But when comparing the two, the nationalist threat should take priority. It's long past time for right-leaning critics of both ideologies to treat nationalism for what it is: the greatest threat to liberal democratic institutions today.\n\n\"Nationalism\" and \"wokeness\" are relatively vague terms with multiple meanings, so it's important to define them from the outset.\n\nNationalists believe the main purpose of government is to protect the interests of a particular ethnic, racial, or cultural group, usually the majority group within the nation. They generally view foreigners with deep suspicion, support severe restrictions on immigration and international trade, and tend to back large welfare-state programs. Nationalism's focus on ethnic and cultural particularity distinguishes it from other ideologies that promote patriotism on universalistic grounds, such as the idea that U.S. institutions deserve loyalty because they promote universal values of liberty and democracy.\n\n\"Wokeists\" hold that the U.S. and other Western nations are deeply compromised by a history of injustice toward \"historically marginalized groups.\" When it comes to race, for example, they treat this \"structural racism\" as almost ineradicable. To combat these injustices, wokeists advocate for state-based racial and ethnic preferences, sometimes even including reparations. As wokeist icon Ibram X. Kendi puts it , \"The only remedy to past discrimination is present discrimination. The only remedy to present discrimination is future discrimination.\" Wokeists also push for extensive \"antiracist\" indoctrination and-in many cases-suppression of what they see as racist and bigoted speech.\n\nFor all their mutual hostility, right-wing nationalists and left-wing wokeists actually have much in common. Both groups treat racial and ethnic identity as fundamental and largely immutable. Both want the government to actively promote the interests of some ethnic or cultural groups relative to others. And most of all, both assume a zero-sum world where gains for one group can only come at the expense of others.\n\nBut though wokeists and nationalists engage in a similar identity politics, the latter are far more dangerous. Why? In large part, because an identity politics movement promoting the supposed interests of the ethnic majority has a much greater chance of political success in a democratic society than one focused on minority groups. The core potential political constituency for nationalism in the U.S. is white Christians, a group that constitutes a plurality of the population . Many secular whites are also a potential constituency, which is notable since nonreligious members of the ethnic majority have been an important base for nationalist movements in Europe. By contrast, the potential constituency for wokeism-racial minorities and left-wing intellectuals-is far smaller. While people like Elon Musk may fear the \" woke mind virus ,\" many more are susceptible to the nationalist mind virus.\n\nMoreover, most woke policies are highly unpopular. Racial preferences in education, for example, are opposed by over two-thirds of Americans , including most racial minorities. Among women, most oppose woke policies like allowing transgender women to participate in women's sports or use women's bathrooms. Wokeists also have a knack for antagonizing members of groups they seek to woo, like insisting on using the term \"Latinx,\" even though most Hispanics dislike it .\n\nTo be sure, woke ideology disproportionately appeals to the highly educated, which gives wokeists an edge in the media, academia, and various bureaucratic institutions. However, nationalists have enough highly educated personnel of their own to counter. TV networks like Fox News and \"national conservative\" think tanks like The Heritage Foundation (which is planning a wide-ranging nationalist agenda for Trump's possible second term) provide nationalists with enough media influence and brainpower to get by. Wokeist influence over regulatory bureaucracies is counterbalanced by greater nationalist influence over law enforcement entities-the government agencies with the greatest power to arrest and detain people-and their potential to once again control the White House, which has great leverage over federal regulatory agencies.\n\nHistory also shows nationalist movements are a menace to liberal political institutions. Whether in 1930s Germany or present-day Russia, nationalist movements have subverted liberal democracy and installed brutal dictatorships in its place. By contrast, not a single wokeist egalitarian movement has achieved such a result. Racial and ethnic minorities have sometimes managed to impose dictatorships over an ethnic majority (as in apartheid-era South Africa). But in those cases, the minority group relied on military and organizational superiority, not on something like a woke egalitarian ideology. There is no real chance of wokeists achieving such military superiority in the U.S. or any other Western nation.\n\nWokeists have recently suffered setbacks even where their influence is greatest. Nowhere is the power of wokeists greater than in universities, where they are heavily represented among administrators and faculty. Yet numerous leading universities have recently brought back mandatory use of standardized tests in admissions and dropped the use of DEI statements in faculty hiring, two measures long supported by wokeists. Perhaps most visibly, many schools called in law enforcement to crack down on pro-Hamas protesters who had established \"encampments\" or occupied buildings near end of the academic year. While schools should have taken these steps sooner, the fact so many did so at all is an indication of the limits of wokeist influence.\n\nThere is little doubt that nationalists have far greater political influence than wokeists. Nationalists have become the dominant faction of the Republican Party, with Donald Trump openly declaring himself a nationalist. By contrast, committed wokeists are just one of several groups contending for dominance among Democrats. The nationalists, therefore, have a greater chance of leading a political coalition and enacting a more expansive and harmful agenda.\n\nSevere immigration restrictions are at the heart of it-and not just cutting illegal immigration, but the legal kind as well. In his first term, Trump cut the latter far more than the former , and he and his \"national conservative\" allies would do more in a second term. They plan to gut most types of legal migration , including for family reunification, economic migrants, and refugees-such as Ukrainians fleeing Vladimir Putin's war of aggression under the highly successful Uniting for Ukraine private sponsorship program-among others.\n\nNationalists usually paint these policies as beneficial for native-born Americans, ignoring evidence to the contrary. Immigration restrictions deprive Americans of numerous valuable economic and social interactions with migrants, undermining natives' economic liberty more than any other government policy. Moreover, immigrants contribute disproportionately to entrepreneurship and scientific innovation that benefits everyone. Mass deportations supported by Trump and other nationalists predictably raise prices , severely damage the U.S. economy , and destroy more jobs for native-born Americans than they create. Immigration restrictions also threaten natives' civil liberties , because thousands of U.S. citizens get swept up in the racial profiling, detention, and deportation that are unavoidable aspects of aggressive immigration enforcement. Nationalist restrictions on legal migration would also predictably exacerbate disorder at the border , as desperate migrants would have no option other than illegal entry. By contrast, expanding legal options is the best way to reduce illegal entry .\n\nThere is also a deep moral problem at the heart of immigration restrictions. Libertarians and conservatives rightly oppose woke racial preferences in education and employment because they disadvantage people based on morally arbitrary circumstances of birth. Yet immigration restrictions are much the same: They bar people from living and working in the U.S. because of  accidents of parentage and birth. Being born south of the Rio Grande River as opposed to north of it-like being born black instead of white-is a morally arbitrary circumstance outside of people's control. It should not determine how much freedom and opportunity they have. Indeed, Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration analyst at the Cato Institute, has rightly characterized these immigration restrictions as a form of affirmative action for natives . And it's a far more severe type of discrimination than woke racial preferences: Being consigned to a lifetime of poverty and oppression in Cuba or Venezuela is far worse than being rejected from an elite university for similar reasons.\n\nThe nationalist trade agenda is also enormously harmful. Trump promises to impose 10 percent tariffs on all imports, which would severely damage the U.S. economy , exacerbate inflation, and raise prices for a wide range of goods. The American Action Forum estimates that, after accounting for retaliation by trading partners, it would cost Americans some $123 billion per year . Such a trade war would weaken U.S. credibility abroad and alienate our allies. China, Russia, and other U.S. adversaries would benefit. Additionally, nationalist legislators like Sens. J.D. Vance and Josh Hawley have portrayed industrial policy as a bulwark for the working class-yet they ignore how it rewards poorly performing firms and can be used to support the party in power and punish opponents. And of course, nationalist industrial planning shares many of the flaws of its socialist counterpart .\n\nNationalists' fear of cultural change lead them to favor government control of the culture, as well as the economy. Thus, they try to impose speech restrictions on things like drag shows and DEI workplace trainings . Even those who are not fans of such programs should be concerned about the threat to free speech.\n\nPerhaps worst of all, the growth of nationalism poses a severe threat to democratic institutions. Historically, nationalist movements tend toward leader-worship and often degenerate into authoritarianism. The belief that they and they alone represent the true people-the \"real Americans,\" as opposed to minorities or \"globalist\" elites-often leads nationalists to reject the legitimacy of election results that go against them. Donald Trump's effort to overturn the 2020 election based on claims it was rigged against him-by a combination of illegal immigrants and nefarious elites, no less-was in part the product of his personal flaws and idiosyncrasies. But it was also part of a broader tendency of nationalist thinking. A second Trump administration, or a future president influenced by nationalist ideology, might well take more systematic steps to curb free electoral competition. By fiat alone, he could upend not only consequential policies like trade and immigration, but even democratic institutions themselves.\n\nThe fight against wokeness should not be abandoned, especially in places where it enjoys great influence. Academics should do more to combat racial and ethnic preferences in higher education, for example, and reduce ideological discrimination in faculty hiring . Moreover, it should be noted that wokeists are not the only illiberal force on the left; \"Democratic socialism\" remains a noteworthy threat .\n\nBut despite such caveats, the threat of nationalism is on another level. No woke policy that has any plausible chance of enactment in the foreseeable future is likely to cause as much harm as the nationalist agenda. No plausible woke policy is likely to consign millions of people to a lifetime of poverty and oppression, or to massively damage the U.S. economy. And though they are certainly illiberal, wokeists are also comparatively unlikely to severely damage democratic institutions or keep in power a president who has lost an election anytime soon.\n\nConservatives and libertarians should oppose the excesses of the woke agenda. But doing so at the expense of countering the greater nationalist threat is a recipe for disaster.\n\nIlya Somin is Professor of Law at George Mason University, B.

      "text": "Did Wokeness Get Its Trial Run On Tumblr?\n\nThe online platform from a bygone era pioneered politicizing everything.\n\nWelcome back to Techne !\n\nI've become slightly obsessed with the culture of Mound Builders . Last Friday, I walked around Cahokia Mounds and scaled the largest mound, Monks Mound, with my friend Dr. William Aungst . Located across the Mississippi River from St. Louis (and pictured below), Monks Mound at its base is about the size of the Great Pyramid of Giza. At its peak, there were about 30,000 people in the Cahokia region . It was also home to a thriving copper smelting industry and trade routes that extended into the Gulf of Mexico. But in a mystery that still stumps archaeologists, the region was completely abandoned by 1350 A.D.\n\nThe social networking website Tumblr is a shadow of its former self now, but from about 2010 to 2016 something new was arising in it. It was generally referred to as remix culture at the time, but today, it's clear that the site helped germinate something more specific and central to a lot of debates: woke culture.\n\nI say this as a former Tumblr user. In its heyday, to be on Tumblr was about melding various cultural elements into coherence. Fashion, architecture, movie clips, art, and music would appear next to a post about gender, income inequality, sexual identity, and racism in America. Comment threads would go deep and followers would often follow the tree, spending hours understanding the context of the conversation. Tumblr helped bring about a completely new mode of conversation that flattened valence and politicized every utterance.\n\nIn the indispensable Kill All Normies , a book chronicling internet subcultures, Angela Nagle gave special focus to the site, noting that, \"Tumblr was one of the most important platforms for the emergence of a whole political and aesthetic sensibility, developing its own vocabulary and style.\" The resulting seven years since its publication has only vindicated Nagle's relatively dry observation that \"These dynamics, which began in subcultural obscurity online, later spilled over into the campus wars over free speech, trigger warnings, the Western canon and safe spaces.\"\n\nSo you've got to wonder: Did this new, very online phase of the culture wars start on Tumblr?\n\nTumblr's rise.\n\nThe internet age has skewed our sense of proportion. Tumblr wasn't as obscure as Nagle seemed to suggest. In 2011, it had 13.4 million active visitors , about half of whom were under the age of 25 and located mostly in the U.S. At the time, the under-25 population hovered around 100 million, so this group might have made up around 5 percent or so of the population.\n\nFounded in 2007 by David Karp, Tumblr had few of the limits that other sites did. Unlike Twitter, which limited posts to 148 characters, Tumblr users could upload video clips or gifs, chat with other users, follow blogs, and, importantly, repost content as long as it was under 500,000 characters . And unlike Facebook, which had a real name policy , Tumblr users could stay anonymous or they could divulge as much as they wanted. Tumblr offered flexibility and anonymity.\n\nFamously lax content moderation allowed for NSFW content to proliferate, which grew alongside fandoms and niche communities. At the time , Tumblr was known for being a haven for teenage girls, which, combined with the lack of oversight, helped self-harm and pro-anorexia circles flourish. The darker elements of the site gave it an edge. Meme culture flourished.\n\nBut Old Tumblr also had limited filtering options, which meant that users were exposed to a range of topics. The effect was that niche communities and fandoms freely intermingled with identity politics. Katherine Dee, one of the best chroniclers of internet culture today, interviewed approximately 100 former Tumblr users and found, \"Most people I spoke to shared that the first time they were exposed to anything related to identity politics (especially queer identity or feminism) was on Tumblr, and almost always within the context of fandom, e.g. representation in a favorite fan property.\"\n\nThe experience seems to be widespread. Writing in Pacific Standard , Emma Sarappodec found that for many wealthy white people, Tumblr would have been their first experience with conversations about race and privilege. Trace Pfaff, a white, gay man from Tennessee, told Sarappodec that, \"Prior to Tumblr, I was a Republican a-hole.\" In their text exchange, Pfaff explained that those posts, sandwiched between jokes, became instrumental to his political development as a teenager. \"So I join Tumblr primarily because of the memes, but I notice that all the meme accounts would also frequently reblog some very new liberal ideas that I had never considered before,\" he reflected.\n\nSarappodec also interviewed Emma DuFort, who grew up in Michigan, in what she describes as a \"highly privileged, sheltered environment.\" Again, Tumblr introduced her to new ideas of race and class. \"I mean, it sounds like such a joke to say 'Tumblr radicalized me,' but it's become less of a joke as the years go on.\"\n\nDuring its peak, however, there was really only one major article written about Tumblr. Valeriya Safronova's \"Millennials and the Age of Tumblr Activism\" appeared in the New York Times in late 2014. As she reported, \"The cyber social-justice movement is always brewing on Tumblr, and it picks up steam when shocking news hits the country or when protests take place offline.\"\n\nWhat's interesting about this report is that it documented the prevailing wisdom of the time:\n\n\"Tumblr is kind of like a gateway drug for activism,\" said Philip Howard, 44, the principal investigator at the Digital Activism Research Project at the University of Washington. \"Once you connect to other people who feel strongly about race or crime or gay marriage, you stay engaged on that one issue area.\"\n\nBefore my work in policy, and right out of college, I spent two years at the University of Illinois at Chicago, studying rhetoric and what was then called new media. Back then, there was a sense of optimism surrounding these sites, especially following the Arab Spring where social networks seemed to power political action. But what was little appreciated then-and now for that matter-is that Tumblr helped to grow a politics rooted in intersectionality , where politics came to frame everyday decisions. Now a tweet, or post on Facebook, an Amazon order, or a right swipe on a dating app carries with it a political statement. Tumblr was a trial run.\n\nWhat does seem prescient, however, is when the Times reported:\n\n\" You can create your own identity via Tumblr,\" said Moya Bailey, 31, a postdoctoral fellow at Northeastern University in women's studies and digital humanities. \"I see many more diverse images on Tumblr than I see anywhere else. It's one of the few places where I see fat people, trans women and trans women of color who are celebrated.\"\n\nSo it shouldn't be surprising to see how the company was self-identifying in 2016: \"We have a very woke crowd on Tumblr,\" Victoria McCullough, social impact and public policy manager at the platform told Mashable .\n\nThe 2018 NSFW ban changed all of that.\n\nThe Exodus.\n\nIn 2017, Verizon bought Yahoo!, and as a result, Tumblr changed hands. Then, at the end of 2018, Tumblr announced stricter content moderation standards, which got rid of NSFW material. This post from the advocacy group , the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), offers more context for this shift.\n\nRegardless, people revolted and left the site because of its new content moderation policies, radically remaking Tumblr's user base. From October 2018 through April 2019, the number of consistent users dropped by about a third , from 558 million to 376 million monthly visits globally. Back in 2013, Yahoo! paid $1.1 billion for Tumblr. By the end of 2019, it was worth just $3 million .\n\nThe exodus away from Tumblr had varying impacts on platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and others. We'll have to explore those changes in a future post, as well the aesthetics of a Tumblr post, which was often nostalgic of the 1990s, a now dominant trend in fashion and art. For now, let's just keep in mind what Old Tumblr helped to facilitate: an online world where the posting and comment structures made it possible to read everything politically. Tumblr may not have been the prime mover of this new trend, but it was certainly a key part of it. It was at the vanguard of the culture war we're living in now.\n\nIn a previous age, a plaque of a bald eagle with outstretched wings signaled that the house was paid off. Today, homes are decorated with what is effectively a Tumblr image repost: \"In this house, we believe...\"\n\nUntil next week,\n\n🚀 Will\n\nWill Rinehart is author of Techne and a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nYour membership includes the ability to share articles\n                with friends.

We have nothing further to add.\"\n\nFord Motor Co.\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign (HRC), which is one of the largest and most progressive nonprofits in the country, condemned Ford's move in a statement posted on its website on Wednesday.\n\n\"Today, Ford Motor Company abandoned its commitment to hundreds of thousands of employees by cowering to internet troll Robby Starbuck, and signaling that inclusion and other core values are no longer a priority in the workplace,\" HRC President Kelley Robinson said in the statement.\n\nHOME DEPOT PARTNERED WITH HRC ON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL GENDER CURRICULUM THAT TAUGHT KIDS ABOUT PANSEXUALS\n\nRobinson added, in part, \"After decades of commitment to inclusion and top ratings on the HRC Foundation Corporate Equality Index, the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index, Disability:IN's Disability Equality Index as well as their longstanding philanthropic record funding scholarships for Hispanic students, the Human Rights Campaign could not be more disappointed to see Ford Motor Company shirking its responsibility to its employees, consumers, and shareholders.\"\n\nThe HRC issued similar condemnations of home improvement giant Lowe's and Jack Daniel's owner Brown-Forman in recent days, after each reportedly decided to end their participation in the surveys.\n\nHRC blames Starbuck for companies abandoning its surveys, and the anti-woke activist is taking credit.\n\nIn celebrating Farley's memo to Ford employees, Starbuck told his X followers, \"So far you've helped me change corporate policy at Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley Davidson, Polaris, Indian Motorcycle, Lowe's and now Ford.\"\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nHe added, \"We are winning and one by one we WILL bring sanity back to corporate America.\"\n\nFOX Business' Timothy Nerozzi contributed to this report.\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nMDB Capital president and chief marketing strategist Lou Basenese joins 'Cavuto: Coast to Coast' to discuss Disney's recent turnaround.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company appears to be scaling back its DEI initiatives according to its latest SEC filing - and activist investors are pushing the entertainment conglomerate to go even further.\n\nDisney dropped its \"Reimagine Tomorrow\" program from their Diversity, Equity and Inclusion section of its 2024 SEC 10-K report. The program was mentioned in the 2023 report, which defines the program as \"the Company's digital destination for amplifying underrepresented voices and features some of Disney's DE&I commitments and actions.\" The program hosted a controversial 2022 leaked \"all-hands\" meeting in which a Disney executive touting her \"not at all secret gay agenda.\"\n\n\"On my little pocket of Proud Family Disney TVA, the showrunners were super welcoming... our leadership over there has been super welcoming to my not-at-all-secret gay agenda... they're going hard... I don't have to be afraid to have these two characters kiss in the background. I was just, wherever I could, adding queerness,\" executive producer Latoya Raveneau said at the time.\n\nDISNEY EXPOSED: LEAKED VIDEOS SHOW OFFICIALS PUSHING LGBT AGENDA, SAYING DESANTIS WANTS TO 'ERASE' GAY KIDS\n\nDisney appears to be backing away from woke policies (Fox News Digital / Fox News)\n\nDisney's \"Reimagine Tomorrow\" webpage, which is still active, says its mission is \"amplifying underrepresented voices and untold stories as well as championing the importance of accurate representation in media and entertainment.\"\n\nThe page also lists racial and gender breakdowns of their content and workforce as of 2021 and boasts of their Business Employee Research Groups which represent employees from different ethnic backgrounds.\n\n\"The Walt Disney Company Has Established Business Employee Resource Groups Across 10 Dimensions: Asian/ Native Hawaiian/ Pacific Islander, Black/ African American Disabilities Hispanic/ Latin X Jewish, LGBTQ+, Multicultural, Native American/ Indigenous Veterans/ Military, Women,\" the website boasts.\n\n\"Disney dropping [Reimagine Tomorrow] from their DEI section could mean they're walking back their DEI investments, or it could signal they're hiding them,\" Stefan Padfield, director of the Free Enterprise Project for the National Center for Public Policy Research, told Fox News Digital. \"Either they recognize that more litigation is coming, or it could be part of a vibe shift.\"\n\nTarget was recently hit with a lawsuit related to its DEI initiatives as shareholders contend the retailer failed to be transparent about the risks posed by their DEI policies and Pride displays.\n\n\"Where is your data that shows DEI serves the bottom line?\" Padfield asked of companies that still employ DEI measures.\n\n\"The concern about the scrutiny about these questions is built into this movement we're seeing across companies. The Trump administration announced they'll investigate nine companies for their DEI practices, and you're seeing corporations scramble to not be among those nine,\" he said.\n\nBy scaling back its DEI section in its SEC filing, Disney joins a growing trend of companies from Meta to John Deere that have rolled back or eliminated their DEI initiatives.\n\nThe movie, cruise and theme park behemoth has also dropped its \"The Disney Look\" appearance guidelines from their DEI section in their 2024 SEC filing. The 2023 SEC filing states that the guidelines were \"updated to cultivate a more inclusive environment that encourages and celebrates authentic expressions of belonging among employees.\"\n\nDisney didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nDISNEY ACCUSED OF MISLEADING SHAREHOLDERS WITH 'WOKE POLITICAL AGENDA'\n\nDisney has removed its \"Reimagine Tomorrow\" section from its recent SEC filing. (Gary Hershorn/Getty Images / Getty Images)\n\nThe moves come as Disney reportedly lost 700,000 users on its Disney+ streaming platform in the final quarter of 2024. The entertainment conglomerate has faced backlash for, what some call, its \"woke political agenda.\" The corporation was sued by America First Legal in March 2024 for allegedly doing \"damage to Disney's brand, properties, and commercial reputation by management's manufactured misalignment between its woke political and social agenda and the vast majority of the Company's customers.\"\n\nDisney's move to distance itself from the woke initiative comes as activist investors are pressuring the company to drop its participation in the Human Rights Campaign's (HRC) Corporate Equality Index.\n\nThe HRC releases a yearly survey which grades corporations on their compliance with a litany of LGBTQ initiatives, among them \"Equal health coverage for transgender individuals without exclusion for medically necessary care\" and \"Integration of gender identity and sexual orientation in professional development, skills-based or other leadership training that includes elements of diversity and/or cultural competency.\" Disney has had a perfect score on the Equality Index every year since 2007.\n\n'CAPTAIN AMERICA: BRAVE NEW WORLD' STAR SAYS THE CHARACTER SHOULD NOT REPRESENT AMERICA\n\nLGBTQ employees and their supporters walkout of Disney Animation protesting CEO Bob Chapek's handling of legislation in Florida in 2022.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nAmerican Conservative Values ETF President Tom Carter explains how investors are shying away from 'woke' companies\n\nEver noticed how often businesses are uber-villains in popular films and television? Gordon Gekkos and cartoon corporate bad guys are common tropes of cinema. These caricatures are, for the most part, unfair and inaccurate. Sure, there have been Enrons and industry scandals such as the one that recently shook Wells Fargo. Yet, in advanced countries that enjoy economic freedom and stable institutions, most businesses most of the time benefit society and generate widespread health and prosperity.\n\nBusinesses, acting ethically and in good faith, follow rules, treat others with respect, and enable cooperation and trust among diverse individuals. They provide value by producing goods and services that make our lives easier and better.\n\nWhy, then, are businesses adopting woke policies and contributing to social justice movements? Do their leaders believe they can purchase absolution for their hard-earned profits or boost their brand with progressive politics? If wokeness is antithetical to good and honest business, why would corporations \"go woke\"?\n\nThe call for businesses to be more socially responsible, or woke, presumes that they are, presently, socially irresponsible. The irony is that, once honest businesses pursue wokeism, they become irresponsible and begin to act, in many cases, unethically. They then resemble the unflattering depictions of sinister corporations with leadership that merely performs virtue, care, or concern to accrue power and wealth, manipulate politicians and government officials, and sway public opinion.\n\nPROFESSOR ROLLS OUT SCHOLARS PROGRAM AIMED AT ENDING 'WOKEISM' IN CORPORATE AMERICA\n\nArizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich argues one of the world's largest investment firms is potentially putting its 'leftist' policies over investors' interests and returns on 'Cavuto: Coast to Coast.'\n\nCorporations often pursue woke agendas, from diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) to environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG), to avoid scrutiny of their practices that are, in fact, harmful to minorities or the environment. They lobby for government regulations in these areas to minimize competition and solidify their position through government privileges.\n\nIf a private business wishes to alienate consumers by pursuing wokeness or social justice initiatives that aren't consistent with the principles and convictions of most Americans, it has that right and can take that risk. But seeking to impose wokeism through government affects everyone in society.\n\nWokeness as an ideology is necessarily bound up with the growth of government and the dismantling of norms and institutions grounded in historically liberal principles like equality under the law, due process, and free speech. Woke companies attach themselves to government agencies and programs, exacerbating rather than abating social unrest and division. Woke corporations engender surveillance culture and prosecutorial attitudes among their employees, who, rather than collaborating as a team, divide and define themselves by their race or gender , not their character or excellence.\n\nWokeness is fundamentally illiberal, consolidating power through corporate-government partnerships, concentrating power in the hands of an elite few, and weaponizing the resultant quasi-public apparatus against private individuals holding views that are inconsistent with various social justice initiatives. As the new woke corporate giants amass power through government backing, they broaden the parameters of wokeness to indict a wider array of people and activity as racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, and so forth.\n\nFOX Business host Stuart Varney argues the first instinct of Democrat activists is to side with the bad guys and humiliate the police. \r\nWARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT\n\nAnyone who doubts that corporate wokeness is bound up with government can look to the case of BlackRock, the world's largest asset management company that invests, among other things, government pension and retirement funds. BlackRock has become a gateway to government positions in Washington, D.C., especially in the Biden Administration. Work for BlackRock, and you might just land an influential appointment in the federal government where you can oversee a vast bureaucracy with massive regulative authority.\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink, a notorious supporter of Democrat politics, seems more committed to leftist causes than to his shareholders or the beneficiaries of the pension money that his company invests. Nineteen state attorneys general have warned him that BlackRock may be mismanaging state pensions by adopting costly ESG requirements and standards that reduce shareholder returns on investment, forcing companies into unnecessary regulatory compliance schemes (thereby reducing profits and lowering stock prices), and coercing companies into supporting ideological agendas that their shareholders, management, employees, and consumers oppose.\n\nThe wokeness of asset management companies and proxy advisors raises ethical issues ranging from conflicts of interest to breaches of fiduciary responsibility. Shareholders and beneficiaries of stocks or pension funds should have more control over their valued assets. Are you a public-school teacher? Did you take a job in \"public service\" because you wanted to help your state or community? Whether you like it or not, BlackRock or other money managers and proxy advisory firms could be mismanaging or speculating with your much-deserved retirement.\n\nEven if you're not a government employee, you're likely to invest your earnings and retirement savings in interest-bearing index funds. In so doing, you may be supporting political causes unawares.\n\nNate Fischer, New Founding Chairman and General Partner, shares his thoughts on the growing number of global corporations funding woke company policies\n\nThe backlash against rampant corporate wokeism is underway. Nate Fischer and Matthew Peterson have launched New Founding to combat wokeism through journalism, networks of likeminded businesses, investment strategies, and innovative tech platforms. Vivek Ramaswamy, author of Woke, Inc., created Strive Asset Management to depoliticize asset management. The company refuses to mix business and politics in its investment strategies.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThe Manuel H.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nNY Post columnist Karol Markowicz joins 'Varney & Co.' to discuss her op-ed on how Twitter colluded with the Biden campaign and law enforcement, and how American Girl is receiving backlash over its new book on gender changing tips.\n\nToy companies have issued \"woke\" renditions of classic toys in recent years, which has prompted criticism from Americans who argue the industry is attempting to push a narrative with the help of local government and liberal-leaning Wall Street, one expert told Fox News Digital.\n\nA new California law went into effect on January 1 requiring every store in the state that sells childcare items or toys and has more than 500 employees to include a \"gender-neutral\" toy section or face a $500 fine.\n\nProponents of the law argue it will eliminate gender discrimination and stereotypes about boys and girls, but the move comes on the heels of conservative boycotts of transgender-related items sold to kids many deemed inappropriate.\n\nConsumers' Research issued a report about toy companies, calling out Mattel, Hasbro, Build-A-Bear and Fisher Price for pushing \"woke\" toys in an attempt to target America's children and \"normalize radical transgender ideology.\"\n\nConsumers' Research executive director Will Hild told Fox News Digital that \"woke toys\" are \"unfortunately\" right in line with what he would expect based on the way that both \"woke Wall Street and the governments, like the state of California, have been pushing far-left propaganda.\"\n\n\"In this case, it's an extreme LGBTQ agenda that's clearly targeting kids and trying to basically force a view of gender that is both unscientific, unpopular and grotesque, in my opinion,\" he said.\n\nThe American Girl Doll brand, for example, which is owned by Mattel, released its latest rendition of \"A Smart Girl's Guide: Body Image,\" in 2023, which garnered nationwide attention for its discussion of gender transitions with prepubescent girls.\n\nAn example of LGBTQ content aimed at kids: American Girl's book \"A Smart Girl's Guide: Body Image\" explains gender expression and defines cisgender and nonbinary. | Fox News\n\n\"While gender expression is what you show on the outside, gender identity is how you feel on the inside-a girl, a boy or someone who doesn't quite fit into either category,\" the book reads.\n\n\"Parts of your body may make you feel uncomfortable, and you may want to change the way you look,\" the book says at one point. \"That's totally OK!\"\n\n\"You can appreciate your body for everything it allows you to experience and still want to change certain things about it,\" another page adds. \"If you haven't gone through puberty yet, the doctor might offer medicine to delay your body's changes, giving you more time to think about your gender identity.\"\n\nMattel also owns Barbie, which released a transgender doll modeled after Laverne Cox, who has long hair and is wearing a ball gown, as well as the \"Creatable World\" collection of customizable dolls that encourages kids to create their own characters free of gender norms.\n\nTARGET CEO ACCUSED OF TELLING 'FLAT-OUT LIES' ABOUT PRIDE MERCHANDISE BACKLASH BY CONSUMERS' RESEARCH LEADER\n\n\"It is a fashion doll, but it's a gender neutral body and it's a kit that comes with about 14 accessories, clothing, shoes, a long wig,\" Kim Culmone, Senior Vice President of Mattel Fashion Doll Design told Forbes . \"The doll itself has short hair so the kids can put together all of these elements and build a doll and then rebuild it all again.\"\n\n\"It's about six kits, different ethnicities and all different accessories and clothing to put together in whatever expression they would like, and whatever character they would like to build,\" she continued. \"The target age for the product is five to eight and the doll itself is prepubescent. So it's a body and an expression that's not a realistic rendering, but it's a stylized interpretation of a preteen child.\"\n\nLaverne Cox at a star-studded evening at the Barker Hanger in Santa Monica. (Amy Sussman / Getty Images)\n\nFisher Price released dolls of famous drag queen RuPaul that were marketed \"for fans ages 1-101 years,\" according to the packaging as seen on Amazon.\n\nBuild-A-Bear also launched a RuPaul teddy bear as a \"tribute to the world's most famous drag queen\" that is no longer featured on the brand's website. The New York Post described the Build-A-Bear site's original product description: \"Two iconic pop culture institutions join forces for this one-of-a-kind collector's item made in tribute to the world's most famous drag queen.\"\n\nHild said it is clear to him that these types of toys are \"100% about pushing a narrative\" and pointed out that in his opinion, if it wasn't, it wouldn't be necessary to mandate anything by law, as California has done.\n\n\"It's not like there isn't enough competition in the children's toy market, there's hundreds of thousands of different toys in the world, there's a great market for this,\" he said. \"If this was something that existed large enough for people to want it, it would already be in these stores.\"\n\nHasbro's Mr. Potato Head was made \"gender-neutral\" in 2021, encouraging children to create gender-fluid families with the potato characters.\n\nFormer California state Sen. Melissa Melendez criticized a state law requiring large retail stores to offer a gender-neutral toy section beginning in 2024. (Fox & Friends/Screengrab / Fox News)\n\n\"The possibilities to create your own families are endless with mixing and mashing all the parts and pieces,\" Hasbro said regarding the classic toy's rebrand.\n\nSome photos showed a potato mom with a mustache and a potato dad wearing mascara. Hasbro later clarified that the brand itself would no longer be gendered, but that the characters themselves still would.\n\nDISNEY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PROVE COMPANY BECAME 'TOO WOKE,' WILL SHAKE UP CORPORATE AMERICA: EXPERT\n\nHild added, \"Mr. Potato head... you don't have to adopt a political or ideological framework in order to play with them... They forced you to make a political statement to buy a toy that has been around for 40 years.\"\n\nHild said he sees the trend as part of a broader pattern in the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) space, which has been criticized as an investment philosophy and as a way to push political preferences that critics argue are at odds with an asset manager's fiduciary duty.\n\n\"The question becomes, how do they suddenly inject a bunch of far left-wing politics into their investing? What they use to justify it is they say, 'Well, things like net-zero targets are going to be put in place by 2050' and 'DEI requirements are going to be put in by law, so we're just preparing these companies for the inevitable legal requirements,'\" he said. \"Then governments come along, and they say, 'Look, the market's already doing this, we're just standardizing it or we're just making it so that either investors or business people have clarity around what's required.\"\n\nHe explained that this environment has asset managers and governments claiming they aren't pushing a social or political narrative as they are \"ping-ponging between each other\" over who is to blame for the \"woke\" policies.\n\nPARENTS OUTRAGED AFTER POPULAR NETFLIX SHOW FOR TODDLERS HAS BOY DANCE IN TUTU FOR GAY DADS\n\n\"This is a perfect example of that, because you've got the state of California trying to undoubtedly use civil rights law as a justification for this,\" he said. \"They're claiming, 'Oh, this needs to be equitable for all children, non-binary or binary or whatever' and then I guarantee you're going to have asset managers and companies pushing ESG, start asking toy companies, 'Well, are you prepared for this coming wave of requirements like California as this spreads throughout the country?' That is how they're going to work together to push this agenda across the country.\"\n\nHild said there are many people who don't take issue with non-binary options, which he said is fine \"if it's organic and what people actually want, but when it's being forced on them, either by Wall Street actors like BlackRock... or by the government, they not only have a right, but a responsibility if they care about the free market to push back and say, 'No, I find this offensive and I want it done away with.'\"\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

The ad ignited immediate outrage on social media, with users accusing the tech giant of going \"woke.\"\n\nVeyssi, 30, has had features in several media publications recently about rising social media influencers and is a co-host on the Amazon Prime talk show \"Influenced.\"\n\nGOOGLE ACCUSED OF 'WOKE' NEW CHRISTMAS AD WITH 'NONBINARY' BEAUTY INFLUENCER\n\nCyrus Veyssi attends the God's Love We Deliver Golden Heart Awards at Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City on Oct. 21. (Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images / Getty Images)\n\nWhile Veyssi doesn't often discuss politics on social media, he isn't afraid to take shots at people he disagrees with online. In a post marking Trans Week of Visibility last month, Veyssi put out a video responding to a female social media user who celebrated President-elect Trump's victory and \"the right to be protected when going into a female bathrooms .\"\n\nThe woman said she was relieved \"not [to] have to share a bathroom with a biological male.\"\n\n\"Hi diva, plot twist,\" Veyssi replied on Instagram. \"You don't care about being protected from trans people. You hate trans people.\"\n\n\"Let me explain. As a millennial with anxiety, I understand fear. So what I do is, I take data and that quells my fears. because this myth and this fallacy that trans people are just using restrooms to access people and violate them can very easily be disproved,\" Veyssi went on.\n\nThe content creator, who goes by \"he/him\" and \"they/them\" pronouns, cited two studies examining non-discrimination laws and criminal offenses committed in bathrooms, claiming that they found \"no evidence\" of a correlation between the two.\n\n\"There was no link. There's no evidence. There were no cases,\" he said.\n\n\"So you see it's not fear,\" Veyssi added. \"It's hate... and misinformation.\"\n\nVeyssi made no mention of the case in Loudoun County, Virginia, in which a father was famously arrested during a school board meeting after accusing the school of trying to cover up a sexual assault incident by a gender-fluid individual against his daughter.\n\nBUD LIGHT HASN'T FULLY REBOUNDED AS ONE-YEAR MARK OF DYLAN MULVANEY FIASCO APPROACHES: 'VERY STUBBORN BOYCOTT'\n\nScott Smith said a boy wearing a skirt entered the girls' bathroom and assaulted his ninth grade daughter in May 2021. The sheriff's office confirmed to Fox News that an investigation was launched into the matter and that the suspect was arrested two months later. All juvenile records are sealed, but the father's attorney, Elizabeth Lancaster, told The Daily Wire at the time that the boy was charged with two counts of forcible sodomy, one count of anal sodomy and one count of forcible fellatio.\n\nCyrus Veyssi attends NYC Tastemaker Cocktail Event Celebrating Prime Video's \"Influenced\" in Brooklyn, New York, on July 31.

The student was charged with single counts of disorderly conduct and assault and battery.\n\nVeyssi did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.\n\nA Google spokesperson told Fox News Digital the company works with many influencers and that the tech giant doesn't endorse the views of everyone they work with.\n\n\"We work with hundreds of creators and influencers across social platforms, so we don't endorse all of their respective personal views,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe spokesperson also noted how the Google Shopping campaign is a social media investment designed for younger audiences. The campaign includes numerous high-profile influencers that are popular among Gen Z, like family-first content creator Addie McCracken who posts about being a mom and wife, Olympic athlete Shawn Johnson and others.\n\nGoogle previously told Fox News Digital that the ad featuring Veyssi was just one in its broader campaign featuring dozens of smaller social media influencers.\n\n\"Everyone likes to find a good deal and save money. That's why we're promoting Google Shopping as the best way to do that.

Earlier this week, a conservative watchdog announced that American Airlines reportedly agreed to end diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) hiring and employment practices, after the group filed a federal complaint alleging discrimination by the airline.\n\nWalmart also recently agreed to a slate of changes to DEI policies, Starbuck announced in November. The changes were similarly agreed to after he warned executives that he would be doing a story on \"wokeness\" at the retail giant, he said.\n\nIn October, Toyota announced its plans to move away from DEI and pro-LGBTQ events after facing heat online.\n\nThe company sent out a memo to its U.S. employees saying it will \"narrow community activities to align with STEM education and workforce readiness\" and no longer participate in the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index.

They have our backs,\" she said . \"They bring us into a community, and they give us power. Community means power, and this is really important right now when workers' power has been attacked and the community is being weakened.\"\n\nIn 1972, Fonda went on to tour North Vietnam in a controversial trip that would come to be the most notable part of her activist career, and led to her being given the nickname \"Hanoi Jane.\"\n\nWhile in Vietnam, Fonda appeared on 10 radio programs to speak out against the U.S. military's policy in Vietnam and beg pilots to cease bombing non-military targets , according to Time magazine.\n\nDuring the trip a photograph was taken of her seated on an anti-aircraft gun in Hanoi, making it look like she would shoot down American planes, which apparently led to the nickname.\n\nAt the time, Fonda's public criticisms of U.S. leadership caused massive outrage among American officials and war veterans\n\n\"Hanoi Jane Fonda got a lifetime achievement award because Hollywood still hates America,\" Scarlett Johson, a political strategist who works for the Wisconsin chapter of Moms for Liberty, wrote in an X post.\n\nFonda during her speech Sunday said she got her start in film during the Hollywood Blacklist era during the mid-20th century when people suspected of being a communist were banned from working in the United States entertainment industry, which essentially coincided with the large McCarthyism era, in which the fear of communism and Soviet influence was a concern among most every American institution.\n\n\"I made my first movie in 1958. It was at the tail end of McCarthyism when so many careers were destroyed,\" she said. \"Today, it's helpful to remember, though, that Hollywood resisted.\""

I believe the United States has no right to exist. I believe every settler colony who has committed genocide against native peoples has no right to exist.\" On Woke Kindergarten's website, Gross is described as an \"abolitionist early educator, cultural organizer and creator currently innovating ways to resist, heal, liberate and create with their pedagogy, Woke Kindergarten.\"\n\nIn the Chronicle's reporting, Glassbrook teacher Tiger Craven-Neeley, who is white and describes himself as a \"gay moderate,\" questioned a Woke Kindergarten trainer who described the nation as the \"so-called United States\" and promoted \"Lil' Comrade Convos\" for children about imagining a world without police, money, or landlords. Craven-Neeley, who sued and settled with his former school district for not being allowed to talk about LGBTQ+ history before moving to the Bay Area, says he was banned from future Woke Kindergarten training sessions for his questions.\n\nOther teachers questioned why the school opted to use $250,000 in limited federal funding meant to be used on improving educational outcomes for the nation's worst-performing public schools on science-based math and reading interventions that are proven to work.\n\nOne teacher who spoke to the Chronicle anonymously said, \"Our reading scores are low. That [$250,000] could have gotten us a reading interventionist.\"\n\nMeanwhile, nearby John Muir Elementary adopted a math intervention program that increased math proficiency rate from 15% - barely higher than Glassbrook's 12% - to more than 50%. A recent Stanford study found reading interventions for the state's 75 worst-performing public elementary schools based on scientific, phonics-based programs accelerated reading learning by 25% and, as a spillover effect, boosted math advancement by 12% relative to students in schools that didn't adopt the programs.\n\nThe majority of California students do not meet grade-level proficiency in any tested subject, and over 1,400 California public schools have lost more than 20% of their students since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic due to outmigration, declining birth rates, and parents choosing education options outside of public K-12."

And the reason why is because we've got to protect our shareholders, the employees, customers, and the community from its overall spread.\"\n\nParker explained that the Boardroom Initiative will combat woke corporations and boards in a variety of ways, including filing shareholder proposals, advancing viewpoint diversity on corporate boards, and utilizing digital channels to spread the awareness of its mission.\n\n\"All of this is kind of happening below the radar, but we're starting to see it bubble up with some of the big headlines,\" she said.\n\nDisney has certainly made headlines over the past few weeks for publicly criticizing a recently passed bill in Florida that bans instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in classrooms for grades K-3. The company announced it would suspend political donations in Florida and support organizations working to oppose the new measure.\n\nIn response, the Florida legislature voted Thursday to strip Walt Disney World of its private government status, a step supported by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nDisney is just the latest prominent example of corporations supporting left-wing positions on hot-button issues.\n\nLast year, for example, Delta and Coca-Cola lambasted a newly passed election bill in Georgia meant to minimize voter fraud. Critics, including the two companies, said the measure was designed to suppress voter turnout, especially among minorities - a claim denied by those who supported the bill. Major League Baseball even moved its All-Star Game out of Atlanta due to the voting law.\n\nAnother corporation accused of going woke is Bank of America, which has encouraged employees to be \"woke at work\" and told white employees to \"decolonize your mind\" and \"cede power to people of color,\" according to Manhattan Institute fellow and investigative reporter Christopher Rufo.\n\nCorporate leaders are \"speaking out on policies that don't impact their companies,\" said Parker. \"This is social engineering. These are issues that they shouldn't be getting involved in ... They have a responsibility to their shareholders to produce profit and value for the company.\"\n\nOne way in which companies have embraced wokeness is through Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) evaluation, a rating system used by investors to measure a company's advancement of policies designed to address climate change, increase board diversity, and support a progressive \"social justice\" agenda.\n\nOn Thursday, Utah Treasurer Marlo Oaks coordinated an effort by political leaders across the state to send a letter to S&P Global Ratings President and CEO Douglas Peterson and President Martina Cheung demanding that S&P withdraw ESG indicators as part of its credit ratings for states and state subdivisions.\n\n\"ESG is about controlling and forcing behaviors,\" Oaks said in a statement. \"It attempts to do through capital markets what activists and their government allies have been unable to do through democratic processes. S&P should be concerned about whether investors will get paid back, not whether a state policy lines up with their political beliefs, whatever those may be.\"\n\nMany of these leftward shifts in corporate boardrooms are motivated by stakeholder capitalism, experts say.\n\nStakeholder capitalism is the idea that companies should serve not only their shareholders but also other interests and society at large, according to Vivek Ramaswamy, an entrepreneur and author of \"Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam.\"\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink has been one of Corporate America's biggest promoters of stakeholder capitalism.\n\nStakeholder capitalism is not about politics ... It is capitalism,\" Fink wrote in his annual letter to American CEOs in February. \"Putting your company's purpose at the foundation of your relationships with your stakeholders is critical to long-term success.\"\n\n\"Your company's purpose is its north star in this tumultuous environment,\" he added. Shareholders \"do need to know where we stand on the societal issues intrinsic to our companies' long-term success ... It is more important than ever that your company and its management be guided by its purpose.\"\n\nLast year, BlackRock helped elect three climate-focused candidates to Exxon Mobil's 12-member board, describing its vote as an effort to push Exxon to fight climate change. BlackRock is a major Exxon shareholder.\n\nBeyond climate change, many corporations have also taken up the mantle of the Black Lives Matter movement (BLM).\n\nIndeed, spurred by the social unrest that tore through urban America in 2020, many companies have invoked the BLM slogan and pledged to donate money to the organization.\n\n\"Corporate leaders assumed that they were reducing their political and reputational risk by adopting [left-wing policies], especially on topics like climate change and workplace diversity,\" said Richard Morrison, senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. \"In many cases, this seemed like a smart move at first, but only because prior to the last few years, there was almost no countervailing conservative activism from the other side. That has now changed.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, black leaders called on Papa John's, Coca-Cola, and other \"woke corporations\" to show support for police officers after they \"blindly\" supported BLM and its affiliates.\n\nThe call came from Concerned Communities for America (CCA), a group of black leaders that lambasted BLM for \"hate mongering\" and asked corporations to pledge to support law enforcement rather than BLM.\n\nPerhaps the most infamous example of corporate wokeness is Big Tech's censorship of content - censorship that conservatives believe is meant to silence them and promote left-wing views.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk, the world's richest man, has cited social media platforms' suppression of content as a key reason why he's currently trying to buy Twitter, saying Twitter's higher-ups are infringing on freedom of speech and his goal is to change that.\n\nTwitter founder Jack Dorsey has also spoken out against the company's board of directors in a further indication that corporate leaders' behavior is alienating large swaths of the country.\n\nActivism against corporate wokeness is slowly being turned into policy. Beyond Florida's battle with Disney and Utah's letter to the S&P, the Texas legislature last year passed a law that denied financial institutions who refused to do business with oil and gas companies or gun manufacturers the opportunity to do business with the Texas state government.\n\n\"In terms of a government response, I think the Texas one is legitimate - the state government can set certain standards for the vendors it wants to do business with, whether that's buying food for public schools or hiring a company to provide state agencies with financial services,\" said Morrison. \"But states that try to reach out beyond their own role as a consumer and force 'woke' firms to renounce left-wing policies is over the line.\"\n\nMorrison cited Florida's recent vote against Disney as one such move that went \"over the line,\" describing it as a \"political vendetta.\"\n\nHe added that it's \"perfectly legitimate\" for Congress to stop federal agencies from pressuring or forcing companies to adopt certain policies and priorities.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission, for example, is pushing to adopt a new rule that would force corporations to radically expand their climate change disclosures.\n\n\"Congress should limit the jurisdiction of the SEC to its traditional role of facilitating financially material disclosures and not allow it to branch out into environmental and social policy,\" said Morrison, who noted Rep. Beth Van Duyne (R-Texs) has a bill now, the Stopping Excessive Climate Reporting Act, to do just that."

      "text": "Woke is dead - let's make sure it never comes back\n\nAcross the non-left media world, it's now an article of faith that Donald Trump's emphatic victory is a woke watershed.\n\nAfter asking petulantly for year upon year, \"Now have we hit peak woke?\" - like children in the back seat nagging Daddy, \"Are we there yet?\" - we learn repeatedly from conservative outlets that the progressive lunacy that has tormented us since about 2014 (if not since 1965) has been roundly defeated.\n\nA decisive death knell for identity politics dangles the blessed possibility of no longer squandering our brief duration on this Earth on stupid conversations and debates over whether women can have penises; racial discrimination cures racism; advancement in employment and education should be determined by skin color ; the Western civilization that gave us penicillin, Rembrandt, Bach and the Hubble Space Telescope is a disgrace; being grotesquely fat is healthy; and wearing a sombrero that you bought yourself on Amazon is theft.\n\nFriends, the folks who've really been stealing - and high-value items: our precious time, energy and attention - are the doctrinal morons who've roped us into addressing these painfully self-evident questions. I have devoted whole afternoons to seriously considering whether a mass movement to sterilize children and cut off their healthy body parts is a good idea.\n\nAgreed, then: We yearn to put this rank idiocy behind us.\n\nIn fact, I'm intensely curious how this period of communal madness will be regarded once it's foreshortening in the rear-view mirror. Will this era's edges blur until, in retrospect, \"cancel culture\" is remembered as rather cute?\n\nWill historians recall only that for a funny little period, people cared innocuously more than usual about \"social justice\"?\n\nOr will the reign of woke instead take its place alongside Mao's Cultural Revolution, Stalin's show trials and Pol Pot's killing fields as a lower-fatality example of a whole society losing its collective mind?\n\nAs for that rear-view mirror, there are promising signs. Preferred pronouns are quietly dropping from email signatures. The sanctimonious University of Michigan is firing diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) staff. Walmart has dropped the term DEI altogether . Investors are suing the retailer Target for putting commitments to DEI, environmental, social and governance and Pride Month above the interests of shareholders. Formerly left-wing Silicon Valley billionaires are publicly excited about, or even bidding to participate in, the Trump administration.\n\nThe atmosphere on podcasts is suddenly more permissive; why, it might finally be safe to make a joke.\n\nDemocratic media figures are drowning in self-pity, while the viewership of the hectoring MSNBC channel has plummeted. Red states are banning gender-defying care for minors, and these laws have a good chance of holding up in the Supreme Court. The word \"retarded\" is enjoying a comeback.\n\nStill, I worry that we're jumping the gun. This dogma has infected all our institutions like a fungus. It won't be easy to eradicate. Ever notice how quickly, after a full complement of treatments, athlete's foot comes right back?\n\nOne American election won't do the trick. There are too many people with a vested interest in wokery because \"decolonizing the curriculum,\" say, is their job. Many a museum director has been hired expressly to ensure an art collection doesn't acquire work by white people.\n\nNumerous black female hires who tick two boxes in a diversity \"Buy one, get one free\" but are sometimes conspicuously underqualified, such as ousted Harvard president Claudine Gay, owe their appointments to that fungal way of thinking, and they won't all go quietly.\n\nAmerica's entire Democratic Party is steeped in this brain rot, and Kamala Harris still came within 1.5 percentage points of winning the popular vote.\n\nOn both sides of the Atlantic, the universities, the judicial system, NGOs, the legal and medical professions, the news media, cultural institutions, theater, publishing, film: They've all been putrefied by the zombie fungus. Picture the special effects for \"The Last of Us,\" all those hairy tendrils and fibrous clumps crawling up the skyscrapers of Midtown Manhattan.\n\nSo this is a long fight that's not yet won. That's not to detract from the cheerful impression that we sane people do seem to have gained the upper hand right now.\n\nIndeed, I've never doubted that our level-headed and unindoctrinated contingent - however beleaguered, persecuted and shockingly few in number - has always been destined to win, because lunacy eventually collapses from its own contradictions. It has only ever been a question of how much longer we have to put up with this staggering bull.\n\nAs for the present juncture, I have a theory. Let's remember the nature of the opposition. Wokesters are conformists. They didn't invent their wretched ideas; they're reading from a common hymn sheet.\n\nThat's why they all use the same words and subscribe to the exact same roster of convictions, no matter how preposterous: These people aren't original thinkers. But they imagine they're at the cutting edge.\n\nBeing \"progressive\" means they're in the vanguard. They think woke makes them modern, makes them hip.\n\nSubscribe to our daily Post Opinion newsletter!\n\nPlease provide a valid email address.\n\nBy clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy .\n\nNever miss a story.\n\nWhatever the more complex truth of the matter, it's in our interest to promote the trope that woke is over. That woke has been vanquished. That woke is totally yesterday, hopelessly stale and played out. That the rest of us are moving on to genuinely thorny questions that aren't stupid. That we'll no longer waste our time pushing back against petty amateur linguists who insist we call the portly \"people living with obesity.\"\n\nThat, whatever our private reservations about the guy, Trump's election marks a hard Before and After. That as Kamala would say, we've \"turned the page\" and \"we're not going back.\"\n\nBecause when you say something enough times (this is a gambit the wokesters themselves have mastered), you can make it true. Wokesters are highly suggestible. Furthermore, most of these folks don't really care about social justice. They care about appearing to care about social justice. They care about other people's esteem. They care about fitting in.\n\nThey echo what everyone else around them says, because being a mindless copycat means other mindless copycats will like them and they'll keep their friends and their jobs. And they care about social fashion.\n\nSo they won't spout lingo like \"cisgender\" if that might risk an eye-roll at parties. They won't want to seem behind the times. If we convince them that woke is over, that their BLM lawn signs are passé, that maundering about \"white privilege\" is boring and old hat, they'll drop the whole patriarchy/neurodiversity/heteronormativity et al. package in a New York minute.\n\nWe just have to persuade them that woke is unhip. Which it always has been, but some people are slow.\n\nLionel Shriver's latest book, \"Mania,\" is published by the Borough Press. Reprinted with permission from Spiked ."

      "text": "Bill Maher rails against woke left 'crazies' within the Democratic Party\n\nBill Maher made it clear how he feels about the \"crazies\" within the Democratic Party in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Saturday.\n\nWhen asked why he mocks the left more than he used to, he responded, \"You're damn right I do, because you give me more material. I'm a comedian. I'm going to go where the gold is.\" Maher expanded on his comedy, adding, \"I think humor is one of the best avenues to get at the truth, maybe the best, especially in politics,\" and that \"When someone laughs, it is involuntary. So you can make the audience admit that they agree with you even if they really don't want to.\"\n\nThe interviewer responded by saying \"But the woke don't always laugh.\" Maher agreed, responding, \"This is one of the issues I have with the left. They can't stand to have to endure a moment of hearing something they don't already agree with. Not that the right doesn't do it, too, but the left does it worse.\"\n\nMaher also touched on how his liberal friends can't stand the fact that he invites conservative guests, such as Ann Coulter, on to his show. \"'I had liberal friends who just couldn't stand that. Just think about what this is,' Bill takes a dramatic pause, 'that's people who hate me for who I won't hate,' again repeating, 'People who hate me for who I won't hate.'\"\n\nAfter being asked, \"Why do people on the left find it impossible to be congenial toward those they disagree with?\" Maher responded, saying, \"It's in their psychological profile, they just have this need for virtue signaling, and to have their friends-and I guess everybody on social media-think of them as the good people. 'We're the good people. We know who's good. And it's us.'\"\n\nWith many speculating about whether Maher is considering changing parties, Maher shoots down that notion, stating, \"Many Republicans say, 'Maybe we could get Bill Maher.' No, you can't. What you can get is Bill Maher being honest about the left. I'm not going to join your team that doesn't believe in democracy.\"\n\nAlthough he doesn't plan on switching parties himself, Maher pointed out that there are voters who are \"not particularly enamored with Trump, not blind to his many flaws, but they just feel that the crazy on the left is somehow worse. I don't agree with them, but I get it. I don't hate them for voting for him.\"\n\nMaher also had some choice words for the younger generation, with one of his issues with them being \"that they have no idea, no perspective. Of course, if they've gone to elite universities, i.e., a-h- factories, they've been indoctrinated into this idea that they live in the worst country in the world at the worst time in history, when actually they live in, with all our flaws, still probably the best, with definitely indisputably the best time in history.\"\n\nWhile Maher believes that what the country needs is a metaphorical \"colonic,\" he adds that he does \"like America,\" and that \"America does not need a revolution,\" contrary to what some people on the political fringes believe.\n\nHe believes that Republicans will dominate the Democrats in elections as long as the Democratic Party fails to \"unconvince itself that it is this misunderstood vehicle for what people really want,\" adding, \"They often say, when they lose elections, 'We didn't get our message out.' Yes you did. They just didn't like it. You got it out loud and clear.\"\n\nIn Maher's final statement of the interview, as if he were addressing Vice President Kamala Harris herself, he stated, \"You lost a crazy contest to an actual crazy person. Congratulations.\"\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "How the Trump Smithsonian order is fighting another bulwark of woke insanity\n\nDonald Trump is fighting back against yet another bulwark of woke insanity - issuing an executive order that \"improper, divisive or anti-American ideology\" be removed from the Smithsonian Institution (the nation's premier network of major museums).\n\nIt also charges the Interior Department to restore federal parks, monuments, and memorials that have been \"removed or changed in the last years to perpetuate a false revision of history.\"\n\nYes! Among the worst excesses of the woke crusade was the rush to divide and segregate America by race again, allegedly to somehow ameliorate the ills caused by social injustice.\n\nTax-funded institutions like the National Museum of African American History and Culture went all in on racist nonsense: In 2020, the museum put out a graphic stating that \"objective, rational, linear thinking,\" \"quantitative emphasis,\" and \"hard work before play\" are white qualities.\n\nThat's an insult to everyone.\n\nRemember too, the move to literally write out of the record even extremely important figures from America's past by toppling monuments, painting over murals, and renaming facilities.\n\nOne recent target was William Penn , a man famous for founding a state based on the idea of religious freedom; it took public outrage to reverse 2024 National Park Service plans to remove his Philly statue.\n\nAnd cosigning it all was huge swathes of our public-intellectual class, including historians and preservationists - the very people supposed to protect the past, not cheer its obliteration.\n\nA free nation must tolerate its critics; all serious history is, in a sense, revisionist.\n\nBut the idea that the taxpaying public should sponsor race-based pseudo-sociology and the gleeful, wanton destruction of the past is beyond vile.\n\nThat's why Trump deserves credit for striking back.\n\nYes, it's an executive order, so it can be undone if a Democrat wins the White House - and Democrats are still deeply vested in this nonsense.\n\nThat is: The \"museum wars\" are only part of the much larger struggle to push American elite culture back toward sanity and excellence - to end the lefty bullying that elevates fourth-rate scholarship like the 1619 Project far beyond its merits.\n\nRooting that out is beyond the reach of any executive order, but this one is certainly an excellent first step."

After refining the initial scale, the study was expanded to a more representative national sample of 5,000 participants, distributed via Helsingin Sanomat, Finland's largest newspaper.\n\nIn the end, their final Critical Social Justice Attitude Scale identified seven truisms of woke people:\n\n\"The gender divide was probably most surprising to me,\" Lahtinen told PsyPost of Finnish attitudes. \"Three out of five women view 'woke' ideas positively, but only one out of seven men.\"\n\nThis was especially true of women in fields such as social sciences, education, and humanities. By contrast, participants who worked in STEM were more likely to critique social justice efforts associated with being woke.\n\nHowever, the most concerning finding was the relationship between mental health and agreement with the scale. Specifically, researchers found a high prevalence of anxiety and depression in people who believe the statement \"If white people have on average a higher income than black people, it is because of racism.\" More broadly, they found that those who identified as left-wing were most likely to report lower mental well-being.\n\nLahtinen warned against extrapolating their findings to international audiences just yet, particularly across Western nations.\n\n\"The studies were quite robust with a sample size above 5,000 and good psychometric properties,\" Lahtinen said. \"However, the scale would need to be validated in North American samples in order to know how these attitudes manifest there. I encourage colleagues in the United States to study the prevalence of these attitudes in the country where they originate from.\""

      "text": "How the rise of woke 'educrats' is destroying higher education\n\nThe nation's universities, particularly so-called elite ones, are in crisis. Speakers are shouted down, professors are afraid of students, students can't discuss certain topics, and nobody trusts the gowned \"experts.\" And that's before Hamas' attack on Israel revealed these bastions of progressive enlightenment to be the heart of antisemitism in America. Why is this happening?\n\nTruth be told, what's different now from when I was in school 25 years ago isn't so much that faculties have shifted left. They have a bit, and millennial professors are more activist than their boomer elders, but this is not just the latest conservative lament about the liberal takeover of the academy.\n\nInstead, university officials at best placate, and at worst foment, illiberal mobs that stifle education. And that's largely a story of growing bureaucracies.\n\nThe statistics on the growth of nonteaching staff are mind-boggling. In the 25 years ending in 2012, the number of professional university employees who don't teach grew at about twice the rate of students. In the same period, tuition at public colleges more than tripled.\n\nThose trends have only accelerated, though useful statistics are hard to come by as surveyors change methodologies and the Department of Education fails to collect or disclose uniform data.\n\nWhat all this really means is that students are paying more and more to fund an expanding cohort of well-compensated bureaucrats, without getting anything in return. And this isn't just a budget issue. Administrators are more radical than professors, and not steeped in norms of academic freedom, all of which detract from the educational environment.\n\nA 2018 survey found that faculty had a liberal-to-conservative ratio of about 6 to 1, with 13% of our nation's professors self-identifying on the right. Students are more balanced: 42% of freshmen called themselves centrist, while 36% said they were liberal and 22% conservative.\n\nIn contrast, two-thirds of higher-ed administrators self-identified as liberal - with 40% calling themselves far-left - and only 5% said they were on the right. That makes for a liberal-to-conservative ratio of 12 to 1 .\n\nThose who once were technocratic paper-pushers ensuring compliance with federal financial aid and antidiscrimination regulations have morphed into enforcers of radical race and gender ideology. The great political economist Mancur Olson detailed how the growth of bureaucracies ultimately causes the decline of nations.\n\nAnd that's precisely what's happened in the academy, as well-paid apparatchiks with no connection to universities' teaching and research missions create and enforce codes that chill speech and eviscerate due process.\n\nIn recent decades, the growth in university bureaucracies has far outpaced the growth in faculties and student bodies.  According to Department of Education data, between 1993 and 2009, college administrative positions expanded by 60% , a rate of growth 10 times that of tenured faculty.\n\nMoreover, between 1987 and 2012, the number of administrators at private universities doubled, while their numbers in central offices of public university systems rose by a factor of 34 . Overall, during that period, colleges added more than half a million administrators and then even more in the decade after that. The Bureau of Labor Statistics expects their number to grow by 7% a year between 2021 and 2031.\n\nAround 2010, schools started employing more administrators than full-time instructors. Through the following decade, some, especially elite places such as Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Stanford, and MIT even started having more administrators than students.\n\nYale's administration rolls grew by 45% in 2003-21, expanding at a rate nearly three times faster than that of the undergraduate student body . At Stanford, the number of administrators grew by 30% in 2017-22 alone, with the biggest growth coming in the first full pandemic year of 2020-21.\n\nStanford now has nearly twice as many nonteaching staff as undergrads and nearly six times as many as faculty. The ratios tend to be lower at public schools, but still, administrative growth at UCLA has outpaced growth in other sectors, so there are now four times as many staff as faculty.\n\nThe disproportionate increase in nonfaculty positions is also reflected in budgets. At 198 of the leading US research universities, spending on administrative functions has been rising faster than spending on instruction and research.\n\nFrom 1993 to 2007, administrative expenses increased by 61% per student, while instruction-related expenses increased by only 39%. That trend has only accelerated . For the 2018-19 academic year - the last year before COVID-related expenses made everything look even worse -degree-granting institutions spent $632 billion, but less than 30% of that went to instruction.\n\nBetween 2009-10 and 2018-19, instructional expenses per full-time student at four-year institutions grew by only 8%, while overall expenses grew by 114% .\n\nOr look at Harvard, which has long regarded itself as the crown jewel of American higher education. Harvard's administrative payroll nearly doubled in this century's first two decades.\n\nIn 2020, the school spent $47,706 per student on administration, which is just under the cost of undergraduate tuition (not including fees, room, and board). This bureaucratic growth accounts for almost the entire increase in the annual cost of attending Harvard.\n\nStay up on the very latest with Evening Update.\n\nPlease provide a valid email address.\n\nBy clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy .\n\nNever miss a story.\n\nThe trend of having higher-ed institutions run by bureaucrats rather than academics intensified in 2023 when Harvard named Claudine Gay as its next president. Even without the revelations of plagiarism that forced her resignation barely six months later, Gay had a thin scholarly record, having authored 11 unremarkable academic articles and no books.\n\nBut she came from a privileged background and was elevated for advancing progressive orthodoxy while checking the right intersectional boxes. She is the apotheosis of an anti-intellectual movement that values identity and activism over merit and education.\n\nThe Gay episode encapsulates the DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) aspect of bureaucratic bloat. It wasn't until after the Supreme Court's decision in Grutter v. Bollinger in 2003, approving the use of race in admissions, that universities began fully integrating diversity officers into higher administration.\n\nThat led to the creation of a plethora of new jobs specifically focused on those issues. Diversity officers play a direct role in presidential decision-making that typically bypasses executives of equal or higher rank in areas such as research or finance.\n\nA 2021 survey of 65 large universities comprising the old \"power five\" football conferences found that the average school has more than 45 people devoted to DEI - more than the average number of history professors.\n\nIndeed, DEI is the fastest-growing segment of the educational bureaucracy, with staffs on average four times larger than those providing legally mandated accommodations to disabled students. (The study was careful to exclude people whose primary responsibility was in Title IX, equal employment opportunity, or other legal obligations.)\n\nThe average school had 3.4 DEI staff per 100 tenured or tenure-track faculty. Syracuse University was the worst, with 7.4 DEI staff for every 100 professors. At the University of Michigan, 163 people had authority over DEI programs, a number that grew to 261 by 2023 - and double that when partial positions are included, at an annual cost of more than $30 million.\n\nAt larger universities, campus-wide DEI structures are replicated in colleges and departments, including through centers focused on providing services to people with particular racial, ethnic, or gender identities.\n\nVirginia Tech has a vice president for strategic affairs and diversity, who is supported by an associate vice provost of diversity education and engagement, and in turn by assistant provosts for (1) diversity and inclusion and (2) faculty diversity, plus several directors.\n\nThese DEI offices are further supported by communications teams, program associates, and other aides. The number of DEI offices created or filled has spiked dramatically since the \"racial reckoning\" that followed the killing of George Floyd in 2020.\n\nThe dramatic increase in noninstructional staff has driven tuition higher for decades, without benefiting students. That is, campus climate surveys show that students' satisfaction with their college experience generally, and with campus diversity specifically, doesn't correlate with the number of administrators, let alone the size of DEI offices.\n\nAs Jay Greene, who co-authored that 2021 survey, pointed out , \"The real danger of universities hiring so many staff who do not engage in teaching or research is not the expense but how it corrupts the core mission of higher education.\"\n\nUniversities no longer see their role as facilitating an open search for the truth or, in the case of law schools, producing skilled lawyers and the furtherance of the rule of law. Instead, they employ an army of educrats \"who either distract from that mission by providing therapeutic coddling to students or subvert truth-seeking by enforcing an ideological orthodoxy.\"\n\nProviding students with staff to organize their social lives and hold their hands while they \"process\" the trauma of disappointing elections infantilizes students, who should be preparing for serious challenges in the workplace and public square.\n\nInstead, DEI offices enforce narrow perspectives through orientations and trainings, to the detriment of the intellectual inquiry that students need.\n\nThey also take power away from faculty who are supposed to be instilling academic norms and give it to political commissars who have little regard for the traditional mission of higher education.\n\nIlya Shapiro is the director of constitutional studies at the Manhattan Institute and author of the new book Lawless: The Miseducation of America's Elites , from which this essay is adapted.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Trump's all-out assault on woke is tearing down the left's cultural sway\n\nThe right just experienced its best three weeks in the culture war in 50 years.\n\nA blitz of executive orders issued by President Trump have taken dead aim at left-wing cultural priorities and pillars of the left's cultural influence.\n\nFashionable progressive ideas that have long been ascendant, including DEI and gender ideology, have received hammer blows since Trump's inauguration, and there's more to come.\n\nNever before has control of the executive branch of the federal government had such potentially momentous cultural significance.\n\nThe Trump administration is determined to use every tool at its command - chiefly federal funding but also the enforcement of civil rights laws - to push back against decades-long trends that have long felt inexorable.\n\nFor quite some time, conservatives have focused on the notion of a \"long march through the institutions\" to understand how the left came to dominate elite culture.\n\nThe phrase is attributed to the 1960s-era left-wing German activist Rudi Dutschke, who wanted, in the words of a progressive analyst, \"to create radical change from within government and society by becoming an integral part of the machinery.\"\n\nThe left's insight was that by taking over faculty lounges, Hollywood studios, HR departments and the like, it could bring about revolutionary change in a way that it couldn't through the ballot box or a frontal assault on such institutions.\n\nNow, Trump is bringing to bear a real counter-force via federal power.\n\nThis represents a new way of thinking about cultural change for the right, and a strange reversal - to wit, it's the progressives who effectively used civil society to their ends, and now conservatives are attempting to use government to theirs.\n\nGovernment played a role in the tide of left-wing cultural change, but it wasn't necessarily the dominant one.\n\nThe takeover of elite culture was largely driven by private actors: The hiring policies of university administrators, the funding decisions of large foundations and the practices promoted by corporate HR departments, among other things, had an enormous hand in effecting a de facto cultural revolution.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services didn't direct Disney to inject woke story lines into its programming; the company did it on its own.\n\nSubscribe to our daily Post Opinion newsletter!\n\nPlease provide a valid email address.\n\nBy clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy .\n\nNever miss a story.\n\nTrump is a new factor in this equation.\n\nThe most recent example was the executive order late last week saying that federal funding would be withdrawn from educational institutions that permit males to compete in women's sports .\n\nThe NCAA instantly changed its policy to say that only athletes who were female at birth can compete against females.\n\nTrump's anti-DEI executive order will have similar effects at least among federal contractors, and perhaps more broadly.\n\nDaniel Patrick Moynihan once said, \"The central conservative truth is that it is culture, not politics, that determines the success of a society. The central liberal truth is that politics can change a culture and save it from itself.\"\n\nTrump is borrowing from the liberal truth in this moment of cultural insanity.\n\nIn part, his executive actions represent a case of what's good for the goose is good for the gander.\n\nIf Barack Obama could use the threat of a cutoff of federal funds to impose star-chamber procedures on campuses in sexual assault cases, there's no reason Trump can't use the same tool for more rational ends.\n\nNaturally, everything Trump has done will be subject to litigation, and liberal institutions will do all they can to skirt his executive orders.\n\nThere may, as happened the first time around, be a backlash against him that stokes cultural radicalism.\n\nSo far, no such reaction is in evidence, though. Mainstream institutions, like Meta, are treating Trump's return to power as a permission slip to escape the chains of their woke captivity.\n\nIt helps that on DEI and trans ideology, Trump is offering the recovery of a normality that is much more popular than the alternative.\n\nHowever it turns out, the feeling of conservative impotence in the culture war is, for now, a thing of the past.\n\nTwitter: @RichLowry"

      "text": "Wokeness is in retreat, but Nasdaq's 'diversity rules' show its awful stench will be hard to eliminate\n\nWokeness is in retreat, but its stench will be hard to eliminate.\n\nConsider the curious case of the bone-headed \"Nasdaq diversity rules\" - edicts by the stock market giant to force every company that \"lists\" there to choose a board of directors that stresses intersectionality - racial, sexual and gender diversity - as opposed to competence.\n\nSure, diversity is a worthy goal, but demanding outcomes in hiring through practices such as Diversity Equity and Inclusion is the most counterproductive way to run a business that woke mankind ever thought of. Forcing it on corporate boards as Nasdaq has been doing since 2020 is particularly scary. And now it's illegal.\n\nBoards perform a vital function of oversight of public companies, and the C-suite. Making sure the CEO isn't robbing the place blind is what the law - established through the Depression-era Securities and Exchange Act - ­demands from directors.\n\nNasdaq turned decades of corporate law on its head at the height of the so-called social justice movement. It came at a particular hysterical time in American history, when the left tried to convince the country it was inherently racist because of the police killing of an ex-con named George Floyd as he was resisting ­arrest.\n\nThat was then. These days, sanity is returning and woke is in retreat. Courts are ruling that DEI is illegal.\n\nThe Fifth Circuit federal court did just that, telling Nasdaq it will have to end the insanity.\n\nYes, the ruling is a sign wokeness is dying. But it's not quite dead. The rules will likely find an afterlife because of a quirk in the disclosure system, and the way the securities regulators might interpret the court finding, The Post has learned.\n\nReminder: Nasdaq, like its main competitor, the New York Stock Exchange, is a stock market; it wasn't created to serve as a lefty NGO. One of its functions is to make sure people can buy and sell shares,  in an ­orderly fashion, of the companies that \"list\" to trade there.  Another is to ensure that listed companies ­follow basic corporate-governance rules that protect investors, including hiring competent directors.\n\nUnder CEO Adena Friedman, Nasdaq joined the social justice movement that was all the rage in 2020. She demanded that listed companies stock their board with directors who were not the target of progressive ire during that eerie time, aka straight white men.\n\n\"Each Company, except as described below in, must have or explain why it does not have, at least two members of its board of directors who are Diverse, including at least one Diverse director who self-identifies as Female; and at least one Diverse director who self-identifies as an Underrepresented Minority or LGBTQ+,\" the Friedman-led Nasdaq said in its edict.\n\nAs I point out in my book on progressivism run amok, \"Go Woke Go Broke; The Inside Story of the Radicalization of Corporate America,\" the idiocy of this rule isn't confined to the very real fact that it's illegal by any fair reading of the securities laws or various civil rights acts.\n\nThere are also very real studies with control groups, margins of error, etc., that show that there's no link between performance and ­diversity.\n\nPlus, this rule doesn't apply to all those Chinese companies that Nasdaq lusts for to pay its listing fees.\n\nCompanies hailing from one of the world's most oppressive regimes - that are literally controlled by the repressive Chinese Communist Party - get a free pass. No members of the persecuted Uyghur minority need apply, according to Friedman & Co.\n\nChinese listings can get away with placing a couple of women from the CCP to be directors.\n\nNasdaq has argued to me the rules weren't totally mandatory - though it always reserves the right to reject a listing. It also stressed that the rules were about disclosure, which sounds quaint until you realize that companies are supposed to disclose stuff investors care about like earnings, not their social justice preening.\n\nOn top of that, the disclosure part had an interesting compulsory element. A company board's diversity data, listed in its public disclosure filings, could be easily downloaded on the SEC's website known as ­EDGAR. This enabled powerful social activist groups with ties to the lefties who run the Biden White House - the Human Rights Campaign, the Center for American Progress - to jump into the debate and pressure companies to up their diversity game as a de facto woke enforcement staff of the Nasdaq.\n\nThen something brilliant happened. Someone sued. Not Nasdaq, but its regulator, the equally woke Securities and Exchange Commission, which approved the measure. The lawsuit argued that stock markets weren't created as political tools of the left. A federal court agreed.\n\nCase closed, right? Not quite. The mandates could live on in a perverse way because of  the disclosure system that each public company must comply with.\n\nThe way the people at the Nasdaq explained it to me, the rules were legal until the courts ruled they weren't. That means the EDGAR system likely continues to keep a record of thousands of companies that compiled the useless and illegal data the Nasdaq asked for, they tell me, even after the Nasdaq is supposed to vacate the mandates in early February.\n\nThey could be around well into perpetuity for the likes of the Human Rights Campaign to enforce their brand of social justice,  securities lawyers I speak to say.\n\nAs one corporate lawyer told me: \"Just think how dumb it was to have a stock exchange telling companies what slots you have to fill while giving the Chinese a pass. Then they will just sit there, which is even dumber.\""

Gavin Newsom, once the wokest of the woke, has now  . . .  woken up .\n\nNewsom has started a new podcast in a blatant effort to grab a bigger megaphone ahead of his 2028 run at the White House.\n\nOne of his debut guests: right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk, a Trumpist par excellence.\n\nTo whom Newsom admitted that \"it's deeply unfair\" for biological men to compete with women in sports and that \"We [i.e. Democrats] are losing . . . We're toast.\"\n\nFor anyone who's followed Newsom's career, this admission sure seems like a sea-change: He has long been among the loudest and most active fighters for woke policies on gender, crime and everything else.\n\nBut now he's finally heard the message from voters on these issues, and he's seems to be listening.\n\nYes, he's only doing it because he figures it will help him win in '28, and it took a historically awful wildfire torching his political capital to prompt a change.\n\nBut he gets it; this is progress.

      "text": "A short history of the Woke Right\n\nThis column will be boring to read. You know I try. I really do, but there is no other way. This week I write about antisemitism . There is so much of it about, and so much is said about it, that by now, you must as be bored with it as I am. But it is because there is so much of it that we must rouse our interest yet again. I'll be quick. I don't wish to bore you, but it's interesting.\n\nSome people say we are witnessing the New Antisemitism, an infusion of Islamist zeal into the radical Left. The alignment suggests a certain novelty, but I must report that the New Antisemitism is pretty much like the Old, only with extra diversity, which is the conformity of our age. If the New Antisemitism feels new, it is because, since 1945, it was considered vulgar, at least in the Western liberal societies, to say that Jews are poisoning the wells, rigging the financial system, and sacrificing children, so they must be purged from society.\n\nThese stupidities can now be asserted without sanction or ridicule, providing \"Israelis\" and \"Zionists\" are substituted for \"Jews.\" Again, this is not new. It is how the Soviets talked. It is how the Arab League, the Muslim Brotherhood, and the Khomeinists of Iran still talk. It is how the Nation of Islam has always talked and how the Western Left has talked since 1967. It is how Americans have been taught to talk by the universities since then. The American exception is that the professors fooled the parents into paying for the corruption of their children. A novelty, after all.\n\nThe least novel variety, the Old Antisemitism, was marginal for decades after 1945. The Christian churches repented for a millennium of incitement. The Old Right lost its grip on the Republican Party when William F. Buckley Jr. excluded the Jew-haters from National Review . The racists of the backwoods Right were antielitist, semiliterate, and on a budget: three reasons not to send your children to study with Edward Said and Noam Chomsky. Yet now the Old Antisemitism is back, speaking the novel language of the New.\n\nThe Old Antisemitism's political revival on the Right began in 1992 when Pat Buchanan, who denied the motives, means, and scope of the Shoah, launched the first of his two candidacies for the Republican presidential nomination. It received a further boost after 9/11, when the Buchananites, notably at the American Conservative , advanced the New Left's line that American Jews were working for Israel's Likud party and were the puppeteers of America's Middle Eastern wars. The economic crises of the Great Recession of 2008 and the COVID-19 panic created further resentments to exploit on the Right by using the Left's analysis, and the internet offered a new means of distribution. But it was the Left's campaign of identity politics that brought antisemitism into the American mainstream.\n\n\"You taught me language,\" Caliban tells Prospero in The Tempest . \"My profit on't is, I know how to curse.\" Buchanan, as the first Republican candidate to rebel against identity politics, was the first Republican candidate to seek the electoral profits of its curse. He wanted to restore Christianity to the town square after the New Left's campaign of desacralization. But his strategy, racializing the resentments of the white majority in the name of Christian ethics, was little more than the New Left in whiteface.\n\nThere is something of King Lear in Buchanan. Instead of reversing a decline, he hastened it. His fire and brimstone scorched his enemies in the Republican Party, but the Buchanan apocalypse made the Democrats look reasonable. The Left pushed identity politics further into the institutions and pushed Christianity further out of public life. After 2008, the Woke Left cursed America and taught that race was everything. And now the identitarians of the \"Woke Right\" are also cursing America, and especially the Jews, in the name of whiteness and Christianity, and in the name of their left-wing enemies.\n\nAMERICAN INTERESTS IN UKRAINE\n\nBuchanan's story is pathetic in both the small and tragic senses. It is not boring. It is intriguing. The issues that tormented and enraged him - the decline of Christianity and public morals, free trade and demographic shifts, George H.W. Bush's tax policies - had nothing to do with the Jews. Yet to Buchanan, all of it somehow had everything to do with the Jews. Since then, Buchanan's rage has curdled into the Woke Right's impassioned loathing of America and dumb fantasies about Israel.\n\nThe motives and rewards of this kind of thinking lie in the mind and the passions. That is why the logic of its rationalization is always false - and why the appeal to reason usually fails. But a liberal society cannot function unless reason manages the passions. If the second Trump administration is to succeed in unmaking the state that identity politics built, it must disown the identitarians, antisemites, and race fantasists of the Right, too. This is essential if Americans are to remain free and equal under God and law.\n\nDominic Green is a Washington Examiner columnist and a fellow of the Royal Historical Society.

      "text": "Woke? I don't know the meaning of the word!\n\nPresident Donald Trump is back at the White House , so politics are back at awards shows. Accepting an award for \"global impact\" at the Grammys over the weekend, singer Alicia Keys alluded to the president's executive order banning diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in the federal government.\n\n\"This is not the time to shut down the diversity of voices,\" she said. \"We've seen, on this stage, talented, hardworking people, from different backgrounds, with different points of view, and it changes the game. DEI is not a threat. It's a gift. And the more voices, the more powerful the sound.\"\n\nCelebrities are busy these days playing defense for DEI and anything conservatives might call \"woke.\"\n\nIn response to the news that Netflix is producing a \"fresh take\" on the iconic Little House on the Prairie series, commentator Megyn Kelly said what many fans of the 1970s show were thinking: \"Netflix, if you woke-ify 'Little House on the Prairie' I will make it my singular mission to absolutely ruin your project.\"\n\nThat didn't go over well with little Laura Ingalls, or rather, the actress who once played her.\n\n\"Ummm...watch the original again,\" an indignant Melissa Gilbert posted. \"TV doesn't get too much more 'woke' than we did. We tackled: racism, addiction, nativism, antisemitism, misogyny, rape, spousal abuse and every other 'woke ' topic you can think of. Thank you very much.\"\n\nKeys and Gilbert may play dumb, but people are wising up to the fact that movements such as DEI aren't as innocent as they sound. And even some Democratic politicians agree.\n\nDEI efforts go \"off the beam, to my mind, when they imply that racism, bigotry, and settler colonialism is the unique purview of white people,\" Rep. Adam Smith (D-WA) recently told the New Yorker . \"You don't need to imply that all white people are racists and that all white people are oppressors.\"\n\nMajor corporations such as Google and Target are turning their backs on DEI, and it's not because they suddenly support racism and misogyny. They're just responding to the market, as picking employees and vendors based on race, gender, and sexuality just doesn't have the cachet it held in 2020 at the height of the Black Lives Matter movement. Today, it frankly sounds discriminatory.\n\nAnd what about \"wokeness\"? Did tackling difficult subjects really put Little House on the Prairie on par with what we would call \"woke\" today, say, a Netflix show that teaches preschoolers to come out as nonbinary? (Yes, that's real.) In case you couldn't tell, the answer is no. Wrestling with the darkness of the human condition and giving viewers something to aspire to really has nothing to do with the type of values progressivism pushes today, from \"trans rights\" to \"abortion rights\" to apologizing for living on stolen land.\n\nSorry, ladies, but the jig is up. The \"it's called being a decent human being\" defense for wokeness and its corollaries is over. We know that what's hiding underneath these buzzwords has nothing to do with human decency and everything to do with the control of language and politics. DEI is about domination, exertion of power, and influence. At least in this instance, it's time we take a cue from Kelly and make it clear that we're not playing along."

      "text": "We are living through a vertiginous anti-woke revolution\n\nThis must have been what it was like to live through the French or Russian revolutions. Our old assumptions are crumbling. The hierarchies, doctrines, and habits we held up as praiseworthy a few months ago are suddenly detestable.\n\nThe speed of the vibe shift has been vertiginous. Affirmative action in universities has been ruled unconstitutional. What seemed like the irresistible march of diversity, equity, and inclusion has turned into a full-scale rout. Almost every major company that had invested in DEI programs is now scaling back, including Ford, Walmart, Molson Coors, Harley-Davidson, and Toyota.\n\nWhat changed? The short answer is the 2024 presidential election , which pitted a candidate who was herself a product and a champion of identity politics, someone who used the word \"Latinx\" without irony, against a man who sold himself as the instrument of vengeance against the whole racket.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's victory at the polls catalyzed an immediate change - not just in the mood but, as his executive orders began to flood out, in the law. There were only two genders ! English was the country's official language! Anti-Christian bias was illegal! We can argue about how many of these matters were within the competence of the federal government, but we can't argue about their secondary effects, as state and local authorities, nongovernmental organizations, and corporations rushed to adjust their behavior.\n\nMight things look different had the Democrats found a more credible candidate and edged the result? Yes and no. Trump's superpower is his immunity to criticism. He may be thin-skinned, but he has a unique ability not to be deterred by censure. In that sense, he was the perfect tool to break open the DEI scam.\n\nThen again, elections don't happen in a vacuum. A backlash was already gathering force as identity politics overreached. Twenty years ago, it was recognized that racial slurs were unpleasant, but no one suggested that they be expunged from old novels. Ten years ago, sacralization was underway. The words were now treated as magic spells that could not be printed. By five years ago, a professor of Chinese in California could be suspended for using a Mandarin phrase that sounded a little bit like the N-word.\n\nSomething similar happened over gender. We went from wanting the sexes to be treated equally to claiming that even the differences that led to men and women playing separate sports were social constructs. There comes a point when ideas become too silly for even the most fashion-conscious people.\n\nThe backlash is global. In Britain, a gender-critical professor, Kathleen Stock, was hounded out of her job at Sussex University. Now, her former employer has been fined nearly $1 million for failing to defend free speech.\n\nIn 2020, the future prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer , was photographed taking the knee. That was the old, comfortable world, in which anything done by conservatives could be condemned as racist, and the Left glowed with self-righteousness. Now, Starmer is scrambling around to find an overseas destination to take illegal immigrants, and it is suddenly OK to ask whether his predecessor, Rishi Sunak, was \"really English.\"\n\nEuropean politicians who were dismissed as a far-right fringe as recently as last year are advancing in Spain, Sweden, France, and Germany. As Viktor Orban , Hungary's strongman leader, told a Make Europe Great Again rally last month, \"Yesterday, we were the heretics. Now, we are the mainstream.\"\n\nConsider the Netflix series Adolescence . Announced as recently as March 2024, it observes the old pieties. A drama about the abuse of women in a northern English town ignores the rape gangs scandal, disregards the fact that knife crime is an almost exclusively black problem, and casts the killer as a white child from a stable two-parent family. That is what all dramas used to do. There was a convention that bad guys had to be white (which, apart from anything else, made for very predictable stories.) Already, it feels dated.\n\nThe big change was not Trump's election victory but Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter, which ended the preference falsification that had made unpolitical people go along with extreme wokery .\n\nA SHORT HISTORY OF THE WOKE RIGHT\n\nThe problem is that the identity politics of the Left is being replaced by a conservative version, every bit as intolerant, unthinking, and collectivist. People are still categorized by group, but the good and bad guys are switched. Different words are banned. It's now fine to say manpower or midwife but not birthgiver or Latinx .\n\nThe old conservative ideal, that the government should do as little as possible, has been replaced with the notion that the state should be mobilized against people you dislike. Freedom, alas, remains as unpopular in this age as in every other."

      "text": "To understand the woke, you have to understand The Culture of Narcissism\n\nThe nature of the Left in 2022 is rooted more in psychology than political science. Specifically, liberalism is suffering from narcissism.\n\nTo understand how, it's essential to grasp the true meaning of narcissism. In its clinical definition, narcissism is not self-love - it's the opposite. The narcissist isn't full of ego. Rather, he has no real sense of self. Where the self would be is emptiness, which results in a mad effort to fill the psyche with meaning. Lacking a stable and confident sense of identity, the narcissist hunts for meaning in therapy, self-help, sex, or radical politics. None of these can give meaning to empty lives.\n\nNEWS JUNKIES: MARGARET SULLIVAN'S NEW MEMOIR AND THE MEDIA'S ADDICTION PROBLEM\n\nIn his seminal 1979 work The Culture of Narcissism , the brilliant social scientist Christopher Lasch argued that the human personality, its psychology itself, had changed over the course of the later 20th century. Americans had transformed from strong and well-adjusted people to those evincing a \"minimal\" self - a personality that is weak and dependent on government, corporations, radical politics, sex, and bureaucracies for a sense of meaning.\n\nA central idea in Lasch's analysis, and something that is key to understanding the new woke generation, is how infants develop. Citing Sigmund Freud, Lasch argued that to an infant, interactions with the world result in feelings of either omnipotence or helplessness. In their fantasy world, a toddler is either the king of the world, demanding their needs get met right now, or is totally helpless and dependent on parents for survival. It represents two extremes that need to be evened out.\n\nTo do so, it is vital that parents, community, and what Lasch called \"transitional objects,\" including toys, games, siblings, and pets, introduce limits to the world of the child. These objects shrink the scale of fantasies, introduce reality, and allow a healthy transition into adulthood. In the later 20th century, the raising of the child went to television, the helping professions, schools, and bureaucracies. Lasch expert George Scialabba once summarized the process this way:\n\nFormerly, the presence of potent but fallible individuals, economically self-sufficient, with final legal and moral authority over their children's upbringing, provided one kind of template for the growing child's psychic development. As fathers (and increasingly mothers) become employees, with the family's economic survival dependent on remote, abstract corporate authorities, and as care-taking parents were increasingly supervised or replaced by educational, medical, and social-welfare bureaucracies, the template changed. The child now has no human-size authority figures in the immediate environment against which to measure itself and so reduce its fantasies to human scale. As a result, it continues to alternate between fantasies of omnipotence and helplessness. This makes acceptance of limits, finitude, and death more difficult, which in turn makes commitment and perseverance of any kind - civic, artistic, sexual, parental - more difficult.The result is narcissism. Lasch described it this way: Having surrendered most of his technical skills to the corporation, [the contemporary American] can no longer provide for his material needs. As the family loses not only its productive functions but many of its reproductive functions as well, men and women no longer manage even to raise their children without the help of certified experts. The atrophy of older traditions of self-help has eroded everyday competence, in one area after another, and has made the individual dependent on the state, the corporation, and other bureaucracies.When one observes the behavior of the new modern woke, Lasch's words are stunningly prescient. The college kids literally screaming like toddlers when faced with a speaker they don't like, the transgender people asserting that their truth is all that matters, the you-go-girl amateur psychologists helping mentally wobbly people to demand respect even if they haven't earned it. This is the world The Culture of Narcissism predicted. These aren't the old communists with their \"dialectical materialism\" and pseudoscience about the tectonic plates of evolutionary social change. These are babies with no secure sense of self throwing tantrums. A comment on a YouTube video I recently came across is very telling. The clip shows some colorful teenage dancers in a 1980s club from 40 years ago. Being in college at the time, I was actually scanning YouTube looking for my old self. Yet what caught my eye was a comment below the video, a remark left by what I assume was a younger viewer: \"They all look so confident.\"\n\nThe woke are not egotistical, assertive activists. They are those without a self, without history, and without confidence. More than 40 years after the publication of The Culture of Narcissism , Lasch's screaming tyke is running the culture.\n\nMark Judge is an award-winning journalist and the author of the book The Devil's Triangle: Mark Judge vs. the New American Stasi.

      "text": "The war on woke isn't won\n\nIn his first months in office, President Donald Trump has begun to defang the diversity, equity, and inclusion industry. You know, the harmful grift that discriminates against people who happen to be white on the pretext of remedying the effects of past discrimination against people who mostly died generations ago.\n\nUnder former President Joe Biden, spending by the Education Department on DEI programs topped $1 billion, another $100 million at the Justice Department, $80 million at the Defense Department, and $14 million at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Federal agencies are still tallying the savings from firing employees, curbing grants and contracts, and canceling DEI indoctrination sessions for their employees.\n\nSlashing federal spending on the DEI sham is a strong start, but the war on woke isn't over. Dr. Ibram X. Kendi's scandal-plagued Center for Anti-Racist Research has shut down, but Kendi now has a new sinecure at Howard University. Corporations from Walmart and Target to BlackRock seem to be swearing off DEI, but some so-called corporate conversions, such as Disney's, look more semantic than substantial. As the applause for woke speakers at this year's Grammy Awards showed, the entertainment industry and cultural institutions will be the last redoubts of DEI.\n\nTake the publishing industry, for example. Penguin Random House, America's biggest seller of children's books, went all-in on DEI themes in 2022 under former CEO Madeline McIntosh and continues on this path under current CEO Nihar Malaviya . This wasn't DEI-prompted altruism. It was big business. Public school libraries spend approximately $500 million a year on print books. Factor in e-books and other media, and the total climbs to nearly $750 million. Public libraries, the majority of which embrace the DEI ideology, spend another $65 million annually on print materials.\n\nSome children's book experts, such as Wall Street Journal reviewer Meghan Cox Gurdon, are optimistic that the tide has begun to turn , but there are three reasons why it won't be easy for publishers to kick their DEI addiction.\n\nPublishing has a long pipeline between acquiring a manuscript and getting a book on the shelves. It takes a year or more for publishers to recoup sunk costs for an author's advance, printing, marketing, and shipping. To avoid losses, publishers such as PRH were locked into decisions made long before Biden's disastrous debate with Trump, when many fervently believed Biden would win a second term and the DEI bandwagon would roll on. As Puff Daddy put it, it's all about the Benjamins, baby!\n\nThe second is a workforce problem. Remember when agitated junior employees walked out in protest until publishers canceled books by conservative or controversial authors? Many of those employees have advanced in seniority and risen in the ranks. These true believers are committed to the DEI stamp of approval on the books they've been bringing out and the authors they've been promoting.\n\nThe third problem is the industry ecosystem, especially writers' organizations and professional publications. The Authors Guild, for example, passed an \"Anti-Racism Resolution\" in 2020 declaiming the \"history and practice of racism in the publishing industry.\"\n\nThe Authors Guild is the country's oldest association for writers. Traditionally, it advocates copyright matters, industry practices, freelancers' rights, and other professional concerns. Its 15,000 active members weren't consulted when it formed a DEI committee and hired a consultant to \"promote voices of Black authors and other authors of color\" and promulgate antiracism policies. That's because the New York-based guild isn't a democracy. A small coterie of insiders committed the guild to DEI preferential treatment for some races over others.\n\nThe guild's president is W. Ralph Eubanks, a talented writer and professor whose focus is race. In an essay first published in Southern Review in 2016 and republished in November 2024 in Literary Hub, Eubanks described the \"conspicuous psychic damage I saw on my students' faces\" after Trump's election. He says \"teaching literature is my tool of activism.\"\n\nUnder his leadership, the Authors Guild is now teaming up with Penguin Random House and the NAACP in lawsuits to overturn school policies and state laws that give parents a veto over the educational materials their children are exposed to in the classroom.\n\nPoets & Writers is the largest nonprofit literary organization in the country. Its magazine, Poets & Writers, is a valuable resource for writers' workshops, master's programs, conferences, and finding literary agents. As recently as 2009, giants of the canon, including Ernest Hemingway, graced the magazine's covers.\n\nDon't expect it to feature \"old white guys\" such as Hemingway today. Poets & Writers is now \"committed to becoming an antiracist organization.\" Its board president is none other than McIntosh, the former CEO of Penguin Random House.\n\nSo, forget the triumphalism. Woke won't die, to borrow Gov. Ron DeSantis's (R-FL) phrase, until people demonstrate that we can't be forced to conform to a racist ideology that seeks to divide the country instead of uniting it.\n\nJohn B.

      "text": "When the woke begin to hate\n\nOn the surface, the wave of anti-Israel protests washing over college campuses across the country looks a lot like left-wing student activism dating back to at least the Vietnam War. Protesters chant radical, often rhyming, slogans accusing American and other Western governments of crimes against humanity with little to no scrutiny of the other side's record on human rights.\n\nThinly connected, if not wholly unrelated, social causes are championed as part of the Rainbow Coalition model of progressive politics. (One placard that went viral on social media lists eliminating tuition at New York 's public universities among its demands alongside a ceasefire in Gaza .) Classroom activity and other parts of campus life are frequently disrupted as overwhelmingly liberal administrators and faculty look on in horror, often unsure of what to do.\n\nA closer look reveals some important differences, however. While the demonstrations are more anti-Israeli than they are pro-Palestinian, often virulently so, many of the targets of its hostility are here at home. Jewish students report harassment and feeling unsafe on campuses where the loudest of these protests have taken hold. At Columbia University, ground zero for the latest conflagration, students have said invective and even liquids were hurled at them for the simple act of wearing a Jewish star. Colleges are creating antisemitism task forces and are under pressure from national political leaders to do more to protect their Jewish students.\n\nSince the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas last year, much has been written and said about what Israel should or should not do in Gaza. There has been at least as much commentary on what U.S. foreign policy in this area should be. Since the college protests have become widespread and police have begun to disperse the most disruptive among them, a great deal of ink and pixels have been devoted to questions of free speech and public order.\n\nConsiderably less attention has been focused on the question of why college campuses should need so many antisemitism task forces in the first place or why top university presidents so carefully parsed their denunciations - when their responses could even be so described - of textbook antisemitic statements. These institutions are awash in anti-racism, sensitivity training, hate speech codes, diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, and calls for tolerance and mutual understanding. Their students are marinated in readings, lectures, and group sessions teaching them to banish impure thoughts about race and ethnicity, yet many of these activists are quick to resort to the basest barroom racial, ethnic, and religious taunts.\n\nThese are not small \"right-wing\" Bible colleges where Jewish students report feeling it is not safe to attend class or where antisemitic incidents and speech are being alleged. The encampments are not found at Bob Jones University, with its recent history of prohibitions on interracial dating. They are instead some of the most influential and most progressive institutions of higher learning in the country.\n\nShouldn't these academic institutions and their young students have acquired antibodies against antisemitism or racially, religiously, and ethnically charged speech or conduct of any kind? Instead, reported antisemitic incidents are not only on the rise but are too often given the benefit of the doubt, explained away, or even defended outright in ways that would be unthinkable in other contexts. People who might be inclined to believe Jussie Smollett are deeply skeptical of Jewish students' claims of mistreatment by the anti-Israel protesters.\n\nThe bigotry masquerading as equity has exposed major defects in the type of anti-racism being taught at elite universities and increasingly worming its way through corporate human resource departments and other institutions both public and private, with applications far removed from Israel and Hamas.\n\nTreating people more as members of groups than individuals ( White Fragility author Robin DiAngelo specifically presents \"the precious ideology of individualism, the idea that every one of us is unique and special\" as an obstacle to fighting, or even talking about, racism), generalizing broadly, neatly separating the world into victims and oppressors, and teaching a secularized version of original sin without hope of redemption, the popularized versions of anti-racism can often sound quite racist.\n\nRacism itself has been redefined. In common usage, it is a term for racial hatred and prejudice. But the progressive definition favored in academia says that true racism must be prejudice plus power. This means that anyone categorized as powerless or who purports to speak for them can hold or express illiberal, even vicious, racial views without qualifying as racist. And by that standard, crude racial stereotyping by or on behalf of the oppressed isn't racism. It can actually be anti-racism. Expressions of racial prejudice may not be racist not because the person expressing them isn't being hateful enough but because he or she is not powerful enough.\n\nThere are a few obvious problems with this conception of racism. To begin with, the use of racial and ethnic slurs, race-based harassment, burning crosses on a lawn, spray-painting swastikas on buildings, lynchings, and most of what might be considered hate speech or hate crimes do not necessarily require political or institutional power to commit. It takes physical, not systemic, power to throw a brick through a window.\n\nThe Ku Klux Klan has held political and institutional power in the United States within the lifetimes of some who are still living today. But the white supremacist hate group has not wielded such influence in decades. This does not make, and has in fact not made, it any less racist. Nor is institutional and political power static: Other groups espousing racial or ethnic hatreds may have more of it in 2024 than the klan does.\n\nWhen a wave of hate crimes against Asian Americans occurred during the pandemic, much of the press covered it as largely a white supremacist phenomenon. \"Asian Americans did not face distinct peril but were targeted by the same forces of hate endured by Black Americans and that were evident in the insurrection against the US Capitol on January 6,\" a CNN analysis of an Atlanta spa shooting paraphrased one activist as arguing at the time. The activist was later quoted directly: \"While the focus is on anti-Asian hate, it all stems from white supremacy, and anyone can be a scapegoat at any moment. This is something that we need to face together and stand in solidarity.\"\n\nBut in other high-profile incidents, the assailants were black. An oft-cited report that found most hate crimes against Asian Americans were committed by white people also concluded that \"hate crimes against Asian Americans are more likely than hate crimes against either African Americans or Hispanics to be committed by non-White offenders.\"\n\nPolicy analyst Diane Yap argued in City Journal that \"news stories covering black-on-Asian violence should not be attributed to disinformation or media bias.\" She wrote, \"Most violent attacks against individuals of a particular racial group are committed by other members of that group - except for Asians, where a plurality is committed by blacks.\"\n\nViolent attacks are no less contemptible based on the race of the perpetrator. That characteristic certainly does not make these incidents qualitatively better for the victim. The issue is that the prevailing narrative about racism in the academy cannot adequately account for conflicts involving multiple protected racial minority groups and has limited explanatory power for current examples of racist violence in our society.\n\nOr examples from recent history, for that matter. Actress Whoopi Goldberg stirred controversy on The View in 2022 when she denied the racism component of the Holocaust, suggesting the mass slaughter of Jews by the Nazis was a form of white-on-white violence. \"Let's be truthful about it because Holocaust isn't about race,\" she said. \"It's not about race. It's about man's inhumanity to man.\"\n\n\"But these are two white groups of people!\" Goldberg continued when pressed by a co-host. \"The minute you turn it into race, it goes down this alley. Let's talk about it for what it is. It's how people treat each other. It doesn't matter if you're black or white, Jews - it's each other.\"\n\nGoldberg apologized, but she didn't seem fully persuaded by her critics' reaction. \"I don't want to fake-apologize. ... You can't call this racism,\" Goldberg said on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert . \"I think of race as being something that I can see. How can you say it's about race when you're fighting each other?\"\n\n\"Being Jewish means watching white nationalists call for your death because you're 'not white' while ladies on national TV say the Holocaust was 'white people killing white people ... y'all go fight amongst yourselves,'\" Israeli writer Hen Mazzig posted.\n\nThe View co-host was at least not disputing that what happened to Jews under Adolf Hitler was an atrocity. But if your definition of racism doesn't readily include the Holocaust or Nazi Germany, it has some serious flaws. The Third Reich would also clearly qualify as structural and systemic racism.\n\nDenying evident facts about individual manifestations of bigotry is necessary to redefine racism as an exclusively societal ill. \"In the DiAngelo doctrine, the issue was not individual racists doing singular bad acts,\" writes Nellie Bowles in the forthcoming book Morning after the Revolution: Dispatches from the Wrong Side of History , as excerpted by the Atlantic . \"All white people are racist, because racism is structural.\"\n\nOne could accept the classical definition of racism as an ideology of racial bias and bigotry without denying racism can and often does have major societal ramifications. This definition does, however, become difficult to square with unqualified pronouncements about how \"all white people are.\"\n\nMuch like progressive exhortations against confusing climate and weather, which are inevitably followed by citations of specific weather events in support of progressive climate policy objectives, individual acts that might fit the classical definition of racism are primarily to be viewed as illustrations of the larger structural problem, if committed by the correct people or groups.\n\nThere is an inherent risk of trivializing genuine expressions and acts of racial hatred when the term \"racism\" is used in the service of a political ideology not shared by a majority of people. It cannot escape notice that under the progressive definition, non-progressive things are generally racist and progressive things are generally not. This might seem to a great many people to be self-serving in an era of extreme political polarization, an observation that might not lead them to \"anti-racist\" conclusions.\n\nIf the word \"racist\" is simply a cudgel to help Democrats win elections, certain academics secure tenure, and DiAngelo, who is white, and Ibram X. Kendi receive money from Coca-Cola and other huge companies with cash to spare, it may start to seem absurd. But the entire point of the \"woke\" exercise is supposedly to raise awareness of one's daily contributions to bigotry and injustice. Instead, it is obscuring these things for some and mainstreaming them for others. If you have the right politics or belong to the right group, you're off the hook.\n\nThis is what leads us back to the present situation of viewing the tragic and intractable problems of the Middle East through the fun-house mirror of American progressive racial politics. Neither the history of the Jewish people nor the Jewish state fits comfortably within the intersectionality framework. When faced with a conflict between two groups with plausible claims of victimhood, both minorities in the U.S., the whole system short-circuits and malfunctions badly.\n\nIf David Duke told New York-born Jews attending American universities to \"go back to Poland,\" it would be instantly recognized for what it is. That's a relatively easy call. If the encampments were teeming with tiki torch-wielding white nationalists, most progressives would pick up on anti-Jewish sentiment even if it were scantily clad in language about Zionism. Yet a \" black queer \" at Columbia can, unlike a certified Charlottesville thug, disguise himself at least for a while as a Palestinian ally while ranting about killing \"Zionists\" before the obvious course correction is made.\n\nAn ostensibly anti-racist ideology is blinding people to the similarities between the slogans they shout and \"the Jews will not replace us\" while letting those who do appreciate the resemblance hide in plain sight. I have no doubt that there are students who hear \"from the river to the sea, Palestine is Arab\" and its more popular variant \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free\" through secular Western liberal ears as a call for a one-state multicultural paradise. If they envision Hamas-controlled territory as a place where Queers for Palestine and drag queens can flourish, or at least no worse than a U.S. state with a Republican governor, then they are primed to believe anything.\n\nHamas's intentions toward Jews are not so benign, which is why the rhetoric of genocidal organizations has no place in the messaging of a putatively anti-genocide campaign. Rejecting Hamas talking points does not require indifference to Palestinian suffering. Yet the problem is not just the naivete of youth or the historical illiteracy of daytime television loudmouths. Some of the most sophisticated progressives teaching on these subjects see Israel, indeed virtually the entire Western experience, as a settler-colonizer dynamic.\n\n\"Although the expression of this worldview isn't limited to college campuses, those campuses are the main reason we are now witnessing three Charlottesvilles a day,\" wrote Seth Mandel, my predecessor at this magazine, in Commentary . \"After all, it means students are paying attention in class.\"\n\nThe writer Najma Sharif put it another way in a social media post shared by a Washington Post foreign affairs columnist, among thousands of others: \"What did y'all think decolonization meant? vibes? papers? essays? losers.\" Note: \"Decolonization\" advocates don't want to stop with Israel.\n\nIt is not even clear that this approach to anti-racism has succeeded on its own terms: curbing white racism. While the hardcore alt-right retreated after Charlottesville, its growth coincided with critical race theory's escape from the faculty lounge. Workshops in which people struggle with their \"whiteness\" provide, however unintentionally, perfect fodder. Sentiments about communities of color that were becoming increasingly marginal in the decades following the civil rights movement are now fairly common on mainstream social media websites.\n\nTo note that a certain flavor of racial progressivism has been counterproductive or fanned the flames of extremism isn't to say that these collegiate critiques of racism are wrong in every particular. But we are witnessing a departure from the arguments that carried the day for civil rights a generation ago, forming a more perfect union consistent with the country's founding principles and highest ideals.\n\nThe sharp illiberal turn in the discourse over Israel should be a bright, flashing warning signal that people who claim to oppose tribalism in principle are not always immune to its excesses in practice. Let's hope we pay attention.\n\nW. James Antle III is executive editor of the Washington Examiner magazine."

      "text": "Reviewed: The Origins of Woke by Richard Hanania\n\nL ast month, the online trial of Richard Hanania provided an odd lesson in the politics of cancellation. The prominent commentator and academic had, the Huffington Post revealed, made disturbingly racist and sexist comments in the years around 2010, writing for far-right websites under a pseudonym. Hanania soon posted a well-written blog entry about how his views had evolved in a classical-liberal direction and survived the scandal. Then he bragged about how the affair had boosted his forthcoming book 's presales.\n\nThat book, The Origins of Woke - an argument for weakening civil rights law - indeed is being published as planned by Broadside, a conservative imprint of HarperCollins . How this happened without any outward signs of revolt from, well, woke staffers at the company is anyone's guess.\n\nBIDEN CONCEDES TO DONORS 'A LOT OF PEOPLE' ARE 'FOCUSED ON MY AGE'\n\nUltimately, the tome is an interesting and mostly sober take on long-debated civil rights topics from one of the Right's most frustrating figures, someone who can go from highly insightful commentary to dog whistle trolling at the drop of a hat, and still find time to defend the legacy media as \"honest and good.\"\n\nHanania's project is to connect the civil rights debates of decades past to the modern phenomenon of wokeness. Indeed, from some of the more strident comments Hanania makes early in the book, one would think he's arguing that civil rights laws are the sole root of all that is woke.\n\nBut the aggressive version of the argument is limited in numerous ways (some of which Hanania himself notes), and the book is best seen as a useful but partial explanation of recent phenomena. The public rise of wokeness happened abruptly, concentrated among college students and recent graduates. It's tricky to explain an abrupt change with policies that have been in effect for decades - and the lefty kids who started it all were certainly not bureaucrats or employers trying to comply with civil rights laws. Younger generations' heavy use of social media and academia's promotion of jargon-laden left-wing ideologies (the history of which my Manhattan Institute colleague Christopher F. Rufo explains in his own exploration of wokeness, America's Cultural Revolution ) factor heavily in the overnight explosion of incessant \"systemic racism\" talk and pronouns in email signatures.\n\nCivil rights law does connect with and explain, however, numerous other important aspects of wokeness, and fleshing out these connections is the key contribution of Hanania's book. Certain tenets of wokeness are already, in some form, U.S. law. Modern debates about how to handle our country's racial ills naturally mirror prior ones, with wokeness in large part comprising what once went by the names of \"political correctness,\" \"identity politics,\" \"equality of outcome\" (as opposed to equality of opportunity), and so on.\n\nAnd civil rights law helps to explain why \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" offices are so common everywhere from college campuses to huge for-profit corporations, with adult HR professionals pushing wokeness along with the purple-haired nonbinary 21-year-olds. As wokeness gripped colleges 10 or so years ago, many of us thought the students throwing temper tantrums upon encountering ideas they disagreed with were in for a wake-up call after graduation, but the phone never rang.\n\nAmerica's civil rights statutes are largely the result of compromises Congress reached in the 1960s and 1970s. These compromises, however, were quickly shifted leftward by executive actions and court rulings. Many readers will already be familiar with this history, but Hanania does an able job of documenting it. Hanania's account is impressively thorough, but a few policies in particular deserve mention.\n\nOne is the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which (among much else) broadly prohibited discrimination by private employers and within federally funded programs. It was primarily meant to end the racial caste system in the South, but its provisions expanded and warped over time through generous interpretive leaps by judges and bureaucrats.\n\nSupreme Court decisions from the 1970s particularly exemplify this pattern. For example, nothing in the act's text suggested that anti-white discrimination was exempt from the rules, but the court upheld both racial preferences in higher ed ( Bakke ) and a private sector hiring quota that had, in turn, been imposed to satisfy executive branch affirmative action requirements for government contractors ( Weber ).\n\nThe court also embraced the \"disparate impact\" doctrine ( Griggs ), which limits the hiring tools employers may use even if the tools were not selected with the intention of discriminating by race. If one racial group outperforms another on average, the burden then falls on the employer to demonstrate that the tool's use is consistent with \"business necessity,\" meaning that the test genuinely predicts job performance. This despite the 1964 Civil Rights Act's explicit language protecting professionally developed ability tests so long as they aren't \"designed, intended, or used\" to discriminate.\n\nIn practice, racial gaps are ubiquitous, and pretty much any test or qualification will admit applicants from different racial groups at different rates. Thus, it's easy to get past the first part of the test and require an accused employer to show business necessity. Hanania summarizes the process as \"everything is illegal and the government will decide which violations it goes after.\" One can certainly exaggerate the effects of disparate impact - in a recent survey of HR professionals by the Society for HR Management, more than half of employers reported using pre-hire tests of some kind - but it clearly makes the use of objective tests more expensive and risky.\n\nStatutes regarding sex and gender followed a similar trajectory. The 1964 Civil Rights Act covered sex discrimination in private employment; this concept gradually expanded, first to obvious wrongs such as bosses' demanding sexual favors from subordinates, and eventually to the amorphous concept of a \"hostile work environment\" that is \"severe and pervasive,\" with First Amendment-protected speech sometimes treated as evidence of such. Businesses naturally responded with zero tolerance policies toward, for example, edgy and inappropriate humor, homogenizing the workplace and restricting the options of those, male and female alike, who enjoy a more free-for-all environment in terms of speech among co-workers.\n\nMeanwhile, Title IX, enacted in 1972, banned sex discrimination in federally funded programs, with the executive branch given considerable leeway to set some of the rules. Title IX came to mean that colleges had to boost female sports participation, actively prevent peer-to-peer harassment, and even adjudicate sexual assault allegations in disciplinary proceedings using a low burden of proof (a policy that lately has ping-ponged as the presidency changes parties).\n\nThe upshot of all this is that, regardless of whether they're the one true root of wokeness, civil rights policies today are far broader than anything the public agreed to through their representatives in Congress. They go well beyond banning intentional discrimination and targeted harassment, and instead trample on free association and free speech in the name of creating more equal outcomes and taming workplaces and public institutions, while allowing intentional discrimination selectively, depending on the target.\n\nToward the book's end, Hanania offers his path forward. Some skeptics of anti-discrimination law - from Richard Epstein and Dinesh D'Souza in the 1990s to Christopher Caldwell in 2020's The Age of Entitlement - have toyed with the idea of outright repealing the core statutes, a fantasy that would require a consensus of the president and both houses of Congress, likely including a supermajority in the Senate to overcome a filibuster. Hanania proposes a more realistic and, for the vast majority of us who believe discrimination should indeed be illegal, more desirable solution: We could return to civil rights law's original compromises the same way we departed from them, through politically easier moves such as executive actions and court rulings.\n\nThe current Supreme Court is clearly the most promising avenue. Its Students for Fair Admissions decision this year effectively ends affirmative action in higher education. Affirmative action in government contracting would be an obvious next step. The court could also take a broader view of the First Amendment vis-a-vis hostile work environment claims. The executive branch, meanwhile, could eliminate the executive order underpinning racial preferences in federal contracting, rework Title IX rules, and scale back disparate impact in the federal government and federally funded programs.\n\nEnding disparate impact in private employment law is a different beast, though. The doctrine took hold with the incorrect Griggs ruling in 1971, but when the court later weakened the rule, Congress explicitly restored it in the Civil Rights Act of 1991. Hanania offers a parsing of the updated language in which it \"specifies details regarding the burden of proof in a disparate impact claim\" yet \"does not explicitly mandate that standard in the first place,\" which is too clever by at least half. It's hard to get around statutory text if one lacks the political power to rewrite the law itself.\n\nA different option Hanania proposes is for the Supreme Court to find disparate impact unconstitutional. The doctrine pressures liability-averse businesses to, in the late Antonin Scalia's words, \"evaluate the racial outcomes of their policies, and to make decisions based on ... those racial outcomes,\" in arguable violation of the equal protection clause. A fair counterargument, though, is that the doctrine merely requires businesses to show a good reason for policies that work to the disadvantage of some racial groups relative to others, and that this is, whatever its demerits as policy, at the very least not a violation of equal protection. It's not clear whether the more cautious conservative justices would take so aggressive a stance to undo a standard that the court itself endorsed 50 years ago and Congress has made the law for 30.\n\nAll told, Hanania has drawn attention to long-standing issues in civil rights law and connected them to the endlessly discussed topic of modern wokeness. Readers can decide for themselves, of course, what to make of his own history and his evolution since.\n\nRobert VerBruggen is a fellow at the Manhattan Institute."

      "text": "House passes anti-ESG legislation as GOP targets 'woke' policies\n\nHouse Republicans passed a tranche of legislation targeting ESG and \" woke \" financial and educational policies, a preview of actions the GOP could take next year if it takes control of both chambers and the presidency.\n\nESG, which is short for environmental , social, and governance, is a financial model that centers on compelling social change through investment and divestment. With ESG, investment managers seek not solely to maximize profits but incorporate other considerations into financial decisions, such as a company's greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nWhile ESG policies and ESG investing have been touted by some on the Left as an effective means to affect change on matters like climate change, Republicans have launched a full-fledged assault against it, branding such policies as \"woke\" and part of a culture war. They argue that companies and funds should be squarely focused on maximizing returns and not on pushing ESG or dabbling in social and environmental matters.\n\nThe Republican fight against ESG has been waged at both the state and national level. As part of a \"woke week,\" the House passed three measures this week.\n\nThe first bill, the Protecting Americans' Investments from Woke Policies Act, is a response to a Biden administration rulemaking. The Labor Department rule in question allowed, though does not require, fiduciaries to weigh ESG factors when making investment decisions for U.S. retirement accounts\n\nThe legislation, which was sponsored by Rep. Rick Allen (R-GA), passed the House in a 217-206 vote, with three Democrats joining all Republicans in passing it. The Democrats voting in favor were among those thought to be most vulnerable in the coming election: Jared Golden of Maine, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington, and Mary Peltola of Alaska.\n\n\"There is no room for ESG when considering how to invest Americans' lifesavings,\" the conservative Americans for Tax Reform said in a letter ahead of the vote. \"Retirement plan managers should only consider pecuniary factors when making investment decisions and voting proxies.\"\n\nIn a statement of administration policy released ahead of the vote, the White House said that it opposed the legislation, which would \"severely restrict the ability of fiduciaries of job-based retirement plans to make informed investments on behalf of plan participants and beneficiaries.\"\n\nThe second piece of legislation, dubbed the End Woke Higher Education Act, targets colleges and universities, which have increasingly been under the spotlight following the Hamas attack on Israel and subsequent protests that have rocked campuses across the country.\n\nThe legislation, which was introduced by Rep. Burgess Owens, passed the House in a 213-201 vote, with four Democrats joining Republicans.\n\nIt amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require that colleges and universities to \"put in place First Amendment principles\" in order to receive federal funding. It also bars accreditors from requiring \"partisan frameworks and ideological litmus tests\" for schools in order to receive accreditation.\n\n\"What is happening on college campuses and in classrooms goes against the values America was built on,\" House Majority Leader Steve Scalise's (R-LA) office said in a news release. \"House Republicans are fighting to ensure American students are able to freely express themselves and have the opportunity to allow their ideas to compete without repercussion.\"\n\nThe White House opposes the legislation and said its adoption would \"micromanage\" colleges and universities, \"undermining their ability to recognize and promote diversity.\"\n\n\"Today marks a major victory for academic freedom in higher education and a decisive blow to politicized accreditors who have worked to make the adoption of woke DEI agendas a condition for federal funding eligibility,\" Owens said.\n\nThe House also passed the Prioritizing Economic Growth Over Woke Policies Act, which was introduced by Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-MI). The bill passed in a 215-203 vote, with three Democrats voting with Republicans.\n\nThe legislation would limit corporate disclosures required by the Securities and Exchange Commission, as response to activists who have tried to require that companies provide disclosures related to climate and social goals. Conservatives have decried such efforts as social regulation via the financial system.\n\nThe bill also would prevent the SEC from forcing a publicly traded company to include a shareholder proposal or even the discussion of a proposal in a proxy statement.\n\n\"These misguided ESG efforts don't benefit our banking system or capital markets,\" Huizenga said Thursday on the House floor. \"They certainly don't help consumers, workers, job creators, everyday investors, or retirement savers.\"\n\nThe White House also opposes this legislation. The administration said that its passage would \"fundamentally limit the SEC's ability to fulfill its mission\" and \"would disempower stakeholders and investors.\"\n\nTaken together, the anti-ESG and anti-woke legislation shows that Republicans are prioritizing such matters in the lead up to the November elections. GOP state officials have also been pushing back on ESG.\n\nFor instance, in a cease-and-desist order from this year, Mississippi Secretary of State Michael Watson accused money manager BlackRock - a frequent target of anti-ESG ire - of making \"fraudulent statements, omissions, and other misrepresentations\" about its environmental, social, and governance strategies.\n\nWest Virginia Treasurer Riley Moore - who is now running for a seat in Congress - has banned several banks from state contracts over their ESG policies and \"boycotts\" of fossil fuel companies. Among them are BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo. Those banks have lost access to billions of dollars in annual inflows and outflows.\n\nThe grouping of \"woke week\" legislation comes after Republicans dubbed last week \"China week.\" The House passed several pieces of legislation to curb China's growing influence and present a contrast with the Biden-Harris administration."

      "text": "Calls For UK DOGE As Billions 'Wasted' On 'Woke' Projects Abroad Highlighted\n\nAuthored by Rachel Roberts via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),\n\nCalls have grown for the British government to introduce the equivalent of the United States' Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), after the extent of so-called \"woke waste\" spending on projects abroad which fall under the umbrella of diversity, equality, and inclusion (DEI) was revealed.\n\nSuccessive Conservative and Labour governments have signed off on projects such as £9,550,000 awarded in December 2024 to Cowater International to support \"Accountability and Inclusion\" in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nThe bulk of the funding under scrutiny has come through the foreign aid budget administered by the Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office (FCDO), although spending at home for academic and arts projects that appear to push the DEI agenda have also come under fire.\n\nMore than half a million pounds (£575,000) was granted to the Ark Group to deliver advice to the Jordanian Armed Forces' \"Gender Mainstreaming Strategy,\" also by the FCDO but under the previous Conservative government in March 2024.\n\nProjects around the world aiming to address the \"climate crisis\" are also major recipients of vast sums of UK money, with more than £101 million given to  \"Climate and Ocean Adaptation and Sustainable Transition\" in Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Mozambique , with this contract awarded to DAI Global in November 2024.\n\nThe UK has also allocated a further £12 million for a \" Taskforce on Access to Climate Finance \" in Mauritius, with the contract still out for tender until December this year, the database shows.\n\nWhile many drivers in the UK have been hit by congestion, ULEZ, and parking charges, almost half a million pounds (£499,649.60) was awarded by the FCDO in 2023 for 15 electric vehicles to be \"donated to Albanian prisons\" by the British Embassy in Tirana.\n\nSince winning the general election last July, Labour has repeatedly claimed there is a \"£22 billion black hole\" in the public spending purse, which Chancellor Rachel Reeves has said necessitates sweeping cuts, such as the loss of winter fuel allowance for the majority of pensioners.\n\nA group operating under the handle The Procurement Files since December 2024 has trawled the publicly available government accounts database to expose some of the more contentious spending, working with journalist Charlotte Gill, who runs a blog and uses the handle @wokewaste.\n\nAlso under scrutiny has been the hundreds of millions awarded to diplomatic spending, such as the refurbishment of embassies and high commissioners' offices.\n\nA spokesperson for The Procurement Files told The Epoch Times: \"The UK spends over £100 billion a year on interest. Our aim is to help to find ways to reduce wasteful spend and to save the UK taxpayer money.\n\n\"For us, it is a question of priorities. Why would the UK taxpayer fund a project for 'Green Urban Growth in Somalia' or a 'Maldives Shark Diving Code of Conduct' when people here are struggling to pay sky-high energy bills?\n\n\"Politicans from the Conservatives and Reform, including Nigel Farage, have been in touch and follow our work.\"\n\nThey added, \" We will follow the blueprint laid out by Elon Musk and the U.S. DOGE team, and are cheering them on from the sidelines! \"\n\nReform MP Richard Tice told The Epoch Times: \"I believe I speak for the majority of logical, common-sense Britons when I say we need an equivalent of DOGE in the UK.\n\n\"As has been proven in America, the only people who oppose such an agency are the incompetent or corrupt bureaucrats.\n\n\"Let's expose the levels of government waste, sleaze, and neglect of taxpayers' money.\n\n\" Full transparency is what the people want-let's give it to them .\"\n\nSam Bidwell, director of The Next Generation, part of the Adam Smith Institute, said on social media platform X : \"The benefits of a British DOGE would be in long-term growth rather than short-term savings.\n\n\"We have several hundred regulators, quangos, and [Arms Length Bodies], which churn out reams of absurd anti-growth regulation.\n\n\"Defunding and reforming these bodies would be an enormous net positive.\"\n\nSome Conservatives have backed the calls for a UK DOGE, including Scottish Tory leader Russell Findlay, who pledged in a speech on Tuesday to set up a Scottish Agency of Value and Efficiency in the event of him becoming first minister.\n\nFindlay said such a department would be tasked with \"cutting waste, identifying savings, and delivering better value for taxpayers.\"\n\nBut there has been no talk from the British government of slashing such projects as the £22,490,382 awarded by the FCDO to PwC for \"Green Growth\" in Nepal shortly after Labour took office in July 2024.\n\nUnder the previous government, £220 million was granted to Palladium for \"UK Partnering for Accelerated Climate Transitions\" in developing countries, with an option to more than double this amount. The same company was separately awarded £15.5 million to deliver a \"climate smart jobs programme\" in Uganda.\n\nThe FCDO is not the only department to come under scrutiny, with the Home Office also coming in for criticism on social media for awarding Alcis Holdings £133,000 to monitor the \"Afghanistan Taliban's Narcotics Ban.\"\n\nGenerous spending for high-level diplomacy is a recurring theme of the contracts under scrutiny, with £179,931 granted to \"replace air-conditioning condensers\" at the British High Commission in Barbados, and a £14.4 million contract for a whole-building refurbishment of the High Commission in Kenya.\n\nSmaller amounts of funding have also come under fire over the usefulness of the project, with an academic study of \"Shrimp Health in Bangladesh\" awarded £50,000 in May 2023 through the Department for the Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs.\n\nArts Council funding which promotes DEI themes has also been criticised by commentators and social media users, such as the £185,627 awarded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (ACHR) for a trans-identified academic to research \" Trans Performance Now: Glitching Transgenderism\" at Northumbria University.\n\nGill has highlighted a number of AHRC-sponsored studies in her work , writing that \"the taxpayer is funding their own demise\" by unwittingly stumping up for projects such as \"The Europe that Gay Porn Built,\" awarded £841,627 over four years at Birmingham City University.\n\nACHR funding for academic projects abroad has included £318,510 for a study that claims that water has experienced trauma , and aims to \"address current water and mental health issues affecting Indiginous communities\" in Peru and the United States.\n\nSince taking control of the White House for the second time, President Donald Trump has begun a wide-ranging and rapid programme to cut what he regards as unnecessary and sometimes corrupt government expenditure, appointing SpaceX CEO Elon Musk as head of DOGE, named after the internet meme.\n\nDOGE's first radical move was to announce the slashing of USAID's workforce from 14,000 to 294 after an audit revealed it was funding projects such as $1.5 million to \"advance DEI in Serbia's workplaces,\" as well as $2 million for sex changes and \"LGBT activism\" in Guatemala, and $32,000 for a \"transgender comic book\" in Peru.\n\nUSAID was set up in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy to administer humanitarian aid on behalf of the U.S. government, but much of its work is now contracted out to external agencies.\n\nMusk claims to have already saved the U.S government more than $3.4 billion by halting DEI contracts, using his platform X to highlight what he has labelled widespread \"fraud\" as well as \"waste.\"\n\nThe Trump team has suggested as much as a trillion dollars could be saved by DOGE, although there is pushback from the Democrats and many NGOs and others who work within the foreign aid field.\n\nThe billionaire entrepreneur said earlier this month on X : \"The corrupt politicians 'protesting' outside the USAID building are the ones getting money from USAID.\n\nThat's why they're there - they want your stolen tax dollars!\"\n\nThe United States is the world's largest provider of money for foreign aid, by a considerable margin. The UK is the world's fourth largest spender, giving approximately £15.4 billion in 2023, compared to around £71.9 billion from the United States.\n\nThe FCDO has been contacted for comment.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "Celebrating The Death Of Woke And The Resurrection Of Common Sense\n\nAuthored by Brandon Smith via Alt-Market.us,\n\nYears ago when the woke takeover of government and popular media was hitting a crescendo, I often struggled to put the horrifying development into the proper words. That is to say, woke isn't just about DEI or blaming the \"patriarchy\" - These things are tools that leftists use, but the goal of the movement has always been the destruction of the western world. Woke represented the perverse inversion of every aspect of western society and human morality - To explain such evil requires a concise analysis.\n\nIn the movie 'Platoon', directed by Oliver Stone, Charlie Sheen's character is a young soldier cast into the nightmare of the Vietnam War. Regretting his decision to volunteer, he makes a disturbing observation:\n\nThis description perfectly summarizes the core aspirations of the woke movement; to create a world where all reason is impossible. A world where all logic and critical thought are admonished. A world where lies are celebrated and the truth is treated as treason. A society that's not allowed to claim its own heritage because it has been labeled \"racist\". A culture perpetually walking on eggshells as leftist hall monitors loom over us, gatekeeping our every moment. What we witnessed as a society over the past decade has been a calculated nuclear attack on the very fabric of the human soul.\n\nSome of us saw these developments within the PC movement coming. However, it's a very different experience to predict a calamity vs living through that calamity. To see a living breathing monster in action can be daunting.\n\nThere was a point, I believe, in 2021-2022 where we came within a razor's edge of civil war. You could feel it in the air; millions of Americans were fed up and ready to wipe the political left off the face of the Earth (such a conflict might still happen). I don't think progressives realize how lucky they are that conservatives are patient.\n\nAt bottom, the outcome of the 2024 election represents a total condemnation of the woke religion. Even if you don't like Donald Trump or the GOP in general, there is no denying that the Democrats lost because they embraced far-left zealotry. Kamala Harris, a DEI candidate, is the ultimate example of Get Woke, Go Broke (her campaign spent over a billion dollars, putting them in the red, only to lose the presidency anyway).\n\nIn light of this great turning point in our cultural history and because 2024 is quickly coming to a close, I just want to relate a few observations on why the woke cult lost and applaud some of the much needed changes that are happening in our nation's return to normalcy.\n\nThe worship of corporate icons has ended. Hollywood is dying. Most studios are now scrambling to get rid of their DEI programs and put out content that appeals to conservatives (or at the very least, content that doesn't piss us off). Actually putting out products that make your customers happy instead of acting like the customers owe you something? Imagine that...\n\nFor generations Hollywood and the media have treated Americans like a captive audience beholden to the establishment. In recent years, though, a new trend developed in which companies simply stopped trying to cater to audiences and began acting as if we are REQUIRED to consume their woke content. Communists despise the free market, not because of wealth inequality, but because the existence of consumer choice forces the elites to serve the public rather than the public serving them.\n\nThis behavior has destroyed the old celebrity edifice and made such people obsolete. So-called \"journalists\" have also met with a dire fate as their kingdom of spin crumbles. They can't control the news if no one listens to them anymore. It's truly a beautiful thing.\n\nDuring the election campaign the vast majority of Democrat Party focus was fear mongering over the loss of access to abortion. I'm not sure when killing babies became some kind of sacred liberty for progressive women - For the longest time it was treated as a shameful but convenient way to avoid responsibility for one's actions; because that's what it is.\n\nIt's not \"health care\".  It's not bodily autonomy (because the rights of the baby are ignored). It's not a safety net to prevent death during childbirth because abortion laws don't interfere with that option anyway. It's always been about birth control for irresponsible women who refused to use preventative measures or close their damn legs.\n\nThe sexual revolution and abortion go hand-in-hand. You can't encourage sexual promiscuity as a social norm without the consequences involved, unless you also allow people to kill those consequences. But I'm getting the sense that newer generations are starting to see the circular destructive nature of this dichotomy. I think they are getting sick from it and they're looking for a little purity.\n\nThis is why abortion ranked near the bottom of almost every poll of most important issues to Americans during the 2024 election. Leftists claimed there would be a societal uproar over abortion rights once Roe v Wade was overturned. It never happened. They said there would be a massive \"blue wave\" of Democrat election victories. The opposite occurred. In the end, abortion access just doesn't matter that much.\n\nConservatives said it over and over again - Leave the kids alone. The leftists refused to listen. The effort to introduce gender ideology into schools and children's entertainment was expansive. Not only did they try to confuse children about their basic genetic make-up and biological roles, they also tried to expose kids to sexualized discussions to the point of grooming.\n\nI've said it before and I'll say it again, the moment the left went after the kids was the moment they lost the culture war. That's when the mask came off and centrists realized that everything conservatives were warning about when it came to progressives was true. That's when the Democrats alienated the middle-road voters and the independents.\n\nIt does make sense in a Machiavellian way; a large percentage of woke activists don't have kids and probably never will. In order to pass on their cultism they have to steal YOUR kids and brainwash them. It's the only way progressives can perpetuate their species.\n\nWould people vote for a woman for president if she was honest, forthright, intelligent and logical? Probably, but the Democrats don't have such candidates and the idea of overlooking basic competence and honesty just for the sake of having a woman in the White House is not appealing to the public. They don't care about identity politics, which is why Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris were both crushed by Donald Trump.\n\nThe political left has long sought to force their own made-up social taboos on the rest of us, from personal identity to race to gender to sexual orientation. What they don't seem to grasp is that people want candidates with a plan. Nothing else matters and \"victim status\" is irrelevant.\n\nHave ancestors that were slaves? No one cares. Are you gay? Irrelevant. Do you think you should win simply because you're a woman and women are historically less represented in government? Maybe you're special, maybe you're not, but there's nothing special about a career victim.\n\nAlong with the economy, the border crisis issue was the most important factor on the minds of Americans during the election. Housing expenses are going through the stratosphere.  It's not surprising that the public doesn't want a bunch of third world parasites using government subsidies to snake homes out from under native Americans and drive up rental costs.\n\nIllegals sneaking into the country also work for lower pay, often under the table, driving down wages for citizen workers and craftsman and making industries like construction less enticing. Yes, Americans would do these jobs, just not for a 30% to 50% wage cut. And since tens of millions of migrants have flooded into the US, the fact that they work for less doesn't help with prices. The massive extra demand actually sucks up supply and inflates prices further.\n\nThe progressive notion of the \"American melting pot\" no longer holds any magic for the average American.  The \"migrant dream of the 1920s is irrelevant today.  We don't want other cultures flooding the west, and we don't want millions of people that don't intend to assimilate. Leftists still don't understand that their open border narrative has failed.  Nationalism and protectionism are the winning positions.  No foreigner is entitled to American access.  If they get it, they should be thanking their lucky stars instead of acting is if it's something they're owed.\n\nRemember when calling your friends gay or retarded was normal and no one threw a tantrum over it? Remember when comedy equaled tragedy + time and people knew how to laugh in the face of adversity?  Well, we're bringing that tradition back and there's nothing the woke pearl clutching losers can do about it.\n\nIt might not sound very important, but anyone familiar with the writings of Erasmus, including his 'Praise Of Folly', knows the problems that arise when an ideological movement is incapable of laughing at itself. Humor often requires self examination and a truthful eye, which is something authoritarians greatly fear. If you can laugh at the establishment, then the establishment loses power.\n\nThere have been times when Christianity was incapable of self reflection and humor and it hurt conservatives as a whole. Today, though, most humorless people reside among progressives.  They have dominated our cultural institutions for many years because they used to respect humor.   Finally, thanks to the independence of online content creators, the cultural power has been taken away from leftist elites and is returning to the people.\n\nI'm noticing, with great relief, that most people are starting to smile again. It's slow and it's subtle, but comedians are far less inclined to walk on eggshells these days. It's a big change from only a few years ago. Never forget, the left tried to take our laughter away and control what we're allowed to make fun of. Without humor, society crumbles.\n\nThere are many other shifts in America that are making daily life bearable again and I can't cover them all here.

      "text": "The Woke Plot To Destroy Our Economy\n\nAuthored by Llewellyn Rockwell,\n\n\"Woke\" people claim that they want to wake up racial and sexual minorities to the way they are being discriminated against. Because of past and present exploitation, blacks and other \"protected\" groups are not getting what rightfully belongs to them. The solution to this is that the better off, especially if they are white, should have their wealth and income seized and given to those they are exploiting.\n\nThe woke position rests on a fundamental fallacy. This is that there is a fixed amount resources, so that if the rich have more, the poor have less. But this is wrong. Resources in the free market are not a fixed sum. So long as the economy is growing, everybody can benefit. The 'protected' can do better without taking away what the rich have earned. The economist Paul Rubin, who died last month, gives a good account of the fallacy:\n\n\"Karl Marx called his system 'scientific socialism' Modern leftists advocate a similar ideology and call themselves 'woke' to indicate that they understand the world better than the rest of us. Yet the worldview of Marxists and woke leftists alike is fundamentally primitive.\n\nFolk economics is the economics of people untrained in economics. It is the economic view of the world that evolved in our brains before the development of the modern economy. During this period of evolution, the economy was simple, with little specialization except by age and sex, no economic growth, no technological change, limited trade, little capital, and warfare between neighboring tribes.\n\nZero-sum thinking was well-adapted to this world. Since there was no economic growth, incomes and wealth didn't grow. If one person had access to more food or other goods, or greater access to females, it was likely because of expropriation from others. Since there was little capital, a 'labor theory of value'-the idea that all value is created by labor alone-would have been appropriate, and there was little need to protect capital through property rights. Frequent warfare encouraged xenophobia.\n\nAdam Smith and other economists challenged this worldview in the 18th century. They taught that specialization of labor was valuable, that capital was productive, and that labor and capital could work together to increase income. They also showed that property rights needed protection, that members of other tribes or groups could cooperate through trade, that wealth could be created with the proper incentives, and that the creation of wealth would benefit everyone in a society, not only the wealthy. Most important, they showed that a complex economy could work with little or no central direction.\n\nMarx's economic system was based on the primitive worldview of our ancestors. For him, conflict rather than cooperation between labor and capital defined the economy. He thought that the wealthy became rich only by exploiting the poor, that all income came from labor, and that the economy needed central direction because he didn't believe markets were good at self-correction. The collapse of the Soviet Union, the largest and most expensive social-science experiment ever conducted, proved Smith right and Marx wrong.\n\nMembers of the woke left want to return to policies based on this primitive economic thinking. One of their major errors is thinking that the world is zero-sum. That assumption drives identity politics, which sees, among other things, an intrinsic conflict between blacks and whites. The Black Lives Matter movement and Critical Race Theory foment racial antagonism and resurrect xenophobia. Leftists vilify 'millionaires and billionaires' like Bill Gates and Elon Musk as evil and exploitative. They should recognize them as productive entrepreneurs whose innovations benefit us all.\n\nDislike of the rich makes sense in a world where one can become rich only by exploiting others, but not in a society full of creativity and useful inventions. Changing tax laws to soak the rich makes sense with a labor theory of value, but not with a sophisticated understanding of continual investment and technological change.\n\nAdopting counterproductive woke policies such as racial job quotas, high taxes, excessive regulation of business, and price controls on some goods may not send us all the way back to the subsistence economy of our ancestors. But if policies that penalize saving and investing and that involve excessive government control are adopted, social capital, wealth, and real income will decline. If we bow to this primitive ideology, there will be increased racial animosity and conflict, slow economic growth, and fewer inventions.\"\n\nYou might raise an objection to this.\n\nEven if the economy is growing, and the minorities can gain without taking resources from the rich, why should they be satisfied with what they get? Can't they demand more of the growing economic pie? The answer is that doing this will hurt them, not help them. The way in which the economy grows is by capital accumulation, and the great bulk of this takes place through the investments of the well off. Confiscation of the income and wealth of the wealthy will slow down or stop the rate of economic growth. This will make the \"protected\" worse off. The great Ludwig von Mises proposes a thought experiment that brings out this point vividly:\n\n\"A law that prohibits any individual from accumulating more than ten million or from making more than one million a year restricts the activities of precisely those entrepreneurs who are most successful in filling the wants of consumers. If such a law had been enacted in the United States fifty years ago, many who are multimillionaires today would live in more modest circumstances. But all those new branches of industry which supply the masses with articles unheard of before would operate, if at all, on a much smaller scale, and their products would be beyond the reach of the common man. It is manifestly contrary to the interest of the consumers to prevent the most efficient entrepreneurs from expanding the sphere of their activities up to the limit to which the public approves of their conduct of business by buying their products.\"\n\nThere is another way in which the woke movement undermines our economy, and this may be the most serious one of all . The conjuring up of grievances encourages blacks to hate whites. Being white is regarded by many left-wing revolutionaries as evil, and murderous violence will result from this.  As the great black economist Thomas Sowell points out:\n\n\"Although much of the media have their antennae out to pick up anything that might be construed as racism against blacks, they resolutely ignore even the most blatant racism by blacks against others.\n\nThat includes a pattern of violent attacks on whites in public places in Chicago, Denver, New York, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Kansas City, as well as blacks in schools beating up Asian classmates - for years - in New York and Philadelphia.\n\nThese attacks have been accompanied by explicitly racist statements by the attackers, so it is not a question of having to figure out what the motivation is. There has also been rioting and looting by these young hoodlums.\"\n\nLet's do everything we can to counter the woke plot to destroy our economy and to encourage the free market economic policies of Ludwig von Mises and Murray Rothbard. That is the way to a prosperous economy in which all groups can live in harmony.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

The move is part of a broader consolidation wave within far-left corporate media amid ratings implosion as Americans gravitate towards X and new media outlets in the Trump era.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that the layoffs, which represent 6% of the combined units, will be announced at some point today . The report is based on people knowledgeable about the cuts.\n\nAdditional color by WSJ of the cuts:\n\nThe ABC news magazine shows \"20/20\" and \"Nightline \" are consolidating into one unit, resulting in job cuts , the people said. ABC is also eliminating the political and data-driven news site 538 , which had about 15 employees.\n\nAll three hours of \"Good Morning America\" branded shows will be consolidated under one person ; previously, the third hour had a separate production team.\n\nAt the Disney Entertainment Networks unit, which houses broadcast networks and cable channels such as Freeform and FX, there will be staffing reductions in program planning and scheduling .\n\nWSJ noted, \"The cuts are the latest of several staff reductions over the past few years at Disney, which like many entertainment companies is looking for ways to save on what used to be core businesses as it spends more on sports and entertainment content to compete in the streaming marketplace ,\" adding, \" Ratings and revenue are down at many cable channels as consumers ditch cable packages and advertisers flee for streaming services and digital platforms.\"\n\nThe imminent cuts at ABC (and entertainment unit) come a little more than one week after race-baiting propagandist Joy Reid was fired from MSNBC .

      "text": "Opposition To Woke Progressivism Energizes Trump Coalition\n\nAuthored by Peter Berkowitz via RealClearPolitics ,\n\nIn January, Republicans will gain undivided control of the federal government's political branches. Yet President-elect Donald Trump's comfortable 312-226 electoral-college victory over Vice President Kamala Harris and his narrow margin in the popular vote - 49.9% to 48.4% - do not constitute a landslide. Considering also Republicans' razor-thin House majority and several vulnerable seats the 53-47 Republican Senate majority must defend in 2026, it is early to speak of a national political realignment. Whether the GOP expands and establishes firmly the impressive multi-racial and multi-ethnic working-class coalition that Trump built over the last nine years turns on the coalition's composition and the forces that unified it around the most unlikely of two-term presidents.\n\nIn 2024, Trump enjoyed stunning, nearly across-the-board improvements over his 2020 performance. The president-elect increased his numbers in 2,764 of America's 3,112 counties - including those that tend Democratic - while all 50 states shifted right. Trump achieved \"unprecedented\" levels of support for a Republican presidential candidate among black, Latino, and Asian peoples. Although female voters went 53% to 46% to Harris, Trump bettered his results with women. And, in a mid-November CBS news poll , 57% of adults in the United States under 30 were happy or satisfied with Trump's victory and 58% of those 30-44 years of age. Harris surpassed President Joe Biden's 2020 results only among white, college-educated voters.\n\nSeveral factors propelled citizens of different groups to vote for Trump. As Fareed Zakaria observes , Trump \"celebrated risk-taking and spoke the language of disruption and radical reform,\" which attracted men, entrepreneurs, and technologists. Moreover, the GOP nominee faced a weak opponent who, until three months before the election, conspired with her party and the press to pretend that the unpopular president was as sharp as ever. The perception that Biden presided over lawless migration, high inflation, and indulgence of crime fomented discontent, especially among the working class. In addition, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion programs and transgender activism, which flourished under the Biden administration, angered Trump voters. DEI impelled the federal bureaucracy, big business, major media, and universities to disparage merit as a bigoted standard and to provide preferential treatment to non-Jewish and non-Asian minorities and women. Transgender activism denied the public relevance of biological differences between men and women.\n\nMany Trump voters view the Democratic Party as \"woke.\" So do some Trump critics, prominent among them New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, who maintained shortly after the election that \"woke is broke.\" The term originally emerged in the 1940s among African Americans who described as woke those acquiring awareness of injustice in society. In today's national conversation about politics woke refers to fashionable progressive opinions about society, morality, and politics contrived in universities and spread by elites to government, corporations, the mainstream media, Hollywood, and Silicon Valley.\n\nWoke progressivism is not a fixed creed or settled doctrine but embraces a mix of recognizable and interrelated attitudes, ideas, and goals. Typically, woke progressives maintain that society is divided into oppressors and oppressed. They equate virtue with victimhood. They teach that white supremacy and male supremacy gave birth to the United States and that systemic racism and sexism permeate America's unwritten norms, founding principles, and basic political institutions. They insist that social justice requires government and private organizations to discriminate against white men to ensure that the minorities and women whom they oppress acquire positions of wealth, status, and power at least equal to their proportion in society. They reject civility, toleration, and colorblindness as hopelessly compromised by their association with America's corrupt constitutional heritage. And they despise dissent from their axioms and aims, which they interpret as dispositive evidence of dissenters' racism and sexism.\n\nWoke progressivism promotes the social, political, and economic attainment of minorities with privileged status on the hierarchy of grievance - especially those already moving in elite circles . And it advances careers of highly credentialed white people by signaling their rectitude to fellow initiates while giving the pleasure of lording their moral refinement over the clueless rabble.\n\nYet woke progressivism's appeal is limited. It is an ideology that is poorly designed to win over white men or, for that matter, their wives, mothers, and daughters who in many cases take umbrage at the vilification of their husbands, sons, and fathers. It also rankles men and women of all races and ethnicities who believe that America, for all its shortcomings, remains a land of hope and opportunity. And it appears illiberal and antidemocratic to the inspiring diversity of persons who hold that inherent human dignity requires equal respect for the rights of all. The combination of vilified white men, the females who love them, and nonwhite citizens who feel gratitude for American freedom and opportunity seems to embrace a majority of citizens.\n\nIn \" Academe's Divorce From Reality ,\" recently published by the Chronicle of Higher Education, William Deresiewicz indicates that Trump voters rightly associated woke progressivism with the Biden administration. An essayist, scholar, and longtime critic of universities' betrayal of liberal education, Deresiewicz argues that the election represented a referendum on \"the politics of the academy.\" That politics converges with woke progressivism. \"Its ideas, its assumptions, its opinions and positions - as expressed in official statements, embodied in policies and practices, established in centers and offices, and espoused and taught by large and leading portions of the professoriate - have been rejected,\" he maintains.\n\n\"Over the last 10 years or so\" - as Americans' confidence in higher education plummeted - \"a cultural revolution has been imposed on this country from the top down,\" according to Deresiewicz. \"Its ideas originated in the academy, and it's been carried out of the academy by elite-educated activists and journalists and academics.\"\n\nOverlapping in many respects with Biden-administration sympathies and objectives, this university-driven cultural revolution aims at \"decriminalization or nonprosecution of property and drug crimes and, ultimately, the abolition of police and prisons; open borders, effectively if not explicitly; the suppression of speech that is judged to be harmful to disadvantaged groups; 'affirmative' care for gender-dysphoric youth (puberty blockers followed by cross-sex hormones followed, in some cases, by mastectomies) and the inclusion of natal males in girls' and women's sports; and the replacement of equality by equity - of equal opportunity for individuals by equal outcomes for designated demographic groups - as the goal of social policy.\"\n\nThe university-driven cultural revolution anathematizes fundamental institutions and rejects nature , \"insist[ing] that the state is evil, that the nuclear family is evil, that something called 'whiteness' is evil, that the sex binary, which is core to human biology, is a social construct.\"\n\nIt mobilizes the federal government, higher education, and the private sector to establish and manage \"the DEI regimes, the training and minders and guidelines, that have blighted American workplaces, including academic ones.\"\n\nIt commandeers language to compel obedience to its dictates, \"promulgat[ing] an ever-shifting array of rebarbative neologisms whose purpose often seems to be no more than its own enforcement: POC (now BIPOC), AAPI (now AANHPI), LGBTQ (now LGBTQIA2S+), 'pregnant people,' 'menstruators,' 'front hole,' 'chest feeding,' and, yes, 'Latinx.'\"\n\nAnd it seeks not merely acquiescence to its policies but solemn allegiance - outward and inward - to its imperatives: \"It is joyless, vengeful, and tyrannical. It is purist and totalistic. It demands affirmative, continuous, and enthusiastic consent.\"\n\nA recent report of the Network Contagion Research Institute at Rutgers University, \" INSTRUCTING ANIMOSITY: How DEI Pedagogy Produces the Hostile Attribution Bias ,\" lends social-science support to the observation that woke progressivism, contrary to its promise to advance social justice, fosters distrust and enmity among citizens. For example, researchers asked one group to read representative statements contending that America is rife with systemic racism and the other to read nonpolitical materials. Researchers then presented to both groups a hypothetical involving a college applicant who, following an interview, is denied admission. While the hypothetical mentioned neither the applicant's nor the interviewer's race, those who read the DEI materials were significantly more likely to see bigotry at play.\n\nNCRI researchers' several studies consistently found that \"ideas and rhetoric foundational to many DEI trainings,\" contrary to DEI claims, neither \"foster pluralistic inclusiveness\" nor \"increase empathy and understanding.\" Rather, \"[a]cross all groupings, instead of reducing bias, they engendered a hostile attribution bias...amplifying perceptions of prejudicial hostility where none was present, and punitive responses to the imaginary prejudice\" (footnote omitted).\n\nThe NCRI findings reinforce common sense. If, in the spirit of woke progressivism, elite universities teach that American institutions are hateful, students will learn to despise their country and scorn the patriots among their fellow citizens. If elite universities teach that Americans are either oppressors or oppressed, the best and the brightest will view politics as war and education as propaganda. If elite universities teach that group identity takes precedence over the dignity of the person, graduates will regard themselves as duty bound to trample over individual rights in pursuit of social justice.\n\nAnd if our elite universities - and the graduates they annually launch into the world - keep it up, they will increase the Trump coalition's chances of landslide election victories and enhance the prospects of a national political realignment built around working-class men and women joined by individuals of all colors and classes who cherish freedom and democracy in America.\n\nPeter Berkowitz is the Tad and Dianne Taube senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University.

      "text": "Woke DEI + Green Nihilism = Dresden In California\n\nAuthored by Victor Davis Hanson via American Greatness,\n\nOver 25,000 acres are ablaze in Los Angeles in the Pacific Palisades fire, a veritable living hell.\n\nSome 12,000-plus structures were incinerated. More than 250,000 souls have been evacuated and are in need of shelter.\n\nNo one has really taken charge yet. And now even the woke culprits for the catastrophe are blame-gaming each other to determine who was the more incompetent, which in this case translates to the most woke.\n\nNo one knows how many have died; all know the number will escalate in the next few days.\n\nThe eventual price tag of the ruin will exceed $200-300 billion and outstrip the billions of dollars given to Ukraine.\n\nAnd there are still some fires that are completely uncontained.\n\nThe Los Angeles apocalypse was a multisystem, green-woke collapse-and a disastrous reminder that when Soviet-style, anti-meritocratic ideology permeates all aspects of modern life in California, disaster is inevitable.\n\nFirst, note that the culprit of the catastrophe is not climate change; it is not Donald Trump. Those are excuses for arrogant incompetency and disdain for the public. And it is not racism or homophobia to fault those who paraded and virtue signaled their tribal identities so extraneous to their actual responsibilities for public safety.\n\nNote that all California statewide officeholders are left-wing. The California left holds supermajorities in both houses of the state legislature. Only 17 percent of California's huge congressional delegation of 52 seats is Republican. California's judiciary is the most left-wing in the country. There is not a single Republican on the 15-member Los Angeles City Council.\n\nAdd it all up, and the woke socialist state has been eagerly deindustrializing, decivilizing, and retribalizing its way into what is now a veritable peacetime Dresden on the Pacific.\n\nAgain, there is no one else to blame, because California is one of those rare states in which Republicans have de facto zero political power. All the state media, the legacy newspapers, the Silicon Valley daily online news sites, the Bay Area-based Apple, Google, and Facebook monopolies, and the local news outlets are parrots of the woke-green mindset.\n\nTo the degree that anything still works in California, it predates 2000. The core of the ossified Central Valley Water Project and the California Water Project remain-though they are in need of massive maintenance, like almost all the infrastructure the current generation of politicians inherited and largely ignored.\n\nNow crowded and obsolete highways that were once the nation's best still function-but barely. And there are a few remnants of sanity in what is left of the pre-woke and once-great universities of Berkeley, Caltech, Stanford, UCLA, and USC, founded by a now despised but far wiser and more competent long-dead generation of visionaries.\n\nLos Angeles brags about its new $50 billion budget and trumpets how it expanded \"Care First\" programs. Indeed, the mayor's budget claims it created a new \"451 positions\"-highlighting its investments in \"growing the department of youth development.\"\n\nIt boasts it is adding positions to the \"Justice, Care, and Opportunities Department,\" \"reducing our jail population,\" and expanding \"voting solutions for all people.\" There is not much about fire, policing, or water-apparently now the low priorities that prior sexist, racist, and homophobic generations once worried about.\n\nThe role of DEI? Mayor Karen Bass was warned of the current danger of dry hillsides of chaparral buffeted by record-high, 100-mph Santa Ana winds. Her response?\n\nShe went junketing a continent away to the inauguration festivities of the president of Ghana-a strange way to prepare for a possible inferno to come. Does Ghana have firefighting expertise to share with Bass? In damage-control mode, Bass flew back only to be confronted at the airport by a now rare honest-and thus foreign-reporter.\n\nHe asked her why she cut over $17.6 million from the LA fire service budget-itself just 65% of the city's homelessness expenditures. (She had planned to cut millions of dollars more). And why, he asked, was she in Africa at all in her city's hour of need?\n\nBass stood mute-shamed into silence.\n\nI think Los Angelenos needed no answer since it was obvious to them: she went to Ghana because she could and wanted to-since identity chauvinism is what ensured she was elected, reelected, and immune from criticism. Look at her appointments and budget, and it is clear public safety, fires, and water are most certainly not her priorities.\n\nBass was confident that if LA went up in smoke as she pursued her African agendas, the woke megaphones would silence critics as \"racist\" or \"homophobic\" or \"sexist\" in the way Soviet commissars used to send to Siberia any \"ideological enemies of the state\" who complained that the farms, industries, and trains of Russia no longer worked. And on spec, we now hear it is now racist to criticize a black woman incompetent mayor.\n\nHow about the Bass-appointed DEI \"deputy mayor for safety,\" Brian Williams?\n\nSurely, he stepped up in the mayor's absence, given his purview of the city's \"safety?\" Nope.\n\nYou see, he is currently under suspension for suspicion of phoning in a bomb threat to Los Angeles City Hall.\n\nWell, how about the DEI- and the much-acclaimed \"first Latina\" director of Los Angeles's vast waterworks? Bass recruited such talent by nearly doubling the job's normal salary to $750,000 per year.\n\nWhat did she accomplish on her over $2,000-a-day salary? Did Janisse Quiñones, \"the new Chief Executive Officer and Chief Engineer of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) and the \"first Latina woman to lead the organization,\" leap into action?\n\nWell, the water very quickly ran out in Pacific Palisades, and the hydrants went dry-as many had been for months prior.\n\nQuiñones claimed that \"three million gallons\" in tanks above the suburb were mysteriously not up to the task of quenching the LA Dresden. You think?\n\nShe apparently gauges disaster preparation by the number of gallons of water available in tanks, not the number of gallons needed to save thousands of homes and lives. And she forgot to tell the public that in fact there is a 117-million-gallon water reservoir atop Pacific Palisades built for some purpose unknown to her.\n\nYet it was empty and \"under repair\" for months because of a mere damaged cover. Consider that: a dry autumn, the onset of the usual Santa Ana winds, a recent plague of hilltop wildfires, and Quiñones shuts down the linchpin of a prior generation's plan to save the Palisades.\n\nNote Quiñones was supposed to be the professional replacement for a retired director of water and power, who himself had been a replacement for another director who was found guilty of bribery and is currently in federal prison.\n\nSo goes the agency created by water wizard William Mulholland, who once created the 18-million-person Los Angeles megapolis by tapping every river and reservoir he could to feed the city's unquenchable thirst for water.\n\nHow about fire chief Kristen Crowley? She now blames the mayor for dry hydrants. But in doing so, she pleaded that her job starts only after water flows out of them-as if their inert condition is not really her concern.\n\nThe self-celebrity, nonbinary fire chief Kristen Crowley has talked nonstop for the last two years about \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" and the \"LGBTQ community.\" Less was said about the need to ensure the most meritocratic force possible, unmatched equipment, and long preplanned measures to prevent conflagrations-and screaming to high heaven that fire hydrants were either being stolen or bone dry.\n\nInstead, like Bass, Crowley was mostly mute about the lack of preparation or the absence of sufficient warning to those about to be engulfed.\n\nHow about her deputy Kristine Lawson, who claimed people in need want to see fire officers arrive who look like they do? And if they don't?\n\nShe is also on record with this: \"Am I able to carry your husband out of a fire? He got himself in the wrong place if I have to carry him out.\" Consider that helpful LAFD logic: So, if you are a man who suffers cardiac arrest and collapses on your kitchen floor, it is your fault that you died without medical attention, not Kristine's, who apparently either would not or could not carry you out the door.\n\nThe speaker of the California Assembly, Robert Rivas, along with Governor Gavin Newsom, had just called a special session of the legislature to \"Trump-proof\" California. He wished to allot millions of dollars in state funds-in a year of massive deficits-to sue and impede the federal government.\n\nWill Rivas's Trump \"resistance\" session include canceling California's simultaneous request for hundreds of billions of federal dollars for Los Angeles from the Trump administration? When asked whether it was wise to borrow millions to sue Trump while Los Angeles was burning, Rivas mumbled, stuttered, and revealed himself to be little more than a caricature of an incompetent.\n\nGovernor Gavin \"Nero\" Newsom made his usual performance art, virtual-signaling appearance. When asked why the hydrants were dry, he batted it off as a \"local problem.\" He now uses his own campaign website, linked to Democratic fundraising efforts, to warn the fire-struck public about supposed \"misinformation.\"\n\nBut what could Newsom do or say? His entire tenure is synonymous with too many catastrophic forest fires and too little water.\n\nHe did nothing after the catastrophic Aspen and Paradise fires to revive the timber industry to glean and clean the forests. He never allowed much new grazing on fuel-rich hills or sent crews in to cut back the chaparral.\n\nHe never reconsidered his policies of diverting precious snowmelt from the Sacramento River tributaries to flow into the sea to help the delta smelt rather than to ensure that farmers could irrigate their crops or that Los Angeles County reservoirs were fully banked.\n\nDespite an approved 2014 $7.5 billion bond to build three huge dams and reservoirs, Newsom ensured that we built none: not the easily constructed Sites reservoir, not Temperance Flat, and not Los Banos Grandes, all tertiary foothill reservoirs that could have given California by now nearly five million additional acre-feet of storage.\n\nOr is it worse than that?\n\nGovernor Dam-Buster still brags about how he greenlit blowing up four dams on the Klamath River-the largest dam removal in American history. The dams provided 80,000 homes with clean hydroelectric power, farmers with irrigation water, and the public with recreation and flood control.\n\nInstead of following the voters' bond to build reservoirs and dams, Newsom preferred to dynamite them. The ensuing muddy deluge wiped out the surrounding riparian ecosystem.\n\nJoe Biden, now in the last days of his disastrous tenure, was in the LA area by chance to boast that he had put thousands of valuable federal square miles off limits.\n\nInstead, he mumbled about his new great-grandson and relief that his kid's house was saved, as the fire was engulfing 12,000 homes of others. Then Biden unceremoniously left, heartbroken that his last junket to Italy might have to be canceled as Los Angeles continued to burn. Later he too grumbled about \"misinformation,\" which is his synonym for telling the truth about the Los Angeles green woke bomb.\n\nKamala Harris? Was the vice president perhaps marshaling federal money and assets to stop the fires in her last weeks in office? After all, we remember from her 2024 campaign Harris's frenzied efforts to help out during national disasters, as she scolded the capable Florida governor Ron DeSantis that he was not partnering enough with her to mitigate the effects of flooding.\n\nShe too proved invisible other than remarking the fire was \"apocalyptic.\" Instead, Harris was too busy planning a multimillion-dollar junket in her last week in office and of free royal travel.\n\nInsurance? Is there some plan to rebuild these suburbs as they were, to ensure there are some $300 billion to pay out claims? Well, no again. The state is broke and is driving out insurance companies, not enticing them in. Its public \"Fair\" unfair insurance plan of last resort is underfunded and will go insolvent once a week or two of claims flows in.\n\nCalifornia's failure to effectively prevent and put out fires-along with hyper-regulation and failure to combat an epidemic of insurance fraud-has destroyed the state's insurance industry. Given the prior inability of homeowners to buy credible fire insurance at any cost, there are thousands of now-homeless who had no insurance at all.\n\nHow about the region's large homeless population that camps out on the streets and in the tinderbox chaparral above the suburbs? Did the city investigate arson or detain, arrest, charge, and jail those rounded up with incendiary devices or seen lighting fires? Of course not. They vetoed any notion long ago of an anti-camping ordinance.\n\nAdd it all up.\n\nThe California nihilist green ethos and the left-wing politicians who run the madhouse ensured there is no effort to glean the forests and hills of combustible fuel.\n\nThere is not enough water for hydrants, not enough to deliver to Los Angeles, and when it arrives, there is too much incompetence to know how to use it.\n\nThere were no real warnings to residents that they had mere minutes to flee for their lives. Or was it worse still? As the fires wore on, continuous false alarms of new fires sparked unnecessary and dangerous mass evacuations citywide, destroying what, if any, trust was left in the fire department.\n\nThere is no reason to believe that such derelict politicians during the next fire will not again be AWOL on DEI junkets, boasting of their genders, their race, and their sexual orientation, but not of their duties to those whose lives they are sworn to protect.\n\nCalifornia's DEI \"humanism\" and Green New Deal environmentalism ensured the cruelest imaginable treatment of thousands of people and unrivaled destruction of the natural ecosystem.\n\nNo one in the government dares to guess about what might have caused the fires, even as they cry \"climate change\"-as if to do so would expose their own incompetency or confirm rumors of sporadic homeless arsonists.\n\nThe California green utopians, by their very ideological zealotry, ensured their fires likely will have released into the atmosphere several weeks' worth of the entire state's collective auto emissions.\n\nThe fires will have wiped out thousands of protected flora and fauna, will have released toxic fumes into the air, and will have destroyed the lives of thousands of Los Angeles residents for years to come.\n\nTo paraphrase a 1960s California left-wing slogan-green-woke is not healthy for children and other living things.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "VICE Co-Founder Admits Woke Journalism Destroyed Brand: 'What The F**k Is This?'\n\nVICE co-founder Shane Smith admitted in an interview with legendary music producer and 'Tetragrammaton' host Rick Rubin that his the once-high flying digital media empire--once valued at $5.7 billion - collapsed partly due to leaning heavily into \"woke\" content.\n\nRICK RUBIN: Is there any point in the VICE story where you feel like VICE sold out?\n\nSHANE SMITH: I wouldn't necessarily say sold out because we were always independent, we always sold pieces of it.\n\nRICK RUBIN: But from a content perspective, did you ever pander your content away from what you actually liked?\n\nSHANE SMITH: The problem with content, and what people don't understand, is the same thing with TV: people don't put content on that they like because they like it; they put content on that rates. So, to go back to around 2017, at the peak of the HBO era - because all of our big clients, like Google and the studios, and everybody was out in LA. I moved to LA and so I sort of stepped back from day-to-day but I kept doing news. And VICE - the other channels, not the news, and VICE started moving - ' cause we always say 'give the company over to the interns,' like every five years. And VICE started moving into this sort of weird woke era or whatever . But it was young people writing for themselves for the audience. It was like our audience went from Millennials to whatever that is - Gen Z - and they were writing for themselves, to themselves . By the way, traffic was through the roof, but the old VICE audience, including me, was like, \"What are we doing here?\"\n\nAnd also, one of the mistakes was that VICE News was over here, which I was concentrating on, and it was still killing it and doing awards and all that stuff, but people didn't differentiate between VICE.com and VICE News. There was just VICE, and so I think that was a f**k up . We should have had a lot more differentiation. I mean, the \"go woke, go broke\" thing, I'm well aware of , and a lot of times I'd see stuff and you would be like, \"what the fuck?\" Then you go to give someone shit, and they're like, \"Okay, this is the one you liked; 10 people saw the one that this other piece got 100 million, that's just what fuckin' young people want, you old man.\" And you're like, \"Oh, well.\" It's a problem with digital media, in that it changes with the audience. The audience now, that young digital-consuming audience, is that audience, and that's the content they want.\n\nSo, it became problematic. And definitely, should be speaking of selling out, like Disney or any of those corporate partners, they didn't want that; we didn't want that. It was just sort of this... you know, we had, I don't know, 5,000 employees doing 7,000 pieces a day , and all of this stuff would come out and you'd be like, \"What the fuck is this this?\" Did we lose control of the bicycle? Yeah.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "Gay Dragons And Black Samurai: Woke Game Companies In Crisis As Consumers Walk Away\n\nThe entertainment sector has been at the core of the woke movement over the course of the last ten years, integrating Critical Race Theory, feminism, gay and trans propaganda, climate change hysteria, anti-gun rights messaging and pro-socialist rhetoric into their content at breakneck speed.  There has always been progressive politics in movies and TV, but this new social justice takeover was a highly coordinated tidal wave; a Blitzkrieg of hard-left ideology into every possible media space.\n\nOne group of consumers noticed the threat very early on - Gamers picked up on the leftist subversion of their hobby almost immediately in 2013 .  They would go on to launch \"Gamergate\" in 2014, a movement to expose the feminist hijacking of games journalism and the hobby at large.  They were punished for their foresight, accused of \"misogyny\", \"bigotry\", \"racism\" and even terrorism, but they were correct.  There was indeed a far-left agenda to dominate the gaming world and extort companies into adopting social justice propaganda.\n\nThe plan succeeded spectacularly. Most corporations eventually folded and instituted DEI programs outright.  Gaming developers were some of the worst perpetrators and their products quickly became replete with woke indoctrination.  The one thing they didn't count on, though, was a consumer revolt.\n\nIt's hard to say what they expected; maybe they assumed that once the market was saturated with leftist content the average customer would give up hoping for a normal game with a good story, compelling characters and fun mechanics and simply buy whatever the critics told them to buy.  Instead, gamers stopped buying anything and walked away.\n\nAny product with leftist messaging, race swapping, LGBT characters or situations, etc. is exposed long before the project is released. The more insidious developers have actually sought to stop people from reporting on the content of these games using intimidation and legal measures, but nothing they do will save them.  These businesses are, rightfully, collapsing.\n\nMore recent casualties include Ubisoft, which reportedly stands on the edge of financial ruin due to multiple woke failures.  Ubisoft is also sitting on perhaps one of the most woke AAA game releases of all time - Assassins Creed: Shadows.\n\nThe group hitched their wagon to an activist historian named Thomas Lockley with a wild tale - The supposedly \"true story\" of a black slave named Yasuke who traveled on a Portuguese ship to Japan and became a samurai.  Instead of making a game about a Japanese samurai in Japan's Azuchi-Momoyama period, they chose to use Lockley's research as the basis for their plot.\n\n(Leftists are known to be particularly hostile towards the Japanese because of their highly controlled immigration policies. Featuring a black samurai protagonist is obviously meant as a jab at Japanese culture).\n\nAs it turns out, Lockley's research is likely exaggerated (or fabricated) and he has been accused by the Japanese government of potential fraud.  Yasuke was never a samurai; he was treated as an oddity by the Japanese emperor who had never seen a black man before.  He became a fixture at the emperor's court for a short period, but was never given the title of samurai, nor did he have time to learn any of the warrior disciplines that samurai are renowned for.  The man existed, but the idea of him being a samurai is complete fiction.\n\nStatements made by Ubisoft also seem to indicate that the characters of Assassins Creed will be gay , including Yasuke.  So, a black gay samurai in feudal Japan who is supposed to be an assassin?  Genius.  He wouldn't stand out at all.\n\nUbisoft is stuck with this project.  Hundreds of millions of dollars are already invested and they have delayed the release multiple times.  Most gamers are well informed of the fallacies and propaganda in the title and it is expected to bomb hard once it is finally put on the market.  The company is now engaging in mass layoffs across multiple studios , apparently in preparation of the vast sums of money they're about to lose.\n\nAnother big developer that's in the midst of an implosion is Bioware, which is now being downsized by Electronic Arts after the embarrassing release of their highly expensive Dragon Age: The Veilguard title. The company hired gay and trans consultants and developers to inject LGBT propaganda into the fantasy project and the results were hilariously bad, including trans \"dragon people\" and gay pirates preaching about neo-pronouns.\n\nThe layoffs come less than two weeks after Dragon Age game director Corinne Busche announced her own departure from BioWare, and just a week after EA said Veilguard had underperformed sales expectations.  In reality, the game was an unmitigated failure. EA said Veilguard was \"down nearly 50% from the company's expectations.\"\n\nGaming developers were some of the first people to join the woke insurrection of American media, so it's fitting that they are now among the first people to go bankrupt and lose their jobs because of it.  Get Woke, Go Broke.\n\nHopefully, these collapsing companies will stand as a smoldering reminder that the consumer runs the show, not the creators. The free market is still a thing, and it decides if a game is going to succeed or crash and burn.  The gaming industry in its hubris has been begging for a slap in the face for years, and now they have it.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "Woke Panic: Civil Rights Groups Demand That Corporations Stop Cutting DEI Programs\n\nThe invasion of woke ideology and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) policies into every facet of American life seemed to happen out of the blue starting in 2015-2016, but in reality the agenda had been quietly and insidiously slithering into western institutions for decades prior.\n\nEstablishment controlled NGOs like the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation and George Soros' Open Society Foundation had been pumping billions of dollars into US universities since at least the 1960s, launching social justice  programs and placing propagandists into teaching positions with the intent of \"manufacturing consent\" as Noam Chomsky once dubbed it.\n\nThe effort was to control the thinking of a top percentage of American professionals, turn them into rabid adherents of Cultural Marxism and globalism and then send them out into the world to create a progressive trickle-down effect in every major corporate and political institution.  In other words, the establishment believed that if they could dominate the professional class with their suits and lab coats and specialized degrees the rest of the public would blindly follow along due to \"expert bias.\".\n\nAs it turns out, they were wrong.\n\nIt took almost ten years to root out this tiny contingent of cult manipulators, but today the woke movement is well and thoroughly exposed.  Woke organizations and DEI departments are now in fast decline and even the activists are beginning to admit they're losing the battle for the minds of the masses.  Let's not forget, only a few years ago the political left denied the DEI agenda even existed and called anyone talking about it a \"conspiracy theorist.\"\n\nBig Tech companies like Meta and Google made cuts to DEI staffers and resource officers in 2023.  Dozens of major corporations are completely dropping their DEI initiatives in 2024.  The Hollywood Reporter recently published an article lamenting the fall of DEI in Hollywood, spotlighting a list of DEI producers in an effort to assert that leftist activists still have power in Tinsel Town despite their failing ideology.  Gay activist group GLAAD has complained that \"LGBT representation\" has started to decline in popular entertainment, with only 27% of films and television promoting gay and trans characters (given these people make up less than 3% of the global population, this level of representation is still far too high).\n\nThe reason for this precipitous collapse of DEI programs is three-fold:\n\nFirst, after central banks hiked interest rates and ended QE programs the floodgates of ESG money closed and dried up.  Venture capital disappeared and woke companies then had to rely on pure profits to stay afloat.\n\nSecond, the mass boycotting of woke companies proved beyond a doubt that there is no market for products that cater to DEI.  For many years we have been told that woke is the majority, and anti-woke is a fringe minority.  The truth is the exact opposite.\n\nThird, lawsuits over DEI hiring programs are forcing companies to admit there is an element of ant-white and anti-straight prejudice involved in their employment practices.  They are beginning to fear the backlash in civil courts, not to mention, hiring poorly qualified employees simply to check diversity boxes is a recipe for financial disaster.\n\nThere's a good reason why the corporate media loses their minds every time there's a successful boycott of a product like Bud Light or a progressive series like Star Wars: The Acolyte - Each time this happens the event stands as proof that the political left is a paper tiger, a tiny minority with no power or influence beyond their ties to corporations and governments.  They are an astroturf movement created by psychopathic billionaires and politicians.\n\nConsumers and the free market have spoken - They don't like DEI and will not buy DEI products.  But leftists insist the public is being \"misled\" by the right wing.  The only way they can keep the farce going is to continue to maintain DEI programs across the board despite public refusal to participate.  If corporate programs start to shut down then the entire facade is shattered.  DEI finally dies.\n\nThis is probably the motivation behind a recent push by the NAACP, the National Organization for Woman and other \"civil rights\" activist organizations to pressure companies to keep DEI departments in place.  At least 19 of these groups penned and published an open letter to corporate leaders of Fortune 1000 companies demanding that they stop cutting woke programs.\n\nThe groups claim that \"companies that abandon their DEI programs are shirking their fiduciary responsibility to employees, consumers and shareholders.\"\n\nTheir statement reads:\n\n\"Diversity, equity and inclusion programs, policies, and practices make business-sense and they're broadly popular among the public, consumers, and employees...But a small, well-funded, and extreme group of right-wing activists is attempting to pressure companies into abandoning their DEI programs...\"\n\nLeftists always gaslight by accusing their political opponents of engaging in the same kind of sabotage they engage in all the time.  In fact, these businesses only have a duty to their shareholders, and their shareholders are tired of losing money.  The \"corporate citizen\" narrative is not going to fly anymore in 2024.\n\nIf there was a market for DEI then it wouldn't matter if conservatives were boycotting these companies.  If woke activists were anything other than an insignificant portion of the population then they would be buying up woke products like crazy and proving conservatives wrong.  But, they don't because they can't.\n\nIn their letter, the civil rights organizations, which also included UnidosUS, the Urban League, Advocates for Trans Equality, the National Women's Law Center and the American Association of People with Disabilities, said divesting from DEI would alienate a wide range of consumers.  Again, the opposite is true.  DEI propaganda and hiring practices have greatly degraded company performance, product quality and they have politicized consumer markets in a way that has angered Americans.  Get woke, go broke.\n\nIt would be brand suicide to continue on this path, which is why so many companies are finally backing away.  However, is it too late?  Did corporations flirt with leftist ideology for too long and lose their customers forever?  Only time will tell.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "The Anti-Woke Collegiate Counterrevolution Is Just Beginning The real world might just be changing its approach to woke higher-ed.\n\nT he first 24 years of the 21 st century have been the era of Woke Supremacy in our institutions of higher learning. Universities have downplayed traditional academic standards and expectations while becoming centers for promoting ideologies centered around combatting perceived injustices, especially condemning perceived racist behavior while showing increasing contempt for the post-Enlightenment collegiate ideal of free expression of ideas. \"Social justice\" seems to be replacing \"academic excellence\" and the \"searching for truth and discovery\" on many college campuses. Whole new terms have arisen to describe 21st-century campus life, like \"trigger warnings,\" \"DEI\" (diversity, equity, and inclusion), \"cancel culture\" and \"self-censorship.\"\n\nA huge problem has arisen with emerging woke supremacy on campus: Public support for colleges is plummeting, most obviously manifested by a sustained decline in enrollments . Moreover, as anger over campus wokeness rises to a new crescendo in the wake of the Hamas invasion in Israel, more ominous things have started happening - most notably, multiple billionaire benefactors of the nation's richest elite universities have announced that they are going to stop donating.\n\nMeanwhile, some private schools are booming - mostly because they are decidedly anti-woke and are not mired by such despicable behaviors as students rioting and shouting down distinguished campus guests or engaging in anti-Semitic demonstrations. There has been a surge in applications and enrollments at very conservative, traditional Catholic schools. I started to notice the trend a year or so ago when, in the midst of generally falling church enrollment, I began seeing a few college students attending mass in my college town of Athens, Ohio. This year the number has grown exponentially, and it is not unusual to see a double-digit number of undergraduates at 8:30 a.m. Sunday mass where overall attendance is under 100.\n\nI know one of the group of avid Ohio University churchgoers, Henry Taylor, and he confirmed that students have bonded closely, even traveling long distances to attend more traditional Latin masses. So I was not too surprised to read a story in the Campus Fix on soaring enrollment in the more traditional Catholic colleges, schools like Belmont Abbey (North Carolina), the University of Mary (North Dakota), or Franciscan University of Steubenville (Ohio), where daily masses are so crowded they are standing room only. Faithful Catholics who read of drag shows being held at elite Notre Dame (drawing condemnation from the local Catholic bishop) may be steering their kids to schools maintaining centuries-long traditional values.\n\nIt is not just Catholics - evangelical and other conservative Protestant denominations started the trend decades ago (e.g. Liberty or Regent universities). Very conservative Brigham Young, the Harvard of Mormon higher education, seems to be booming as well despite its condemnations of promiscuous and nonconventional sexual behavior. By contrast, my university, fairly typically, practically drops condoms out of airplanes over campus to facilitate, if not explicitly encourage, student sexual activity. Traditional Christian schools with a conservative political orientation like Hillsdale College and Grove City College seem to be mostly thriving, unlike many other liberal arts schools.\n\nOther factors are at work. Businesses, who until recently seemed curiously uninvolved in the training of their future leaders, are waking up. They are becoming less rigid about degree requirements for positions, something that led to excessive credential inflation. Do you really need a master's in janitorial science to mop floors or a bachelor's in chemistry to mix drinks in an upscale bar? Meanwhile, prestigious large law firms, whose newly hired associates often make upwards of $200,000 annually, are saying , \"We will not interview or hire students involved in violent anti-Semitic campus demonstrations.\"\n\nIn short, after a lag of a decade, the Real World of productive Americans is catching on to the antics of academics and installing some discipline. There is more work to be done: For example, DEI apparatchiks need to be defanged and defunded. Colleges accepting unqualified students just to collect tuition fees (usually federally funded) should face real consequences when many fail to complete schooling - they should have skin in the game.\n\nIn a real-guard action, woke extremists will probably try to use accreditation to maintain leftish behavioral norms. \"You cannot scale down or eliminate your DEI office because it shows a lack of commitment to equity and inclusion of the disadvantaged\" or similar arguments. (The solution: simply end accreditation as we know it today, a subject for another epistle.) But the counterrevolution is beginning on American college campuses.\n\nRichard Vedder is a Distinguished Professor Emeritus at Ohio University and the author of Restoring the Promise: Higher Education in America .\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "The High-Water Mark of Woke Corporate Activism Corporations begin to align their policies with the values of their customers rather dictating values to them.\n\nI n July of 1863 at the battle of Gettysburg, Confederate forces reached their high-water mark during Pickett's charge. While no one knew it as a high-water mark at the time, that point marked the beginning of the end for the Southern cause. While singular events are viewed in the context of the moment, a high-water mark is a mystery of timing. It can only be discovered retrospectively as subsequent events unfold. Given recent developments in corporate America, it is now apparent that woke corporate activism has had its high-water mark.\n\nIn April 2023, at the start of the NCAA basketball March Madness, marketing executives from the Bud Light brand decided that the best way to communicate the attributes of their product to their target audience of mostly young, blue-collar males was to promote a sponsorship with transgender influencer and activist Dylan Mulvaney. By disregarding their target consumer and following the well-worn path of woke corporate activism, the Bud Light brand lost customers, market share, and revenue.\n\nWhile no one knew it at the time, Bud Light represented the high-water mark for woke corporate activism. The next 18 months marked the steady decline of woke corporate policies and practices culminating in the world's largest retailer, Walmart, announcing a halt to its DEI practices.\n\nBut how did we get to this point?\n\nBut how did we get to this point?\n\nNothing worked.\n\nThe brand continued its steady decline. Hot on the heels of Bud Light came a controversy at Target, where the retailer faced significant backlash surrounding the promotion of its Pride Month clothing toward children. Target subsequently removed some of the offensive items from its stores and scaled back Pride Month displays in response to the controversy.\n\nNext came one of the biggest blows to woke corporate activism, a 2023 Supreme Court ruling that effectively ended affirmative action in college admissions. The ruling has since been used against various diversity programs in corporate America. Additional dominoes fell across the corporate landscape as companies like Ford, Boeing, and Harley-Davidson abandoned their DEI initiatives in direct response to customer sentiment, a changing social landscape, and scrutiny by conservative activists. Lastly, Walmart recently announced that the company was abandoning its DEI policies, all but signaling the end of woke corporate activism.\n\nWalmart's announcement cuts across multiple areas of the company . The term \"DEI\" has been eliminated from company documents and job titles. Quotas for collaborating with suppliers designated as \"diversity partners\" have been dropped. The company elected not to renew a multimillion-dollar commitment to the Center for Racial Equity. Walmart will even remove some LGBTQ merchandise from its shelves, will stop providing company data to the Human Rights Campaign, and will reevaluate the company's participation in Pride Month events.\n\nWalmart's move is particularly impactful for three reasons. First, as the world's largest retailer and number one private-sector employer in the United States, Walmart sets an example for others to follow. It is likely that other firms will follow Walmart's lead. Second, Walmart is aligning its policies with the expectations and values of its customers rather than dictating values to them, learning from the mistakes of Bud Light. Third, Walmart is clearly responding to the changes coming in the wake of the recent presidential election.

      "text": "The True Victims of Woke Corporations From debanking to companies policing religious employees, the cost of corporate bias is a human one.\n\nS teve Happ never expected helping Ugandan orphans could be considered controversial.\n\nA career IT professional, Steve caught the passion for world missions after meeting a new family at his church outside Memphis, Tenn.: the Birungis, who'd come to America seeking medical treatment for their son Omega's brain tumor. After striking up a friendship, Steve felt the call not only to visit Uganda (where the father, Medad Birungi, was a pastor) but to create a way to help the people there directly.\n\nAfter visiting Africa for the first time in 2012, Steve tells me he encountered a critical barrier to his plans for ministry: \"No foreigner can understand Uganda well enough to do ministry there.\" Having lived in Tennessee, Steve realized that his impact could be better spent helping ministries built by and for Ugandans, already working within the region.\n\nSteve began searching for existing Ugandan ministries to align with and support through the assistance of American donors and philanthropists, and Indigenous Advance Ministries was born. Last August, the group had been operating for eight years serving as a vital conduit between Ugandan schools and orphanages and American financial support networks.\n\nAnd that's when everything changed.\n\nOne morning last April, Steve was sorting through his mail and discovered five identical letters from Bank of America, all referencing accounts to which Happ was a signatory, with a simple but life-changing message on them. \"Upon review of your account,\" the letters read, \"we have determined you're operating in a business type we have chosen not to service at Bank of America.\"\n\nWith no explanation given, Steve immediately began making calls to sort out what he believed must be some kind of mistake. \"We'd used Bank of America since 2015,\" he explained to me, noting that the bank's services were always top-notch, especially for a nonprofit manager who went to Uganda as often as four times a year. At least, they had been.\n\nThe answers to Steve's calls were all the same. \"We can't discuss this with you.\" When Steve pressed, asking what business type the bank actually considered Indigenous Advance Ministries to be, he was given the same answer. Upon visiting his local Bank of America branch, Steve described his experience with the branch manager. \"She was initially surprised, left the room, and when she came back, it was like she turned into a robot: 'We can't discuss it.'\"\n\nWeeks later, Steve got another letter from Bank of America that only served to deepen the mystery: his nonprofit \"no longer align[ed] with the bank's risk tolerance.\"\n\nIndigenous Advance Ministries had been debanked.\n\nIn the abstract, debanking broadly refers to a process by which companies shutter a client's access to banking services over perceived risk of various types (legal, reputational, etc). But in the real world, Steve Happ had 30 days to sort out exactly what had happened to his nonprofit, and the more than $100,000 his partners in Uganda depended on. (RELATED: Buying Guns and Bibles Might Just Get You Debanked )\n\nActually, no he didn't - his next trip to Uganda left in a week, giving him seven days to sort out a banking problem that his bank categorically refused to talk with him about. (RELATED: The Biden Big Government/Big Banks Surveillance Collusion )\n\nAs Steve and I talked, he laid out the chaos of that next Uganda trip, with the nonprofit's banking status still hanging in the balance. \"I get to Uganda and I can't access money. There's 7 employees I can't pay. We have partner ministries we can't give money to.\" One partner ministry was an orphanage in Mukono with almost two dozen children. If not for an unfathomably lucky purchase of bulk food Happ made shortly prior, Indigenous Advance's debanking could have easily meant further hunger to those orphans - and further hardship to its Ugandan employees.\n\nAs the media broke the story, he told me he got calls from Bank of America offering a willingness to discuss reinstating his accounts. But, as he told me, he wasn't interested in trusting any more of Indigenous Advance's future to a company whose negligence could have easily been the end of the nonprofit. \"It was the whole range of emotions: anger, disbelief was one of the biggest ones. I couldn't believe this was actually happening,\" he tells me. \"I kept thinking if I could find the right person to talk to, they could explain this was all a mistake.\"\n\nSteve never truly received a conclusive answer about why he was debanked - or why, despite his personal accounts also being listed with Bank of America, only his ministry's funds were targeted: \"I could forgive them for an algorithm change, but to not have an appeals process?\"\n\nThe skepticism about other potential motives is high. Indigenous Advance went on to file a consumer complaint against Bank of America in partnership with legal advocacy group Alliance Defending Freedom, raising questions about whether the ministry was targeted for its Christian beliefs, in direct violation of the bank's own Code of Conduct that commits to respecting diversity of its customers' religious views.\n\n\"No American should have to worry that a financial institution will deny them service based on their religious beliefs, but Bank of America appears to have done just that with Indigenous Advance,\" said ADF senior counsel Jeremy Tedesco. And, as Steve tells me, after the ADF angle hit the news cycle, he began to receive letters from other ministry leaders saying, \"The same thing happened to my ministry.\"\n\n\"Was it several different banks that did this?\" I asked. \"No,\" Steve responded. \"It was all Bank of America.\"\n\nMaybe Bank of America has a problem with the religious nonprofits who rely on it for financial services. The bank maintains that this isn't the case, but its lack of plausible rationale regarding numerous debanking cases, such as Indigenous Advance and global pastoral training organization Timothy Two Project International , certainly isn't helping its case.\n\nAnd Bank of America's current position, highlighted in Trump's recent address at Davos, as the most notorious offender on suspicious cases of debanking, including Indigenous Advance, is reminding the world of how shaky its track record on institutional neutrality really is.\n\nIt's easy to think about corporate politicization as something that happens in the abstract, in numbers and industries and returns (all of which profoundly impact real people, to be very clear). But when it comes to the 22 Ugandan orphans who almost went hungry because an American bank decided that the ministry feeding them didn't pass muster? These are the human costs of corporate politicization - and the disingenuous responses of many companies to such trends being called out.\n\nSometimes though, the politicization problem isn't a decision made for vague reasons that puts livelihoods in jeopardy. Sometimes it's just a company's decision to opine on things that don't neatly fall within the boundaries of business.\n\nIn 2015, James Brown was working on web analytics for Adobe, when he logged on to one of the company's internal websites, normally a commenting forum for announcing work events. Except what he found had nothing to do with work - it was a statement about the then-recent Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges legalizing same-sex marriage. With an open comments section.\n\nBrown, who worked in Utah and told me he'd been a member of the Mormon church for decades, decided to weigh in on the discussion. In response to a fellow employee slamming the socially conservative Family Research Council, citing the Southern Poverty Law Center's labeling of the FRC as a hate group, Brown responded that the standards used by the SPLC to determine its hate group list, often characterized as a politicized and biased grouping, including \"marches,\" \"rallies,\" and \"leaflets,\" would apply to many groups that obviously aren't hate groups, including members of the LGBTQ+ community. (RELATED: The Loser of the Year: The Southern Poverty Law Center )\n\nWhile several employees voiced similar sentiments, several other employees criticized Brown, and the comments section was later turned off completely. Shortly after, one of the company's vice presidents delivered Brown a written warning, informing him that his comments were \"inappropriate for the workplace ... offensive and hurtful to a number of employees ... [and] inconsistent with Adobe's values and policies.\"\n\nDespite the warning, Brown asked for clarification, noting that Adobe's censure of him for expressing his views in a public forum potentially ran afoul of the Utah Antidiscrimination Act which forbids employment discrimination based on religion.\n\nIn response, Adobe retracted the written warning from Brown's personnel file - a step a different vice president informed him was unheard of in the past. But the damage may have been done as it was. After Brown's web analytics team was laid off due to business cuts, James applied to work at other internal Adobe teams without success. There's no way to know, but Brown says he suspects he was on an internal HR blacklist.\n\nJames retired several years later, but he still remembers his experience at Adobe and says he felt remarkably targeted. \"As far as I'm the only one that got in trouble for [making employee comments].\"\n\nJames' story isn't a dramatic story about jeopardized livelihoods in the Third World, like the tragic story of Indigenous Advance. But it is a complication - a hurdle in his corporate career that could have easily been avoided by Adobe simply not opining (and what's more, encouraging employees to opine) on social and political issues that aren't connected to core business.\n\nAnd when we talk about corporate bias, we have to remember: the impact stories are human stories. James Brown. Steve Happ. The schoolchildren in Uganda. These are the people who get affected by corporations veering off the fiduciary mark.\n\nIn a moment where the chickens of corporate bias are increasingly coming home to roost, we can't afford to forget this critical reality: The free enterprise system has always been built on advancing human flourishing. And as such, America's biggest companies getting out of politics and back into a business-first approach is really a people-first approach. We forget that at our peril - and as the Mukono orphans remind us, that approach is only a few bad decisions away from being destroyed.\n\nREAD MORE from Isaac Willour :\n\nShould We Believe Facebook on Free Speech?\n\nThe Rise and Fall of Candace Owens, Right-Wing Provocateur\n\nHarvard's Stupidly Obvious Affirmative-Action Fix\n\nIsaac Willour oversees shareholder engagement at Bowyer Research, America's leading pro-fiduciary proxy consulting firm.

      "text": "You'll Never Woke Alone Under wokeness and incivility, college enrollments continue to decline.\n\nM y apologies to Oscar Hammerstein, whose song \" You'll Never Walk Alone \" from his great 1945 musical Carousel with Richard Rodgers not only is one of the great triumphs of the American musical theater but later became the anthem for an English football team and other sporting organizations. I think my slightly revised title should become the anthem of the American Council on Education (ACE), the Association of American Universities (AAU), and/or other higher-education groups that gather to piously pontificate and party periodically.\n\nAmerica is ripe for a new revolution in thinking about higher learning.\n\nAmerica is ripe for a new revolution in thinking about higher learning.\n\nNot only has \"wokeness\" grievously damaged American higher education, importantly contributing to the dramatic decline in public confidence in our colleges, but its intellectually poisonous effects have spread to other sectors of American life, especially business, fundamentally challenging the private free-market, profit-driven model that is the single most important reason why the United States over the course of the 20th century became the world's most successful nation, a magnet for the poor and oppressed across the planet.\n\nThe Cold War, lasting roughly from 1945 to 1990, came to an end due to the courage and imagination of American leaders like Ronald Reagan and George Shultz and Soviet leaders like Mikhail Gorbachev and Eduard Shevardnadze, all of whom overcame the hard-liners on both sides who believed a negotiated agreement to wind down hostilities between the two superpowers was impossible. We need similar thinking and action to end the scourge that wokeness is inflicting on higher education and American life.\n\nCollegiate wokeness is largely both a cause and consequence of a political mindset that rejects the tolerance and civility of traditional academic discourse in favor of an ideological zeitgeist eerily reminiscent of old Marxist and Nazi thinking, in which there is only one Truth that must be discussed and ultimately venerated - a quasi-religion masquerading as God. Similar to Nazism, this ideology grew out of fundamentally racist and sexist thinking: Attention to biological characteristics like race and gender were considered of paramount importance in assessing and advancing the human condition. Fortunately, to the electoral multitudes rather well educated in past generations, this woke supremacy is viewed with suspicion and outright alarm, as the rise in anti-DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) legislative initiatives indicates.\n\nAs higher-education enrollment has fallen for 11 straight years - from 2011 through 2022 - businesses and even governments have started to relax the credential inflation that nearly made it necessary to have a master's degree in janitorial science in order to mop floors or a degree in chemistry to become a bartender (like most academics, I exaggerate a bit). We are rediscovering that some higher learning can occur in less than four years at institutions without \"college\" or \"university\" in their title.\n\nUp to this point, the ACE/AAU crowd, which thinks it represents American higher education, has lavishly funded and encouraged the DEI anti-merit and anti-free-expression approach. The market response (fewer students) and political fallout (more restraints imposed from politicians on collegiate behavior) to date have not much impacted the woke zealousness of the heads of universities or their largely subservient and often clueless governing boards. But that is starting to change. Federal dropping of money out of airplanes on college campuses, or its equivalence, helped colleges forestall fiscal disaster over the last three years, but that money is running out. The Biden administration has little clout in the short run - and, very possibly, in the long run - to restore bailouts for its academic allies who are de facto wards of the state.\n\nThis is to say that America is ripe for a new revolution in thinking about higher learning. Fresh, new ideas are needed. I am attending a conference shortly at a leader in innovative approaches, the new University of Austin , where some of the best and brightest university names are contemplating how the academy can achieve the needed three \"Rs\" - recovery, reform, and revitalization -similar conceptually but not in content to the three New Deal \"R\" monikers of relief, recovery, and reform. Or, to invoke two other cries from the distant past: \" It's time for a change \"; \" Give me liberty, or give me death !\"\n\nRichard K.

But I know it when I see it, and the motion picture involved in this case is not that.\" - Potter Stewart, Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U.S. 184 (1964)\n\nThe phrase \"I know it when I see it\" regarding hard-core pornography was coined by Justice Potter Stewart in his concurring opinion in the Supreme Court case of Jacobellis v. Ohio . Stewart captured so succinctly what constitutes hard-core pornography without actually defining it.\n\nSome use a similar approach when it comes to what constitutes \"woke\": you know it when you see it. This is because many have struggled in defining the term.\n\nAs a long-time observer of public behavior, I have crafted the definition of \"woke\" that so many have sought. Bookmark this website and share it with friends.\n\nWoke - A progressive ideology heavily influenced by Marxism that attempts to upend norms of behavior and accountability in civilized society by promoting flawed beliefs, failed causes and dangerous actions.\n\nThere is more. Woke tenets include:\n\n• Merit is a crime against humanity.\n\n• Equality should be replaced with equity.\n\n• All societal ills must be blamed on white supremacism and toxic masculinity.\n\n• The wounds of racial divides should fester and be exploited rather than be healed.\n\n• Select minorities are incapable of success unless the white community intervenes with the force of government. Those minorities that do succeed on their own must be restrained.\n\n• Minorities who fail to adhere to progressive beliefs are traitors to their race, ethnicity, creed and nationality.\n\n• The sexual revolution is defined by any manufactured notion of what constitutes an individual's sex because biological sex simply does not exist.\n\n• Science is not defined by the laws of nature, but by fleeting political whims.\n\n• The rule-of-law to protect individuals and property is meaningless; law enforcement and the judiciary must be used to strike down political opponents.\n\n• History must be rewritten to promote favored political narratives rather than document events with historical accuracy.\n\n• The free expression of ideas is not permitted if it offends fragile sensitivities and then the speaker may be shouted down and permanently banned from participating in public discussions.\n\n• Truthful speech that offends progressive thoughts must be labeled \"hate speech.\"\n\n• Individuals must be \"canceled\" for merely holding disfavored beliefs.\n\n• Having a liberal grievance - real or imagined - is a license for rioting, destruction, theft, and assault.\n\n• Tolerance is forcing an individual to violate their conscience so that you may satisfy yours.\n\n• Violence is defined as using politically incorrect words, phrases, and by expressing certain beliefs, but property destruction and physical assault are accepted means of expression when committed by the favored mobs.\n\n• Young adults cannot be held responsible for poor life choices, including mismanaged finances, whereas pre-adolescents are mature enough to give consent to permanent, life-altering body mutilation and sexual relations with adults.\n\n• Sound business practices must give way to social activism.\n\n• The military, first responders, tradesmen, farmers, and those without a college degree make no meaningful contributions to society and must be ignored.\n\n• Virtue signaling by the snooty elite is held in higher regard than actual acts of charity and kindness by the masses.\n\nBeing woke is more than being pretentious about how much one cares about a social issue. Wokeism is used as a weapon to bludgeon people, thoughts, and policies that do not comport with the neo-Marxist ideologies of today's progressives.\n\nMark Hyman is an Emmy award-winning investigative journalist.

      "text": "The Bell Tolls for Woke Humanities Professors Enrollment has declined, and soon the number of faculty will follow.\n\nC ollege enrollments in the humanities have declined , even more than the general fall in the numbers attending college. West Virginia University recently laid off numerous faculty in the humanities, especially foreign languages, and other schools have done so on a smaller scale.\n\nMoreover, graduates in such humanities as foreign languages or English literature on average fare less well than many other majors in the job market. In a recent talk to public university trustees in Ohio, I noted that two determinants of post-college vocational success are the perceived quality of the school where the student graduated and the field of study. Unless things change substantially, today's accounting and engineering majors are more likely to be driving fancy cars and belonging to the country club two decades from now than are those majoring in philosophy or English. Markets appear to be working: Enrollment shifts suggest resources are moving from less productive uses (studying English and philosophy) to more productive ones (studying accounting, economics, and electrical engineering).\n\nREAD MORE from Richard K. Vedder: Free Speech? Not on College Campuses.\n\nNonetheless, I have been increasingly uneasy about some attacks on the humanities by politicians, university governing boards, and others. The American Academy of Arts and Sciences (AAAS) has published a new report , using \"five years of pooled data\" from the American Community Survey of the Census Bureau, showing that in all but four very small states, humanities college graduates make over 40 percent more after school than do high school graduates. College French majors do not fare as well as economists, but they still fare far better than high school graduates - ignorance is not economic bliss. Moreover, from my study of the Census data compiled by AAAS, the humanities graduate also makes more than education graduates and earns nearly the same on average as those in the behavioral and social sciences. For example, in New York the median earnings of humanities graduates - $83,822 - was less than 3 percent smaller than that for behavioral and social science graduates ($85,641), and about 90 percent higher than median high school graduate earnings. Studying Shakespeare in college is not financially debilitating.\n\nSpeaking personally, three score and four years ago, I was an economics major at Northwestern University and liked my courses and professors enough that I successfully made that field my career. But the three individual courses that I most fondly remember today were one in English literature, where professor Bergen Evans captivated an audience of literally hundreds interpreting King Lear for weeks on end; a similar course studying the plays of Molière, Racine, and Corneille (in French) - Shakespeare's 17 th- century rivals as leading European playwrights; and a magnificent survey course in Western civilization, whose main textbook I still occasionally consult. My courses in the humanities gave me a lot of deferred gratification. I think that these and similar did a lot to help me comprehend the human condition in its many manifestations.\n\nMore generally, I think courses in the humanities tend to make students into better critical thinkers and communicators (especially in writing), shaping them ultimately into more productive persons even in a narrow financial sense. One reason why humanities majors do about as well as ones in the behavioral and social sciences is that a huge proportion ( about 40 percent ) of them go on for other graduate and professional degrees. Over the years, appearing in scores of courtrooms (as an expert witness), I have encountered many highly successful lawyers who were English or philosophy majors.\n\nIf all this is true, why then are humanities enrollments in the doldrums? I think that to a considerable extent, it is because they are dominated by angry, woke persons who have a lot of contempt for the American Dream and American exceptionalism. I suspect college enrollments in general fell over the past decade because a large number of American students, and especially their parents, became increasingly uncomfortable with what was being taught. They do not like when they read about or watch angry university students condemning Israel after the Jews have suffered their worst catastrophe since the Holocaust. Do I want to send my kids or grandkids to study under professors who glorify what I regard as truly verbal excremental filth? Is it no wonder leading law firms have said they will not be hiring graduating students who participated in this morally repulsive behavior! (RELATED: The Barbarians Within the Ivy League Gates )\n\nMeanwhile, as enrollments have plummeted in the humanities - often taught by ultra-progressive faculty - that has not been the case in such areas as engineering or business, where enrollments have generally been relatively robust. Have you ever heard of a woke accounting professor? I suspect they are as rare as Republican sociologists. Wokeness, a significant part of the reason for American collegiate decline, is centered to a considerable degree in the humanities. As a Brown University philosopher professor and writer of some distinction, Felicia Nimue Ackerman, opined recently (in the Wall Street Journal ), \"[H]ow come many humanities professors are self-important, status-conscious jerks?\"\n\nEnrollments have been in decline since 2010 at a large portion of America's universities, and the 21 st- century worldwide aversion to having children suggests that the pool of college-age kids will fall meaningfully in coming years. Financially hard-pressed university presidents will be forced to slash administrative staff supporting the Woke Conspiracy, such as aggressively racist DEI apparatchiks. But they also will find it fiscally necessary and academically appropriate to reduce the number of humanities faculty. Borrowing from John Donne and Ernest Hemingway, the bell is tolling for the woke professors who have done so much to harm the study of the humanities in America.\n\nRichard Vedder is Distinguished Professor Emeritus at Ohio University, Senior Fellow at the Independent Institute, and author of the forthcoming book Let Colleges Fail: Creative Destruction in Higher Education .\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "University of Michigan Might Walk Back Woke Policies University leadership considers monumental change to DEI policies.\n\nT he University of Michigan pioneered diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives long before \"DEI\" became common parlance. Today, Michigan has the largest DEI bureaucracy of any large public university in the nation. But after spending a quarter of a billion dollars on DEI since 2016, leadership isn't sure their investment paid off.\n\nThe university's regents and board are considering significant reforms to the school's DEI initiative that would redirect efforts away from diversity statements in hiring and promotion and instead foster \"recruitment programs and tuition guarantees for lower-income students.\" As of Dec. 5, the university \"will no longer solicit diversity statements as part of faculty hiring, promotions, and tenure.\"\n\nThough other schools have reformed their DEI practices under pressure from state legislatures, Michigan could be one of the \"first selective public universities to rethink D.E.I from the inside,\" the New York Times reports .\n\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives enjoyed popular support in the social justice surge of 2020. And though conservatives were skeptical from the start, DEI efforts have come under increasing scrutiny by mainstream moderates and liberals alike. Where the Right - and, increasingly, the political center - criticizes DEI for suppressing viewpoint diversity and encouraging racial division, the Left sees DEI as virtue signaling that doesn't sufficiently disrupt the status quo.\n\nStudents, faculty, and staff have criticized Michigan's DEI programs from both angles. A 2021 survey conducted at the main Ann Arbor campus found that students felt \"less of a sense of belonging\" and a \"less positive campus climate\" than before the program's start in 2016. These findings aren't surprising given the DEI program's bureaucratic grievance process pits professors and students against each other.\n\nAt the beginning of a semester, one professor acknowledged his intentions to be \"sensitive to social justice issues\" and encouraged his students to \"'call me on it' if he failed.\" A student filed a Title IX complaint because that professor had \"wrongly asked women in the class to educate their professor about sexism and had failed to fully acknowledge his privilege.\"\n\nOthers are frustrated that the school's DEI initiatives don't go far enough. University of Michigan Black Student Union speaker Princess-J'Maria Mboup called the school's DEI initiatives \"superficial.\" She told the New York Times that \"the students that are most affected by D.E.I. - meaning marginalized communities - are invested in the work, but not in D.E.I. itself.\"\n\nIn the Michigan Daily student newspaper, Mboup clarified that, though she and her fellow leaders of the Black Student Union have criticized DEI \"as it relates to anti-Blackness and the University's hypocrisy and complicity in the Palestinian genocide,\" she does want their critiques to be \"flattened and conflated with critics who don't believe in diversity, equity, and inclusion.\"\n\nThis potential change at the University of Michigan reflects increasing uncertainty about what a second Trump term holds for higher education. Given the vast reliance by universities on federal grant money and federal student loans - and the growing political will to gut taxpayer-funded DEI initiatives - university administrators are right to be concerned.\n\nCorporate America has already started to realize the \"Go Woke, Go Broke\" reality. Outrage at Dylan Mulvaney's Bud Light commercial several years ago snowballed into a movement of consumers who don't want to spend money on products made by corporations that oppose their values. A number of companies have responded by walking back the excesses of their DEI programs. Lowe's, Harley-Davidson, Ford Motor Company, and, most recently, Walmart have announced the end of these initiatives. (RELATED: The High-Water Mark of Woke Corporate Activism )\n\nNow, higher education might be at a similar turning point. Between disruptive anti-Israel protests at elite universities across the nation and high-profile exposés of DEI corruption - like Claudine Gay's plagiarism - the problems plaguing higher education are obvious.\n\nSome schools are pivoting away from full-throated DEI measures. This past spring, Harvard University's Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology eliminated the requirement for job candidates to submit diversity statements. Now, changes at the University of Michigan could signal to other universities that they, too, should reform their practices.\n\nAlthough universities that scale back or redirect their DEI programs might receive support from the broader American population, they will face harsh criticism from stakeholders closer to home: faculty, staff, and students. After all, just the potential that the University of Michigan could reshape its DEI initiatives sparked a protest at the Ann Arbor campus.\n\nMary Frances (Myler) Devlin is a contributing editor at The American Spectator .

      "text": "Corporations' Woke Signaling Won't Override Profit Motive Virtue signaling theater does not benefit companies.\n\nM any people on the Right fear \"woke capitalism\" and the idea that corporate executives will bend to pressure to advance a vision of the world that replaces their values with progressive ones. To those who are worried, I say, be grateful for the profit motive. To the progressives pushing for such practices, I say, be careful what you wish for.\n\nRegular free-market capitalism has no conflict with companies spending their own money in pursuit of whatever goals they choose. Milton Friedman himself wouldn't raise an eyebrow over a devoted LTBGQ baker who bakes cakes only for same-sex weddings or a company that only hires workers from underrepresented minorities. But woke capitalism gets more controversial when the likes of Delta Air Lines, JPMorgan Chase, and Apple use inflammatory and questionable talking points against Georgia's voting-reform legislation, or when Major League Baseball pulls its All-Star Game from that state in protest.\n\n\"Woke\" is a loaded, political term. The passion it triggers obstructs the fact that behind the whole concept there is a genuine set of values, and many of them - like tolerance and equality of opportunity - are worth promoting. However, when practiced by corporations under pressure from vocal customers, employees, or even investors, woke capitalism often incentivizes high-noise, low-cost signaling rather than actual cultural changes.\n\nThere is some evidence, for instance, that some companies are more likely to be woke when it won't cost them many customers. I don't know whether that was on Delta executives' minds when, in 2018, they used a very public announcement to end a travel discount for NRA members flying to its annual convention. But with only 13 customers benefiting from the discount, Delta lost almost nothing. The company's wokeness didn't increase its share prices, according to at least one analysis, and there's no reason to believe it decreased gun violence.\n\nOther companies talk a big game but make no actual changes to their business models. A case in point is the group of 136 companies that first signed on to the Business Roundtable's statement on the \"Purpose of a Corporation,\" which boasts a commitment to deliver value not just to shareholders, but to all \"stakeholders,\" including customers, employees, suppliers, and communities. Yet two years after the signing, the companies' updated corporate governance guidelines showed no real change or attempt to elevate stakeholders. Most of them even reiterated their commitment to shareholders' primacy. Eighty-five percent didn't even report signing it in a proxy statement sent to their shareholders. The ones that mentioned it didn't add how they would change their business models.\n\nMore dispiriting examples include Wells Fargo employees interviewing \"diverse\" candidates even though positions had already been filled. The same thing seemed to happen to former Miami Dolphins head coach Brian Flores, who interviewed for the New York Giants' top coaching job three days after they allegedly promised it to a white candidate. Flores argues in a discrimination lawsuit that the team circumvented the NFL's diversity-driven Rooney Rule.\n\nDisheartening, too, are the recent firings of low-level employees at various companies for minor offenses following Twitter mob campaigns.\n\nBehind this whole mess is the progressive belief that demanding that a company sell you some mayonnaise with a side of social justice will be profitable for the cause and business. Both are unlikely. Attempts at measuring the profitability of wokeness reveal that many companies that build politically correct actions into their strategies could lose serious income and turn off large chunks of their consumer bases. Lost profits are bad for business sustainability, as Netflix's CEO seems to have finally understood.\n\nAnd who benefits from displays of woke virtue signaling? While they may not realize it, it's not those who hope and demand that companies be used as agents of change. It's not communities or members of underrepresented minorities, either. Nor does this theater bestow much benefit on the companies who do the virtue signaling.\n\nThis explains why some on the Left are now speaking up against woke capitalism. As Helen Lewis wrote in the Atlantic a few years ago, \"If you care about progressive causes, then woke capitalism isn't your friend.\"\n\nThe path forward is for CEOs and other company leaders to drop the culture warrior pretense and return their focus to supplying quality outputs to all their customers. Just as important, though, is for woke warriors to stop demanding that companies produce outcomes they aren't designed to deliver and instead focus on persuading people that their values are worth adopting.\n\nVeronique de Rugy is the George Gibbs Chair in Political Economy and a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.

      "text": "Woke College Fires Adjunct Art Instructor for Showing Illustrations of Muhammad The student newspaper also removed a letter that defended the instructor.\n\nI 'm always astonished when I come across the name of an American university that I've never heard of in my entire life. It happens pretty often. It's amazing how many of these places there are. Now that I've finally checked, I've discovered that, at least according to one list, there are 1,762 \"chartered, licensed or accredited\" institutions in the U.S. that offer \"at least four-year undergraduate degrees (bachelor degrees) or postgraduate degrees (master or doctoral degrees)\" and that deliver courses \"predominantly in a traditional, face-to-face, non-distance education format.\"\n\nThe latest such institution to find its way onto my radar is Hamline University in St. Paul, Minnesota. Established in 1854, it's the oldest university in the state.  According to Wikipedia, it's \"known for its emphasis on experiential learning, service, and social justice.\" Which may explain why I've never heard of any of the 48 people on Wikipedia's list of Hamline's \"notable alumni.\" Nor, for that matter, have I ever heard of its current president, Fayneese S. Miller, the former director of Brown University's Center for the Study of Race and Ethnicity in America and founder of its Ethnic Studies Department.\n\nAnyway, I finally became aware of Hamline as the result of a news story at Inside Higher Education. On Oct. 6, some poor soul who works as an adjunct instructor at Hamline - which means earning a per-course income of about $5,000 every semester - was teaching a class in art history. The works under discussion that day included a couple of illustrations of Muhammed, one dating back to 14th-century Persia and the other to 16th-century Turkey. Because the instructor was aware that some Muslims nowadays are, shall we say, touchy about images of their prophet, she informed her students ahead of time that she'd be showing them these pictures and told them that, if they wished, they could leave the room for the duration.\n\nThat warning turned out to be insufficient. As it happened, one of the students in the course was Aram Wedatalla, president of Hamline's Muslim Student Association (MSA), who went straight to the top with a complaint about the adjunct's vile action. The next day, Miller, the university president, met with Wedatalla, and Patti Kersten, the dean of students, phoned Wedatalla to apologize for the traumatic experience she'd endured. Later, in an interview with Hamline's student newspaper, the Oracle, Wedatalla recounted her response to the adjunct's actions: \"I'm like, 'this can't be real.'... As a Muslim, and a Black person, I don't feel like I belong, and I don't think I'll ever belong in a community where they don't value me as a member, and they don't show the same respect that I show them.\"\n\nThat was only the beginning. On Oct. 10, members of the MSA and their adviser, Nur Mood - who is also Hamline's assistant director of social justice programs and strategic relations - \"met with members of the administration ... to discuss the incident and how to move forward.\" Mood later told the Oracle that the adjunct's action was something she'd never expected to happen at Hamline \"in a million years.\" While acknowledging that the administration had been spreading around \"a lot of apologies,\" Mood complained that university officials had been insufficiently focused on \"the healing process.\"\n\nAt some point during all this trauma, the administration invited Jaylani Hussein, head of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) - a notorious terrorist-group front - to lead a \"community conversation\" on Hamline's campus about the evils of Islamophobia. On Nov. 7, David Everett, Hamline's associate vice president for inclusive excellence - yes, that's his title - publicly stated that the adjunct's actions had been \"undeniably inconsiderate, disrespectful, and Islamophobic\"; two days later, he announced that the adjunct's employment had been terminated.\n\nThere's still more. In a Dec. 6 letter to the Oracle, Mark Berkson, who teaches religion at Hamline, actually dared to defend the adjunct, pointing out that \"Muslims have created and enjoyed figural representations of Muhammad throughout much of the history of Islam in some parts of the Islamic world.\" Alas, shortly after posting Berkson's letter on its website, the Oracle 's editors took it down - because, they explained, some members of the \"Hamline community\" claimed that it had \"caused them harm.\"\n\nAnd on and on it went. On Dec. 9, Everett and Miller, Hamline's president, wrote a letter to the university community affirming that \"respect for the observant Muslim students in that classroom should have superseded academic freedom.\" They added: \"Academic freedom is very important, but it does not have to come at the expense of care and decency toward others.\" Needless to say, this kind of logic could be used to justify any and all limits on free speech. Plus a fact, to limit free speech in order to avoid offending Muslims is, quite simply, to replace American constitutional liberty with a concept of freedom rooted in sharia.\n\nDuring these weeks, while various worthies were making public statements about the earthquake that had taken place in that classroom on Oct. 6, one voice was conspicuous by its absence: that of the adjunct herself. The media that have covered this story haven't provided her name; nor has she come forward. But if Hamline's undergraduate course listings for Fall 2022 can be relied on, there's only one course that sounds remotely like the one in question. It's World Art (ARTH 1100-1), taught by Erika Lopez Prater. Classes were held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 8 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. - which means that she had to drag herself out of bed at about 6 in the morning twice a week - in ice-cold Minnesota! - so she could race to Hamline and expound on medieval art before sunrise.\n\nIf Lopez Prater is indeed the teacher who was fired for showing her students artwork, why hasn't she come forward? It occurred to me that perhaps, like many adjuncts I've known, she cobbles together her annual income, such as it is, by running from one college campus to another - teaching a course here, a course there - and that, having lost her gig at Hamline, she's more desperate than ever not to endanger her jobs elsewhere by going public. Sure enough, it turns out that Lopez Prater teaches art history at Macalester College (also in St. Paul) and has recently been an adjunct at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design.\n\nMs. Lopez Prater, I urge you: if you're the woman at the center of this controversy, please come forward. Speak up. Have your say. You're a serious but criminally underpaid educator who's been outrageously wronged by fatuous, cowardly administrators who are lavishly compensated for enforcing identity-group despotism. The blow they've struck against free speech and liberal education can't be allowed to stand. If you weigh in on this absurdity, you'll be a heroine to millions. In any case, there surely must be better ways for you to go forward with your life than to stay silent so you can keep earning a pauper's wage.\n\n2022: Academia's Worst Year Yet?\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "Is the New York Times Shaking Off Woke? A 'Times' critic suggests woke movies seem way past their sell-by date.\n\nF or ten years, half of them in this magazine, I have rung the death knell for Hollywoke. Earlier this month, the unlikeliest source joined the bellringing - the New York Times . And when the Gray Lady backs up a conservative outcast like me, you know it's the end of Hollywood as we know it, and I predicted it.\n\nBut the current James Bond is just the ultimate manifestation of the dying art of cinema.\n\nAs a movie writer and critic, I understood that once leftist ideology sublimated art, the whole business would collapse like the Soviet Union. Because it required driving out true artists, including the liberal kind who value storytelling over messaging, then replacing us with feminist hacks that despise normal men and traditionalist women.\n\nMost of my peers in the screen trade cheered my expulsion, a good number of them my former friends. They forgot the unspoken rule of their philosophy, \"You can never be woke enough.\" When the grim reaper came for their jobs, it didn't matter that they'd cursed Trump and supported baby murder. They were straight white males, thus personae non grata. Now they can't find work. Though, to add to their pain, Donald Trump did - 47th President of the United States.\n\nThe feminist women and beta males who displaced us in the last two decades had little of our talent, only a mandatory anti-man, anti-white, pro-queer agenda. But they inherited one enormous advantage from liberal weaklings: Centuries of narrative art they could never have created yet now control, a treasure trove of epic heroes and romantic heroines to corrupt and exploit - the legacy of Hans Christian Anderson, the Brothers Grim, J. R. R. Tolkien, Walt Disney, Ian Fleming, Stan Lee, Gene Rodenberry, George Lucas, and countless others.\n\nAnd despoil them they have, in a long dissembly line of minority-inclusive woke garbage: The Little Mermaid featuring a black starlet, The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power de-Christianizing and confusing Tolkien's masterpiece, the sexless Avengers movies (the stars of which humiliated themselves in a cringeworthy political ad for Kamala), fake female-driven mutations of Star Wars , Star Trek , and Indiana Jones , and the forthcoming embarrassment Snow White, starring the most obnoxious actress of the century, Latina Rachel Zegler.\n\nAll of these travesties are meant to reorient fans of the original properties to the new matriarchy. In advancing such an idiocy, their caretakers deny normal boys and girls the fun their predecessors enjoyed from the initial versions. Yet they keep expecting kids, parents, and grandparents to subsidize their garbage. Naturally, they have stayed away in droves, except when conned by a pretty bauble like Barbie .\n\nAs I've stated for years, no fictional icon has been more emasculated this century than the greatest male hero of the Twentieth, James Bond. In my review here of the last 007 atrocity, No Time to Die , starring overrated asexual mope Daniel Craig, I chronicled every politically correct subtraction of the character. And now even the leftist New York Times agrees with me - and my long communicated view on the screen trade - in a recent piece, \" Is the Awkward 'Diversity Era' of Hollywood Behind Us?\" , sub-headlined The past decade's clumsiest attempts to cram new faces into old stories now feels like a moment, and a genre, of their own. Article writer Kabir Chibber echoes my criticism of the James Bond devolution via the wretched No Time to Die .\n\nOther films tried too hard to correct the past, judging their original white male protagonists far more harshly than anyone in the audience did. In the final James Bond film from Daniel Craig, \"No Time to Die,\" Bond has been replaced as Agent 007 by a Black woman, played by Lashana Lynch (can you remember her name or her drink of choice?); he obsesses over girlfriends dead and alive; he is unable to seduce. (A much younger Ana de Armas laughs at the thought.) By the end, you're just happy that this poor man, now totally out of time, has been put out of his misery. The old Bond films are distinctly of their era but feel timeless; what's surprising is how quickly this one, in its desperation to be modern, has come to feel dated.\n\nI had to read the last line twice to make sure I hadn't written it. The old Bond films are distinctly of their era but feel timeless; what's surprising is how quickly this one, in its desperation to be modern, has come to feel dated. In fact, I have written the very same thought many times. The magnificent, enduring film creation of producers Albert Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, director Terence Young, and brilliant actor Sean Connery fell into the hands of Broccoli's untalented feminist daughter Barbara Broccoli, who couldn't have imagined such a hero, and has done much to destroy him. She actually killed him off in the last film, to no real fan's regret.\n\nBut the current James Bond is just the ultimate manifestation of the dying art of cinema. The sad woke lot killing it off have no idea how to resuscitate it and wouldn't if they could, because it would mean going against the Message. That women are no physical match for men, don't wish to be, appreciate real ones, and desire to be romanced by them.\n\nPast filmmakers knew these truths to be self-evident. Practically every movie shown on Turner Classic Movies (TCM) has more human insight and verve than any dark anti-human effort made this century. And many of their writers were women who understood the world, and didn't dream about reshaping it into something impossible. Some could even write fine Westerns validating male camaraderie, as Leigh Brackett did in two of the best, Rio Bravo and El Dorado .\n\nI remember how wonderful moviegoing was shortly after Reagan got elected. In 1982, my friends and I went to the movies every night. We saw E.T., the Extra-Terrestrial , Tootsie , An Officer and a Gentleman , Rocky III , Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan , Poltergeist , Diner , Conan the Barbarian , Blade Runner , The Thing , Fast Times at Ridgemont High , The Year of Living Dangerously , First Blood , and The Verdict . I knew then it could never get any better. But who knows? Maybe with another revolutionary conservative President, and the end of Hollywoke, it will be.\n\nREAD MORE from Lou Aguilar:\n\nTrump and the Advent of the Pax Americana\n\nMAGA Animal House\n\nWant to really enjoy this merry post-election Christmas, and find out how it may have turned out the way it did?

Tom Cotton (R-AR) proposed legislation on Tuesday that would tax \"woke\" universities' endowments and cancel student loans for \"criminal\" protestors.\n\nCotton unveiled the Woke Endowment Security Tax (WEST) Act, a bill that would institute a six-percent excise tax on the endowments of 11 American universities, using the proceeds to pay down the national debt and secure the southern border.\n\n\"We should levy this tax on these schools' endowments. A tax on the billions of dollars these schools have amassed would be more than enough to pay down our national debt or secure the southern border,\" Cotton said in a written statement, noting that many of these universities have become wellsprings of anti-Israel protests.\n\nThe excise tax would apply to secular institutions with endowments of at least $11.9 billion and secular institutions with endowments of at least $10.5 billion that also operate a state contract college. Cotton's office believes that the bill would generate $16.6 billion in revenue.\n\nThese institutions are Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Princeton, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Pennsylvania, Northwestern, Columbia, Washington University, Johns Hopkins, and Cornell.\n\nCotton also proposed the No Student Loans for Campus Criminals Act, a bill that would prevent any campus protestor convicted of a crime from receiving federal student loans or student loan relief.\n\n\"American taxpayers shouldn't underwrite the tuition of criminal, pro-Hamas protesters who deface their college campuses, disrupt classes, and endanger their fellow students. My bill will bring learning back to the heart of our American universities and institutions,\" Cotton said in a statement about the bill.\n\nRep.

      "text": "'Breitbart Posts Something, Congress Reacts': Democrat Congressman Credits Breitbart News for Killing Woke Museum Bill\n\nRep. Jared Huffman (D-CA) credited a Breitbart News story for killing the National Museum of Play Recognition Act.\n\n\"That's how it works these days,\" Huffman proclaimed on the House floor Wednesday. \"Breitbart posts something, Congress reacts.\"\n\nHouse Republican leadership previously announced a vote on the bill introduced by New York Democrat Rep. Joe Morelle to designate the Margaret Woodbury Strong Museum in Rochester, New York, as the \"National Museum of Play.\"\n\nHuffman said a Breitbart News report published Tuesday afternoon revealing some of the museum's more controversial programs spurred House Republicans to yank the bill.\n\n\"Shortly after the Breitbart post went up, this bill disappeared from the agenda,\"Huffman said Wednesday. \"It was pulled.\"\n\nBreitbart News reported Tuesday:\n\nA page on the museum's website dedicated to \"Toyetic Oppression: Black Toys and Black People\" asserts that is \"useful to explore Black playthings by whether they proliferate violence through Negrophobia or Negrophilia.\" It also includes a lesson titled \"Exploring the Genius of Black Women in Video Gaming.\" Another page is dedicated to \"feminism in the doll industry.\"\n\nThe museum also offers \"diversity and inclusion internships.\"\n\nHuffman, who called the bill \"innocuous,\" said from the House chamber \"We are told that many Republicans think the museum is too woke and too DEI. That's right, that's the explanation we've been given for why the deal's off and the Democratic bill can't be considered today.\"\n\nThe California Democrat described additional exhibits and statements from the museum, including \"a small temporary exhibit\" on \"the pivotal role that black designers have played in diversifying toy aisles\" and an Instagram post \"about Hispanic Ballerina Barbie\" and how those dolls \"come in various ethnicities and styles encouraging inclusivity and diversity.\"\n\n\"Are our Republicans friends just taking their orders from the far-right website Breitbart, which posted yesterday, attacking this museum for its content and for offering what it called 'Diversity and Inclusion Internships'?\"\n\nThe museum's own website refers to \"Diversity and Inclusion Internships.\"\n\nBreitbart News's initial report, which revealed the bill would be considered under suspension of the rules, read:\n\nBills advanced under suspension require two-thirds support but circumvent rules designed, in part, to ensure adequate time to scrutinize legislation. Suspension bills in practice are often assembled together in large packages requiring only one vote or voted on in quick succession.\n\nMany suspension bills target parochial issues, such as renaming post offices, important to individual members or a small constituency within their district. Members often look the other way at suspension bills they might ordinarily oppose in order to ensure their own bills can pass without issue.\n\nIn 2024 the museum received nearly $400,000 in taxpayer funding through the National Endowment of the Humanities.\n\nIn January, Axios reported on \"Breitbart's D.C. deployment\" and increasing influence in the nation's capitol. That same month, Politico reported a similar story: \"Trump's back - and so is Breitbart.\"\n\nBradley Jaye is Deputy Political Editor for Breitbart News.

When I contacted them, they were ready to make some BIG changes,\" he wrote:\n\n\"PepsiCo has 318,000+ employees and a market cap of more than $200 BILLION dollars. Those employees will now have a neutral workplace without feeling that divisive issues are being injected and this corporate neutrality will also extend to their many suppliers who will no longer feel pressure to endorse these policies,\" Starbuck added.\n\nHowever, Paul Chesser who is the director of the Corporate Integrity Project for the National Legal and Policy Center, is not so sure about Pepsi's recent announcement, telling Fox, \"If you check their website it still has DEI cr-p all over it... they're just pushing it below the surface.\"\n\nThe news comes as some DEI professionals are worried about losing their jobs as Trump fights against DEI practices, Breitbart News reported February 4.\n\nPepsi was also named among other companies that have scrubbed or softened their DEI language from annual reports to investors.\n\nAccording to NPR:\n\nThe companies that have recently deleted or softened their DEI language include Disney, Google, GM, GE, Pepsi, Intel, PayPal, Chipotle, Comcast, 3M, Regeneron, and Philip Morris, according to the NPR analysis. Most companies have not disclosed the reasons for the changes, although some told NPR that they are re-evaluating some of their DEI programs as well as examining Trump's executive orders.\n\nMeanwhile, Costco has apparently dug in its heels regarding its DEI policies while other companies back away from them, per Breitbart News.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

Lemley's decision comes in the wake of recent changes implemented by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, which the lawyer describes as a \"descent into toxic masculinity and Neo-Nazi madness.\"\n\nLemley, a partner at the law firm Lex Lumina, represented Meta in 2023 when comedian Sarah Silverman and other authors sued the company for allegedly violating copyright by training its Llama AI model on their written works. At the time, Meta's legal team argued that the claims should fail because the authors could not prove that the AI-generated text closely resembled their original content. The case is still ongoing.\n\nIn a LinkedIn post on Monday, Lemley expressed his disappointment with Meta's direction, stating, \"While I think they are on the right side in the generative AI copyright dispute in which I represented them, and I hope they win, I cannot in good conscience serve as their lawyer any longer.\" He also announced that he has deactivated his Threads account, as he does not want to \"support a Twitter-like site run by a Musk wannabe.\"\n\nLemley's woke meltdowncomes amidst a series of sweeping changes implemented by Zuckerberg since the start of the year. These changes include eliminating third-party fact-checking in the US in favor of community notes, reducing DEI initiatives, and Zuckerberg's recent statement that Meta needs more \"masculine energy.\"\n\nMany have drawn parallels between Zuckerberg's recent actions and those of Elon Musk, who has made similar changes to the social media platform X (formerly Twitter). Musk has been vocal in his opposition to DEI initiatives and biased left-wing content moderation, and has thrown his support behind right-leaning political parties and figures in Europe and the US. He is also a prominent supporter of President-elect Donald Trump and has been named co-lead of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.\n\nZuckerberg's shift in political stance and relationship with Trump is a marked departure from his previous approach. In 2020, he expressed disgust at the then-president's \"divisive and incendiary rhetoric\" on Facebook, and the platform subsequently barred Trump in 2021 for praising \"people engaged in violence at the Capitol on January 6.\" However, Meta reversed this decision two years later.\n\nRhett Millsaps, managing partner of Lex Lumina, commended Lemley's decision, stating, \"Money can't buy everyone. We're proud to be a firm that doesn't sell out our values. Sadly, it seems this is becoming a rarer and rarer quality in America today.\"\n\nRead more at Business Insider here.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

      "text": "Musk-Bashing Democrat Donor Pleads Guilty in Alleged Woke Fraud Scheme\n\nA Democrat donor who has heaped criticism on Elon Musk pleaded guilty to wire fraud as an alleged co-conspirator in an alleged woke investment fraud scheme, according to federal prosecutors in California.\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) on March 3 arrested Joseph Neal Sanberg, 45, a cofounder of Aspiration Partners Inc., which dubs itself a \"climate-friendly banking alternative\" on its website. The arrest stemmed from \"a federal criminal complaint alleging that he conspired to defraud two investor funds of at least $145 million,\" per a DOJ press release.\n\nMusk critic Ibrahim Ameen AlHusseini, 51, whom the DOJ labeled as \"Sanberg's coconspirator,\" was arrested in October and took a plea deal last month. AlHusseini, who founded the investment firm FullCycle, signed the agreement in February, and it was unsealed on the day of Sanberg's arrest. Per the DOJ, citing the plea deal, AlHusseini received about $12.3 million in payments via the alleged scheme.\n\nAspiration Partners Inc. had notable celebrity backers like Leonardo DiCaprio, Cindy Crawford, and Robert Downey Jr, the New York Post reported .\n\nThe DOJ wrote in a release:\n\nAccording to the complaint against Sanberg and AlHusseini's plea agreement, Sanberg obtained $145 million in loans secured by AlHusseini, who Sanberg knew did not have sufficient financial assets to cover those loans if Sanberg defaulted.  Sanberg hid this fact from investors, then defaulted on the loans, which resulted in at least a $145 million in losses.\n\nActing United States Attorney for the Central District of California, Joseph McNally, said authorities \"have worked methodically to secure a guilty plea from one of the main offenders in this case and have now charged another member of the conspiracy.\"\n\n\"We will continue to ensure that markets and businesses receive an honest and level playing field in which to operate,\" he added.\n\nAlHusseini, whose sentencing is scheduled for September 29, is a major Democrat donor who has contributed to countless Democrat campaigns and organizations. In the 2024 cycle alone, he gave thousands of dollars each to Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Cori Bush (D-MO), Ro Khanna (D-CA), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Jamie Raskin (D-MD), and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Federal Election Commission (FEC) records show . The Daily Wire reports Democrats have received over $300,000 in contributions from him through the years.\n\nCiting OpenSecrets, the Post reported that \"Sanberg has contributed thousands of dollars to various Democrat-aligned causes over the years.\"\n\nMoreover, AlHusseini has a track record of criticizing Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and X, who is working on cutting federal waste through the Department of Government Efficiency in his role in President Donald Trump's administration.\n\nIn December 2022, he went on CNBC's TechCheck, where he trashed Musk, saying he was wounding Tesla's brand.\n\n\"Tesla's a brand, right? And that brand is being tarnished on the daily because of Musk's behavior publicly on Twitter,\" AlHusseini said.\n\n\"Now it is a confused brand where it is, you know, that brand is associated with a founder that attacked Fauci,\" he went on to add. \"[Musk], you know, promotes characters that are anti-semitic, and it ... really has turned off a lot of the buyers.\"\n\nLast year, AlHusseini, who invested in Tesla early on, told CNBC's Closing Bell he \"unenthusiastically voted yes\" in favor of Musk's pay package.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

Brandon Gill (R-TX) on Friday introduced legislation to abolish the $95 million Fogarty International Center as part of the Trump administration's goal of \"gutting government waste.\"\n\n\"We are gutting government waste under President Trump's strong America-first leadership and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. As a member of the House D.O.G.E. Subcommittee, I am doing my part through this legislation to slash unnecessary taxpayer funded programs and centers,\" Gill told Breitbart News in an exclusive statement.\n\nHe continued, \"The Fogarty International Center has a history of funding projects that are antithetical to American values and harm our nation's global standing. The U.S. spent nearly $13 billion on global health initiatives last year-we can spare a $95 million program that pushes a woke agenda overseas and wastes taxpayer dollars.\"\n\nThe Fogarty International Center aims to advance the mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) by supporting and facilitating global health research conducted by the United States.\n\nHowever, as many Americans can see, the Center overlaps many of the efforts already led by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, which leads international research.\n\nFurther, the Center has a distorted view of \"global health equity\" and has partnered with the World Health Organization (WHO). One of Trump's first actions in office was to withdraw from the WHO.\n\nThe Fogarty International Center has funded many projects that do not appear to align with the Trump administration's agenda. This includes:\n\nGill's proposal serves as the latest initiative to cut wasteful spending in the federal government, especially amongst those leading Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) efforts.\n\n\"Congress and DOGE must find common sense ways to save money, and abolishing the Fogarty International Center is an easy place to start. No one wastes money better than Washington, which is why my subcommittee will work hard to return money back to hard working Americans,\" DOGE Chair and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) said in a written statement.\n\n\"I am excited to cosponsor Congressman Gill's legislation, and I look forward to having him on the DOGE Subcommittee to combat government waste, fraud, and abuse,\" she added.\n\nSean Moran is a policy reporter for Breitbart News.

      "text": "Biden Antitrust Holdover Doha Mekki Continued Woke Agenda Instead of Taking on Big Tech\n\nPresident Trump's nomination of tech critic Gail Slater to lead the Justice Department's antitrust division comes amid controversy over a series of last-minute enforcement actions by recently departed acting antitrust chief, leftist activist Doha Mekki.\n\nPresident Trump has nominated Gail Slater to lead the antitrust division at the Justice Department. Slater has a strong record against Big Tech, having served as an aide to JD Vance in the Senate and advising President Trump on tech and telecommunications policy during the first term. Many populist Republicans, including Vance and Josh Hawley, also supported Biden's antitrust chief, Jonathan Kanter , for continuing the work of the first Trump administration with lawsuits against Apple and Google.\n\nSlater will almost certainly continue these lawsuits against Big Tech. However, after Kanter resigned on December 18, his woke deputy Doha Mekki took over as acting antitrust chief and pushed through many radical actions in the last weeks of Biden's lame-duck presidency.\n\nMekki has impeccable credentials as a leftist extremist. Left-wing academic Zephyr Teachout praised a \"brilliant piece by Doha Mekki on the long and important relationship between antitrust and racial justice.\" Teachout was referencing an October 29 speech by Mekki, in which she  argued that antitrust law was needed to address \"robust political and social liberties for all\" rather than focusing on \"contractual restraints, property rights, and industrial relations.\"\n\nMekki repeatedly invoked  W.E.B. Dubois, a black Marxist thinker to further her argument that antitrust laws must be used against what she considers racism. Dubois also argued that \"the greatest gift of the Soviet Union to modern civilization was the dethronement of the clergy,\"\n\nIn the final weeks of the Biden administration, Mekki issued rules addressing \"HR\" policies , which typically have nothing to do with antitrust policy. She issued a last-minute lawsuit against six major landlords, in line with the Biden administration's blaming AI and landlords rather than his own inflationary policies for high rents. She sued KKR over paperwork violations. KKR responded that the Justice Department was rushing to \"start enforcement actions in the final days of the current administration.\"\n\nMost significantly, she filed a lawsuit just days before Trump became president to Block Amex GBT from purchasing Carlson Travel, a decision in line with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government, who is also suing them.\n\nCarlson Travel is a broker that has struggled due to technological advances and the crippling effect of COVID and Biden's long lockdowns. The company just emerged from bankruptcy in 2021, with revenues down over 50 percent since the COVID lockdowns. Almost all industry experts note the company is still hanging by a thread and could shut down with 9,000 jobs at risk. Somehow, this became a priority for Mekki before the Trump administration could take over.\n\nNotably, none of Mekki's actions have anything to do with countering Big Tech. Carlson Travel was acquired for $570 million-less than a drop in the bucket when compared to the market caps of tech giants like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Apple that have been on the DOJ's radar for years for a wide variety of anti-competitive actions.\n\nThe Trump administration must review the flurry of last-minute lawsuits filed during the transition period. These enforcement actions will need thorough evaluation under Slater's leadership, with their continuation likely depending on whether they align with the incoming administration's priorities and enforcement philosophy, as determined by President Trump and Attorney General Bondi.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

      "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Yeti Accused Of Going 'Full Woke' After Years Pushing DEI, Sponsoring Trans Ideology For Kids\n\n(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\n\nConservative nonprofit organization Consumers' Research on Friday accused Yeti, a premium outdoor gear brand, of going \"full woke\" by promoting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, including sponsoring transgender ideology for children.\n\nWhile the push for DEI initiatives appeared to slow in 2023 as American companies tightened budgets amid economic uncertainty, Yeti continued to promote these efforts. According to an alert sent out by Consumers' Research, first obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation, the U.S.-based company has maintained its DEI focus, supported organizations promoting inclusion between girls and biological boys identifying as transgender girls, and extensively tracked its race and gender diversity quotas.\n\nSince 2020, the U.S.-based company has been training employees on \"unconscious bias,\" setting the stage for Yeti's expansion into DEI initiatives, according to analysis from Consumers' Research. In a December 2020 LinkedIn post , Yeti Senior Vice President of Human Resources Hollie Castro emphasized the company's commitment to \"embracing change\" and \"leaning into difficult conversations with sensitivity.\"\n\n\"Over three weeks, the team took our YETIzens through understanding bias, identifying bias, cultivating connection, and choosing courage. Rather than ignore what was happening around the world, we wanted our employees to know that we are here to support them and that we are committed to educating ourselves and taking actions to do better - for our workforce, our communities, and our consumers,\" Castro wrote.\n\n\"On top of delivering these delicate training sessions, the Talent Experience team was heavily involved with the launch of our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Council's focus groups and affinity groups,\" she added. \"The team was instrumental in listening to and understanding our employees' feelings and needs and then developing the resulting action plan after digging into the findings and feedback.\"\n\nBy 2022, Yeti furthered its DEI commitment by partnering with the non-profit organization Skate Like A Girl, which promotes social justice through sports. The organization hosts events for both women and men identifying as trans. An informational poster obtained by Consumers' Research shows the group promoting an overnight skate camp in California, welcoming participants of all ages, while consistently including trans girls and women regardless of their age. (RELATED: Problem-Riddled Boeing Axes Entire Diversity Division)\n\n\"The lack of an inclusive and safe environment for women, girls, and trans people to practice and excel in recreational and competitive skateboarding. YETI was a main sponsor of their first-ever skating summer camp for adults in August 2021,\" the company wrote in its 2022 ESG Report. \"Through YETI's partnership, Skate Like a Girl was able to bring over 50 skaters to their summer camp and promote confidence, leadership, and social justice through skateboarding.\"\n\nYeti coolers are displayed at an REI store on May 09, 2024 in Berkeley, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\n\nHowever, Skate Like a Girl was not Yeti's first partnership with organizations blending biological women and girls with biological men identifying as women. According to the website for SheJumps, a nonprofit serving \"all women and girls (transgender and cisgender) as well as non-binary people who identify with the women's community\" in outdoor activities, Yeti has been a corporate partner since 2021.\n\nSince expanding into DEI initiatives, Yeti has closely tracked its progress and goals, according to its 2024 ESG Report. For example, the company reported upholding its goal of \"gender pay equity across all levels annually,\" noting there was \"no disparate impact in compensation for all U.S.-based employees in the same job family based on gender, race and ethnicity, and age.\"\n\nThe company has highlighted its goal of increasing both gender diversity and racial and ethnic diversity at all levels by 2030. It reported that race and ethnicity representation at the director level increased to 17% and 35%, respectively, compared to 2020 baselines of 14% and 32%. However, gender diversity decreased from 41% in October 2020 to 30% as of December 2023.\n\nOne of the company's latest initiatives involves a partnership with The Venture Out Project, which leads \"backpacking and wilderness trips for the queer and transgender community.\" According to the organization's website, one of its upcoming events is a Spring \"Queer Forest Bathing Retreat with Toadstool Walks.\"\n\n\"Yeti has gone full woke. Putting kids at risk by exposing them to radical transgender ideology and enforcing ridiculous DEI quotas throughout the company. Yeti was an iconic American brand, but it has turned away from American values,\" Consumers' Research Executive Director Will Hild told the DCNF. \"Consumers deserve better. Consumers' Research will continue to call out this reckless behavior from corporate America, pushing hard to ensure that companies are once again prioritizing serving their customers, not woke politicians.\"\n\nYeti did not immediately respond to DCNF's request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "ZACHARY MARSCHALL: Woke Colleges Finally Being Forced To Reckon With Diversity Agenda\n\n(Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe only way to fix American higher education is from outside the system. The moral rot within universities is too deep and expansive for any minor reforms to make an impact. Universities have failed students and now need a shock to their system to redeem themselves.\n\nThat is why I submitted 33 Title VI complaints through the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights against universities that failed to protect Jewish students from campus antisemitism in the wake of the October 7 terrorist attack. Filed between November 2023 and January 2024 and containing evidence of antisemitism reported by Campus Reform, these complaints resulted in 14 investigations at colleges like Boston University , Princeton University , Northwestern University and Johns Hopkins University .\n\nThe biggest problem during the fall 2023 semester was that universities chose not to enforce existing anti-discrimination policies after antisemitic protests broke out . Administrators were too weak to stand up against leftist professors and their brainwashed students who falsely insisted that calls to \"globalize the intifada\" and wipe Jews off the face of Israel were examples of political speech.\n\nMake no mistake. These chants and acts of intimidation were antisemitic actions against Jews. My efforts were part of a national wave of Title VI complaints documenting universities failing to respond to incidents of national origin discrimination against Jewish students. This wave is significant because it catalyzed a domino effect of reforms throughout 2024 that have made campuses safer for all students.\n\nAnother two investigations resulted in resolutions between the Department of Education and Brown University and Temple University . Both resolutions require the universities to overhaul anti-discrimination trainings so the institutions are better equipped to respond to antisemitism.\n\nThese updates are not just welcome news, they are completely necessary. I doubt university presidents and administrators would have made these changes if they hadn't been called out for losing control of their campuses. Outside pressure on universities is needed because college administrations proved they lack the moral clarity to stand up against violence and ensure all students' safety regardless of race, ethnicity, national origin or religion.\n\nI saw that timidity firsthand when I attended the House Committee on Education and the Workforce hearings . The presidents from Columbia University, Rutgers University, Northwestern University and the University of California Los Angeles testified about their failings to combat antisemitism on their campuses. The testimonies made it painfully clear that higher education officials were out of touch with reality. They naively thought they could allow radical students and professors to indulge in activist curriculum without those ideologies perverting higher education as a place for open-minded learning. They were extremely wrong.\n\nHigher education must depoliticize its campuses and lecture halls to restore civility and learning. Luckily, momentum is going against the far left as we head into 2025. Since the summer, schools like Yale University and Dartmouth College have endorsed institutional neutrality policies that forbid administrations from commenting on political issues that do not directly involve their campuses.\n\nInstitutional neutrality policies are the direct result of outside pressure on schools afraid of losing federal funding or being subject to further investigations. Students, parents, concerned citizens and activists must keep pressure on the universities and submit Title VI complaints when they see institutions failing to protect students from antisemitism because we still cannot trust university administrations to do the right thing on their own terms.\n\nUniversities are crucial institutions in Western societies because they teach civic responsibility, tolerance and new uncomfortable truths to the next generation of leaders. University presidents must do their jobs and remember their place in our national society. Their institutions exist to teach students, not to indoctrinate and let them run wild.\n\nZachary Marschall is editor in chief of the Leadership Institute's Campus Reform and an adjunct, assistant professor at the University of Kentucky.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author and do not reflect the official position of the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "'What The F*ck Is This?': 'Woke' Journalism Fueled Vice Media's Downfall, Shane Smith Admits\n\n(Photo by Craig Barritt/Getty Images for VICE Media)\n\nVice Media co-founder Shane Smith said in an October podcast that \"woke\" journalism, written by younger generations of staffers, contributed to the company's spectacular collapse earlier in 2024.\n\nIn February, Vice CEO Bruce Dixon said in a memo that the company, once a media powerhouse, was shutting down its vice.com website ( the website is live now in October, with an announcement that its magazine was relaunching), laying off hundreds of staffers and undergoing significant restructuring. Smith, who started the company in 1994, told legendary music producer Rick Rubin that \"woke\" content catering to Millennial and Generation Z readers contributed to the brand's downfall.\n\nInterestingly, Smith said the woke content still generated tons of traffic. However it alienated not only Vice's core audience but also corporate partners like Disney. (RELATED: Vice Media's Diversity Chief Made Bank As Left-Wing Media Outlet Went Bankrupt, Laid Off Staffers)\n\n\"From a content perspective, did you ever pander your content away from what you actually liked?\" Rubin asked.\n\nAround 2017, Smith explained, \"Vice started moving into this sort of weird woke era or whatever. But it was young people writing for themselves for the audience. It was like our audience went from Millennials to whatever that is - Gen Z - and they were writing for themselves, to themselves. By the way, traffic was through the roof, but the old Vice audience, including me, was like, 'What are we doing here?'\"\n\n\"One of the mistakes was that Vice News was over here, which I was concentrating on, and it was still killing it and doing awards and all that stuff, but people didn't differentiate between vice.com and Vice News. There was just Vice, and so I think that was a fuck up. We should have had a lot more differentiation. I mean, the 'go woke, go broke' thing, I'm well aware of, and a lot of times I'd see stuff and you would be like, 'What the fuck?' Then you go to give someone shit, and they're like, 'Okay, this is the one you liked; 10 people saw it. This other piece got 100 million, that's just what fucking young people want, you old man.' And you're like, 'Oh, well.' It's a problem with digital media, in that it changes with the audience. The audience now, that young digital-consuming audience, is that audience, and that's the content they want,\" he continued.\n\n\"So, it became problematic. And definitely, speaking of selling out, like Disney or any of those corporate partners, they didn't want that; we didn't want that. It was just sort of this ... you know, we had, I don't know, 5,000 employees doing 7,000 pieces a day, and all of this stuff would come out and you'd be like, 'What the fuck is this this?' Did we lose control of the bicycle? Yeah,\" Smith said.\n\nIt's not a surprise that Vice rotted with time and eventually became woke, but it's interesting to hear Smith give a glimpse into the dynamics between someone like him, who's the O.G., punk rock Brooklyn hipster, and the younger generations who wanted to write for themselves and people like them, who were very much the opposite of punk rock. Even more interesting to hear that the corporate suits at Disney, who you would think would welcome more woke and diverse content , considering their movies are often just that , were turned off by Vice's new stuff.\n\nI've always enjoyed reading Vice, at least the pieces that weren't woke. Sometimes when I'm bored of the 2020s, I'll retrieve Vice's lost pre-2017 posts, like the columns of independent publisher Giancarlo DiTrapano, and revisit the mid-2010s, a weird era in American culture that I look back on fondly.\n\nDid you enjoy this post?

      "text": "VICTOR DAVIS HANSON: DEI Cronyism And Woke Grifters\n\n(Patrick T. Fallon/AFP/Getty Images/TNS)\n\nWhen ideology replaces meritocracy or provides immunity from the consequences of illegal behavior, systemic mediocrity follows.\n\nUnder toxic National Socialism, Stalinism and Maoism, millions of cronies and grifters mouthed party lines in hopes that their approved ideology would allow them to advance their careers and excuse their lawbreaking.\n\nThe same thing has happened with the woke movement and the now-huge Diversity, Equity, Inclusion (DEI) conglomerate.\n\nGrifters and opportunists mask their selfish agendas under the cloak of neo-Marxist care for the underprivileged or victimized minorities. Meanwhile, they seek to profit illegally as if they were old-fashioned crony capitalists.\n\nDuring the disastrous COVID-19 lockdown, Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom pontificated about leveraging the quarantine to ensure greater equality: \"There is opportunity for reimagining a (more) progressive era as it (relates) to capitalism ...We see this as an opportunity to reshape the way we do business and how we govern.\"\n\nLOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 13: California Governor Gavin Newsom (C) speaks as Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass (L) listens at a press conference near the closed I-10 elevated freeway following a large pallet fire, which occurred Saturday at a storage yard beneath the freeway, on November 13, 2023 in Los Angeles, California. Engineers have been assessing the extent of the damage and it remains unknown how long the freeway, which is a major commuter artery through the downtown area, will remain closed and complicate traffic for the city. Newsom said the fire was caused by arson and that over 300,000 vehicles drive through the freeway corridor each day with drivers being urged to use public transit.

(Photo by Rob Carr/Getty Images)\n\nIn another egregious case, the now-imprisoned felon, Sam Bankman-Fried, may have been the greatest con artist in American history. He siphoned billions of dollars from his cryptocurrency company, destroying the fortunes of thousands when his multi-billion-dollar Ponzi empire collapsed.\n\nHow did Sam and his two Stanford law-professor parents manage to accumulate millions of dollars in resort properties and perks without getting caught until after their empire collapsed?\n\nAnswer: Sam showered millions of dollars on left-wing politicians to advance their progressive crusades. His parents justified this family giving as a form of \"effective altruism.\"\n\nThat catchy phrase masked the reality that his crusade for social justice was just an incredibly effective get-rich-quick scheme.\n\nThe Bankman-Fried family apparently reasoned that their devotion to this woke form of \"altruism\" would translate into riches for themselves, albeit bankruptcies for investors.\n\nAnother example: In Georgia's Fulton County, District Attorney Fani Willis ran for office, promising to indict supposed right-wing monster Donald Trump.\n\nATLANTA, GA - MARCH 01: Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, left and prosecutor Daysha Young, right, speak to each other during a hearing in the case of the State of Georgia v.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nShe raised campaign money on her woke credentials. Often, when challenged, she played the race victim card.\n\nMeanwhile, Willis hired as a special prosecutor her secret paramour, the incompetent Nathan Wade, although he had never tried a single felony case.\n\nShe and Wade then went on expensive junkets. She claimed that she reimbursed him with cash that was, of course, unverifiable.\n\nGiven their woke ideology, both assumed they were entitled to splurge at taxpayers' expense, offer likely-false testimony under oath and violate canons of professional behavior for lawyers.\n\nShe wasn't alone in her corruption. After the death of George Floyd, the founders of the left-wing Black Lives Matter movement went on a house-buying rampage. The more corporations filled their coffers with millions, either from guilt or as protection money, the more new homes the directors purchased.\n\nOne co-founder, Patrisse Khan-Cullors, a self-described Marxist, splurged by spending $3.2 million in alleged BLM money to buy herself four upscale residences.\n\nAnd the most radical Democratic members of Congress - the so-called Squad - apparently feel that the more they level accusations of racism, the more they can profit without fearing any consequences for their wrongdoing.\n\nOne squad member, Democratic Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, redirected $2.8 million of her office's allotted government money to her husband's political consulting company.\n\nStill another member, the radical leftist Rep. Cori Bush, often harangued the country to defund the police. Now the FBI is investigating her for stealthily paying tens of thousands of campaign dollars to her own husband for \"security.\"\n\nWoke and DEI activists may not necessarily be any more innately mediocre, corrupt or conniving than other politicians and activists.\n\nBut they seem so, because they loudly broadcast that they are for \"diversity,\" \"equity\" and \"inclusion\" - and thus assume themselves to be exempt from all scrutiny and free to profit in any way they please.\n\nThe woke/DEI project is enticing thousands of shysters, careerists and mediocrities, all keen to enrich themselves on the premise that they are noble fighters for social justice who deserve immunity from any scrutiny.\n\nHow odd it is that America is wasting billions of dollars hiring DEI czars and electing woke politicians who so often accuse others of a multitude of sins, largely as a way of enriching themselves, hiding their own culpability and making a mockery of the law.\n\nVictor Davis Hanson is a distinguished fellow of the Center for American Greatness.

      "text": "Trump's Education Department Cuts More Than $350 Million In 'Woke Spending' As Musk Hunts for Government Waste\n\n(Photo by J. David Ake/Getty Images)\n\nThe Department of Education (ED) announced the cancellation of over $350 million in \"woke spending\" to education and equity organizations Friday as part of a broader attempt to cut government waste.\n\nThe ED ended 10 contracts with the Regional Educational Laboratories (REL) after \"review of the contracts uncovered wasteful and ideologically driven spending not in the interest of students and taxpayers,\" according to the ED's press release . The contracts totaled to $336 million. The RELs work with policymakers and people in the field of education across the U.S. to help craft local and state \"policies, programs and practices,\" the Institute of Education Sciences said .\n\nThe REL supported \"woke\" causes, according to the ED. The Regional Educational Laboratory Midwest suggested that Ohio schools conduct \"equity audits\" and conversation. (RELATED: Federal Gov's $190 Billion Handout For Public Schools Only Made Small Dent In Students' Poor Test Scores, Studies Show)\n\n\"The Department plans to enter into new contracts that will satisfy the statutory requirements, improve student learning, and better serve school districts, State Departments of Education, and other education stakeholders,\" the press release read.\n\nThe department also put an end to $33 million in grants issued to four Equity Assistance Centers (EAC). The grants \"supported divisive training in DEI, Critical Race Theory, and gender identity for state and local education agencies as well as school boards,\" according to the ED.\n\nThe department's website claims the EACs ensure \"that all students have equitable access to learning opportunities, regardless of their child's race, sex, national origin, or religion.\"\n\nThis is not the first substantial cut in spending at the ED. Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) announced earlier efforts to cut the department's spending on X. The ED canceled 89 contracts totaling $881 million and 29 DEI training grants totaling $101 million.\n\nAlso today, the Department Of Education terminated 89 contracts worth $881mm.\n\nOne contractor was paid $1.5mm to \"observe mailing and clerical operations\" at a mail center.\" https://t.co/VaAw1vNAoa\n\n- Department of Government Efficiency (@DOGE) February 11, 2025\n\nTrump's Secretary of Education nominee, Linda McMahon , said in her confirmation hearing Thursday that she will look at spending.\n\n\"It is my goal, if I am confirmed, to get in and assess these kinds of programs because I'm not sure yet what the impact of all of those programs are,\" she said.\n\nFriday's ED spending cut comes a week after Democrats attempted to make their way into the ED building in Washington, D.C., to protest President Trump's announcement of his plan to close the department. Trump had begun drafting an executive order to shutter the ED and direct Congress to pass legislation to that effect.\n\nThe protest also followed the president asking DOGE to search the ED for wasteful spending. This followed DOGE exposing USAID's chronic misuse of federal funds on projects including LGBT inclusion for Serbian workers, a musical in Ireland incorporating DEI and transgender clinics in both India and Vietnam.\n\nPresident Trump referred to the ED as a \"con job\" and said he would \"like it to be closed immediately\" Wednesday while meeting with reporters in the Oval Office.\n\nTRENDING\n\n©2025 The Daily Caller, Inc.\n\nThe Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006\n\nSubscription Type\n\nUnlimited digital access to The Daily Caller\n\nPremium Article: Subscribe for $1 to read the rest.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nAlready have an account?

      "text": "'Not On Your Side': Religious Group Slams Insurance Giant For 'Woke Politics,' Underwriting Gender Ideologues\n\nGeorge Rose/Getty Images\n\nThe religious advocacy group Center for Christian Virtue (CCV) launched a campaign Tuesday criticizing certain diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and support for LGBT causes at top U.S. insurer Nationwide.\n\nThe campaign, titled \"Nationwide: Not On Your Side,\" targets a number of Nationwide's DEI efforts, including supporting child transgender programs and participating in a pride march hosted by Ohio LGBTQ+ nonprofit Stonewall Columbus, the CCV website shows . Nationwide has also advocated for the Ohio Fairness Act, which would force businesses to allow men in women's bathrooms and has received a perfect score on the 2021 Corporate Equality Index - a survey conducted by transgender activist group the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) that scores companies based on their adherence to LGBTQ+ ideology. (RELATED: Despite Billions In Backing, Studies Show Diversity Trainings Just Aren't Working)\n\n\"For far too long, Nationwide has positioned itself as a family-friendly business to its rural and agricultural clients, while advocating for some of the most radical legislation at the Ohio Statehouse, and financially supporting organizations that host drag queen story hours and other absurd events that harm children,\" Aaron Baer, President of the CCV, said in the release. \"Enough is enough. We're calling on all Nationwide Insurance customers to call your broker and tell them you don't want to work with a company that is putting woke politics over your family. Until Nationwide drops their radical political advocacy, no farmer or family should stand with them.\"\n\n🚨 We're exposing @Nationwide 's woke political activism that's undermining their customers' free speech, privacy & religious freedom 🚨\n\n\"Nationwide: Not On Your Side\" launched today to educate farmers at the Farm Science Review.\n\n🔎 @aarbaer 's statement: https://t.co/KDYFVmYgn6 pic.twitter.com/WhkD6iVbCU\n\n- Center for Christian Virtue (@CCVPolicy) September 17, 2024\n\nStonewall Columbus, who hosted the pride march that representatives from Nationwide attended, posted an explicit social media segment in July entitled \"Basics 4 Bottoms\" that provided intercourse advice for gay men on how to relax their anuses. The organization, which operates in Columbus, where Nationwide is headquartered , has also hosted \"queer speed dating\" and \"Trans Taco Tuesdays .\"\n\nThe CCV campaign consists of a signage, digital advertising and text messaging outreach program that details the insurer's DEI policies and how those initiatives may conflict with customers' values, according to the CCV press release. The launch comes after an array of major U.S. corporations have reversed their DEI initiatives in recent months, including Ford , Stanley Black & Decker , Coors and Lowe's , all of which stopped participating in the HRC's Corporate Equality Index.\n\n\"Nationwide Insurance was birthed from the Ohio Farm Bureau, and was once seen as a company that supports families. But they've been consumed by leftist ideology,\" Baer said in the release. \"Nationwide should stay out of cultural politics and not work against the interests of Christians, children, and the farming community.\"\n\nNationwide and the CCV did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight.\n\nNow that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate  media and \n\t\t\t\t\tjoining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes \n\t\t\t\t\tto marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; \n\t\t\t\t\tsenators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want \n\t\t\t\t\tto limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our \n\t\t\t\t\tindependence.\n\nWe don't complain -- we can't stand complainers --  but we do call it how we see it. We have a fight on our \n\t\t\t\t\thands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.\n\nWe're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. \n\t\t\t\t\tOur original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates \n\t\t\t\t\tthem -- because we won't bend the knee to political correctness.\n\nOne reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of \n\t\t\t\t\tour being, and we think she's worth saving from today's craziness.\n\nHelp us save her.\n\nA second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train.  We have \n\t\t\t\t\ttrained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political \n\t\t\t\t\tspectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There's a good chance they were trained at Daily \n\t\t\t\t\tCaller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, \n\t\t\t\t\tNewsmax, Daily Wire and many others.\n\nSimply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a \n\t\t\t\t\tfair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.\n\nSince 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress. We're in the Oval Office. \n\t\t\t\t\tAnd we're in up to 20 million homes every single month. That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible \n\t\t\t\t\tto ignore.\n\nWe can overcome the forces lined up against all of us. This is an important mission but we can't do it unless you - \n\t\t\t\t\tthe everyday Americans forgotten by the establishment - have our back.\n\nPlease consider becoming a Daily Caller Patriot today, and help us keep doing work that holds politicians, \n\t\t\t\t\tcorporations and other leaders accountable. Help us thumb our noses at political correctness. Help us train a new \n\t\t\t\t\tgeneration of news reporters who will actually tell the truth.

      "text": "Why I Will No Longer Use The Word 'Woke'\n\nMy business school and I have been on the forefront of dealing with the phenomenon called \"woke capitalism.\"\n\nIn October of 2020, we were the first organization to host a conference on the topic in New York, and I wrote an op-ed on the topic later that year. Since then, we have been in regular conversation with executives on how to manage the onslaught of wokeness.\n\nI have come to realize that a big part of the problem is the word \"woke\" itself. It's a trap, and supporters of the market economy have fallen right into it.\n\nThe word is defined (e.g., by Merriam-Webster ) as being \"aware of and actively attentive to important facts and issues (especially issues of racial and social justice).\" But its use encompasses a far wider range of meanings, both supportive (being against racism, alienation, exploitation, and oppression) and pejorative (being hostile to free enterprise and in favor of every extreme Left-wing cause).\n\nIn this, it is a lot like the word \"capitalism.\" Capitalism has both positive and negative meanings: a system of private enterprise that has lifted millions out of poverty, and a system of oppression of workers by the owners for the means of production. Pope St. John Paul II highlighted the ambiguity of the word just over 30 years ago after the fall of Communism, when he asked whether \"capitalism should be the goal of the countries now making efforts to rebuild their economy and society.\" His answer-it depends:\n\n\"If by 'capitalism' is meant an economic system which recognizes the fundamental and positive role of business, the market, private property and the resulting responsibility for the means of production, as well as free human creativity in the economic sector,\" he wrote, \"then the answer is certainly in the affirmative.\n\n\"But if by 'capitalism' is meant a system in which freedom in the economic sector is not circumscribed within a strong juridical framework which places it at the service of human freedom in its totality, and which sees it as a particular aspect of that freedom, the core of which is ethical and religious, then the reply is certainly negative.\"\n\nThis ambiguity around the word \"capitalism\" has been a serious obstacle to the recognition of the wide-ranging benefits of the market economy because, whenever one attempts to describe those benefits, one has to explain first which capitalism one is talking about - the good kind or the bad. How did this happen? Champions of the market economy seem to have accepted, uncritically, a word that was originally used in a derogatory way and that owes much of its initial popularity to Karl Marx's use of the word \"capitalist.\" Using your opponents' terminology lets them set the terms of the debate.\n\nThe same thing has happened with the word \"woke.\" For many people, woke means simply \"not racist.\" So if you stake out an anti-woke position, others will interpret that as you being racist. Avoid this trap entirely by not using the word \"woke.\" We don't need it. We already have a perfectly good word for what we mean by \"woke\" when we use it in its pejorative sense-the identification of people by different subgroups and the classification of people into oppressor or oppressed-and that word is \"Marxist.\" Why let people get away with giving Marxism a hip new name like \"woke\"? We should abandon this word.\n\nOnce I finish writing this article, I will never again use the word \"woke\" or any of its derivatives (wokeness, woke business, woke capitalism), and I recommend that everyone who cares about the market economy and freedom, itself, do the same.\n\nUsing the correct word, \"Marxist,\" instead of \"woke\" will show how absurd it is to speak of \"woke capitalism.\" Instead of speaking about \"woke capitalism,\" we would have to say \"Marxist capitalism\" - but of course there is no such thing. There is only Marxism, pure and simple. Bringing Marxist ideas into the market economy does not lead to a kinder, gentler form of capitalism. It just leads to the destruction of free enterprise and its replacement by totalitarianism.\n\nAbandoning the word \"woke\" and saying \"Marxist\" instead will make that clear.\n\nThis is the last time I will be using the word \"woke.\"\n\nAndrew V.

      "text": "How Woke Ideologies Are Corrupting America's Future\n\nToday's protesters will become tomorrow's prosecutors.\n\nIf you've been paying attention over the last couple of years, you've seen how woke ideologies are ripping through all aspects of society from the K-12 education system to colleges, the military, and our local, state, and federal governments.\n\nIf you haven't been paying attention, Harvard-educated House GOP Chair, Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) thrust this into the spotlight and is finally taking some action. Her brave questioning of several U.S. college presidents in Washington, D.C., exposed the rot that has formed at many of America's most respected education institutions.\n\nAnd now this is extending beyond the GOP. Bill Ackman, billionaire and longtime Democrat donor, recently told the New York Magazine that his daughter was indoctrinated at Harvard University saying in part \"She became, like, an anti-capitalist. Like practically a Marxist.\"\n\nBill's comments reflect the pain that many parents from around the nation are feeling who have watched their sons and daughters return home from college not smarter, more cultured, or more business savvy, but brainwashed on many issues that go against the values in which they were raised as children.\n\nWhat should terrify all parents, is that this is not an uncommon scenario in today's world where a young man or woman goes off to college with a deep love for America only to come home on spring break with a new mindset: burn America to the ground.\n\nU.C. Berkeley's School of Law allegedly created a \" Zionist-free zone \" where anyone who supports Israel is not allowed to enter. On another side of the same campus, Jewish students were recently forced to to barricade themselves inside because of a angry mobs trying to attack them.\n\nThrough a strategic plan to completely infiltrate our education systems, we have seen innocent children grow up to become unrecognizable anarchists on campuses across our nation. What should scare us even more - today's protesters will become tomorrow's prosecutors.\n\nAnd it doesn't stop there. Innocent, moldable minds that have been hijacked by woke ideology are the future of our healthcare system, government, judicial system, and yes, those in charge of educating generations to come.\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump has always said, \"They aren't after me, they are after you.\" But it doesn't stop there - they are after an entire generation.\n\nAs a former intelligence officer and prosecutor, this problem is much deeper than meets the eye.\n\nFor years, this has been quietly driven by weak college presidents who can't find the moral courage to unequivocally condemn Anti-Semitism and tenured professors turned political activists with a single mission - to brainwash the minds of our nation's future.\n\nThis hate-filled culture is not enriching life on college campuses. Why are the leaders of higher education allowing this to take root and more importantly, who is funding it?\n\nAnd it's not just in higher education where the destructive woke ideologies have taken root. We now see them on full display in the U.S. military where recently, radical U.S. airman, Aaron Bushnell, quite literally set himself on fire outside of the Israeli Embassy in the United States to protest the American government's support for Israel.\n\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) practices have transformed into a Marxist value system and the consequences are detrimental and our recruitment is suffering immensely.\n\nTraditionally, the U.S. military has been revered for its focus on meritocracy and unity of purpose. Recruitment was based on the principles of honor, duty, and patriotism, with individuals from diverse backgrounds coming together under the shared goal of defending their country. However, the rise of Marxist initiatives has shifted the focus away from these core principles, prioritizing identity politics over the fundamental qualities necessary for military service.\n\nDEI initiatives have fostered a toxic environment within the military, where divisive identity politics take precedence over unity and cohesion. Rather than fostering a sense of camaraderie and shared purpose, these initiatives have sown discord and resentment among service members, undermining morale and eroding the bonds of trust that are essential for effective teamwork in combat situations.\n\nIt is imperative that we recognize the dangers posed by Marxist initiatives all throughout our society and take decisive action to reverse this damaging trend. Instead of focusing on divisive identity politics, we must reaffirm our commitment to meritocracy, unity, and shared purpose.\n\nFrom all aspects of our education systems to our military to our government leaders, one thing is for sure; woke ideologies are destroying the fabric of our great nation and they must come to an end once and for all.\n\nAnd in Congress, I will fight to save our children and our national security. I will use all means possible to form a task force to investigate this problem, find out who is funding it and make sure that our youth once again believes in one nation, under god, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n\n* * *\n\nAbe Hamadeh is a Trump-endorsed Republican Candidate for Arizona's 8th Congressional District and former U.S. Army Intelligence Officer.\n\nThe views expressed in this piece are those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of The Daily Wire.\n\nContinue reading this exclusive article and join the conversation, plus watch free videos on DW+\n\nAlready a member?

      "text": "Wokest Wash Around: Here's How Dove Has Pushed Woke Nonsense\n\nThe soap company has swallowed the woke Kool-Aid, and now it's spitting it out at all of its customers.\n\nWhile most Americans grow sick of leftism infecting every area of life, personal care brand Dove has been busy doubling down on a marketing strategy that centers on wokeness.\n\nIf you're a normal person who understands basic biological reality, Dove's obsession with some of the craziest ideologies over the past few years should make you want to vomit. The soap company has swallowed the woke Kool-Aid, and now it's spitting it out at all of its customers.\n\nLet's back up to September of 2023. Dove partnered with a Black Lives Matter activist to push a \"fat liberation\" campaign. This move created one of the wokest promotions of all time. If only the plus-sized BLM \"fat liberation\" activist also had pronouns in her bio... ohhhh... she does . So this really is in the running for the wokest campaign of all time. Congrats, Dove!\n\nBut the personal care brand wasn't done.\n\nJump ahead to Super Bowl Sunday of this year, and you'll find Dove claiming that it supports girls and women in sports. At this time, Dove also partnered with Matthew Cherry, a director and former football player, for a \"quest to transform the world of sports into a welcoming environment where every girl can thrive and truly belong.\"\n\nThat seems like a pretty normal thing to do. But don't get too excited about a return to normalcy.\n\nDove's Super Bowl ad and partnership with Cherry would've been great if it weren't for the fact that just a few years earlier, the brand congratulated Laurel Hubbard, a male weightlifter who competed against women at the Olympics.\n\n\"History in the making. Congrats to Laurel! Here's to more trans representation in sports,\" Dove tweeted in 2021.\n\nIf that seems hypocritical, it's because it is. Dove is trying to claim it supports women's sports while celebrating when men who claim to be women infiltrate women's sports.\n\nBut at Jeremy's, we know the difference between a man and a woman, and we don't hate the customers who give us their money. We don't partner with BLM \"fat liberation\" activists who have pronouns in their bios. We don't advocate for stripping away the rights of girls and women in sports. And we make some pretty great products.\n\nRight now, Jeremy's is offering a Buy One Get One on its Body Wash so you can have a clean conscience and get a great deal today! This was the most popular deal of the year, and it's only back for a limited time! Jeremy's also has an Oatmeal & Citrus bar soap , so you can send Dove on its way.\n\nWhy get your personal care products from a company that pushes against everything you believe when you can get even better products from a company that shares your values?\n\nAs Dove continues to campaign against normalcy with no end in sight, Jeremy's is pushing back against the craziness of the Left by offering consumers quality products that are... well... normal.\n\nJeremy's Razors shares common ownership with The Daily Wire.\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "America's Golden Age Starts, And The Left Still Goes Woke\n\nWokeness is now the core philosophy of the Democratic Party.\n\nAmerica's Golden Age is just getting started.\n\nAnd the Left has still not recovered.\n\nThey haven't regained their semblance of reality or normalcy. One of the reasons why there is a feeling of unity in the country overall is because the era of weird is over and the era of the normie is back.\n\nThe Left cannot embrace this. The Democratic Party cannot embrace this. And that's worth exploring for a moment, because the most obvious thing about this current election cycle is that the Democratic Party blew it. They absolutely blew it because of wokeness.\n\nWoke issues are an 80-20 issue in the country. Americans do not believe in discrimination on the basis of race. That is an 80-20 issue. They reject it. Americans do not believe that little boys are the same as little girls, and boys can be made into girls or vice versa. That's an 80-20 issue.\n\nThese issues are losers for Democrats, which prompts this question: Why don't the Democrats separate themselves from those issues?\n\nEvery time a Democrat tries to separate from it, that person is immediately raked over the coals. This happened to Democrat Congressman Seth Moulton in Massachusetts, who made the signal error of suggesting that boys should not play in girls' sports. He was then clubbed by his entire party.\n\nWhy can't they separate themselves from an issue like that? If it's an 80-20 issue, why is it so vital for them to continue embracing it?\n\nHere's the answer: Wokeness is now the core philosophy of the Democratic Party. It is the core philosophy that the Left cannot be separated from.\n\nThe reality is that we live in a country of immense prosperity and historic wealth. The typical Left-wing case, the Marxist case, is that there are classes, and these classes are solid and impenetrable, that if you're born poor in America, you die poor; if you're born rich, you die rich, and your kids die rich.\n\nThat's not true. That has never been axiomatic in America.\n\nOne of the most amazing things about the people who stood next to Donald Trump during his inauguration, those tech bros, is that they did not all grow up uber wealthy people.\n\nFor example, my company, The Daily Wire, was founded by three people. Jeremy Boring, co-founder of the company, did not graduate from college. Caleb Robinson did not even go to college. I went to Harvard Law School, but I grew up in a 1,300 square-foot house in Burbank, California, with two bedrooms - one for my parents and one for the kids, which meant four kids in one bedroom and one bathroom for all six of us until I was 11-years-old.\n\nThe amount of income and wealth mobility in the United States is astonishing. That is always why it has been a land of opportunity, which means that in America, the typical Marxist case for the flattening and destruction of the free market in the name of equality does not work and has never worked for long.\n\nSometimes, it's applied after an economic crisis when people are looking for some sort of answer. And that's when you get the FDR administration. That's when you get Obama.\n\nBut it doesn't last for long because Americans are an aspirational people, a people who like innovation. We like adventure. We want exploration. The typical Left-wing economic Marxist case, that everything is economically unfair, does not tend to work in a system that has those levels of economic mobility. The aspiration most Americans have does not match up with what the Left believes, which is to free society in place, redistribute all the winnings and then everybody is equal in penury.\n\nThat is not the aspiration of the American people. When I campaigned with a series of Senate candidates during the last election cycle, whether it was up in the tip of Ohio with a bunch of white folks, or whether I was down in the Rio Grande Valley campaigning with Senator Cruz with an entirely Hispanic population, everyone wanted the same thing: to be able to keep their wealth, to build wealth for the next generation, to raise their family, to go to church, and to help their kids have a better life than they did.\n\nThat is why Marxism has never successfully been applied in the United States and will not win in the United States. And that is also the reason why for the Left, economic Marxism had to be recast as something else . It had to be recast as race Marxism or sex Marxism, which is wokeism.\n\nThe idea became that you had to completely restructure the system, to destroy capitalism.\n\nWhy? Because the Left says people are innately not different . But the beauty of capitalism is that it is a meritocracy, and you don't have to be at the top level of any particular thing in order to succeed in the United States.\n\nThis is the theory of comparative advantage. For example, I may be really good at talking and writing, but I'm not so good at plumbing. That plumber can be highly successful and make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year starting a plumbing company.\n\nThat's one of the beauties of capitalism. But what the Left says instead is that all people are innately exactly the same - not equal before God, but innately the same. \"Men\" and \"women\" are arbitrary categories. Group differentiation is all arbitrary.\n\nThat means any inequity between those groups must be a reflection of unfairness. That's what wokeness is: Wokeness is the argument that all disparities are discrimination.\n\nIn order for that argument to make any sense, it means that all people must be exactly the same. So the argument to destroy capitalism has to be made on the basis that we are all basically undifferentiated widgets.\n\nThis is why the Left can't let go of those arguments. They can't. The minute they give up that argument, they're relegated to arguing economic Marxism again. And economic Marxism in the United States tends to lose. Bernie Sanders is popular with a relatively small cadre of the American people. His candidacy would have been a disaster for Democrats.\n\nThus, they've had to move into a weird combination of economic Marxism, economic progressivism, race Marxism, sex Marxism: Wokeness.\n\nWhy do I bring this up?\n\nBecause one thing that's been evident in the aftermath of President Trump's swearing-in is that the Left will never give this up. That made itself absolutely apparent yesterday at the National Prayer Service at the Washington National Cathedral.\n\nPresident Trump attended, along with Melania, the entire Trump family, and Vice President Vance and his family.\n\nChip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nIn the middle of the service, Mariann Budde, a female Episcopal bishop, spoke. She proceeded to spew a diatribe of woke-mind nonsense that had nothing whatsoever to do with the Bible or Christian traditionalism. 50 years ago, you would have been much more likely to hear this in a Communist Party hall than in a church.\n\nThe decline of religion in America has led to hearing this kind of trash in churches. So this resistance pastor got up and decided she was going to make herself famous by ripping into Donald Trump and JD Vance the day after the inauguration.\n\nAnd she was going to do so by spewing absolute nonsense wokeness about trans kids who don't exist.\n\nWhen I say they don't exist, I mean that there may be kids with gender dysphoria, but the notion that a child knows that their body is not in line with their sex is ridiculous on its face. She spewed nonsense about trans children and illegal immigrants and suggested that if President Trump wished to emulate the values of Jesus, he must abandon his entire political agenda.\n\nI've noticed that Jesus was not in favor of free migration across all borders. I certainly know that Jesus was not in favor of the idea that boys and girls are the same and are interchangeable and boys can become girls.\n\nBut of course, this had nothing to do with religion.\n\nIt is what the Left has done with nearly every institution. They've hollowed them out. They hollowed out the church, and they stuck in a bunch of Left-wing woke garbage.\n\n\"Our God teaches us that we are to be merciful to the stranger, for we will all want strangers in this land,\" she pronounced.\n\nThis is ridiculous. It's ridiculous. The notion that you are now citing the biblical injunction to be kind to the stranger in order to suggest you cannot have a border as a country is asinine. The suggestion that the Bible mandates that President Trump allow the mutilation, the hormonal sterilization of small children on the basis that they think they might be a member of the opposite sex is perverse.\n\nShame on whomever did not vet this woman, the same woman who said just a couple of years ago that everything about President Trump was antithetical to the teachings of Jesus.\n\nThis is all insulting, ridiculous, and divisive. It's also bound to lose because the American people - anyone who takes the church or the Bible seriously, whether Christian or Jewish - don't believe this. You don't take this perspective seriously if you happen to be a person who believes in Biblical values.\n\nBut the Left can't let it go.\n\nThe Left's attachment to wokeness never dies.\n\n* * *\n\nContinue reading this exclusive article and join the conversation, plus watch free videos on DW+\n\nAlready a member?

      "text": "'Google Is F***ing Woke': Former Employees Reveal Company's Dedication To DEI\n\nAfter Google Gemini was revealed to be rewriting history from a woke perspective, with racial history being distorted when it was asked simple prompts, numerous former Google employees spoke of the woke culture at Google and how it has zealously adopted diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices.\n\nIn February, Google paused its AI chatbot's image generation feature after it was accused of racism against white people. The chatbot was accused of refusing to generate images of white people after Frank Fleming, a writer for Daily Wire scripted content, repeatedly asked the chatbot - whose \"next-generation model\" Gemini 1.5 offered image generation - for such images.\n\nIn a long X thread, Fleming began by asking for an image of a pope. Historically, popes have been white men, but the chatbot posted images of a dark-skinned man and woman. Fleming then proceeded to ask for images of medieval knights (garnering four images, two dark-skinned women and two dark-skinned men); jokingly asked for someone eating \"a mayo sandwich on white bread;\" asked for an image of a Viking; and then asked for images of groups that are traditionally non-white (such as Japanese samurai and Zulu warriors) to see if the chatbot would show diversity by including white people. It did not.\n\nShaun Maguire, a partner at Google Ventures from 2016 until 2019, told The Free Press ,\n\nI was not shocked at all. When the first Google Gemini photos popped up on my X feed, I thought to myself: Here we go again. And: Of course. Because I know Google well. Google Gemini's failures revealed how broken Google's culture is in such a visually obvious way to the world. But what happened was not a one-off incident. It was a symptom of a larger cultural phenomenon that has been taking over the company for years.\n\nMaguire recalled taking the job as an investing partner at Google Ventures:  \"I was excited about the role, but I was a little wary of Google, which had already been getting a reputation. By the time I joined, the word around Silicon Valley was that Google had already lost its way. It was only when I got there that I realized the full extent of it.\"\n\nDavid Kiferbaum, a Google business manager who worked for Google from 2015 to 2023, said he was told regarding hiring, \"We're really looking for diverse candidates for this role.\" He said he interpreted the comment to mean \"a non-white, a non-hetero\" applicant, adding, \"I was like, 'Whoa, I can't believe this person is saying this out loud.'\"\n\nMaguire said a diversity working group at Google Ventures in 2017 made \"unreasonable demands. ... The demands included the insistence that senior leaders hire at least two additional female general partners - which is the senior role I was promised I'd get once I reached three years with the company. One of those hires, the group demanded, needed to happen within six months. If leadership refused, about a quarter of the firm, or 20 people out of the 80 employees at Google Ventures, threatened to quit.\"\n\nAlthough Maguire said hiring a female general partner was \"a good goal,\" he continued, \"but they were trying to force a timeline that would ultimately lead to lowering standards. Hiring general partners into a venture firm is a very hard, laborious process, because the positions are so senior and require finding the right fit. The hiring process normally takes anywhere between one to two years.\"\n\nHe said that Ventures' CEO, \"like all of the senior leadership across Google, proved to be spineless in the face of these employee threats. Within a year, he hired a new female general partner, who was really smart but who wasn't qualified for the job. Because of her lack of experience, she was never treated on the same level as the other general partners, which I believe was ultimately unfair to her.\"\n\n\"Meanwhile, over the next two years, I started to notice the dynamics of our team change. Instead of highly experienced founders and seasoned investors, young people from minority backgrounds were coming in with virtually no investment experience whatsoever,\" Maguire continued. \"In this time, Ventures promoted a 25-year-old black woman to investment partner - the same position I held at the time - who had not yet made a single investment decision in her entire career.\"\n\nA former product manager at Google said it was mandatory for him to attend a session on \"Psychological Safety for Inclusive Teams.\" He said one of his coworkers asked him to update his pronouns and gave him this list: she/her, ey/em, zie/hir, ve/ver, he/him, ze/hir, zie/zir, it/its, they/them, ze/zie, xe/xem, any pronoun, name as my pronoun, and \"ask me about my pronoun.\"\n\nAfter he lost out on a promotion, Maguire recalled, \"I decided to slowly start looking for other jobs. When firms would ask me why I wanted to leave Google, I would be brutally honest. I'd say, 'Because Google is f***ing woke. It's not a meritocracy. And I want to work somewhere with a performance culture.'\"\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "'Social Crusades': Ending The Woke Agenda At The State Department\n\nMarco Rubio stands poised to confront this destructive ideology and restore the Department's focus on advancing America's strategic interests.\n\nThe Department of State, established in 1789, is the oldest executive agency in the United States. Founded to handle foreign affairs, promote peace, and represent America's interests abroad, it played a pivotal role under the leadership of Thomas Jefferson, the first Secretary of State, in establishing the U.S. as a global leader for freedom and democracy during an era dominated by European monarchs and despots.\n\nToday, the Department has dangerously drifted far from its founding mission. Thomas Jefferson would hardly recognize the institution - or the nation - it represents. Jefferson's Department has succumbed to \"woke culture,\" undermining its effectiveness and jeopardizing America's leadership on the world stage.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio, President-elect Trump's nominee for Secretary of State, stands poised to confront this destructive ideology and restore the Department's focus on advancing national security and traditional American values. Senator Rubio has always been a staunch defender of American freedom, both at home and abroad, with a deep commitment to combating communist regimes, especially given his Cuban heritage. As the son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio understands firsthand the dangers of totalitarianism and the importance of standing against oppressive regimes. Rubio believes that America First means returning to the core principles of security, prosperity, and democratic values, rather than enforcing partisan ideologies .\n\nFor years, the radical Left has sidelined traditional ideals like Senator Rubio's in favor of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) initiatives. Instead of championing democracy and reinforcing America's foundational principles, diplomats have spent resources promoting drag theater performances in Ecuador under the guise of national security . Rather than addressing serious threats like communism, our Cultural Officers promoted a film festival featuring incest and pedophilia in Portugal . The Biden-appointed U.S. ambassador to France has replaced portraits of American Founding Fathers with images of a transgender activist , a violent protester, socialist icons, and communists.\n\nThe obsession with promoting progressive social values has dangerously eroded America's standing abroad. Adversaries like Communist China - likely amused by an ambassador swapping portraits of American heroes for communists - exploit this ideological preoccupation, bolstering their influence while the U.S. falls behind.\n\nMy personal experience attending events in Washington, D.C., with State Department officials underscores the problem. At these gatherings, I often spoke passionately about the hope many oppressed people place in America - those yearning for freedom from authoritarian regimes and seeking the basic human rights we often take for granted. After all, I saw it firsthand growing up under an oppressive government.\n\nInstead of tackling critical global challenges, State Department representatives often steered our discussions toward their woke agenda, emphasizing progressive and ideological initiatives that mean little to oppressed populations seeking America's leadership and support. I shudder to imagine how a younger version of myself would have felt if this had been America's message to my family in the Soviet Union.\n\nConsider the alarming juxtaposition of priorities: in 2022, the State Department issued an interagency strategy to promote LGBTQ+ rights abroad well before publishing the U.S. national security strategy . Meanwhile, China has increased its trade with the Gulf Cooperation Council, expanded its financial dominance in Africa and South America, and solidified security pacts in the Pacific - all without facing significant U.S. resistance .\n\nAt home, the situation is equally troubling. Instead of addressing urgent threats like China's rising power, resources are diverted to diversity recruitment and DEIA mandates. The Department's Equity Council , with unclear authority and no oversight, prioritizes loyalty to progressive values over traditional standards like competence and integrity. Today, becoming a front-line diplomat for our country requires passing a stringent ideological test, focused more on woke credentials than on diplomatic skills.\n\nThis ideological drift undermines the credibility of our diplomacy. Foreign counterparts do not view America as a reliable partner when moralistic lectures replace constructive dialogue. For instance, reprimanding Vietnam for its cultural values while neglecting to address Beijing's aggression in the South China Sea is not just counterproductive-it signals a dangerous abdication of leadership.\n\nInclusivity is a core American value, and sexual orientation or moral shaming should not be the focus of our diplomacy. Richard Grenell made history as the highest-ranking openly gay ambassador in U.S. history when President Trump appointed him as Ambassador to Germany. Despite his groundbreaking position, Grenell never made his sexuality a focal point of his diplomatic work or public persona. He focused on his role, advancing the President's mission of America First, prioritizing U.S. interests. His appointment was a testament to the President's recognition of his qualifications and leadership, not his sexual orientation. Abilities matter most, not identity.\n\nThe 21st century will be defined by America's competition with the Chinese Communist Party, and winning that contest requires a State Department that prioritizes strategic interests over social crusades. The American electorate agrees: Donald Trump and Marco Rubio are the right people for the job. Until then, the Department is a grave risk to our national security-and America's position in the world.\n\n* * *\n\nKarina Lipsman is a national security expert and visiting fellow at Independent Women's Forum ( iwf.org ).

      "text": "Why Woke Healthcare Is Just Bad Medicine\n\nFirst off, let me start by saying I am Jewish, I served as President Trump's Ambassador and endorsed him the day he announced he was running again, so it's not like I need to give the woke Left another reason to hate me - but here's one more.\n\nAs a doctor and surgeon, I've dedicated my life to upholding the highest standards of medical care. Today, I sound the alarm: the principles of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) threaten to erode the very foundation of our healthcare system, jeopardizing the lives of every American.\n\nConsider the journey of a medical professional - a rigorous eight-year odyssey from the halls of academia to the high-stakes environment of the emergency room. In that critical moment when a life hangs in the balance, excellence is not a luxury, it's a necessity. Yet, we are witnessing the alarming rise of what I call \"mediocre medicine,\" where merit is overshadowed by misguided notions of diversity.\n\nMake no mistake, America was once the envy of the world because we championed meritocracy. We trained the best and brightest, regardless of race or background, fostering a culture of excellence. But now, under the guise of DEI, our institutions have succumbed to a dangerous narrative where qualifications take a backseat to identity politics.\n\nAs we witness doors and panels dropping off planes, unqualified teachers indoctrinating our children, and our weak military becoming the laughingstock of the world stage, the infiltration of DEI into our medical schools presents yet another alarming threat. DEI initiatives, under the guise of promoting ethnic diversity, risk creating a generation of doctors and healthcare providers who are inferior due to lowered standards driven by so-called diversity. The consequences of this ideological shift in medical education have yet to fully materialize, but the potential ramifications for patient care and public health are deeply concerning.\n\nTake, for example, the manipulation of medical school admissions. The Medical College Admission Test (MCAT), a benchmark of academic aptitude, has been compromised in the name of diversity quotas. Instead of raising the bar for all students, universities have opted to lower standards, admitting candidates based not on merit, but on race. Astonishingly, the average MCAT score of rejected Asian applicants closely mirrors that of enrolled black students. This misguided approach has led some institutions to consider eliminating the MCAT altogether to meet their diversity quotas. Rather than elevating standards for all students, this move would sacrifice excellence in favor of checking a box, ultimately undermining the integrity of medical education.\n\nThis insidious practice not only undermines the integrity of our medical education system but also poses a grave threat to patient safety. Medical professionals are prioritizing pronoun preferences over proper surgical procedure. Consider the recent case of a North Carolina medical student boasting about injuring a patient highlights the perilous consequences of prioritizing ideology over competence. Multiple Ivy League Schools, once  bastions of academic excellence, now offer courses like 'Social Change and the Practice of Medicine,' wherein aspiring doctors are groomed to become advocates for social change rather than focusing on the core principles of medical science and patient care. Such ideological indoctrination undermines the very essence of medical education, diverting attention from the paramount goal of equipping future physicians with the knowledge and skills necessary to save lives. This shift towards activism over competency only exacerbates the crisis of mediocre medicine and imperils the well-being of patients nationwide.\n\nMoreover, the push for DEI in medical schools is symptomatic of a broader ideological shift in academia as the law school panels also aim to eliminate the LSAT testing. Radical activists masquerading as educators seek to indoctrinate future physicians with socialist dogma, relegating medical training to a mere afterthought.\n\nWe must reject this assault on excellence and reaffirm our commitment to merit-based principles. When lives are on the line, there is no room for compromise. As a seasoned practitioner, I've witnessed firsthand the stark contrast between the excellence of American medicine and the subpar standards of communist regimes.\n\nKarl Marx's ideology has permeated American medicine with a deep influence of socialist principles in our healthcare system. From the erosion of individual autonomy to the prioritization of collective welfare over patient-centered care, Marxist ideology has reshaped the landscape of American medicine. These are dangerous Marxist principles leading to the erosion of medical ethics and the rise of bureaucratic control in healthcare decision-making. America must embrace the core tenets of medical practice, rooted in individual liberty, free market principles, and the Hippocratic Oath and it is imperative that we remain vigilant in safeguarding the integrity of our healthcare system and preserving the doctor-patient relationship at its core.\n\nLet us heed the warnings of esteemed voices in the medical community, such as Dr. Greg Murphy and Dr. Stanley Goldfarb, who adamantly oppose DEI's intrusion into medical education. Their advocacy for preserving the Hippocratic Oath and prioritizing patient care over political agendas must not fall on deaf ears.\n\nI urge my fellow Americans to stand firm against the encroachment of DEI ideology in our healthcare system. We must staunchly defend the integrity of medical education from ideological infiltration, reaffirming our commitment to excellence and patient-centered care above all else. Let us reclaim the mantle of American exceptionalism by championing merit, not mediocrity, in medical education. The future of our nation's health depends on it.\n\n* * *\n\nAmbassador Jeff Gunter, MD, is an American healthcare executive, philanthropist, diplomat, and former U.S. Ambassador serving as the 24th United States Ambassador to Iceland.

      "text": "Christian College Caves to Woke Mob, Apologizes For Congratulating Alum In Trump Admin\n\nWheaton College posted, and then retracted, a message congratulating Russ Vought on his confirmation to lead the Office of Management and Budget\n\nIllinois' Wheaton College has long traded on its reputation as a doctrinally conservative Christian institution. Its landing page promises prospective students that they will \"find [their] Christ-centered calling\" at the school. And its alumni list reads like who's who of evangelical leaders.\n\nBut the college is unwilling to honor the accomplishments of one famous son because of his association with the Trump administration.\n\nOn Thursday, the Senate confirmed Russ Vought, who has a strong pro-life record, to lead the Office of Management and Budget, with all 53 Republicans voting in his favor. The following day, Wheaton's social media accounts commended Vought, posting that the school \"congratulates and prays\" for him.\n\nBut by Saturday morning, negative comments left by Facebook users prompted Wheaton to retract the post.\n\n\"The recognition and prayer is something we would typically do for any graduate who reached that level of government,\" Wheaton said in a statement. \"However, the political situation surrounding [Vought's] appointment led to a significant concern expressed online. It was not our intention to embroil the College in a political discussion or dispute.\"\n\nThe college added that \"as a non-profit institution, [it] does not make political endorsements,\" even though its congratulatory message was not at all partisan.\n\nWhile Wheaton did not make any formal political endorsements in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election, the school did host a political event with anti-Trump speakers . On September 12, it welcomed The After Party , a political Bible study program created by New York Times columnist David French, Christianity Today editor-in-chief Russell Moore, and Duke Divinity consulting professor Curtis Chang, all three of whom openly opposed Trump's candidacy. French went as far as to endorse Kamala Harris, while Chang called Trump's win \"a disaster for the country\" that left him in \"anguish.\"\n\nThough The After Party says its mission is to \"reframe Christian political thinking,\" it was financed exclusively by left-wing secular funders , including Bill Kristol's anti-Trump group, the Defending Democracy Together Institute - which the campaign finance watchdog Open Secrets highlighted as a major source of dark money in the 2020 and 2024 elections. Moreover, Christian authors like Natasha Crain have highlighted that The After Party's content is \"in no way non-partisan\" and seems intended to \"confuse [church] members into believing that there's a moral equivalence between the political parties.\"\n\nWheaton does not appear to have held any similar political events with conservative speakers in 2024, and Vought told The Daily Wire that he has not been welcomed to speak to students at the school since his early years as a Hill staffer.\n\nThe Daily Wire reached out to Wheaton about its Vought retraction, The After Party event, and whether it welcomed conservative speakers in 2024. Wheaton spokesman Joseph Moore replied \"Offering prayers and congratulations is not a political endorsement. However, the social media post created a distracting amount of conflict on our social media channel, so we removed it and explained why.\"\n\nEric Teetsel, Executive Vice President of the Center for Renewing America and former Vice President of Government Relations at the Heritage Foundation, is, like Vought, a Wheaton graduate with a long history in conservative politics. He told The Daily Wire he's incredibly disappointed in his alma mater, and no longer feels he can recommend it to friends.\n\n\"Last summer, I proudly walked two of my daughters around campus to see the place that means so much to me,\" he said. \"It breaks my heart that I could not in good conscience encourage them to attend Wheaton, too. The alumni magazine always features generational students. Some have family members going back seven and eight generations! I always wanted that. It sucks.\"\n\nEconomist and author David Bahnsen echoed Teetsel's sentiments, writing on X, \"Admitting you took down a 'call to prayer' because people online were mad at you is rank cowardice. Parents should take note of [Wheaton's] boldness and courage when considering a school for their young adult children, because this is seriously pathetic.\"\n\nBahnsen added in a text to The Daily Wire: \"Their rationale for the takedown was even worse than the takedown.\"\n\nMembers of Congress, too, were quick to express their disgust with Wheaton's capitulation.\n\n\"Russ Vought is a highly accomplished alumni who should be celebrated. It's absurd that the smallest minority of detractors come away victorious yet again,\" Missouri Senator Eric Schmitt said .\n\nHillsdale College, which, like Wheaton, is a private institution, had also congratulated Vought on its social media pages on Thursday. On Saturday, it reaffirmed those well wishes, posting , \"Trigger warning: We will not be deleting our earlier post congratulating Russ Vought.\"\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "Conservatives Won The Word 'Woke.' Now It's Time To Reclaim Accurate Language Everywhere\n\nBy describing woke ideologies and their fruits at face value, conservatives felled the left's self-conferred monopoly on how, when, and where the term could be used.\n\nThe Associated Press Stylebook, a once-respected linguistic guide for journalists, conceded the definition of the word \"woke\" to conservatives on Thursday, in an update instructing writers to \"use quotes around the slang term.\"\n\n\"Woke\" was originally popularized by left-wing proponents of identity politics to flatteringly refer to their own \"enlightenment or awakening about issues of racial and other forms of social justice,\" as the AP explains. Conservatives have used it to describe those same people and their ideas.\n\nThose ideas more often than not, demand revolutionary social changes that prejudge people based on their secondary physical characteristics. If, like the vast majority of America until about five seconds ago, you think such identitarian prejudices are a bad thing, you might use the word \"woke\" in a less than fawning manner. Apparently, the AP's staff can't handle that.\n\nAP's concession of the word is hilariously thin-skinned, but it's also a rare win for conservatives in the war of words. Just by describing woke behavior as such, we've held a bit of ground against the unhinged language police who are mad that the right is using their terminology against them. Unintentionally, it seems we've ended up with command of the word altogether, if left-wing outlets like the AP are henceforth refusing to use it.\n\nWhile there are times individual ideologies require a more specific description - queer theory, or socialism, for example - \"woke\" is a completely fair and often helpful term to use when speaking generally about the coalition of people on the left who want to see meritocracy replaced by identity politics. As my colleague Samuel Mangold-Lenett noted recently in these pages, \"what other slogany-sounding word really works as a catch-all for what leftism has become?\"\n\n\"They lost complete control of the English language,\" he added, \"and the word they used to indicate their radicalism to one another is being used to expose that radicalism to the rest of the world.\"\n\nThe apparatus of left-wing media outlets, cultural celebrities, and tech platforms that drives our modern discourse has a majority share in defining the language we use. From headlines to search engines to literal dictionaries , activists manipulate the tools of debate. In any debate, the first step is defining your terms - if your definitions are off, you've already lost.\n\nThat's why it's incumbent upon conservatives to be intentional, honest, and straightforward with the words we use. That includes defending the legitimacy of disfavored-but-accurate terms (like \"woke,\" or \"woman\") and refusing to use inaccurate language.\n\nTake the nonsense phrase \"gender-affirming care,\" for example. The diction dictators have effectively standardized the term, to the point where even people who disapprove of such procedures will glibly repeat it. But nothing about the phrase is tethered to reality.\n\nThe whole idea that people have \"genders\" beyond their natural sex is pseudo-science crafted to further an ideology. Procedures that attempt to inhibit or reverse the physical realities of a person's sex are not \"affirming\" that sex, but actively rejecting it. And deformative surgeries that involve amputating healthy body parts and creating Frankenstein-esque \"penises\" and \"vaginas\" with scraps of carved-up skin are certainly not \"care.\"\n\nTo use the phrase \"gender-affirming care\" is to give up the entire argument before it's even begun. Or, as George Orwell put it, such nonsense terms \"construct your thoughts for you,\" and \"perform the important service of partially concealing your meaning even from yourself.\"\n\nThe same goes for using improper pronouns to describe sexually confused people: calling a man \"she\" or a woman \"he.\" Doing so indulges a delusion. Having physical reality on your side does little good if you concede it away by the very words you use.\n\nThe list of nonsense words that woke ideologues are injecting into common parlance is long. For starters, here's a list of \" 10 Politically Correct But Factually False Words And Phrases To Stop Using Immediately ,\" and a follow-up list of eight more .\n\nConcurrent with the effort to mainstream invented euphemisms such as \"gender-affirming care\" is an effort to cannibalize established English vocabulary. Other victims of the AP Stylebook's recent crusades include \"riot,\" \"mistress,\" \"crazy,\" and \"pro-life.\" Proper grammar is also a victim, with the redefinition of the plural pronoun \"they\" to refer to individuals who are in denial of their natural sex.\n\nTech monopolies such as Google instruct their employees to avoid terms like \"man hours\" and \"blacklist.\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has nixed \"criminal\" and \"foreigner.\" From journalism to medicine, terms such as \"mother\" and \"woman\" are replaced by dehumanizing lingo like \"birthing parent\" and \"person who menstruates.\" Merriam-Webster has redefined \" anti-vaxxer ,\" \" sexual preference ,\" and \" assault rifle \" to further the editors' ideological ends.\n\nBy describing woke ideologies and their fruits at face value, conservatives felled the left's self-conferred monopoly on how, when, and where the term could be used. But the same people policing the word \"woke\" are appointing themselves the arbiters of the rest of the English language, too.\n\nFor those of us who prefer our words to reflect reality, there is nothing to be gained by good-naturedly going along with linguistic charades. On the other hand, there is the entire discourse to be lost.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

      "text": "A Woke Children's Literature Cabal Is Conditioning Your Kid To Be An Obedient Leftist\n\nThe entire children's book publishing industry - from authors to publishers to librarians - believes it should have the power to control your kids' minds.\n\nChildren's books are one of the most powerful tools parents have to help teach their kids how to be good humans. From picture books being read at bedtime to novels being read by flashlight under blankets, kids flourish in the safety of stories as they develop their belief systems. Resilience, empathy, respect, and many other noble traits are portrayed and experienced vicariously through books. What a powerful tool!\n\nHaving been a part of the children's book publishing industry for several decades, and as a passionate participant, I have watched in growing dismay as the children's literature, or \"kidlit,\" world has shifted and changed, and most recently taken a drastic plummet. Parents need to understand the destructive path this industry has taken, or they will discover too late as the damage hits home.\n\nThis shift in kidlit has been happening for a long time. About 25 years ago, novels that portrayed kids as environmental activists began to win awards. About 15 years ago, the award-winning books showed shocking, disturbing scenarios. Ten years ago, books that depicted sexualization and abuse at younger ages began to win awards. Then, five years ago, it shifted a bit more to where books focused on systemic racism and sexual identity won awards. Today, if books don't include any of the above depictions, they are rarely published by medium and large publishing houses.\n\nAnd it's the medium and large publishing houses that supply schools, libraries, and bookstores.\n\nEight years ago, I organized a statewide writer's conference for children's book authors. We brought in several high-powered industry members from major publishing houses. One editor's words threw open the window to this shifting world.\n\nShe asked a writer at our conference, who was a leftist himself, about his story. He explained that in his manuscript, his main character learns that his hero is gay. The protagonist is troubled by this and works through his feelings to come to acceptance later in the book.\n\nThe respected editor stopped the writer mid-explanation and said, \"No.\" She explained that in kids' books, we must present the ideal as if it already exists. There can be no \"being troubled by\" gayness. There can be no \"coming to terms with\" sexual identity. The characters in our stories must immediately accept with positive responses any representation of modern social constructs. This immediately laudatory reaction to woke ideology is now required in kidlit. If an author doesn't portray it as such, his book will not be published.\n\nThis pronouncement by the editor shocked me and many other writers there. The line had now been drawn. As writers, our hope of publication rested on our willingness to positively portray woke ideology.\n\nShortly after this conference, as a part of several online writers' groups, I started to see comments like this: \"We have a duty to save children from conservative, Christian thought,\" and \"It's our responsibility as writers to right the wrongs of past traditional thinking.\" In their minds, they were in a strategic position as writers of kids' books to influence young minds in the direction they wanted. These groups soon canceled me.\n\nIn the past three years, there has been another dangerous shift. In 2020, the Publisher's Weekly list of Best Middle Grade Books of the year featured 14 titles. These are books for kids ages 9 to 13. Out of the 14 books, nine on that year's list openly spoke about racism and sexual identity. Each book's description clearly identified these themes. Of the 14 books on the 2021 Best Books list , nine of the 14 again included topics of racism and sexual identity, but this time, some were clearly identified and others subtly presented. On the Publisher's Weekly list of Best Middle Grade Books for 2022 , nine of the 14 books discussed racism and sexual identity, but only one clearly stated so in the book description.\n\nPublishers no longer openly tell readers about the portrayal of radical social agendas in their books. They are subtly inserting the concepts that they want to teach young kids without letting parents know they are there.\n\nThis shift frightens me more. We have moved from the inclusion of liberal social agendas in kids' books - and flaunting it - to sneaking them in under the radar of parents. This is called normalization. The goal is to include these ideologies in exciting, adventurous stories so they become commonplace. Woke ideology has shifted from being the make-up of a book's plot lines to the fabric of the setting - the normal backdrop of the story as if it exists that way in real life.\n\nThis normalization leads to acceptance, which leads to embracing. By weaving these social agendas into the \"normal\" background of a story, a child who feels shocked at a scene or description immediately shifts to feeling shame for being shocked in the first place. Kids will seek to replace their shame with acceptance. This is the power of normalization.\n\nWhen I know what a book is about, I can make sure my child doesn't read it. When I'm being kept in the dark, these ideologies may slip past me and fall directly into my child's hands and mind. Strong storytelling mixed with normalized social agendas creates a book that will influence my child in ways I don't want. This is the power the industry holds.\n\nWe can no longer walk into a library or bookstore, grab a children's novel off the shelf, and expect it to be clean, based on traditional values, or to contain age-appropriate material. It won't.\n\nAnd not only books and publishers pose a problem. After the seismic cultural shift that happened in 2016, libraries across the nation purged their shelves of anything \"old.\" This weeding out pulled many classics, which got some attention, but the deepest cuts were made in the children's departments. Traditional values were ejected to make room for new, modern left-wing values - from board books for babies to young adult novels.\n\nMany homeschool families use literature extensively in their programs because of the versatility of the media. But these families have increasingly become dismayed at what they are finding at the local libraries they have depended on for so long. I have heard from many parents that they no longer go to the library at all. What a shame! Even when well-meaning people donate clean books with traditional values to their local libraries, in the hopes of spreading light, many new library acquisition policies dictate that the donations be thrown away.\n\nOf 12,000 librarian donors to the 2020 presidential campaign, 93 percent went to President Joe Biden . The vast majority of public and school librarians across the nation are leftist in their personal beliefs and are more than happy to join the publishing industry in promoting their ideals. We see this in children's book promotional displays, in the way librarians arrange books on shelves, and in the books they order. In your library, you may find more than a dozen different children's biographies on Ruth Bader Ginsberg, but not even one on Amy Coney Barrett. This has become typical.\n\nOn Feb. 25, 2023, conservative children's book publisher Brave Books, hosted a story hour at the Hendersonville, Tennessee Public Library. Kirk Cameron, Missy Robertson, and Riley Gaines went to read their traditional-value books to kids. When the librarian learned who they were, he tried to stop the story hour, saying he \"didn't want their movement\" in his library. This librarian had previously hosted drag queen story hours. But Brave Books had arranged the story hour according to the library's policies, so it couldn't be stopped. So instead, the head librarian, along with his two assistants, did everything they could to disrupt the event. They blasted music, banged tables, and tried shouting them down.\n\nFortunately, Hendersonville is a very conservative community. Almost a thousand families came to the library for the story hour and appreciated the opportunity to stand up for traditional values in kids' books. Due to public outcry, within a few weeks, the librarian had been fired.\n\nThis is what we're up against. The entire children's book publishing industry - from authors to publishers to librarians - believes it should have the power to control your children's minds. And it has systematically and progressively gained that access.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

      "text": "How I Survived My Woke Employer's Diversity, Equity, And Inclusion Struggle Sessions\n\nMy woke boss was chomping at the bit to \"do the work,\" for racial equity, so HR decided to divide employees into groups based upon their DNA.\n\nIt all started out innocuously enough.\n\nIn the midst and aftermath of the violent riots of 2020, companies flocked to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) consultants for guidance. They were under intense pressure to \"do something\" to demonstrate their commitment to racial justice.\n\nMy pharma biotech employer was no different. My boss - an abundantly avuncular, smart, and very woke Oberlin, CIA, and Wall Street alum - was chomping at the bit to make public statements in support of the prevailing \"social justice\" zeitgeist.\n\nHe did, at one point, hold forth on anti-Asian hate - perhaps in a nod to the ethnic composition of our workforce - but that subsided as it became clear that such hate was not emanating principally from white supremacist precincts. Around the same time, there had been a spate of antisemitic violence in the New York area, but no supportive statement was issued in response to that: too complicated, a combination of both Rube and Whoopi Goldbergian elements.\n\nMy company was far from the most woke. Indeed, the most progressive thing we did, workplace-wise, was to make our headquarters dog-friendly, largely at the behest of our canine-loving CEO. This had wide support except for in HR - or \"People Strategy,\" as we called it - which had to deal with both the allergy people and the cat people.\n\nNevertheless, the company did a number of things to manifest its commitment to DEI. For example, we incentivized the creation of employee affinity groups on the basis of race and ethnicity. After all, nothing fosters racial amity better than segregating employees into groups based upon their DNA!\n\nI was asked to be the executive sponsor for the Hispanic affinity group. This was no doubt because of my well-known devotion to all things Iberian. For starters, my surname is both Spanish and Italian. I am married to a Wise Latina, and my kids are wise Latina guys and girls. If I had married an Italian like me, no doubt they would have been merely wise guys. Indeed, I \"identified\" as Hispanic before \"identifying as something you most definitely are not\" was cool.\n\nAnyway, I agreed to be the executive sponsor of the group and met with two fellow employees who had founded the group. While reviewing the charter, I noticed that the verbiage referred to \"Latinx this\" and \"Latinx that.\"\n\nI screwed up my courage and said, \"Listen, compadres, I am happy to sponsor this group on one condition: we banish any reference to Latinx.\" After all, I explained, \"Latinx\" is a culturally imperialist term that ravishes our beautiful, beloved, gendered Castellano in favor of this monstrosity foisted upon \"us\" by woke white people.\n\nI held my breath awaiting their reaction. I was relieved when they started chuckling. One said, \"I totally agree with you, that term was imposed upon us,\" Thereafter, \"Latinx\" was consigned to the dustbin of history, allowing us to concentrate on pressing cultural matters, like which Hispanic restaurant would be the destination of our first field trip.\n\nI took a mental victory lap after slaying the Latinx dragon. But soon thereafter, I was to face an even more fearsome foe: \"People Strategy\" had hired DEI consultants, and the Executive Committee, on which I sat, was scheduled for a three-hour session with them.\n\nAs preparation, each of us had to complete a statement on what we hoped to accomplish during the session. I hoped to survive the three hours without going insane. I didn't write that down. Instead, I wrote something gauzy like \"I aspire to foster a workplace where people of all backgrounds can thrive.\" Who could argue with that?\n\nWell, the two woke white ladies who ran the session could! I had heard tales of woke white people telling other white people they are racist and expected to hear some of that during our DEI session. I was not disappointed.\n\nWe went through a battery of exercises and discussions that all basically had the same message. Whether we realized it or not, we were all racist, the woke white ladies darkly implied. Admittedly, we were all white.\n\nOne of my colleagues, a whip-smart emigre from Europe, said she aspired to create a color-blind workplace. The gasps of horror escaping from the woke white ladies were immediate, audible, and visible.\n\nColor-blindness is a myth, Woke White Lady Number One soberly informed us. We know that because \"experts\" have done \"studies\" that prove that beyond any reasonable, non-racist doubt. Concurrently, Woke White Lady Number Two bombarded us on the Teams Chat screen with links to numerous \"studies\" buttressing that point. It's almost as if they were expecting that particular blasphemy.\n\nThings proceeded along a similar path for the entire session. Another bombshell came when one colleague ventured that we should strive for a meritocratic workplace where employees are rewarded for effort and good work, regardless of their race, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, or weird hobbies.\n\nGasp! The woke white ladies got the vapors yet again. \"Meritocracy\" is a myth that \"experts have found\" is designed to enforce patriarchy and white supremacy, intoned Woke White Lady Number One. Yet again, Woke White Lady Number Two leaped into action, bombarding us with links to \"studies\" conducted by \"experts\" that demonstrated beyond all doubt that the \"M\" word was simply an awful concept whose mere mention constituted a microaggression.\n\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, the session ended, with the woke white ladies promising to consolidate their findings and advise us on next steps.\n\nI resigned some time thereafter due to the company's imposition of a \"get vaxxed or get fired\" mandate. I am not sure whether and to what extent the wit and wisdom of the woke white ladies were incorporated into the corporate ethos. I just hope and pray that the fearsome Latinx beast has not reared zer fearsome head again to terrorize the remaining Wise Latinos and Latinas.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "How Wokeness Puts Its Defenders In A Chokehold - And How To Help Them Out\n\nSince Oct. 7, leftists are finally waking up to see how their cause discards allies so easily and abandons moral axioms so callously.\n\nThe weeks following the Oct. 7 atrocities, where 1,400 Jews were brutally killed in Israel, have been paradigm-shattering for many who had heretofore considered themselves woke allies.\n\nThe vilest acts of terrorism there were regaled here by all the usual woke suspects: Black Lives Matter and LGBT activists, college and high school students , and well-positioned college professors . The shameless celebrations on the backs of terrorism quickly pivoted to an explosion of blatant harassment of Jewish people on campuses and beyond, leaving those still living in the realm of sanity to question what this movement actually stood for all along.\n\nFor those looking to \"detransition\" out from woke possession, and those seeking to facilitate their escape, it is essential to understand how exactly so many were captured by it. The process of leaving the woke movement is similar to that of disentangling oneself from a cult or an abusive narcissist. You must begin to spot the lies and identify the various forms of manipulation. Once seen, such tactics are hard to unsee, and the spell breaks abruptly.\n\nStages of woke manipulation generally move from pity to fear to force. It starts with appeals to compassion, then preys upon fear of social or civic retribution, and finally moves to force through coercive laws, encroachments on freedom, corruption of agencies and institutions, and finally violence.\n\nThe first stage is the most subtle. In any marginalized identity group, there are plenty of examples of legitimate injustices that ought to elicit righteous anger and compassion in response. The #MeToo movement for example had no shortage of boorish and abusive male transgressions to galvanize a societal corrective. The BLM movement capitalized on racial grievances and militarized them.\n\nIt's easy in the moment to overlook the uncomfortable excesses amid any sort of collective correction. If slogans such as \"believe all women,\" \"smash the patriarchy,\" or \"defund the police,\" seemed themselves unjust, well, such rhetoric can be forgiven when people have suffered so much. Likewise, if we need to turn workplaces and schools into DEI struggle sessions and silence or amplify employees and students based on skin color, maybe that's justified if other groups have been so privileged.\n\nThe word \"privilege\" is a powerful rhetorical device for this form of manipulation. It is a word used not to induce gratitude but to impugn guilt and cement a fundamental redefinition of the person. Traditionally, we have defined persons based on what unites us: We are all rational animals, or we are made in the image of God.\n\nFor the woke, we are defined not by the love of God, but by the hatred of mankind. We are defined by what divides us. The appeal to pity then holds power only as long as we see ourselves on one side or the other of this unbridgeable binary of groups who are made innocent by their victimhood and groups who are implicated by their privilege.\n\nAt this stage, some might start to suspect that something is amiss. Perhaps it is not actually compassionate or empowering to persuade people that they are in a permanent victim class. Despite this gnawing suspicion, many will remain silent out of fear. This stage of manipulation is implicit: Even if compassion has worn thin, most people don't want to appear uncompassionate. Belonging is a fundamental human need, and fear of ostracism is a compelling motivator.\n\nThe movement exploits this fear through the militancy in which it demands full-throated endorsement of its tenets. For example, judging people by the content of their character - not the color of their skin - has long been understood to be a good and right goal and one endorsed by our civil rights heroes of old. But in 2020, it became not only insufficient but demonstrably evil, as colorblindness was rebranded as a sign of white supremacy.\n\nManipulation by fear is not only through social condemnation but also financial and civic retribution. In any given workplace there are substantial numbers of employees who sit silently through DEI trainings and begrudgingly offer their pronouns knowing that to object could cost them their livelihoods. Even if they work independently, platforms such as YouTube have demonstrated their swift and certain ability to instantly wipe away an entire channel of income. The implicit threat of this sort can encourage anyone to self-censor.\n\nThe fear stage blends easily into force. What was normalized through weaponized compassion, fear, and silence becomes codified in law and policy.\n\nThe force stage is both alarming and hopeful. Before this stage, the movement still seems benevolent to many. It was easy enough to overlook the more militant parts of wokeism or translate them into something reasonable. Force is the acceleration stage where the social justice movement is exposed as neither social nor just.\n\nEvidence that we are firmly in the force stage of escalation abound. The proof is in the rampant rioting and criminality in the summer of 2020, the legal persecution of pro-lifers in 2023, the forced spoon-feeding of gender ideology in grammar schools, and corporate media's corrupt and desperate running interference in defense of all this. And if the destruction, corruption, and perversions were not enough, maybe the progression to antisemitism and terrorism is. Even if flaccid apologies roll in as institutional donors roll out , the logic of revolution is finally laid bare, and the exposure is too much to walk back.\n\nThough this stage feels not a little terrifying, it presents an opportunity for a burgeoning political realignment. Like the feminists who felt betrayed when the revolution sacrificed them for the transgender movement, many leftists are seeing with clarity the bankruptcy of a cause that can discard allies so easily and abandon moral axioms so callously.\n\nTo welcome them and buttress a return to sanity, we need to alleviate the two greatest barriers to taking the off-ramp from wokeism: power and complicity.\n\nThe greatest intoxication of getting woke is that it imbues a person with a sense of great virtue and power. The movement gives perverse incentive to find one's moral stature in claiming a victim identity. Every perpetual victim needs a perpetual culprit. This leads to a society of accusers in constant roiling conflict, unable to self-examine - incentivized to find evil everywhere around him but never within.\n\nAll are tempted to deflect responsibility, but healthy communities - from a well-ordered family to Christianity - seek to counter it through things like examinations of conscience, confession, or the natural way that the intimacy of family life can hold a mirror to our conscience. The woke movement in contrast seeks to exploit - not counter - this human tendency to deflect and accuse.\n\nBecause this habit of victim/accuser identity is hard to break, we ought to fight the woke revolution without devolving into angry belligerent blowhards who would never welcome a woke refugee into our realm. We want to be the sort of people to whom friends can sincerely admit that they bought into a fraud without feeling that we will spike the football on them.\n\nThe other obstacle to the off-ramp is complicity. How many of the woke have passionately argued for it, cast off lifelong friends over it, engaged in shameful behavior, or supported horrifying things? Even if they now have a growing awareness that they might have been wrong, it is hard to face and hard to hear. There is no truth more offensive than the one we are trying to silence in ourselves.\n\nThe urge to say \"I told you so\" is strong, but the goal is victory, not valorization. Those who can face their complicity and reverse course have the sort of story and courage that can build a powerful off-ramp for many others.\n\nIn this final stage of the woke revolution, it looks to be either nearly triumphant or on life support. Which way we perceive it can determine if we course-correct. Wokeism colonizes the soul by requiring people to lie inwardly so they can accept the lies they must promote outwardly. Normalizing saying true things helps stir change in others, but that groundwork is often hidden for some time. There is good reason to think the spell of ideology is breaking. Keep going.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

      "text": "The Woke Mob Ruined Bon Appetit, And I'm Still Salty About It\n\nI couldn't stomach a 'cooking' magazine that is more devoted to promoting LGBT awareness than teaching readers about delicious food.\n\nI am fortunate to be part of a vibrant Google group (that has since spun off into an excellent Substack ), where weekly conversations can run the gamut from intense national security discussions to analyzing Taylor Swift's latest album. Several years ago, someone in the group asked for recommendations for a solid cooking magazine, and many folks (myself included) chimed in with a vote for Bon Appetit .\n\nYou can tell the BA writers really love to cook, and they want you to love it, too, was an apt description of the mag offered by one group member, to which I heartily agreed. How could I not? As an avid home cook and a loyal BA subscriber, who eagerly awaited the monthly arrival of each new issue to my mailbox, I relished reading it cover to cover, and gaining inspiration for new dishes to share with family and friends.\n\nI can't remember when that BA recommendation conversation took place, but it had to be pre-2020, a year notable (to my mind, and undoubtedly the minds of other avid home cooks) not only for the pandemic, but as the \" Year That Bon Appetit Imploded .\" At the end of last year, as I finally pulled the trigger and canceled my annual auto-renewal for 2023, I thought ruefully of that conversation and of the magazine BA had once been. But I had to admit it: after dozens of issues of idly flipping through the \"new Bon Appetit,\" as they tried to rebrand what is now a woke rag, only ostensibly related to cooking, I couldn't stomach giving money to a \"cooking\" magazine that is more devoted to promoting LGBT awareness than teaching readers about delicious food.\n\nA January 2022 article titled \"Over Fried Fish, I Said Goodbye to My Wife - And to a Version of Myself\" confirmed that year would be my last one as a subscriber. It was a meandering, self-indulgent essay from a trans-identifying man who'd \"discovered\" he was really a woman after living in Uganda with his wife, while she chronicled the LGBT movement there for her doctoral research.\n\nThe article had nothing to do with food, except for the description of the couple's final meal together - a Ugandan fried fish dish - during which he informed his wife he'd be leaving her to live his new life as a \"woman,\" a decision with which, I think, we were meant to sympathize. At any rate, the author thoughtfully tacked on a recipe for the dish, so readers could recreate the meal at which he broke his wife's heart in their own home.\n\nLater that year, for the June \"Pride\" edition (which was truly indistinguishable from the other editions), the magazine featured an article titled \"I Realized I Was Trans While Making Cheese\" and a recipe for \"Big Queer Cold Noodles.\" Yum?\n\nOn that note, it isn't simply these new, bizarre essays that make BA unreadable, but that the tenor of the recipes has changed, too. Laser-focused as Dawn Davis, the new editor, seems to be on promoting \"intersectionality\" and avoiding cultural appropriation, the only recipes that make the cut are hyper-authentic, traditional, cultural recipes that require a laundry list of exotic ingredients that the average home cook likely does not have in her pantry or refrigerator.\n\nAs someone who experiments with all sorts of cuisines, even I balked at the thought of a dedicated trip to H Mart for an additional five ingredients to make a single dish. Now that I live in rural Texas, there's nowhere within a 30-minute drive to get many of those ingredients.\n\nWhere old Bon Appetit featured approachable, slightly anglicized riffs on a cultural dish, or highlighted ways to incorporate a new-to-you ingredient or technique into favorite recipes, \"new BA\" demands strict cultural homogeneity for each dish, made with all of the most authentic ingredients, lest you (gasp!) stray into appropriation territory (never mind that the synthesis of ingredients and techniques across time and cultures has made food vastly more delicious).\n\nOn that note, the recipe had better come from someone who grew up eating it, too, which means that talented BA recipe writers have been pigeonholed into writing recipes from their countries of origin - not a bad gig if you can get it, but pretty darn limiting nevertheless.\n\nIn researching prevailing opinions about the new BA, I found a conversation on Reddit about whether Bon Appetit is \"worth it,\" (especially as their website is now paywalled) that sums up what BA has become: \"It seems like Bon Appetit has decided to market to a worldwide upper-middle class multicultural cooking market (are you a Nigerian-immigrant family Harvard educated surgeon who likes to cook?)\"\n\nIn other words, if you're not a woke, elitist member of the BIPOC LGBT so-called community, Bon Appetit is no longer made for you. Subscription, canceled.\n\nBut I'm happy to report that all is not lost in the cooking magazine world - at least, not for those of us who are still looking for all the things BA used to be. I've learned through a recent subscription to Food and Wine that the genre still has something to offer. The most recent edition featured exactly the kinds of things that I'd loved about Bon Appetit : a fun and delicious-sounding chocolate cake recipe based on a dish from a popular show (FX's \" The Bear \"), various iterations of omelets from around the world and how to make them, a primer on all the different kinds of pepper (with approachable recipes that best highlight each one), a feature on good, affordable whiskeys, and more.\n\nAs salty as I still am over BA, I surprised myself by reading my new copy of Food and Wine cover to cover, comforted that all was not lost in the food magazine world (and I earmarked that chocolate cake recipe for use after Lent is over).\n\nIf you, too, are looking for something to fill in for Bon Appetit, here are a few other suggestions: Friends have also long raved to me about the old standby Cook's Illustrated (by the folks at America's Test Kitchen), and I've also heard good things about America's Test Kitchen founder Christopher Kimball 's recent spinoff, Milk Street Magazine. The King Arthur Baking Company has great online content for those who like their baking woke-free (although I've never flipped through a copy of their magazine Sift). Garden and Gun, while not strictly a food magazine, has excellent food-related content.\n\nWith inflation soaring and budgets tighter than ever before, consumers deserve to get their money's worth on nonessentials like cooking magazines. Do yourself and your wallet a favor, and put your money towards a food magazine that's actually about, well - food .\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "21 Woke Mandates Reveal California's Radical Education Bender\n\nCalifornia funds leftist interest groups to transform schools, while requiring all districts to follow mandates pushed by said interest groups.\n\nIn less than 12 years, California has passed more than 20 education mandates with the goal of sowing radical gender theory and critical race theory into the state's education practices.\n\nIt is easy to get numb to California's single-minded pursuit of wokeness in K-12 education. When all of California's actions are collected in one place (as we show in a recent report from the Claremont Institute's Center for the American Way of Life and the Idaho Freedom Foundation), the ambitions are truly breathtaking. Since 2011, California has gone on a social justice bender.\n\nEach of these 21 mandates aims to remedy either (1) homophobia, (2) transphobia, or (3) racial inequity, or (4) establish manipulative teaching techniques to shape children's affections toward the first three categories. California laws, it seems, are focused on promoting gay pride and transgenderism among students. At least eight mandates concern combatting homophobia or incorporating gender identity into school policy, classroom instruction, or teacher training. In addition, California emphasizes developing manipulative teaching techniques called \"transformative-social and emotional\" learning and culturally responsive teaching so that its woke agenda can be ever more successfully implemented. Let's look at some of these specific mandates.\n\nSeth's Law , enacted in 2011, mandates schools to adopt anti-bullying policies that include sexual orientation, gender identity, and/or gender expression. The state also enacted the FAIR Education Act in 2011 which mandates that examples of LGBT people be incorporated into social science instruction for all K-12 students.\n\nIn 2015, California enacted the Healthy Youth Act which mandated \"LGBTQ+ inclusive\" Comprehensive Sex Education for grades 7-12. The next year, the state adopted a suicide prevention policy requiring public schools to adopt suicide prevention policies for grades K-12 that specifically mention and incorporate LGBT students. Two years later, the adoption of the Online Anti-Bullying Training for Teachers and School Staff required schools to provide teachers and staff with annual online training on bullying.\n\nThe Safe and Supportive Schools Act of 2019 required the California Department of Education (CDE) to provide LGBT resources for school districts. The CDE then adopted the Health Education Framework in 2019 which includes training teachers to affirm and perhaps cultivate LGBT identities in students. Kindergarten students must learn about challenging gender stereotypes, gender identity, transgenderism, and gender nonconformity. None of this, however, is enough for the CDE to rectify supposed homophobia in the system. This year the superintendent of public instruction created a task force on inclusive education to pressure curriculum providers to diversify their materials and be LGBT inclusive.\n\nIn 2013, California enacted the School Success and Opportunity Act, which required public schools to allow all K-12 students to use bathrooms, locker rooms, and other school facilities not based on their sex. By 2021, the state passed the Menstrual Equity for All Act requiring public schools to put feminine hygiene products in both men's and women's restrooms in grades 6-12. In 2022, the Gender-Affirming Health Care Act was passed, effectively allowing the state of California to take a child from his or her parent's custody if the parent does not affirm transgender surgery.\n\nCalifornia has increasingly made school discipline into a race issue. Beginning in 2019, the state passed a law on suspension and expulsion that required public schools to adopt a \"restorative justice\" program banning suspensions in elementary and middle schools for willful defiance. In 2021, the CDE published school discipline guidelines directing school districts to adopt restorative justice practices and more social-emotional learning in the classroom.\n\nNow the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Mandate passed in 2021 requires that all students must complete a semester-long course in ethnic studies in order to graduate from high school. The state recently adopted a mathematics framework for all K-12 schools and declared that \"teaching toward social justice can play an important role in shifting students' perspectives.\" These ideological math standards presuppose that teaching math plainly and objectively reinforces oppressive power structures, and therefore must be transformed through politicized pedagogical practices to make math about social justice and equity.\n\nIn 2011, California Early Childhood Educator Competencies incorporated a focus on \"culture, diversity and equity,\" which requires the use of culturally responsive teaching methods, \"identity development,\" and SEL competencies. In 2017 the CDE developed the \" California SEL Guiding Principles \" which affirmed SEL as \"an essential part of a well-rounded, quality education in all youth-serving settings.\" The guiding principles included a commitment to equity, culturally responsive teaching, and whole-child practices.\n\nA few years later, the State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond created the \"Advance SEL in California Campaign.\" The project culminated with a report declaring that Transformative Social-Emotional Learning (T-SEL) needed to be the \"cornerstone of California's education system.\" Another key finding of the initiative was that racial equity must be an integral part of T-SEL. To implement the recommendations made by the campaign, the CDE developed \"equity-focused\" T-SEL guidance tools for districts to use in \"every learning and teaching context across the education system.\" The tools directed districts to adopt culturally responsive policies that reinforce \"equity, inclusion and anti-racism.\"\n\nUnder CDE's 2020 Transforming Schools Initiative (TSI), the time kids spend within public schools increases. Spending on universal pre-K programs grows by $100 million. TSI establishes \"community schools\" where education bureaucrats in partnership with leftist interest groups visit private homes to prepare all for culturally responsive and equity training in schools.\n\nThe money supporting the California social justice apparatus includes $1.8 billion for professional development including equity and LGBT training, and affirmative action for teachers; $500 million for school counselor training and residencies; $250 million for inclusive early education programs; over $1 billion to improve school lunches; $5 billion for a 30-day increase in the number of school days.\n\nThe TSI gives no less than $75,000 to school districts to use for anti-bias activities , such as anti-racism teacher and administrator training, the development of a diversity plan, \"inclusive\" curricula for K-12 students that address bigotry or racism and promote \"pride in one's multiple identities,\" and student-led efforts about racism or bigotry. Leftist interest groups will organize to receive a large chunk of the funds to provide endless training.\n\nCalifornia's K-12 system is a perfect storm. The legislature lavishly funds leftist interest groups to transform the schools, while requiring all school districts to follow the curriculum mandates pushed by leftist interest groups. Interest groups are pushing on open doors, since school boards and the state Department of Education are filled with ideologues who embrace the woke vision. Teacher certification programs in schools of education are informed by this vision too. It is, to some extent, the same in every state. But when it comes to wokeness in education, there is no place like California.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

      "text": "How Woke Lefties Ruined Aspen\n\nOn Christmas Eve in 2019, The Aspen Times fired its most popular columnist.\n\nGlenn Beaton had been writing his column for seven years. Called \"The Aspen Beat,\" it routinely took to task - most often in a humorous way - the woke pieties of the famous mountain town and its privileged left-wing elites. The token conservative writer was gone. The newspaper's intolerance caused its readers to lose an insightful source of contemporary analysis. But now in his new book, High Attitude: How Woke Liberals Ruined Aspen , Beaton delivers for all with biting sarcasm the full story of the resort town.\n\nThat story begins only 150 years ago with, appropriately enough, a somewhat crackpot idea called \"free silver.\" For the last quarter of the 19th century, the idea kicked around that the government should buy large quantities of silver to create an easy money supply. And for a time, it did just that. Aspen, originally called Ute City, had some of the largest silver deposits on Earth, and it boomed, reaching a population of more than 12,000. Congress repealed the Sherman Silver Purchase Act in 1893, ending the artificial demand for the metal, and Aspen became a quasi-ghost town with a population at the dawn of the 20th century of only a few hundred.\n\nAfter a long downturn, Aspen boomed again immediately after World War II, with skiing as the new silver. Beaton tells with verve the very human story of Army veterans and Chicago businessmen coming together to create a ski resort. Aspen's first modern chair lift was opened in 1947, one of the longest in the world. Aspen became not just a town, but a brand - now one of the most prestigious in the world.\n\nBut Aspen then had a second downfall. The 1960s introduced America to drug abuse and other moral laxness on a widespread scale. Beaton makes the telling point that America has recovered from the '60s, but Aspen has not. Famously, Colorado has legalized marijuana. But in Aspen, non-enforcement of state and federal drug laws by a series of sheriffs has effectively made almost any drug use possible. One consequence - Beaton reminds us more than once - is that the suicide rate in Aspen is double the national average.\n\nOne famous suicide was Hunter S. Thompson, the \"gonzo\" writer still held up as a model in the tolerant town, who gets put under Beaton's microscope. Others examined are some who literally \"got away with murder\" or almost did. The '70s shooting of Spider Sabich by his movie star girlfriend and a murder by Ted Bundy both show the inbred liberal inattention to law enforcement. Bundy was apprehended elsewhere and brought back to Aspen, where he then escaped through an unlocked jailhouse window. He went on to murder again. The Kennedys' disregard of basic skiing rules that apply to mere mortals led to the death of one of their own. The frolicking of Charlie Sheen and the drunken antics of Lance Armstrong add to the picture of privileged left-wing elites out of control.\n\nUltimately, it's a sad story, but Glenn Beaton's humorous writing in High Attitude makes the ugly truth of this beautiful town's decline into wokeism bearable to read.\n\nListen to this author's recent interview with \"The Federalist Radio Hour\" here .\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

Regardless of where you stand on the abortion issue, if you're a diaper company, you want more babies, not fewer babies.'\n\nAs far-left ideologies further embed themselves into American society , growing evidence shows that companies embracing woke capitalism tend to alienate customers, drive away potential employees, and lose profits for investors.\n\nAs with all cultural revolutions, it will take decades to measure the total outcome that woke capitalism has had on the economy, but businesses and investors that depend upon quarterly growth and earnings cannot wait that long. Unfortunately, the financial data for companies that go woke is spotty and largely anecdotal.\n\nSome evidence indicates, however, that corporations should awaken from their woke malaise.\n\nWoke capitalism's fatal flaw is that its principles come from an ideological system, not from rigorous scientific business management principles on which critical decisions should be made.\n\nTake a Trafalgar poll conducted in February 2023 among 1,000-plus likely voters. Nearly 80 percent, whether left, right, or center, said they were more likely to do business with a company that stayed politically neutral or tolerated the many viewpoints of employees and customers.\n\nPeople across the political divide overwhelmingly want all voices to be heard, including 77 percent of Democrats, 83 percent of Republicans, and 77 percent of independents. While support for corporate political neutrality rises with age, still some 70 percent of young voters aged 25 to 34 and 73 percent aged 35 to 44 favor companies that stay out of politics and support differing views.\n\nDespite the public's disdain for woke capitalism, many American corporations are entering the divisive political and social fray by going woke.\n\nJournalist and Wall Street Journal opinion contributor Dave Seminara keeps the most comprehensive, up-to-date list of woke corporations . He began compiling it in April 2021 when a whole cadre of companies spoke out against Georgia's election-integrity law.\n\nSince then, the list has grown exponentially as corporations have taken leftist positions on a whole range of contentious issues, such as abortion, sexuality, parental rights in education, and others.\n\nIt is odd that so many corporations oppose these grassroots, family-values issues since family households spend far more money than single households. And families raise the next generation of potential customers.\n\n\"Corporations are taking their eye off the ball and ignoring what's best for business,\" said serial entrepreneur Andrew Crapuchettes, founder of RedBalloon, a job board that connects employers and job seekers looking for a place where they fit in.\n\n\"Most diaper companies support Planned Parenthood. Regardless of where you stand on the abortion issue, if you're a diaper company, you want more babies, not fewer babies. Supporting Planned Parenthood is bad for business,\" he said.\n\nFurther evidence that going woke erodes business success comes from an analysis done by 2nd Vote Value Investments on large-cap and mid-cap companies measuring their level of engagement on social and political issues against their return on investment.\n\nThe group rated companies on a scale from most liberal to most conservative across six issues, including the environment, education, abortion, Second Amendment rights, other constitutional freedoms, and support for a safe civil society.\n\nThe analysis showed that neutral companies, which took no political or social stances, outperformed the S&P 500 and the Russell 1000 index, which both went down during the last half of 2021 through early 2023, falling 1.8 percent and 3.2 percent respectively. Neutral companies, however, gained 2.9 percent in the same period.\n\nThe group did a 10-year analysis of more than 200 companies that remained neutral over the period and found that neutral company portfolios delivered a far greater return of 334 percent, compared with the overall market's 230 percent gain.\n\n\"Proponents of so-called woke capitalism claim that companies can do 'well' financially by doing 'good' politically,\" wrote Mike Edleson and Andy Puzder, but the analysis proves otherwise. \"The data indicate that, as common sense would suggest, companies that focus on profits outperform companies that don't.\"\n\nRecognizing the need for more academically rigorous research into woke capitalism, Nicolai Foss of the Copenhagen Business School and Peter Klein of Baylor University set out to answer the question, \" Why Do Companies Go Woke? \"\n\nThey defined woke companies as those committed to socially leftist causes with a focus on so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives that began with French postmodernist thinking and the Frankfurt School philosophical movement. These philosophies prioritize personal experience over objective data.\n\n\"There is little evidence of systematic support for woke ideas among executives and the population at large, and going woke does not appear to improve company performance,\" they wrote. \"If corporate wokeness is simply a reflection of a rapid change in social and cultural mores, then why are firms embracing it so quickly, while they often adapt slowly to other exogenous shocks?\"\n\nCorporations normally adapt to change slowly and methodically with detailed analyses of potential costs and benefits to guide executive decisions, but in the case of woke capitalism, they have jumped on the bandwagon without a second thought.\n\n\"Traditionally, you have corporate policy set by the executive team then middle-managers are tasked to execute the policies that are handed down,\" Klein said in an interview. \"But we found woke policies are originating from a cadre of middle-management ideologues. They are a minority within the organization but have outsized power and influence.\"\n\nHe said senior executives, who have not been schooled in woke ideologies, have turned over the reins to the true believers, acting out of fear of backlash. The hoped-for, short-term gain from going woke can come with a high, long-term cost to the company.\n\nThey risk alienating customers as well as potential employees who want to work without worrying about their skin color, religious beliefs, or political views. This woke alienation has attracted millions of job seekers to RedBalloon, which offers freedom from stultifying woke corporate cultures.\n\n\"Non-woke employees are living and operating in a hostile work environment. They're not free to speak up. They're not free to express opinions. That can't be good for productivity or employee well-being. Companies need to build cultures where everybody feels welcome, but they're doing exactly the opposite when they go woke,\" Klein shared.\n\nAnd he believes the greatest long-term price corporations will pay for going woke is the loss of creativity and innovation.\n\n\"The loss of viewpoint diversity is an impediment to creativity. There is a lifecycle argument here. Once companies have a dominant market share - after they've created and innovated - where will the next new idea come from in corporate cultures where everyone is forced to think the same way? Is Disney more creative and innovative now than in Walt's day? No. Disney keeps following the same old stale formula,\" Klein said.\n\nKlein quickly pointed out that going woke is distinct from environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies consistent with good corporate citizenship, governance, and ethical behavior. But leftists don't have a monopoly on that.\n\n\"When in a position of running a company and employing people, you have a great responsibility. Companies have to be good citizens and stewards of the planet. They must operate ethically. These ideas, along with diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), are actually conservative Christian principles,\" RedBallon's Crapuchettes observed.\n\nThe good news is that woke capitalism recently arrived on the corporate scene. The concept of \"woke capitalism\" was introduced in the lexicon by New York Times columnist Ross Douthat in 2015 and it has become a driving force in business since then.\n\nBut corporations can still reverse course and prioritize the beliefs and needs of their customers, employees, and stakeholders. Employees want to be rewarded for the work they do, not their skin color, ethnicity, or background. Shareholders want a return on their investments, and consumers want better products and services at good prices.\n\nEarly signs show going woke leads companies to go broke. They should turn around now before the company you work for, patronize, or invest in becomes another statistic proving the go-woke-go-broke hypothesis.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "'Woke' Effectively Describes The Left's Insanity, And That's Why They Hate When You Say It\n\nWoke-ism is intentionally ambiguous. So when you describe it, that offends those who wish for its intentions to remain murky.\n\nWhen was the last time you were called racist? When was the last time you actually cared about being called racist? Odds are you get called it quite often and care (or should care) about being called it very little.\n\nThat's because lobbing accusations of racial bigotry at anyone who gets in their way is second nature for the left. So when people stopped taking these accusations seriously - realizing it is simply impossible for everything to be racist - the left began decrying \"white supremacy,\" semantically invoking Nazism.\n\nWhen accusations of racism failed to coerce enough action, the left moved on to a pejorative with far worse aesthetics while maintaining the same message. Accusing people and institutions of \"racism\" had lost its utility due to rhetorical inflation, and the era of \"systemic white supremacy\" had begun.\n\nAccording to some, the conservative movement and the American right writ large are experiencing a similar ongoing dilemma with the word \"woke.\" Many suggest the word has come to mean nothing due to right-wing over-saturation, while others insist it has taken on a far more nefarious tone.\n\nWhite liberals are the most woke group in America, but for the Reddit-tier race hustlers \"woke\" now means \"the n-word.\" pic.twitter.com/fNCgTUYxl3\n\nNevertheless, the question remains: Why has the word \"woke\" become so problematic ?\n\nOn Tuesday, Bethany Mandel, co-author of \"Stolen Youth: How Radicals Are Erasing Innocence and Indoctrinating a Generation,\" appeared on The Hill's \"Rising\" to discuss leftism's role in damaging American families.\n\nDuring the discussion, Briahna Joy Gray, co-host of the \"Bad Faith\" podcast, inquired if Mandel would \"mind defining 'woke,' 'cause it's come up a couple [of] times, and I just want to make sure we're all on the same page.\" What followed was a brief moment of self-consciousness in which the author stumbled over her words before offering a generally accepted definition of the term.\n\nDespite this, the moment was clipped, and the author was lambasted as both a bigot and buffoon across the web.\n\nThe whole point of this exercise was to humiliate someone offering a coherent definition of woke-ism that was insufficiently deferential to the whims of leftist ideologues. However, this attempt was unsuccessful.\n\nSo, everybody's seen my viral brain fart from \"Rising\" this morning. I can see why it went viral, of course. For those who haven't, here it is: https://t.co/4rgFBy9SGB\n\nDragging Mandel through the digital public square did not result in the typical groveling struggle session that has come to be expected whenever people explain their opinions in public, but it did inspire many to inquire about the nature of the term \"woke.\"\n\nThe term started to increase in prevalence in the early-to-mid-2010s back when \"Black Lives Matter\" referred to a hashtag, not an organization, and when the hot-button social issue du jour was the legalization of homosexual marriage. Despite its original meaning, used in common parlance simply to refer to personal vigilance, \"woke\" quickly took on social and political meanings. Like how every other community uses specific language to signify in-group allegiance, \"woke\" was used to inculcate oneself among the broader cause of the burgeoning leftist cultural hegemony and, by extension, the Democrat Party.\n\nBut as the term became more and more associated with the party, it became less specifically connected with racial protest movements and more so a shibboleth for supporting the party platform - \"stay woke,\" the slogan went.\n\nIf we don't vote, we tell the world that the future of our communities and our country doesn't concern us. Exercise your right to vote TODAY to make sure your voice is heard. #OH11Votes #BeAVoter pic.twitter.com/BA0jracEa7\n\nIt is undeniable that woke-ism and the people who get protective of the identifying label \"woke\" have an influential presence on the political and cultural left. There was even a short-lived Hulu series titled \" Woke \" that chronicled a previously apolitical black cartoonist's journey through the intersectional landscape of identity politics. And in 2018, \"Saturday Night Live\" poked fun at the concept of corporate fashion brands using woke-ism to market schlock to well-intentioned hipsters.\n\nWoke-ism came to define a movement so insurgent among the institutionalized powers of the left that even its vanguards like former President Barack Obama and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries , who undeniably had a role ushering it in, bemoaned its rancorous presence and how it distracts from the Democrat Party's larger goals.\n\nThis was something the Democrats fully embraced until they could no longer fully control the semantics around it.\n\nWoke-ism is simultaneously a persistent ideological framework and a general inclination - it depends on the person or institution in question at the time. But both rely upon a consistent smorgasbord of Marxian dialectics and ideological accouterment - gender theory, critical race theory, et al. - that seeks to usurp the ideals of the American founding and impose contemporary whims.\n\nThe word has become as commonplace among the current-day conservative movement as MAGA hats and \"lock her up\" chants were at 2016 Trump rallies. And this is, to be fair, totally warranted; what other slogany-sounding word really works as a catch-all for what leftism has become?\n\nSure, it would help if the right had a more tactical approach to diagnosing and labeling each and every radical change introduced to our society at breakneck speed, but that's not how people work. The right can and should identify the unique threats of identitarian Marxism, managerialism, and contemporary Lysenkoism, but is labeling all of these things useful?\n\nUsing \"woke\" as a catch-all label for radical leftism is effective. That's one of the major reasons why the left hates it. They lost complete control of the English language, and the word they used to indicate their radicalism to one another is being used to expose that radicalism to the rest of the world.\n\nWoke-ism is an intentionally ambiguous framework that is meant to keep out interlopers and reward its advocates. Therefore, simply describing it as what it is, is anathema to those who wish for its intentions to remain ambiguous.\n\nSimply saying \"woke\" works.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Is Disney Finally Learning When It Goes Woke, It Goes Broke?\n\n'Inside Out 2' and 'Deadpool and Wolverine' mark a noted departure from the implicit 'wokeness' of many of Disney's box office bombs.\n\nWhen Disney goes woke, it goes broke. When it remembers its audience, however, it succeeds.\n\nIt has been a good few weeks for the Walt Disney Company. Its two most recent films are history-setting box office successes, and the company that has spent years hemorrhaging money may be seeing a light at the end of the tunnel if it takes the right lessons away from its success.\n\nLast week, Disney announced that its recently released animated film \"Inside Out 2\" had overtaken \"Frozen 2\" as the highest-grossing animated film in history, globally grossing $1.46 billion since its premiere on June 14.\n\nOn Sunday, July 28, the most recent Marvel Cinematic Universe entry, \"Deadpool and Wolverine,\" became the sixth highest-grossing opening weekend of all time, grossing $438 million worldwide in three days. It has also been well received, with a 96 percent positive audience score on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nThis is good news for a company that has suffered a challenging few years. The company ousted its CEO Bob Chapek in November 2022 and replaced him with Bob Iger, who quickly announced a slate of sequels, layoffs, and cost-cutting endeavors. The company was subsequently beset by a poor year of box office returns. Seven of Disney's major 2023 releases, including \"Wish,\" \"Elemental,\" \"The Little Mermaid,\" \"The Haunted Mansion,\" \"Indiana Jones 5,\" \"The Marvels,\" and \"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,\" underperformed at the box office.\n\nOverall, this year has shown good signs for the Disney corporation and indications that it may be willing to make changes. FX's \" Shōgun \" became a critically acclaimed hit and \"FX's most-watched show ever on our streaming platforms.\" Sunday also came with the news that Robert Downey Jr. and the \"Avengers: Infinity War\" directors Joe and Anthony Russo would be returning to the MCU for \"Avengers: Doomsday,\" the newest major event film in the franchise set for release in May 2026.\n\nCommenters have noted that \"Inside Out 2\" and \"Deadpool and Wolverine\" mark a noted departure from the implicit \"wokeness\" of many of Disney's box office bombs. \"Deadpool and Wolverine,\" which grossed more in its opening weekend than \"The Marvels\" did in its entire theatrical run , makes fun of cancel culture, feminism, and wokeness.\n\n\"Inside Out 2\" similarly avoided \"woke\" tropes, with film critic Christian Toto arguing that the film presents a conservative path forward \"from a bean counter perspective.\" Worth It Or Woke similarly reported, \"Even though you can feel how badly it wants to be, it's not a woke mess.\"\n\nThis evolution would track with Iger's November 2022 CNBC interview , in which he announced that Disney would shy away from partisan discourse after the company's failed political battle with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. \"We have to entertain first. It's not about messages.\"\n\nIt will be curious to see if Disney's upcoming releases of \"Moana 2,\" \"Mufasa: The Lion King,\" \"Agatha All Along,\" and \"Captain America: Brave New World\" reflect this overall direction of the company in light of the success of their nonwoke blockbusters.\n\nThis doesn't mean Disney still isn't in hot water. On May 7, the company released its Q2 financial earnings report . Iger reported strong improvements from his profitability measures while acknowledging that the \"path to profitability will not be linear,\" suggesting that Q3 will see softer returns. Disney Plus even posted its first profit in nearly five years . However, the company's stock still took an almost 10 percent dip that day, due to Q3 fears. The stock is currently down more than 24 percent from its peak on April 2.\n\nOn July 23, The Wall Street Journal reported that ousted Marvel Entertainment Chairman Ike Perlmutter - noted for internally pushing against female or nonwhite superhero films - had sold all of his 25.6 million Disney shares from April to mid-July. He reportedly expects Disney's stock price to continuously drop from its current value of about $93 to $65-75 per share.\n\nThe company is also still caught in significant culture war issues. On July 24 , U.S. District Judge Sherilyn Peace Garnett denied a motion from the Disney corporation that would've dismissed a defamation lawsuit from \"Mandalorian\" star Gina Carano, meaning that the Elon Musk-backed free-speech lawsuit could make it to trial. She was fired after the show's second season for an Instagram post comparing the dehumanization of Holocaust victims to political retribution against Republicans. Disney accused her of \"denigrating people based on their cultural and religious identities.\"\n\nThe recent Disney Plus series \"Star Wars: The Acolyte\" was also \"review bombed\" by fans, who pushed the Rotten Tomatoes audience score to 17 percent , ranking it as one of the worst-received Star Wars projects along with the infamous \"Star Wars: Holiday Special.\" Online critics have lambasted the show's diversity pushes, moral relativism, continuity issues, and queer coding . Regardless, the show has retained viewership enough to make the streaming charts and led Disney to announce two spin-off novels .\n\nDisney's newest upcoming series \"Star Wars: Skeleton Crew\" continues to show signs of troubled development , with the show reportedly due in late 2024 despite no marketing or publicly available promotional materials.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

I'm not sure what woke means,\" said Army Secretary Christine Wormuth.\n\nIn a news conference with United States Army officials on Monday, Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said that she is \"not sure what woke means.\"\n\nThe Thursday afternoon news conference featured Wormuth, Army Chief of Staff Gen. James McConville, and Sergeant Major of the Army Michael Grindstone talking about national security and modernization efforts within the military branch. Addressing the press, Wormuth said, \"what I would emphasize is I think, more broadly in terms of, you know, soldiers coming from marginalized communities or, you know, demographics that are not widely represented in the army, that's part of why we've got to emphasize positive command climates and inclusion.\"\n\n\"You know, we get criticized, frankly, sometimes, for being woke.

      "text": "Two woke Star Trek series canceled in 2024; Star Trek: Discovery officially removed from canon\n\nBoth Lower Decks and Discovery were canceled in 2024.\n\nBoth Lower Decks and Discovery were canceled in 2024.\n\nThe season finale of Star Trek: Lower Decks delivered its series finale this week, and in doing so, addressed one of the most controversial issues in the Star Trek franchise. The issue in question revolves around Star Trek: Discovery, which has now been officially removed from the prime timeline canon, much to the relief of many fans, who are sick of wokeness in the storied franchise.\n\nDiscovery was infamous among Star Trek fandom for altering the appearance of Klingons and injecting identity politics into the universe.\n\nGiant Freakin Robot reports that: \"In the show's finale, a group of Klingon ships encounters a phenomenon that transforms things into alternate-reality versions of themselves. When a Klingon ship hits one of those transformation rays, it transforms into a big, ugly Discovery- style Klingon ship. Then one of the crewmembers transforms into a Discovery -style Klingon.\n\n\"This couldn't have happened if those weird Discovery Klingons had ever existed in the prime Star Trek timeline. It means that Discovery and its Klingons, just like the J.J. Abrams Star Trek movies, happened in an alternate universe. One that has nothing to do with the rest of Star Trek.\" Fans across the internet rejoiced at the revelation.\n\nSome referred to Discovery as \"garbage.\" One Star Trek enthusiast put it this way: \"Thanks to the finale of Lower Decks, we can now also safely conclude that because of Kurtzman's obsession with having all his Nu-Trek projects being integrated into eachother via references & distinctive visual styles, that not only is STD no longer prime/legacy timeline/canon but also neither is Picard or SNW. Nu-Trekers can squeal as much as they like about \"it's not different universes! It's just different points in time!\". Afraid not chums. When you dive into the realm of alternate universes, strict rules on timelines no longer apply. It's all down to variables and anything different from the established norm is NOT canon. It is it's own thing & wholly separate which frankly, is all any of us Trekkies ever wanted in the first place. People can say whatever shit they like about Enterprise but at least that show intelligently rectified inconsistencies in the lore and fixed them. Nu-Trek made no such attempts.\" Fan site That Park Place put it thusly: \" Star Trek: Discovery debuted with high expectations, but over its run, it faced significant backlash from segments of the fanbase. Criticisms ranged from drastic changes in the portrayal of iconic species, such as the Klingons, to deviations from established timelines and character arcs. The early seasons set the series in the past, but inconsistencies soon emerged, leading to widespread dissatisfaction,\" explaining further, \"There's a rift surrounded by a Schrödinger possibility field that remaps matter into alternate-reality versions from the multiverse. This event transforms the main timeline Klingons into those seen in Discovery , clearly delineating between the two universes. Consequently, while Lower Decks remains canon and part of the prime timeline, Discovery is relegated to an alternate reality, mitigating its previous inconsistencies.\" In 2022, Stacey Abrams used a cameo in Discovery to solicit donations for her gubernatorial campaign. Both Lower Decks and Discovery were canceled in 2024, with the LD finale airing on December 19, providing a final Christmas present for disaffected fans.\n\nSome referred to Discovery as \"garbage.\"\n\nOne Star Trek enthusiast put it this way: \"Thanks to the finale of Lower Decks, we can now also safely conclude that because of Kurtzman's obsession with having all his Nu-Trek projects being integrated into eachother via references & distinctive visual styles, that not only is STD no longer prime/legacy timeline/canon but also neither is Picard or SNW.

      "text": "Non-binary black star of 'gayest Star Wars ever' complains in Juneteenth music video that conservatives co-opted 'woke'\n\n\"Last I recall, woke was something we created.\"\n\n\"Last I recall, woke was something we created.\"\n\n\"Happy Juneteenth,\" non-binary The Acolyte star Amandla Stenberg posted on Instagram, \"and to those who are flooding me with intolerable racism-since it took me 72 hours on my laptop to make this song and video, u got 72 hours to respond. and I expect choreo!!\" And with that, she/they released a black and white music video shot on the streets of New York proclaiming how angry she/they is about slavery, how she/they're tired of being oppressed, and \"so bored don't f*ck wit yo discourse.\" Then she/they goes about f*cking with the discourse. In her/their video, where she/they complained about being criticized for a 2018 interview with \"king\" Trevor Noah, she/they taunted journalists for calling out her/their rhetoric as \"propaganda\" while \"forgetting\" what their job is by not \"telling the truth.\" The interview was for a movie called \"The Hate U Give,\" which she/they said was intended to \"make white people cry.\" The complaints about her/them, she/they said, are meant to \"conflate our pain with violence and try to weaponize everything that we do. The desperation of oppressors is rising and now they holding onto any ol thing they can use. If you rely on misinformation, then that tells me you afraid of the truth.\" But Stenberg, who also backed the Gaza protesters at Columbia, had a complaint of her own, which was the right-wing co-option of the concept of wokeness, which came out of the black community as a way to recognize racism, oppression, and to see through mainstream society to the racist undergirdings of it. \"They spinning woke, bastardize it and appropriate it,\" she/they sang in the video she/they edited all by herself/themselves. \"Last I recall, woke was something we created. Speak truth to power. Keep an eye out for you silly racists and now they use it to describe anything they threatened by,\" Stenberg sang. The use of the term \"woke\" by conservatives in America came from those conservatives needing a way to identify critical race theory and the far-left progressive politics that have taken over the left wing. Since the left already had a word-woke-it made sense to use it. Stenberg likes \"woke,\" conservatives don't, but both are using the word with the same definition. \"It was all about the people recognizing bigotry,\" she/they sang, \"the power of community, not fodder for your clickbait.\" Stenberg doesn't realize that once a cultural concept or story or character is put out into the mainstream, it is open to be co-opted or remade, just as she/they and her/their friends have done with Star Wars, which was something George Lucas created. She/they is also the one who got mad at Kylie Jenner for sporting cornrows. In Stenberg's mind, she/they is the only one allowed to co-opt anything. Stenberg is so oppressed that she/they've appeeared in several major Hollywood undertakings and has spoken at numerous charities on activism, race, and youth empowerment. Much of the backlash against the actress, who also starred in The Hunger Games, has been about the new Star Wars series, but for Stenberg, it's all about racism. In the diss track, she/they said that she/they is \"sick and f*cking tired of repressing my rage,\" which she/they said sends black people \"to an early grave.\" About half way through her anthem, she/they takes aim at journalists, many of which, including at this outlet, have been taking aim at her new Star Wars spin-off The Acolyte, which she/they and showrunning Leslye Headland said is the \"gayest Star Wars ever.\" In fact, the show recently brought preferred pronouns to space in the form of \"he/they.\" \"Journalists I'm looking at you,\" Stenberg said, \"did you forget it's your job to provide the truth? Spreading divisiveness, mining the metrics and data, seem you gave up all your ethics for money and views.\" Which is clearly the reason she/they released this song and video, for money and views in an attempt to become clickbait.\n\nPowered by The Post Millennial CMSTM Comments\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.

The ruling was another strike against woke diversity, equity and inclusion ( DEI ) policies in the corporate boardrooms of America, The Wall Street Journal reported .\n\nThe Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans decided Wednesday that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was in error when it okayed two NASDAQ listing rules that allowed DEI policies to apply to the boardroom. The ruling is in harmony with decisions across America to reverse DEI mandates and environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in corporations that have angered and alienated their clientele.\n\nNASDAQ was a glaring exception to that trend and had actually mandated its listed companies to reveal the racial and gender composition of their board members. Another mandate would have forced companies to meet ad hoc race and gender quotas or justify in written correspondence why such action had not occurred. The regulations would have forced boards to have at least one female director and another who was non-white or identifying as LGBTQ.\n\nIn striking down the NASDAQ mandates, the Fifth Circuit agreed with two groups that filed a lawsuit against the SEC for agreeing to NASDAQ's DEI \"targets\" when they were in fact quotas. The SEC \"has intruded into territory far outside its ordinary domain,\" Judge Andrew Oldham ruled in his written statement representing the majority of the Fifth Circuit.\n\nThe SEC announced that it would be assessing the ruling and would have to decide whether to take the case to the Supreme Court, where it would likely be shot down again, the WSJ maintained. In a statement, NASDAQ indicated it would be dropping the issue, saying, \"We maintain that the rule simplified and standardized disclosure requirements to the benefit of both corporates and investors. That said, we respect the Court's decision and do not intend to seek further review.\"\n\nSheng Li, counsel for the New Civil Liberties Alliance that had sued the SEC, expressed relief over the ruling, saying the DEI policies \"strip people of their individuality and force companies to classify them based on gender, race, ethnicity, and sexuality.\" She said the court \"correctly recognized that neither SEC nor NASDAQ has any business regulating the composition of corporate boards along these controversial demographic dimensions.\"\n\nNASDAQ has argued that targets aren't necessarily quotas because companies had the option of ignoring the instructions and then justifying that non-compliance in a letter of explanation. The SEC had suggested that imposed diversity was good for business because some studies had linked DEI rules to a stronger corporate profile.\n\nPowered by The Post Millennial CMSTM Comments\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.

Citing the surge of illegal immigration under outgoing President Joe Biden, the fentanyl crisis, and issuing a call to stop wokeness, which Trump called \"bullsh*t.\" Trump vowed fast action on his first day back in office.\n\nTrump detailed his priorities: increasing border security drastically, combating drugs, and reclaiming U.S. interests in the Panama Canal.\n\nTrump criticized the state of U.S. borders, claiming, \"We had 21 million people come in the past four years... Hundreds of thousands are racing to come across before January 20.\" He pledged to close the border to illegal aliens and launch \"the largest deportation operation in American history,\" referred to as \"Operation Aurora.\"\n\nAddressing the fentanyl epidemic, Trump said, \"The United States has lost 300,000 people a year [to drugs].\" He criticized Mexico and announced plans to classify cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. \"We're going to do [ads about] how bad drugs are for you. They ruin your look, your face, your skin, your teeth. If you want to have horrible teeth, take fentanyl,\" he warned. \"We're going to do advertise how bad drugs are for you. The ruin your look, your face, your skin, your teeth. If you want to have horrible teeth, take fentanyl,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump called the Panama Canal a \"vital national asset\" and lamented its management since the 1977 treaty transferring control to Panama. \"We're being ripped off at the Panama Canal... A secure Panama Canal is crucial for U.S. commerce and rapid deployment of the Navy,\" he stated, adding that the U.S. might demand its return if fair treatment is not upheld: \"The Panama Canal is considered a vital national asset for the United States due to its critical role on the American economy, the whole world economy, and also national security... We're being ripped off at the Panama Canal... A secure Panama Canal is crucial for US commerce and rapid deployment of the Navy from the Atlantic all the way to the pacific, it's an incredible thing, and drastically cuts shipping times down by days and even weeks. The US is the number one user of the Panama Canal with over 72 percent of all transits heading to or from US ports. \"So we built it, we're the ones that use it, they gave it away. Considered one of the great wonders of the world, the Panama Canal opened for business 110 years ago and was built at huge cost to the United States and it really is big when you consider the lives and the treasure, the equivalent of 1.2 trillion dollars today... When Jimmy Carter gave it away for one dollar... During his term in office, it was solely for Panama to manage and not for China or any other country to manage. You see what's going on there.\"\n\nTrump highlighted several key nominations, including Pete Hegseth for Secretary of Defense and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for Secretary of Health and Human Services. He linked the latter to concerns over rising autism rates: \"Think of this: 25 years ago, autism [affected] 1 in 10,000 children. Today, it's 1 in 36 children. Is something wrong? I think so. Robert and I, we're going to figure it out.\"\n\nTrump also promised to \"stop the transgender lunacy,\" announcing executive orders to end \"child sexual mutilation\": \"Under the Trump administration, it will be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female,\" he declared.\n\nTrump criticized the Biden administration's energy policies, pledging to end restrictions on energy production and declaring a national energy emergency. He also touted the Department of Government Efficiency, to be led by Elon Musk. He also pledged \"to stop woke,\" calling it \"bullsh*t\", saying that the US would bring in a new era of \"peace, prosperity and national greatness\" under his administration. Trump pledged to cut taxes, cut inflation and slash prices, and bring manufacturing back to the United States. \"We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God... We will never back down and we will never ever ever surrender. Together we will fight, fight, fight, and win, win, win. Together we will Make America Powerful Again, Make America Wealthy Again, we will Make America Healthy Again, we will Make America Strong Again, we will Make America Proud Again, we will Make America Safe Again, and we will Make America Great Again,\" the president-elect concluded before walking off to YMCA by the Village People.\n\nPowered by The Post Millennial CMSTM Comments\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.
