      "text": "Why the Supreme Court gutting affirmative action would be 'perverse': education expert\n\nSince the 1970s, conservatives have been using the courts to express their opposition to affirmative action. Now, the legal word is awaiting the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in two cases that challenge affirmative action programs at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nIn both cases, the plaintiff Students for Fair Admissions argues that admissions practices at those two universities discriminate against whites and Asians in favor of African-Americans and Latinos. The High Court has listened to arguments in both cases, and it remains to be seen how the justices will have to say about the plaintiff's arguments.\n\nDiscussing the cases in an article published the Washington Post on January 16, journalist Valerie Strauss explains, \"With Court watchers predicting a ruling against the universities this year, the question remains how broad that ruling will be. How will it affect other colleges and flagship state universities? Will the Court allow racial proxies that favor white students to stand while eliminating affirmative action programs aimed at bringing more minorities onto campuses?\"\n\nStrauss goes on to note what Kevin Welner of the University of Colorado, Boulder's National Education Policy Center has had to say about the cases.\n\n\"Nobody has yet leaked the Supreme Court's upcoming decisions concerning challenges to the affirmative action policies of Harvard and the University of North Carolina, as happened last year with a case that ended with the overturning of Roe v. Wade , which guaranteed women the constitutional right to abortion,\" Welner writes. \"But there's no need for such a leak. We already know the decision, and as a practical matter, we've known it for years. Like a quarterback about to throw an interception, the Court has long been brazenly telegraphing its determination to declare affirmative action unconstitutional. Accordingly, on the late-spring day when the Harvard and UNC decisions are released, the sun will rise, and almost as predictably, six justices will be in the majority, voting to ban any consideration of applicants' race or ethnicity.\"\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court tackled affirmative action back in 1978 in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke . The plaintiff in that case was Allan P. Bakke, who filed a lawsuit against the University of California, Davis School of Medicine after being rejected and argued that UC Davis' admissions quotas were racially discriminatory. The California Supreme Court agreed with Bakke that he had experienced racial discrimination and ordered that the UC Davis School of Medicine admit him. In 1978, California was still a red state, and it was more conservative than it is now.\n\nThen, when the Bakke case went to the U.S. Supreme Court, it upheld affirmative action as constitutional but ruled that the specific racial quotas were not. That was the Burger Court of 45 year ago, and since then, many conservatives have believed that the Burger Court was wrong to accept affirmative action at all.\n\nThe Roberts Court is way to the right of the Burger Court, and as the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization ruling demonstrates, this is not a Court that prioritizes stare decisis (respect for precedent).\n\nWelner doesn't expect The Roberts Court to deliver affirmative action-friendly rulings, but he writes that there is still \"an important element of suspense\" as the decisions are awaited. And he is anxious to see what the Court will have to say about \"factors strongly correlated with race, such as where students live and whether they grew up in poverty.\"\n\n\"Proxies can be powerful tools,\" Welner explains. \"Knowing your zip code allows researchers to make an educated guess about, among many other things, your approximate wealth and income, as well as your likely race or ethnicity - and your school's average test scores. It's not just zip codes. Proxies are all around us. Republicans target their digital advertising at people who eat at Chick-fil-A and Cracker Barrel, and Democrats aim theirs at people who shop at Trader Joe's and Whole Foods Market. For most of us, that's not particularly troubling. But what if an insurance actuarial uses a zip code as a proxy for race - with higher car insurance costs in minoritized neighborhoods?\"\n\nWelner continues, \"In fact, any time a policy or practice depends on where you live, the race-proxy emerges. More broadly, wealth and income are also race-proxies in the U.S., as is the school a child attends.\"\n\nWelner argues that it would be \"perverse\" to make the \"use of race\" in college admissions \"totally impermissible.\"\n\n\"There's something extraordinarily perverse about this proxy discussion: In a society with a long and harmful history of racial discrimination that has massively impacted the distribution of resources and political power, laws and policies that are facially race-neutral will disproportionately and inequitably bestow benefits on white people,\" Welner writes. \"If a benefit is distributed based on neighborhood residence, on formal education, or on income or wealth, then white people will be relatively advantaged. And that advantage is an entirely predictable outcome of the nation's long history of discrimination.\""

      "text": "Why the Supreme Court affirmative action rulings make a case for abolishing the Electoral College\n\nOn Thursday, June 29, 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court disavowed decades of precedent when it struck down the use of affirmative action in college admissions in two companion cases: Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard College and Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina .\n\nThe UNC case was a 6-3 ruling, with all six of the High Court's GOP-appointed justices declaring that race could no longer be a factor in college admissions decisions. The Harvard case, however, was 6-2 because Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson - a graduate of Harvard Law School - recused herself.\n\nCountless liberals and progressives have been vehemently attacking the Court's Students for Fair Admissions rulings, while conservatives and liberals have been arguing that the justices struck down a form of racial discrimination. And one argument on the left is that if the justices oppose affirmative action in college admissions, it's time to abolish the ultimate form of affirmative action: the Electoral College.\n\nProgressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York), a self-described \"democratic socialist\" and close ally of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont), has long been highly critical of the GOP's stand against affirmative action - which she views as hypocritical in light of two things: (1) many on the right have no problem with legacy admissions on college campuses, and (2) the same conservatives who oppose affirmative action in college admissions defend \"electoral affirmative action\" in the form of the Electoral College.\n\nIn a scathing tweet posted after the Students for Fair Admissions rulings were handed down, AOC posted , \"If SCOTUS was serious about their ludicrous 'colorblindness' claims, they would have abolished legacy admissions, aka affirmative action for the privileged. 70% of Harvard's legacy applicants are white. SCOTUS didn't touch that - which would have impacted them and their patrons.\"\n\nAuthor Samuel Perry , on June 29, tweeted, \"Since #SCOTUS is keen on getting rid of affirmative action, think they're open to getting rid of the electoral college? Since it's affirmative action for rural whites?\"\n\nAOC didn't mention the Electoral College in her June 29 tweet, but in the past, she has emphasized that the Electoral College is a form of affirmative action for rural whites.\n\nThe Students for Fair Admissions rulings overturn, in essence, High Court rulings going back to the 1970s. In 1978's Regents of the University of California v. Bakke decision, the High Court ruled that affirmative action was constitutional but that rigid racial quotas were not. Many liberals and progressives have since argued that affirmative action isn't about quotas - it is about leveling the playing field for women and people of color, and is meant to be a hand up but not a handout.\n\nConservatives have often used leveling-the-playing-field arguments to defend the Electoral College, arguing that without it, small rural states would be at a major disadvantage in presidential elections - and that abolishing the Electoral College would give densely populated urban areas an unfair advantage. Republicans have lost the popular vote in seven of the United States' last eight presidential elections, and two Republicans have won the electoral vote despite losing the popular vote: George W. Bush in 2000 and Donald Trump in 2016.\n\nConservative Electoral College defenders who oppose affirmative action have argued that the two are not comparable because while affirmative action takes into consideration race and gender, the Electoral College is strictly about location. But in an article published by Vox on December 17, 2016 , journalists Andrew Gelman and Pierre-Antoine Kremp emphasized that because of the Electoral College, white voters are overrepresented in presidential elections.\n\nGelman and Kremp noted, \"The Electoral College isn't just a goofy way of cumulating votes that sometimes grants the presidency to the person who gets fewer votes. It also motivates candidates to aim for the segments of voters who are overrepresented in swing states. In 2016, this implied a greater focus on whites, which affected the campaign and may have far-reaching implications on politics and policy.\"\n\nSimilar arguments were made by journalist William Spivey in an article published by Medium on November 14, 2020 and headlined \"The Electoral College: Affirmative Action For White People.\" Spivey noted that the Electoral College \"doesn't serve all white people\" but gave southern states \"a permanent overrepresentation.\"\n\nIn 2019, AOC and Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) debated the merits of the Electoral College on Twitter. AOC attacked the Electoral College as \"electoral affirmative action,\" while Crenshaw defended it and posted, \"We live in a republic, which means 51 percent of the population doesn't get to boss around the other 49 percent.\"\n\nJournalist Robert M. Alexander, in an op-ed published by CNN on August 29, 2019, argued that AOC had a valid point and wrote, \"The Electoral College process can lead to outcomes where the 46 percent may look to boss around the remaining 54 percent.\"\n\nOn June 29, 2023, Crenshaw applauded the High Court's Students For Fair Admissions rulings and tweeted, \"Affirmative action = unconstitutional. Justice Clarence Thomas got it right.\" Crenshaw rejects level-playing-field arguments when used in support of affirmative action but uses them in defense of the Electoral College.\n\nIn 2019, AOC told Crenshaw , \"We do not give electoral affirmative action to any other group in America. Do Black Americans have their votes count more bc they have been disenfranchised for 100s of years? Do Reservations get an electoral vote? Does Puerto Rico and US territories get them? No. They don't.... The Electoral College isn't about fairness at all; it's about empowering some voters over others.\""

      "text": "Affirmative action isn't discrimination. It's politics right-wing justices abhor and will strike down\n\nThe Supreme Court appears ready to end affirmative action, or the use of race in college admissions. If the hoopla among liberals is any indication, the pending decision is a BFD. But let's pause a minute.\n\nFirst, consider what the Editorial Board 's Rod Graham said recently . Our neighborhood sociologist said the actual number of college students who'd be affected by a negative ruling is small, because the number admitted as a consequence of affirmative action is small.\n\nWhatever the court decides, Rod said, colleges and universities will continue diversifying the racial constitution of their student bodies because it's in their interest to. If the court rules against affirmation active, as appears to be the case, admissions officers will carry on. They will, Rod suggested, find other ways of achieving the same goal.\n\nSecond, consider the question at the center of the case.\n\nThen dismiss it.\n\nThat question is this: Is it discriminatory to use race as a factor in college admissions? The plaintiffs think yes. The rightwing justices seem to think so, too. But that question presumes something.\n\nThat's what we should focus on. Not the question. But the question's presumption, which is this: the status quo is politically neutral.\n\nYeah, nah.\n\nThe status quo is not \"the way things are.\" Saying so is itself a political statement. Why? Because, however we choose to define it, the status quo is the sum of history, a product of all decisions made before us, all the choices that arose from the politics of their particular time and place. Politics begets politics begets politics.\n\nTo say the status quo is \"the way things are\" is to say that any attempt to change the status quo - any attempt at politics - is inherently suspect on account of it being abnormal when compared to the normal. Instead of politics versus politics, which is what challenges to the status quo are, it's the status quo (or \"custom and tradition\") versus dark forces threatening God, country and family.\n\nAmerica was founded as a republic for rich white men. Therefore, each generation, brandishing the flag of liberal democracy and wrapping itself in the Declaration of Independence, has had to fight against an entrenched status quo to secure their constitutional rights and privileges. In America, the status quo is white power.\n\nAt each juncture, the status quo (white power) tried to depoliticize the fight, first by accusing advocates of liberal democracy of being troublemakers bent on smashing \"custom and tradition,\" as if custom and tradition were not themselves products of history and politics.\n\nEventually, defenders of the status quo resort to slander, smears and even sporadic violence. In one case, defenders broke apart the republic. To the confederates, the stakes were just too high to compromise. Slavery was democracy . Free the slaves, as they alleged Abraham Lincoln would, and enslave free white men. This wasn't politics versus politics. This was the end of politics. This was war.\n\nNormally, though, a majority of people - especially, a majority of elite stakeholders - recognize that the status quo, rather than standing up for \"customs and traditions,\" was standing against liberal democracy - and all the business opportunities that liberal democracy makes possible. Defenders of \"customs and traditions\" end up reconciling with challengers' demands, thus establishing a new status quo.\n\nThe point here is that one kind of politics battles another kind before they come to terms. It's politics versus politics, not good versus evil. When it's politics versus politics, upright citizens can make political choices. When it's good versus evil, as was the case in the antebellum south, there is no political choice. It's the end of politics. It's war.\n\nSome allege that affirmative action is discrimination based in race. That seems right - if you forget about history and all the political choices made in the past that inform the present. In other words, the allegations ring true only if you take the humans out of history. Since that's impossible, we are then forced to recognize an obvious truth.\n\nAffirmative action is not discrimination.\n\nIt's the opposite.\n\nIndeed, it's a compromise of one kind of politics (the civil rights movement) fighting and defeating another kind (Jim Crow apartheid). Its purpose, in the beginning, when Lyndon Baines Johnson initiated the policy, \"was to overcome at least some of the accumulated human damage caused by 350 years of slavery and Jim Crow, and to ensure further progress toward equality,\" wrote historian Nick Kotz.\n\nConservatives who trust you'll forget history have made affirmative action seem like a social evil. Kotz wrote in 2005 that affirmative action programs have been \"vigorously attacked in Congress and the federal courts and criticized for 'discriminating' against the white majority.\" Kotz added : \"With conservatives dominating the federal government, civil rights groups and other liberal organizations have waged a mostly defensive battle to protect the gains of the 1960s.\"\n\nIn other words, the status quo (white power) never liked affirmative action on account of affirmative action challenging the status quo. And until this week, white power had no hope of defeating it.\n\nThat hope is now in sight, but only because white power managed to take affirmative action out of the political arena and put it in the courts, where justices who dislike affirmative action are going to say that it's a social evil, rather than what it is, a product of politics.\n\nPolitics begets politics begets politics. So the fight to \"ensure further progress toward equality,\" as Kotz said, will continue - short of war, it never ended. It will carry on in different shapes driven by different motives. As Rod Graham said, it's not like the Supreme Court's decision will stop colleges from doing what's in their interest to do. They have chosen to defend what is, to them, a new status quo."

The second thing to say is the story about this historic event should be about the president, his administration, foreign allies and relations, and the still-critical role of American diplomacy around the world.\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nLimited to that, there's plenty for enterprising reporters to work with - the personal and dramatic stories of each of the 16 prisoners, including a correspondent for the Wall Street Journal jailed for doing journalism and a former Marine and head of a global security company arrested in 2018; the diplomatic backstory of how Joe Biden worked with foreign leaders, sometimes against their own interests; the tale of international intrigue between Washington, Moscow and others; and perhaps the president's legacy, as he was conducting negotiations even as his own party was pressuring him to drop out of the running.\n\nThis and so much more - a cornucopia of copy! - but alas, the Washington press corps is so fixed on seeing everything about American politics through the lens of winning and losing that it couldn't help but inject the GOP presidential nominee into a story where he didn't belong. Here's the Post with a representative sample: \" Biden, Trump exchange jabs as Russia prisoner swap turns political .\"\n\nI'll get to that headline in a minute, but first I have to say something so obvious as to be invisible, and it's because it's invisible that the press corps can get away with business-as-usual without suffering any loss of credibility by the public, to wit: Biden is no longer Trump's opponent.\n\nThink about it. Biden is out. Trump no longer faces him. But if you're casually reading the Post headline above, you might have forgotten, and if you forgot, it stands to reason the editors who wrote it forget - and why would they seem to forget something as important as that? Because everything about American politics is seen through the lens of winning and losing, such that even an indisputable good news story about an American president's successful negotiation for the release of 16 innocents, jailed unjustly by America's enemy, can't be left alone.\n\nIt gets worse.\n\nBy injecting Trump into a story where he doesn't belong, the press corps minimizes Biden's achievement while maximizing Trump's, well, nothing. He did nothing. That's the point. Trump bragged about how, after beating Biden in November, he would secure the release of every prisoner in Russia, even before he officially took office. He said Russian leader Vladimir Putin would do that for him, the implication being that only a high T-level bro as strong and tough and mighty as Trump could pull that off. But as he was talking, Biden was doing. He did what Trump said only he could do. And in the process, he exposed Trump.\n\nEvery single person in Washington, including the Republican Party, knows Trump is weak. They knew when he said only he could force Putin to release prisoners he was interfering with negotiations for their release. They knew Trump was, in effect, telling Putin to hold them until after the election, putting his own interests above theirs and the country's. They know if Trump won the election, Russia would go on a kidnapping bender, safe in the knowledge of getting what it wants in exchange for Americans' freedom. And they know, by making a liar out of him, Putin implied something Trump does not want to be heard widely. He thinks Trump is too weak to beat the Democratic nominee. There's no longer an advantage to holding the prisoners.\n\nEvery single person in Washington knows Trump is weak, but he rarely comes off that way to the American public, and that's thanks to the press corps. In a sense, the press corps is Trump's \"affirmative action program\" (if we accept the illiberal definition of affirmative action). It doesn't matter how much he fails. It doesn't matter how weak he is. The press corps can be trusted to inject something - anything - he says into any story, even ones where he does not belong, and as a consequence, he will come off as stronger than he is. Case in point: \"Biden, Trump exchange jabs as Russia prisoner swap turns political.\"\n\n(Trump's \"affirmative action program\" was on display this week after he humiliated himself during a televised interview at the annual convention of the National Association of Black Journalists. The audience laughed at him when he doubted Kamala Harris' Blackness. That was funny! But the press corps bailed him out, again, by framing the story as if Harris were responsible for his buffoonery, not him.)\n\nAnd because Trump comes off as stronger than he is, Biden comes off as weaker than he is. Remember: Biden really did get those prisoners out. There's no question about his strength on account of him flexing it so demonstrably. But Trump's crybabying provided reporters with a pretext for questions, so when Biden responded with the obvious - if Trump is so tough, why didn't he do what I did when he was president? - it doesn't sound like a declaration of categorical and impervious fact.\n\nIt sounds like a \"jab.\"\n\nPerhaps the worst consequence of this is people can't see something else so obvious as to be invisible. Trump never stops trash-talking America. That's his message. It's the whole shebang. Everything about us sucks and the only way to unsuck us is voting for him. We know this is true, not only because sucky America is baked into the concept of maga, but also because he can't give Biden even a little credit for doing what he could not do. He can't spare enough generosity to celebrate 16 people tasting freedom for the first time in a long time. Everything about America sucks, he tells us, but he can't admit when it doesn't.\n\nTo me, the worst consequence of the Washington press corps acting like Donald Trump's affirmative action program is truly good news, like the prisoner swap, can't be heard by a democratic citizenry, and because it can't be heard, the people responsible, in this case the Biden White House, are not properly rewarded by a democratic citizenry. The press corps turns incentives upside down so lying is preferable while truth-telling is punishable, and talking about doing things is more powerfully received than actually, literally doing them."

But Trump's crybabying provided reporters with a pretext for questions, so when Biden responded with the obvious - if Trump is so tough, why didn't he do what I did when he was president? - it doesn't sound like a declaration of categorical and impervious fact.\n\nIt sounds like a \"jab.\"\n\nPerhaps the worst consequence of this is people can't see something else so obvious as to be invisible. Trump never stops trash-talking America. That's his message. It's the whole shebang. Everything about us sucks and the only way to unsuck us is voting for him. We know this is true, not only because sucky America is baked into the concept of maga, but also because he can't give Biden even a little credit for doing what he could not do. He can't spare enough generosity to celebrate 16 people tasting freedom for the first time in a long time. Everything about America sucks, he tells us, but he can't admit when it doesn't.\n\nTo me, the worst consequence of the Washington press corps acting like Donald Trump's affirmative action program is truly good news, like the prisoner swap, can't be heard by a democratic citizenry, and because it can't be heard, the people responsible, in this case the Biden White House, are not properly rewarded by a democratic citizenry. The press corps turns incentives upside down so lying is preferable while truth-telling is punishable, and talking about doing things is more powerfully received than actually, literally doing them."

      "text": "The Supreme Court's war on the future: Robert Bork's revenge\n\nThis is the first of a multi-part Dig series, The Supreme Court's War on the Future, investigating how the Supreme Court was remade in the image of Robert Bork.\n\nTo fully appreciate and understand the Supreme Court's hard cut to extremism, start with the failed nomination of Robert Bork in 1987. Bork never made it to the summit of the judiciary, but the legal theory of \" originalism \" he pioneered now thoroughly dominates the bench.\n\nThe Supreme Court's controlling majority of six Republican activists has embraced originalism as an article of faith and practice. Under the stewardship of Chief Justice John Roberts, the court has deployed its tools and techniques to reinterpret the Constitution and create a legacy of legal devastation with a series of landmark rulings on voting rights , gerrymandering , union organizing , the death penalty , environmental protection , gun control , abortion and campaign finance . The court's current session, which opened in early October, promises to deliver more of the same, with cases on \"religious liberty\" and LGBTQ discrimination , the \" independent state legislature \" doctrine, affirmative action and more .\n\nRoberts and company are Bork's ideological offspring and revenge. Their jurisprudence is the culmination of a project that began with Bork long before his rejection by the Senate.\n\nUntil his failed Supreme Court nomination, Bork had a storied career. In March 1973, while on hiatus from Yale, Bork joined the Nixon administration as solicitor general. In October of that year, he was named acting attorney general and subsequently followed Nixon's orders to fire Archibald Cox, the first Watergate special prosecutor, in what became known as the \" Saturday Night Massacre \". In 1982, Reagan appointed Bork to the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals, a position he held until 1988.\n\nAs a primary architect of originalism, Bork had become by the mid-1980s - along with Ed Meese , Reagan's attorney general - the face of a legal counterrevolution aimed at reversing the expansion of civil rights and liberties that had been achieved during Chief Justice Earl Warren's tenure on the court (1953-1969). His mission was to turn back the judicial clock to a pre-New Deal version of the United States.\n\nA prolific writer as both an academic and an appellate judge , Bork argued at various points in his career that the Constitution contained no implied right to privacy, that Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided , and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was unconstitutional. He also rejected the \"one person, one vote\" principle of legislative districting. Bork's outspokenness and abrasive demeanor set him apart from the growing corps of conservative lawyers and legal scholars that were coalescing in the 1980s, making him a vulnerable target for Democrats determined to keep him off the nation's highest judicial body.\n\n* * *\n\nThe campaign to torpedo Bork's nomination took shape quickly. On July 1, 1987, the day Reagan proudly announced Bork's nomination , Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass) took to the senate floor to denounce Bork's selection to replace retiring conservative jurist Justice Lewis Powell. (Powell is best remembered in progressive circles for a confidential memo he penned in 1971 urging business leaders to become more involved in high-stakes litigation and the selection of judges, advice that led to the formation of institutions such as the Business Roundtable , the Heritage Foundation, the Pacific Legal Foundation, the Cato Institute, the Federalist Society and the Chamber of Commerce National Litigation Center .)\n\nIn words that would come to doom Bork's nomination and spark a roiling debate about originalism that continues to this day, Kennedy decried what he called \"Robert Bork's America\" as \"a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists would be censored at the whim of government, and the doors of the federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of citizens for whom the judiciary is often the only protector of the individual rights that are the heart of our democracy.\"\n\nFor 12 days in September , the Senate Judiciary Committee debated Bork's qualifications, and heard five days of candid testimony from Bork himself. Much of the scrutiny focused on originalism as a method of constitutional interpretation and judicial decision-making. The prominent constitutional scholars that testified against Bork included Professor Laurence Tribe of Harvard and Professor Philip Kurland of the University of Chicago , who had worked as a consultant to the Senate Judiciary Committee during the Watergate investigation.\n\nOutside the D.C. Beltway, another fierce battle took place. By the time the Senate hearings commenced, anti-Bork forces had raised a war chest of $12 million. In a manner similar to today's political campaigns, the money was spent on focus groups, opinion polls, media consultants and especially on print, radio and TV advertising.\n\nA newspaper ad taken out by the National Abortion Rights Action League asserted a vote for Bork was the equivalent of voting for a politician who threatened to reverse \"every advance women have made in the 20th century.\" Similar ads were placed by the National Education Association and Planned Parenthood.\n\nMost devastating of all was a 60-second television spot paid for by People for the American Way and narrated by the famed actor Gregory Peck. In his best Atticus Finch voice, Peck sounded the tocsin:\n\n\"Robert Bork wants to be a Supreme Court justice, but the record shows he has a strange idea of what justice is. He defended poll taxes and literacy tests which kept many Americans from voting. He opposed a civil rights law that ended 'whites only' signs at lunch counters. He doesn't believe the Constitution protects your right to privacy. And he thinks that freedom of speech does not apply to literature and art and music. Robert Bork could have the last word on your rights as citizens. But the Senate has the last word on him.\"\n\nOn the other side of the divide, Reagan went to great lengths to salvage the nomination, describing Bork's appointment as his \"top domestic priority.\" But even the \"Great Communicator\" couldn't get his message to resonate. Public opinion, which trended slightly in favor of Bork in early September, turned decisively against him by the end of the month. A Tribune Media poll released on Sept. 28 showed the public opposed the nomination by nearly a 2-to-1 margin.\n\nBork's prospects officially came to an end on Oct. 23, 1987. With six Republicans crossing party lines, the full Senate turned thumbs down against him by a vote of 58-42, the most lopsided vote against a high court candidate in U.S. history. His fall from grace was colossal. Ever since, judicial nominees have come to be wary of being \"Borked,\" a term that has entered the lexicon as a synonym for rejection in the face of adverse publicity and harsh cross-examination. Bork resigned from the Court of Appeals in 1988 and returned to academia, becoming a dyspeptic critic of liberalism, bemoaning the decline of Western culture, which he addressed with special bile in his book, Slouching Toward Gomorrah: Modern Liberalism and American Decline (1996). He died in relative obscurity in 2012.\n\n* * *\n\nBork was defeated, but originalism lived on. Even before his nomination, the theory had established a beachhead on the court with the confirmation of Antonin Scalia in 1986. Although Scalia was in many ways as doctrinaire as Bork, the Senate unanimously confirmed him 98-0 on the same day it voted in favor of William Rehnquist's elevation to the position of chief justice by a margin of 65-33 . Having spent their capital in a losing bid to block Rehnquist, Senate Democrats were either too dispirited, disorganized or not yet fully aware of the dangers and potency of originalism to put up a fight against the first Italian-American justice. Compared to the treatment Rehnquist and Bork received, Scalia's confirmation hearing was a lovefest.\n\nScalia was nine years younger than Bork and had served with him on the D.C. Court of Appeals. Scalia also had a background in academia. In 1982, as a law professor at the University of Chicago, Scalia helped organize one of the first chapters of the Federalist Society , and became the chapter's faculty advisor. He remained active in the society as a coveted speaker and symposium guest until his passing in 2016.\n\nIn 1991, the Senate narrowly confirmed another self-declared originalist and Federalist Society member , Clarence Thomas , after a bitter confirmation hearing highlighted by Anita Hill's explosive allegations of sexual harassment. Nominated by President George W. Bush, Thomas also came to the high court by way of the D.C. circuit, but had produced only a modest paper trail, obscuring his future political machinations. Two years later, however, according to The New York Times, Thomas told two of his law clerks that he planned to serve on the court until 2034, and until then would make the lives of liberals \"miserable.\"\n\nScalia and Thomas brought a new brand of originalism to the court that arose in response to critics who charged that the actual intentions of the framers of the Constitution were too varied, conflicting and often ambiguous to serve as a basis for judicial decision-making. Instead of emphasizing original intent, they and other \" new originalists \" focused on the \"original public meaning\" of Constitutional provisions, which, they contended, could be ascertained from the recorded debates of the founding era and from such sources as late 18th-century dictionaries. The key, as law professors Michael Rappaport of the University of San Diego and John McGinnis of Northwestern University, explained in an influential 2007 law review article would be to determine \"how a reasonable person at the time of the Constitution's adoption would have understood its words and how they thought they should be interpreted.\"\n\nAll originalists - whether of the old or new stripe - contend that their approach limits the subjectivity of judges and acts as a restraint on judicial activism.\n\nIn fact, originalism does nothing of the sort. Fordham University history professor Saul Cornell summed up the fatal flaws of the theory in a scathing 2011 Dissent article, New Originalism: A Constitutional Scam . The first academic iteration of Originalism, Cornell wrote, rested on \"shaky historical foundations\" because the Founders \"did not speak with a single voice on most constitutional questions.\" New Originalism, embodied by the more activist Federalist Society, was in Cornell's estimation even more dubious, amounting to \"little more than an intellectual shell game in which contemporary political preferences are shuffled around and made to appear part of the Constitution's original meaning.\"\n\nResult-oriented judging, of course, has existed from the earliest days of the republic. Originalism in a nascent form existed long before the term was attached to a specific legal philosophy in the latter part of the 20th century. One of its earliest expressions came in the Dred Scott case of 1857, perhaps the most odious decision ever issued by the Supreme Court, which held that Black Americans of African descent could never be U.S. citizens. Plessy v. Ferguson , the 1896 decision that upheld the constitutionality of racial segregation even after the ratification of the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments, is another originalist landmark.\n\nOriginalism in a nascent form existed long before the term was attached to a specific legal philosophy in the latter part of the 20 th century. One of its earliest expressions came in the Dred Scott case of 1857, perhaps the most odious decision ever issued by the Supreme Court, which held that Black Americans of African descent could never be U.S. citizens.\n\nAs the court entered the second decade of the 21st century, however, it remained divided between conservatives, liberals and centrists, often dividing 5-4 in major rulings. The ascension of Donald Trump as the 45th president in 2016 and the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg in 2020 radically altered the balance.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump promised that, if elected, his judicial nominees would \"all [be] picked by the Federalist Society.\" Before the election, Trump released two lists of Supreme Court candidates, both compiled by the Federalist Society and the far-right Heritage Foundation.\n\nAfter the election, Trump proved for once true to his word, meeting with Leonard Leo, then the Federalist Society's executive vice president, to map out plans for selecting Scalia's successor. Soon thereafter, Leo took a leave of absence from the society to formally advise Trump on the confirmation process for both Neil Gorsuch, who succeeded Scalia, and Brett Kavanaugh, who replaced the retiring centrist Anthony Kennedy. Leo had done the same in 2005-06, counseling President George W. Bush on the nominations of Roberts and Samuel Alito.\n\nIt's easy to understand why Trump was attracted to the Federalist Society. From its fledgling beginnings as a debating club at a handful of elite law schools in the early 1980s, the society had mushroomed into a nationwide network of 70,000 economic, social and Christian conservatives, along with right-wing libertarians, organized in lawyers' chapters in 90 cities, and with student affiliates in nearly every major law school. No longer a shoestring operation, the society's 2016 budget exceeded $26 million, raised in large part from contributions by right-wing philanthropists like the Koch brothers and other deep-pockets like the Mercer, Scaife, and Lynde and Harry Bradley foundations.\n\nTrump also pledged during the 2016 campaign that his Supreme Court nominees would be \" originalists \" in the mold of Scalia. He fulfilled that pledge, too, with the selection of Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and, finally, Amy Coney Barrett . Barrett's confirmation in 2020 brought the number of former or current Federalist Society members on the tribunal to six. (Though Roberts says he doesn't recall belonging to the Federalist Society, the group listed him as a member in its 1997-98 directory.)\n\nFor the most part, Barrett followed the post-Bork strategy of other high-court nominees, refusing in her confirmation hearing to give direct answers to important questions such as whether the Constitution requires a peaceful transfer of power , or if a president can pardon himself for federal crimes.\n\nNew Originalism, embodied by the more activist Federalist Society, was in Cornell's estimation even more dubious, amounting to \"little more than an intellectual shell game in which contemporary political preferences are shuffled around and made to appear part of the Constitution's original meaning.\"\n\nBut when asked by Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-CA) what it means to be an originalist, Barrett readily replied : \"In English, that means that I interpret the Constitution as a law and that I interpret its text as text, and I understand it to have the meaning that it had at the time people ratified it. So that meaning doesn't change over time, and it's not up to me to update it or infuse my own policy views into it.\" In an exchange with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), she also revealed that Roe v. Wade was not a precedent the court could never reconsider and overrule.\n\nAnd so, the stage was set for the court to implement an even more regressive form of originalism. In June, it handed down its opinions in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization and New York Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen . In Dobbs, the court not only upheld a restrictive Mississippi abortion law, but finally made the far right's fevered dream of overturning Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey come true. In Bruen, the court struck down a century-old New York state regulation on concealed handgun permits as violative of the Second Amendment.\n\nIn both cases, the court abandoned the traditional methods of judicial scrutiny that require judges to determine the constitutionality of challenged laws by balancing the governmental interests advanced by the laws in question against the competing rights of individuals affected by the laws. In place of interest-balancing, the court substituted a test based exclusively on the Justices' highly selective reading of history and their sense of tradition.\n\nWriting for a 5-4 majority in Dobbs , Alito advanced the march toward right-wing judicial supremacy , declaring that both Roe and Casey were \"egregiously wrong from the start\" because the word \"abortion\" doesn't appear anywhere in the first eight amendments to the Constitution, or anywhere else in the text. He also held that abortion cannot be considered an implied or \"unenumerated\" fundamental right under the 14th Amendment's due process clause - as Roe and Casey both held - because it is not \"deeply rooted in [our] history and tradition.\" As a result, he concluded, the court was free to overrule Roe and Casey unconstrained by the doctrine of stare decisis , which holds that judges should adhere to precedent.\n\nA crowd gathers at the Supreme Court the night after the release of Alito's draft majority opinion overturning Roe v. Wade. Photo: Victoria Pickering / Flickr / CC BY-NC-ND 2.0\n\nInstead of respecting precedent, Alito reached deep into the bowels of Anglo-American common law to override it. He cited, among other sources, the work of Henry de Bracton, a 13th-century English cleric and judge who condemned abortions as homicide, and a 17th-century English jurist who described abortion as a \"great crime\" and sentenced at least three women to death for witchcraft. By the time the 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868, Alito raged on, \"three-quarters of the States [had] made abortion a crime at all stages of pregnancy,\" in order to prove his point that abortion rights are not deeply rooted in our history.\n\nThe only solution, in Alito's view, was to strip abortion of its Constitutional protections and return the issue to \"the people's elected representatives,\" opening the door to state abortion bans and the possibility of a future federal statute outlawing abortion nationwide.\n\nAlito's reading of history was shoddy. Not only did he give no weight to the 50 years that Roe had been the law of the land, but he ignored the actual early history of abortion rights in America. As University of Illinois history professor Leslie J. Reagan explained in her definitive study, When Abortion Was a Crime , \"During the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries...abortions were illegal only after 'quickening,' the point at which a pregnant woman could feel the movements of the fetus (approximately the fourth month of pregnancy).\"\n\nRepudiating Roe and Casey was also unnecessary. The court easily could have upheld the Mississippi statute, which outlawed almost all abortions after 15 weeks, without scrapping the federal right entirely, as Roberts urged in a separate opinion.\n\nClarence Thomas wrote the 6-3 opinion in Bruen , which was joined by all the court's Republican appointees, including Roberts. Like Alito, Thomas applied a specious history and tradition test to strike down New York's long-standing handgun permit system. In so doing, he dismissed the broad history of gun regulation in the U.S., dating back to the earliest days of the republic. As Fordham's Professor Cornell, one of the foremost authorities on the actual history of the Second Amendment, observed in a critique of Bruen published by SCOTUSBlog :\n\n\" The originalist methodology applied by Thomas has one set of rules that apply to interpreting legal texts that support gun rights, and another more demanding set of standards that apply to those that undermine them. The Thomas version of originalism might be summarized as follows: No amount of evidence is enough to support gun control, but no iota of evidence is too little to legitimate gun-rights claims. If one of the goals of originalism was to limit judicial discretion (a value few originalists continue to espouse now that they have a supermajority on the court), then the Thomas rule does the opposite. It provides a license to cherry-pick evidence with reckless abandon if the materials support the ideological agenda of the Federalist Society. \"\n\nCombined with the public leak of the draft of Alito's Dobbs opinion in May and the fast-brewing scandal involving the role of Ginni Thomas in events related to the Jan. 6 insurrection, the court's move to the right has triggered a crisis of legitimacy . In increasing numbers, Americans have lost trust in the court as an institution, and have come to see it correctly as a political body rather than an impartial arbiter of justice. The Dobbs decision is deeply unpopular, with 60% of respondents in recent rolls disapproving of the ruling. According to a June Gallup survey, Americans' confidence in the court has plummeted to a new low. A mere 25% of respondents told Gallup they had \"a great deal\" or \"quite a lot\" of confidence in the Court.\n\nAnd more bad decisions are on the horizon. In his concurring opinion in Dobbs , Thomas called upon his benchmates to revisit such privacy-based precedents as the right to contraception ( Griswold v. Connecticut, 1965), the right to engage in same-sex intimacy ( Lawrence v. Texas , 2003), and the right to same-sex marriage ( Obergefell v. Hodges , 2015). Thomas and Gorsuch are also on record as favoring reconsideration of New York Times v. Sullivan (1964), another product of the Warren Court that shields the media from potentially crippling defamation lawsuits. Reaching even farther into the future, originalist academics such as the University of San Diego's Rappaport have questioned the constitutionality of Social Security and Medicare .\n\nProtest in front of the US Supreme Court in January 2017. Photo: Geoff Livingston / Flickr / CC BY-NC-ND 2.0\n\nThere is a better and more reality-centered way to adjudicate constitutional issues. Originalism's rival, known variously as \"living or dynamic constitutionalism,\" asserts that while the text of the Constitution may be the starting point of any analysis, the meaning of the Constitution should evolve over time and accommodate contemporary values, social needs and changing traditions.\n\nA good example of the alternative can be found in Kennedy's majority opinion in Obergefell . As the court's swing justice, Kennedy sometimes adopted originalism, as he did in his 2010 opinion in Citizens United v. F.E.C . In Obergefell, he took a full-throated living constitutionalism approach, writing:\n\n\"The nature of injustice is that we may not always see it in our own times. The generations that wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment did not presume to know the extent of freedom in all of its dimensions, and so they entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning.\"\n\nIt is no small irony that Kennedy was nominated to the court after Bork was defeated. But Kennedy retired in 2018, replaced by Kavanaugh, whose confirmation Senate Democrats were unable to halt.\n\nThere's no denying the future of the Supreme Court looks grim. Still, as the successful fight against Bork long ago demonstrated, hope should never be abandoned. With enough public pressure and effective organizing, the court can be reformed and brought to serve the nation's needs in the 21st century.\n\nThe prospects for reform will be subject of part II of this series."

      "text": "'This Court is this Court': Expert foresees no future Supreme Court nominations for President Joe Biden\n\nOn April 7th, 2022, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was confirmed by the Senate to a lifetime appointment as the first Black woman Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. Jackson was nominated by President Joe Biden on February 20th to replace liberal Associate Justice Stephen Breyer after he announced his retirement from a twenty-eight-year tenure on the bench. Jackson was sworn in on June 30th.\n\nThe Court's two other left-wing Associate Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were respectively added in 2009 and 2010 by then-President Barack Obama. His third pick - Merrick Garland, the current attorney general - was denied a hearing by then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) because McConnell deemed the timing to be too near to the 2016 presidential election, which former President Donald Trump won.\n\nMcConnell brazenly abandoned his own standard while Trump was in office, and Trump went on to add three conservative Associate Justices: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett. Barrett was selected and quickly confirmed following the death of Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg less than two months before the 2020 presidential election, resulting in a lopsided 6-3 right-wing supermajority.\n\nOn Sunday's edition of Face the Nation , a discussion ensued over the prospects of Biden choosing new jurists. CBS Chief Legal Correspondent Jan Crawford believes that Biden's chances of getting additional nominations are slim.\n\n\"Well, if we're talking about retirements, I guess I will predict - I guess I'm gonna retire,\" she joked as the panelists bantered about the topic. \"No, I don't think we have any retirements from the Supreme Court. That is not big news, right? Nobody thinks they are gonna retire. But I see this Supreme Court staying intact - not only through the end of President Biden's first term - but if he were to be reelected, I do not think he gets another Supreme Court nomination.\"\n\nCrawford further noted that the Court's rightward shift has already begun to have an enormous impact on the American legal landscape, and stressed that this reality is unlikely to end anytime soon:\n\nThis Court is this Court. You've got six conservative Justices. They're going to overturn affirmative action in college admissions like I said earlier. And it's the Court we're going to have for a while. Whether it will be the Court that is the longest in the history of nine Justices to go without a change of membership, I don't know. That was eleven years. That was after Justice Breyer joined the Court in 1994. But it will be this Court for some time, so people can get used to some different rulings.\n\nWatch below or at this link ."

She pointed to the rise of Moms for Liberty, a well-organized anti-LGBTQ+ group with more than 100,000 self-reported members, as a key group to watch due to its effectiveness in countering inclusionary policies in schools. The far right's goal, she explained, is a broad rejection of LBGTQ+ people from public life, including elected office, community leadership decisions and their ability to access services.\n\n\"Grievance is incredibly important to the foundational mythos of Maga. If it's not abortion, it's something else: Trump being persecuted by the dictatorial justice department, the threat of the woke mob, the demonization of blue states. There's always one if not more enemies that are internal to the country,\" Dallek added.\n\nHe emphasized, \"It's never enough because there is always a sense that people in power are corrupt and un-American, that they are destroying the value.\"\n\nThe Guardian notes, according to Levin, \"This supreme court decision, he predicted, will be used to further anchor and galvanize racial discrimination against Black people while serving as an affirmation for white nationalists that white people have been cheated - part of their narrative of white supremacy.\"\n\nThe Guardian's full report is available at this link ."

Not only are the former officers Black, but the city's police department is headed by Cerelyn Davis , a Black woman. None of this helped Nichols, another victim of a modern-day police lynching.\n\nThe militarists, corporatists, oligarchs, politicians, academics and media conglomerates champion identity politics and diversity because it does nothing to address the systemic injustices or the scourge of permanent war that plague the U.S. It is an advertising gimmick, a brand, used to mask mounting social inequality and imperial folly. It busies liberals and the educated with a boutique activism, which is not only ineffectual but exacerbates the divide between the privileged and a working class in deep economic distress. The haves scold the have-nots for their bad manners, racism, linguistic insensitivity and garishness, while ignoring the root causes of their economic distress. The oligarchs could not be happier.\n\nDid the lives of Native Americans improve as a result of the legislation mandating assimilation and the revoking of tribal land titles pushed through by Charles Curtis, the first Native American vice president? Are we better off with Clarence Thomas, who opposes affirmative action, on the Supreme Court, or Victoria Nuland, a war hawk in the State Department? Is our perpetuation of permanent war more palatable because Lloyd Austin, an African American, is the secretary of defense? Is the military more humane because it accepts transgender soldiers? Is social inequality, and the surveillance state that controls it, ameliorated because Sundar Pichai - who was born in India - is the CEO of Google and Alphabet? Has the weapons industry improved because Kathy J. Warden, a woman, is the CEO of Northop Grumman, and another woman, Phebe Novakovic, is the CEO of General Dynamics?

To thwart popular aspirations for justice, colonial police forces routinely carried out atrocities on behalf of the oppressors. The indigenous freedom fighters who fight in support of the poor and the marginalized are usually forced out of power or assassinated, as was the case with Congolese independence leader Patrice Lumumba and Chilean president Salvador Allende . Lakota chief Sitting Bull was gunned down by members of his own tribe, who served in the reservation's police force at Standing Rock. If you stand with the oppressed, you will almost always end up being treated like the oppressed. This is why the FBI, along with Chicago police, murdered Fred Hampton and was almost certainly involved in the murder of Malcolm X, who referred to impoverished urban neighborhoods as \"internal colonies.\" Militarized police forces in the U.S. function as armies of occupation. The police officers who killed Tyre Nichols are no different from those in reservation and colonial police forces.\n\nWe live under a species of corporate colonialism. The engines of white supremacy, which constructed the forms of institutional and economic racism that keep the poor poor , are obscured behind attractive political personalities such as Barack Obama, whom Cornel West called \"a Black mascot for Wall Street.\" These faces of diversity are vetted and selected by the ruling class. Obama was groomed and promoted by the Chicago political machine, one of the dirtiest and most corrupt in the country.\n\n\"It's an insult to the organized movements of people these institutions claim to want to include,\" Glen Ford , the late editor of the Black Agenda Report, told me in 2018. \"These institutions write the script. It's their drama. They choose the actors, whatever black, brown, yellow, red faces they want.\"\n\nFord called those who promote identity politics \"representationalists\" who \"want to see some Black people represented in all sectors of leadership, in all sectors of society. They want Black scientists. They want Black movie stars. They want Black scholars at Harvard. They want Blacks on Wall Street. But it's just representation. That's it.\"\n\nThe toll taken by corporate capitalism on the people these \"representationalists\" claim to represent exposes the con. African Americans have lost 40 percent of their wealth since the financial collapse of 2008 from the disproportionate impact of the drop in home equity, predatory loans, foreclosures and job loss. They have the second highest rate of poverty at 21.7 percent, after Native Americans at 25.9 percent, followed by Hispanics at 17.6 percent and whites at 9.5 percent, according to the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department for Health and Human Services. As of 2021, Black and Native American children lived in poverty at 28 and 25 percent respectively, followed by Hispanic children at 25 percent and white children at 10 percent. Nearly 40 percent of the nation's homeless are African Americans, although Black people make up about 14 percent of our population. This figure does not include people living in dilapidated, overcrowded dwellings or with family or friends due to financial difficulties. African Americans are incarcerated at nearly five times the rate of white people.\n\nIdentity politics and diversity allow liberals to wallow in a cloying moral superiority as they castigate, censor and deplatform those who do not linguistically conform to politically correct speech. They are the new Jacobins. This game disguises their passivity in the face of corporate abuse, neoliberalism, permanent war and the curtailment of civil liberties. They do not confront the institutions that orchestrate social and economic injustice. They seek to make the ruling class more palatable. With the support of the Democratic Party, the liberal media, academia and social media platforms in Silicon Valley, demonize the victims of the corporate coup d'état and deindustrialization. They make their primary political alliances with those who embrace identity politics, whether they are on Wall Street or in the Pentagon. They are the useful idiots of the billionaire class, moral crusaders who widen the divisions within society that the ruling oligarchs foster to maintain control.\n\nDiversity is important. But diversity, when devoid of a political agenda that fights the oppressor on behalf of the oppressed, is window dressing. It is about incorporating a tiny segment of those marginalized by society into unjust structures to perpetuate them.\n\nA class I taught in a maximum security prison in New Jersey wrote \"Caged,\" a play about their lives. The play ran for nearly a month at the Passage Theatre in Trenton, New Jersey, where it was sold out nearly every night. It was subsequently published by Haymarket Books. The 28 students in the class insisted that the corrections officer in the story not be white. That was too easy, they said. That was a feint that allows people to simplify and mask the oppressive apparatus of banks, corporations, police, courts and the prison system, all of which make diversity hires. These systems of internal exploitation and oppression must be targeted and dismantled, no matter whom they employ.\n\nMy book, \" Our Class: Trauma and Transformation in an American Prison ,\" uses the experience of writing the play to tell the stories of my students and impart their profound understanding of the repressive forces and institutions arrayed against them, their families and their communities. You can see my two-part interview with Hugh Hamilton about \"Our Class\" here and here .\n\nAugust Wilson 's last play, \" Radio Golf ,\" foretold where diversity and identity politics devoid of class consciousness were headed. In the play, Harmond Wilks, an Ivy League-educated real estate developer, is about to launch his campaign to become Pittsburgh's first Black mayor. His wife, Mame, is angling to become the governor's press secretary. Wilks, navigating the white man's universe of privilege, business deals, status seeking and the country club game of golf, must sanitize and deny his identity. Roosevelt Hicks, who had been Wilks' college roommate at Cornell and is a vice president at Mellon Bank, is his business partner. Sterling Johnson, whose neighborhood Wilks and Hicks are lobbying to get the city to declare blighted so they can raze it for their multimillion dollar development project, tells Hicks:\n\nTerrible predatory forces are eating away at the country. The corporatists, militarists and political mandarins that serve them are the enemy. It is not our job to make them more appealing, but to destroy them. There are amongst us genuine freedom fighters of all ethnicities and backgrounds whose integrity does not permit them to serve the system of inverted totalitarianism that has destroyed our democracy, impoverished the nation and perpetuated endless wars. Diversity when it serves the oppressed is an asset, but a con when it serves the oppressors."

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - The survival of affirmative action in higher education appeared to be in serious trouble Monday at a conservative-dominated Supreme Court after hours of debate over vexing questions of race.\n\nThe most diverse court in the nation's history - among the nine justices are four women, two Black people and a Latina - is weighing challenges to admissions programs at the University of North Carolina and Harvard that use race among many factors in seeking a diverse student body.\n\nThe court's six conservative justices all expressed doubts about the practice, which has been upheld under Supreme Court decisions reaching back to 1978. The court's three liberals defended the programs, which are similar to those used by many other private and public universities.\n\nGetting rid of race-conscious college admissions would have a \"destabilizing\" effect that would cause the ranks of Black and Latino students to plummet at the nation's most selective schools, Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, representing the Biden administration, said.\n\nFollowing the overturning of the half-century abortion precedent of Roe v. Wade in June, the cases offer a big new test of whether the court, with its 6-3 conservative edge, will sharply steer the law to the right on another contentious cultural issue that conservatives have had in their sights for years.\n\nThe questions the justices offered further laid bare the stark ideological divisions on the court in an era of intense political polarization in the country.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas, the court's second Black justice, who has a long record of opposition to affirmative action programs and other conservative positions , noted he didn't go to racially diverse schools, at one point saying, \"I've heard the word 'diversity' quite a few times, and I don't have a clue what it means.\" He also challenged defenders of affirmative action to \"tell me what the educational benefits are.\"\n\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett, another conservative, pointed to one of the court's previous affirmative action cases and said it anticipated a halt to its use in declaring that any classification based on race was \"dangerous\" and had to have an end point.\n\nShe was among several conservatives who pushed lawyers representing the schools and the Biden administration to venture a guess when that day would come.\n\n\"Your position is that race matters because it's necessary for diversity, which is necessary for the sort of education you want. It's not going to stop mattering at some particular point,\" said Chief Justice John Roberts, who has long been skeptical of considerations of race.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito likened affirmative action to a footrace in which a minority applicant gets to \"start five yards closer to the finish line.\" But liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the court's first Hispanic member, rejected that comparison saying what universities are doing is looking at students as a whole.\n\nLikewise, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the court's newest justice and its first Black woman, also said race was being used among 40 different factors at the University of North Carolina as part of a broad review of applicants.\n\n\"They're looking at the full person with all of these characteristics,\" she said.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan, who was the first female dean at Harvard Law School earlier in her career, called universities the \"pipelines to leadership in our society\" and suggested that without affirmative action minority enrollment will drop.\n\n\"I thought part of what it meant to be an American and to believe in American pluralism is that actually our institutions, you know, are reflective of who we are as a people in all our variety,\" she said.\n\nThe Supreme Court has twice upheld race-conscious college admissions programs in the past 19 years, including just six years ago.\n\nBut that was before the three appointees of former President Donald Trump joined. Jackson was chosen this year by President Joe Biden.\n\nLower courts have upheld the programs at both UNC and Harvard, rejecting claims that the schools discriminated against white and Asian-American applicants.\n\nThe cases are brought by conservative activist Edward Blum, who also was behind an earlier affirmative action challenge against the University of Texas as well as the case that led the court in 2013 to end the use of a key provision of the landmark Voting Rights Act.\n\nBlum formed Students for Fair Admissions, which filed the lawsuits against both schools in 2014.\n\nThe group argues that the Constitution forbids the use of race in college admissions and calls for overturning earlier Supreme Court decisions that said otherwise.\n\nColleges and universities can use other, race-neutral ways to assemble a diverse student body, including by focusing on socioeconomic status and eliminating the preference for children of alumni and major donors, Students for Fair Admissions argues.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch pressed Ryan Park, a lawyer for North Carolina, on why colleges shouldn't be forced to eliminate those preferences, \"which tend to favor the children of wealthy white parents,\" to see if it allowed them to increase diversity without considering race.\n\nA college might end up with a more diverse student body, but \"we just would have a crummy squash team and no art museum,\" Gorsuch said.\n\nIn the Harvard case, lawyer Seth Waxman pointed to lower court findings rejecting claims that Harvard discriminates on the basis of race. Waxman said the school looks for many different kinds of diversity, including having oboe players for its student orchestra.\n\n\"We did not fight a civil war over oboe players,\" Roberts countered, a sharp allusion to the nation's long struggle with race.\n\nThe schools contend that they use race in a limited way, but that eliminating it as a factor altogether would make it much harder to achieve a student body that looks like America.\n\nThe Biden administration is urging the court to preserve race-conscious admissions. The Trump administration had taken the opposite position in earlier stages of the cases.\n\nUNC says its freshman class is about 65% white, 22% Asian American, 10% Black and 10% Hispanic. The numbers add to more than 100% because some students report belonging to more than one category, a school spokesman said.\n\nWhite students are just over 40% of Harvard's freshman class, the school said. The class also is just under 28% Asian American, 14% Black and 12% Latino.\n\nNine states already prohibit any consideration of race in admissions to their public colleges and universities: Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oklahoma and Washington.\n\nIn 2020, California voters easily rejected a ballot measure to bring back affirmative action.\n\nPublic opinion on the topic varies depending on how the question is asked. A Gallup Poll from 2021 found 62% of Americans in favor of affirmative action programs for racial minorities. But in a Pew Research Center survey in March, 74% of Americans, including majorities of Black and Latino respondents, said race and ethnicity should not factor into college admissions.\n\nJackson and Roberts received their undergraduate and law degrees from Harvard. Two other justices went to law school there.\n\nJackson is sitting out the Harvard case because she was until recently a member of an advisory governing board there.\n\nA decision in the affirmative action cases is not expected before late spring.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - A civil rights group is challenging legacy admissions at Harvard University, saying the practice discriminates against students of color by giving an unfair boost to the mostly white children of alumni.\n\nThe practice of giving priority to the children of alumni has faced growing pushback in the wake of last week's Supreme Court's decision ending affirmative action in higher education. The NAACP added its weight behind the effort on Monday, asking more than 1,500 colleges and universities to even the playing field in admissions, including by ending legacy admissions.\n\nThe civil rights complaint was filed Monday by Lawyers for Civil Rights, a nonprofit based in Boston, on behalf of Black and Latino community groups in New England, alleging that Harvard's admissions system violates the Civil Rights Act.\n\n\"Why are we rewarding children for privileges and advantages accrued by prior generations?\" said Ivan Espinoza-Madrigal, the group's executive director. \"Your family's last name and the size of your bank account are not a measure of merit, and should have no bearing on the college admissions process.\"\n\nOpponents say the practice is no longer defensible without affirmative action providing a counterbalance. The court's ruling says colleges must ignore the race of applicants, activists point out, but schools can still give a boost to the children of alumni and donors.\n\nThe complaint, submitted with the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights, draws on Harvard data that came to light amid the affirmative action case that landed before the Supreme Court. The records revealed that 70% of Harvard's donor-related and legacy applicants are white, and being a legacy student makes an applicant roughly six times more likely to be admitted.\n\nIt draws attention to other colleges that have abandoned the practice amid questions about its fairness, including Amherst College and Johns Hopkins University.\n\nThe complaint alleges that Harvard's legacy preference has nothing to do with merit and takes away slots from qualified students of color. It asks the U.S. Education Department to declare the practice illegal and force Harvard to abandon it as long as the university receives federal funding.\n\nThe Supreme Court has struck down affirmative action in college admissions, forcing institutions of higher education to look for new ways to achieve diverse student bodies. (June 29)\n\n\"A spot given to a legacy or donor-related applicant is a spot that becomes unavailable to an applicant who meets the admissions criteria based purely on his or her own merit,\" according to the complaint. If legacy and donor preferences were removed, it adds, \"more students of color would be admitted to Harvard.\"\n\nHarvard said it would not comment on the complaint.\n\n\"Last week, the University reaffirmed its commitment to the fundamental principle that deep and transformative teaching, learning, and research depend upon a community comprising people of many backgrounds, perspectives, and lived experiences,\" the university said in a prepared statement. \"As we said, in the weeks and months ahead, the University will determine how to preserve our essential values, consistent with the Court's new precedent.\"\n\nThe complaint was filed on behalf of Chica Project, African Community Economic Development of New England, and the Greater Boston Latino Network.\n\nAlso Monday, the NAACP launched a campaign aiming to get universities across the nation to promote campus diversity. The group called on 532 public and 1,134 private colleges and universities to end legacy preferences, eliminate \"racially biased\" entrance examinations, recruit diverse faculty, and support low-income and first-generation students with scholarships and mentoring, among other steps.\n\n\"It is our hope that our nation's institutions will stand with us in embracing diversity, no matter what,\" said Derrick Johnson president and CEO of the NAACP. \"Regardless, the NAACP will continue to advocate, litigate and mobilize to ensure that every Black American has access to the resources and opportunities they need to thrive.\"\n\nThat effort joins another campaign urging the alumni of 30 prestigious colleges to withhold donations until their schools end legacy admissions. That initiative, led by Ed Mobilizer, also targets Harvard and other Ivy League schools.\n\nPresident Joe Biden suggested last week that universities should rethink the practice , saying legacy admissions \"expand privilege instead of opportunity.\"\n\nSeveral Democrats in Congress demanded an end to the policy in light of the court's decision, along with Republicans including Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, who is vying for the GOP presidential nomination.\n\nIt's unclear exactly which schools provide a legacy boost and how much it helps. In California, where state law requires schools to disclose the practice, the University of Southern California reported that 14% of last year's admitted students had family ties to alumni or donors. Stanford reported a similar rate.\n\nAn Associated Press survey of the nation's most selective colleges last year found that legacy students in the freshman class ranged from 4% to 23%. At four schools - Notre Dame, USC, Cornell and Dartmouth - legacy students outnumbered Black students.\n\nSupporters of the policy say it builds an alumni community and encourages donations. A 2022 study of an undisclosed college in the Northeast found that legacy students were more likely to make donations, but at a cost to diversity - the vast majority were white.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press education team receives support from the Carnegie Corporation of New York.

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court on Thursday struck down affirmative action in college admissions, declaring race cannot be a factor and forcing institutions of higher education to look for new ways to achieve diverse student bodies.\n\nThe court's conservative majority effectively overturned cases reaching back 45 years in invalidating admissions plans at Harvard and the University of North Carolina, the nation's oldest private and public colleges, respectively.\n\nThe decision , like last year's momentous abortion ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade, marked the realization of a long-sought conservative legal goal, this time finding that race-conscious admissions plans violate the Constitution and a law that applies to colleges that receive federal funding, as almost all do.\n\nThose schools will be forced to reshape their admissions practices, especially top schools that are more likely to consider the race of applicants.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts said that for too long universities have \"concluded, wrongly, that the touchstone of an individual's identity is not challenges bested, skills built, or lessons learned but the color of their skin. Our constitutional history does not tolerate that choice.\"\n\nFrom the White House, President Joe Biden said he \"strongly, strongly\" disagreed with the court's ruling and urged colleges to seek other routes to diversity rather than let the ruling \"be the last word.\"\n\nBesides the conservative-liberal split, the fight over affirmative action showed the deep gulf between the three justices of color , each of whom wrote separately and vividly about race in America and where the decision might lead.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas - the nation's second Black justice, who had long called for an end to affirmative action - wrote that the decision \"sees the universities' admissions policies for what they are: rudderless, race-based preferences designed to ensure a particular racial mix in their entering classes.\"\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, the court's first Latina, wrote in dissent that the decision \"rolls back decades of precedent and momentous progress.\"\n\nBoth Thomas and Sotomayor, the two justices who have acknowledged affirmative action played a role in their admissions to college and law school, took the unusual step of reading summaries of their opinions aloud in the courtroom.\n\nIn a separate dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson - the court's first Black female justice - called the decision \"truly a tragedy for us all.\"\n\nJackson, who sat out the Harvard case because she had been a member of an advisory governing board, wrote, \"With let-them-eat-cake obliviousness, today, the majority pulls the ripcord and announces 'colorblindness for all' by legal fiat. But deeming race irrelevant in law does not make it so in life.\"\n\nThe vote was 6-3 in the North Carolina case and 6-2 in the Harvard case. Justice Elena Kagan was the other dissenter.\n\nThe Supreme Court has struck down affirmative action in college admissions, forcing institutions of higher education to look for new ways to achieve diverse student bodies. (June 29)\n\nBiden, who quickly stepped before cameras at the White House, said of the nation's colleges: \"They should not abandon their commitment to ensure student bodies of diverse backgrounds and experience that reflect all of America,\" He said colleges should evaluate \"adversity overcome\" by candidates.\n\nIn fact, an applicant for admission still can write about, and colleges can consider, \"how race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration or otherwise,\" Roberts wrote.\n\nBut the institutions \"may not simply establish through application essays or other means the regime we hold unlawful today,\" he wrote.\n\nPresidents of many colleges quickly issued statements affirming their commitment to diversity regardless of the court's decision. Many said they were still assessing the impact but would follow federal law.\n\n\"Harvard will continue to be a vibrant community whose members come from all walks of life, all over the world,\" school President Lawrence Bacow said in a statement.\n\nPresident Reginald DesRoches of Rice University in Houston said he was \"greatly disappointed\" by the decision but \"more resolute than ever\" to pursue diversity. \"The law may change, but Rice's commitment to diversity will not,\" he said in a campus message.\n\nFormer Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama offered starkly different takes on the high court ruling. The decision marked \"a great day for America. People with extraordinary ability and everything else necessary for success, including future greatness for our Country, are finally being rewarded,\" Trump, the current Republican presidential frontrunner, wrote on his social media network.\n\nObama said in a statement that affirmative action \"allowed generations of students like Michelle and me to prove we belonged. Now it's up to all of us to give young people the opportunities they deserve - and help students everywhere benefit from new perspectives.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court had twice upheld race-conscious college admissions programs in the past 20 years, including as recently as 2016.\n\nBut that was before the three Trump appointees joined the court. At arguments in late October , all six conservative justices expressed doubts about the practice, which had been upheld under Supreme Court decisions reaching back to 1978.\n\nLower courts also had upheld the programs at both UNC and Harvard, rejecting claims that the schools discriminated against white and Asian American applicants.\n\nThe college admissions disputes were among several high-profile cases focused on race in America, and were weighed by the conservative-dominated, but most diverse court ever. Among the nine justices are four women, two Black people and a Latina.\n\nThe justices earlier in June decided a voting rights case in favor of Black voters in Alabama and rejected a race-based challenge to a Native American child protection law .\n\nThe affirmative action cases were brought by conservative activist Edward Blum, who also was behind an earlier challenge against the University of Texas as well as the case that led the court in 2013 to end use of a key provision of the landmark Voting Rights Act.\n\nBlum formed Students for Fair Admissions, which filed the lawsuits against both schools in 2014.\n\nThe group argued that the Constitution forbids the use of race in college admissions and called for overturning earlier Supreme Court decisions that said otherwise.\n\nRoberts' opinion effectively did so, both Thomas and the dissenters wrote.\n\nThe only institutions of higher education explicitly left out of the ruling were the nation's military academies, Roberts wrote, suggesting that national security interests could affect the legal analysis.\n\nBlum's group had contended that colleges and universities can use other, race-neutral ways to assemble a diverse student body, including by focusing on socioeconomic status and eliminating the preference for children of alumni and major donors.\n\nThe schools said that they use race in a limited way, but that eliminating it as a factor altogether would make it much harder to achieve a student body that looks like America.\n\nAt the eight Ivy League universities, the number of nonwhite students increased from 27% in 2010 to 35% in 2021, according to federal data. Those men and women include Asian, Black, Hispanic, Native American, Pacific Islander and biracial students.\n\nNine states already prohibit any consideration of race in admissions to their public colleges and universities. The end of affirmative action in higher education in California, Michigan, Washington state and elsewhere led to a steep drop in minority enrollment in those states' leading public universities .\n\nThe other states are: Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Nebraska, New Hampshire and Oklahoma.\n\nIn 2020, California voters easily rejected a ballot measure to bring back affirmative action.\n\nA poll last month by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research showed 63% of U.S. adults say the court should allow colleges to consider race as part of the admissions process, yet few believe students' race should ultimately play a major role in decisions. A Pew Research Center survey released last week found that half of Americans disapprove of considerations of applicants' race, while a third approve.\n\nThe chief justice and Jackson received their undergraduate and law degrees from Harvard. Two other justices, Neil Gorsuch and Kagan, went to law school there, and Kagan was the first woman to serve as the law school's dean.\n\nEvery U.S. college and university the justices attended, save one, urged the court to preserve race-conscious admissions.\n\nThose schools - Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Notre Dame and Holy Cross - joined briefs in defense of Harvard's and UNC's admissions plans.\n\nOnly Justice Amy Coney Barrett's undergraduate alma mater, Rhodes College, in Memphis, Tennessee, was not involved in the cases.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Collin Binkley contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Paul Sancya)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court has sent shockwaves through higher education with a landmark decision that struck down affirmative action and left colleges across the nation searching for new ways to promote student diversity.\n\nLeaders of scores of universities said Thursday that they were disappointed by what they see as a blow to diversity. Yet many also voiced optimism that they would find new ways to admit more Black and Hispanic students, despite evidence that eliminating the practice often leads to steep enrollment decreases among them.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said he disagreed with the decision and asked the Education Department to explore policies that could help colleges build diverse student bodies. He also pushed against policies like legacy preferences - admissions boosts given to the children of alumni - that tend to help white, wealthy students.\n\n\"We should never allow the country to walk away from the dream upon which it was founded,\" Biden told reporters. \"We need a new path forward, a path consistent with the law that protects diversity and expands opportunity.\"\n\nYet evidence from states that previously outlawed affirmative action show it will be a daunting challenge.\n\nAs an alternative to affirmative action, colleges from California to Florida have tried a range of strategies to achieve the diversity they say is essential to their campuses. Many have given greater preference to low-income families. Others started admitting top students from every community in their state.\n\nBut years of experimentation - often prompted by state-level bans on considering race in admissions - left no clear solution. In states requiring race-neutral policies, many colleges saw enrollment drops among Black and Hispanic students, especially at selective colleges that historically have been mostly white.\n\nAt Amherst College, officials had estimated going entirely race-neutral would reduce Black, Hispanic and Indigenous populations by half.\n\n\"We fully expect it would be a significant decrease in our population,\" said Matthew McGann, Amherst's director of admission, earlier this year.\n\nFacing a conservative Supreme Court that appeared skeptical from the start, colleges have been preparing for a rollback. Some were considering adding more essays to get a better picture of an applicant's background, a strategy invited in Thursday's Supreme Court ruling.\n\n\"Nothing prohibits universities from considering an applicant's discussion of how race affected the applicant's life, so long as that discussion is concretely tied to a quality of character or unique ability that the particular applicant can contribute to the university,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the court's conservative majority.\n\nOther colleges were planning to boost recruiting in racially diverse areas, or admit more transfer students from community colleges .\n\nThe court took up affirmative action in response to challenges at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina . Lower courts upheld admission systems at both schools, rejecting claims that the schools discriminated against white and Asian American applicants. But at Supreme Court arguments in late October, all six conservative justices expressed doubts about the practice, which had been upheld under Supreme Court decisions reaching back to 1978, and as recently as 2016.\n\nNine states already have banned affirmative action , starting with California in 1996 and, most recently, Idaho in 2020.\n\nAfter Michigan voters rejected it in 2006, the University of Michigan shifted attention to low-income students.\n\nIt sent graduates to work as counselors in low-income high schools. It started offering college prep in Detroit and Grand Rapids. It offered full scholarships for low-income Michigan residents. More recently, it started accepting fewer early admission applications, which are more likely to come from white students.\n\nDespite those efforts, the share of Black and Hispanic undergraduates hasn't fully rebounded from a falloff after 2006. And while Hispanic enrollments have been increasing, Black enrollments continued to slide, going from 8% of undergraduates in 2006 to 4% now.\n\nThe campus is drawing more low-income students, but that hasn't translated to racial diversity, said Erica Sanders, director of undergraduate admissions at Michigan.\n\n\"Socioeconomic status is not a proxy for race,\" Sanders said.\n\nAt the same time, some of Michigan's less selective colleges have fared better. At nearby Eastern Michigan University, the number of students of color increased, reflecting demographic shifts in the state. It illustrates what experts say is a chilling effect seen most acutely at selective colleges - students of color see fewer of their peers at places like Ann Arbor, prompting them to choose campuses that appear more welcoming.\n\nGrowing up in Ann Arbor, there was an expectation that Odia Kaba would attend the University of Michigan. When her application was deferred, she started at Eastern Michigan with plans to transfer to Ann Arbor her sophomore year.\n\nBy then, Kaba was getting daily texts from her sister, who attended U-M, describing the microaggressions she faced as a Black student on campus.

Even though it's a mostly white campus, Kaba said she found pockets of diversity that helped make her comfortable.\n\n\"I'm in economics, which is a white male-dominated space. But I can walk out of the classroom and be surrounded by my people, and I just feel safe,\" she said.\n\nThe University of California also saw enrollment slides after a statewide ban in 1996. Within two years, Black and Hispanic enrollments fell by half at the system's two most selective campuses, Berkeley and UCLA. The system would go on to spend more than $500 million on programs aimed at low-income and first-generation college students.\n\nIt also started a program that promises admission to the top 9% of students in each high school across the state, an attempt to reach strong students from all backgrounds. A similar promise in Texas has been credited for expanding racial diversity, and opponents of affirmative action cite it as a successful model.\n\nIn California, the promise drew students from a wider geographic area but did little to expand racial diversity, the system said in a brief to the Supreme Court. It had almost no impact at Berkeley and UCLA, where students compete against tens of thousands of other applicants.\n\nToday at UCLA and Berkeley, Hispanic students make up 20% of undergraduates, higher than in 1996 but lower than their 53% share among California's high school graduates. Black students, meanwhile, have a smaller presence than they did in 1996, accounting for 2% of undergraduates at Berkeley.\n\nOpponents of affirmative action say some states have fared well without it. After Oklahoma outlawed the practice in 2012, the state's flagship university saw \"no long-term severe decline\" in minority enrollments, the state's attorney general told the Supreme Court.\n\nIt pointed to a recent freshman class at the University of Oklahoma that had more Hispanic, Asian and Native American students than in 2012. The share of Black students fell, but it wasn't far from flagship universities in other states that allow affirmative action, the state said.\n\nStill, many colleges expect racial diversity could take a hit. With affirmative action struck down, colleges fear they will unknowingly admit fewer students of color. In the long run, it can be self-perpetuating - if numbers fall, the campus can appear less attractive to future students of color.\n\nThat's a problem, colleges say, because racial diversity benefits the entire campus, exposing students to other worldviews and preparing them for a diverse workforce.\n\nBeyond race, the decision has the impact to reshape other admissions policies. To draw more underserved populations, experts say colleges may need to do away with policies that advantage white students, from legacy preferences and early admission to standardized test scores.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press education team receives support from the Carnegie Corporation of New York.

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - A civil rights group is challenging legacy admissions at Harvard University, saying the practice discriminates against students of color by giving an unfair boost to the mostly white children of alumni.\n\nThe practice of giving priority to the children of alumni has faced growing pushback in the wake of last week's Supreme Court's decision ending affirmative action in higher education. The NAACP added its weight behind the effort on Monday, asking more than 1,500 colleges and universities to even the playing field in admissions, including by ending legacy admissions.\n\nThe civil rights complaint was filed Monday by Lawyers for Civil Rights, a nonprofit based in Boston, on behalf of Black and Latino community groups in New England, alleging that Harvard's admissions system violates the Civil Rights Act.\n\n\"Why are we rewarding children for privileges and advantages accrued by prior generations?\" said Ivan Espinoza-Madrigal, the group's executive director. \"Your family's last name and the size of your bank account are not a measure of merit, and should have no bearing on the college admissions process.\"\n\nOpponents say the practice is no longer defensible without affirmative action providing a counterbalance. The court's ruling says colleges must ignore the race of applicants, activists point out, but schools can still give a boost to the children of alumni and donors.\n\nThe complaint, submitted with the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights, draws on Harvard data that came to light amid the affirmative action case that landed before the Supreme Court. The records revealed that 70% of Harvard's donor-related and legacy applicants are white, and being a legacy student makes an applicant roughly six times more likely to be admitted.\n\nIt draws attention to other colleges that have abandoned the practice amid questions about its fairness, including Amherst College and Johns Hopkins University.\n\nThe complaint alleges that Harvard's legacy preference has nothing to do with merit and takes away slots from qualified students of color. It asks the U.S. Education Department to declare the practice illegal and force Harvard to abandon it as long as the university receives federal funding.\n\nThe Supreme Court has struck down affirmative action in college admissions, forcing institutions of higher education to look for new ways to achieve diverse student bodies. (June 29)\n\n\"A spot given to a legacy or donor-related applicant is a spot that becomes unavailable to an applicant who meets the admissions criteria based purely on his or her own merit,\" according to the complaint. If legacy and donor preferences were removed, it adds, \"more students of color would be admitted to Harvard.\"\n\nHarvard said it would not comment on the complaint.\n\n\"Last week, the University reaffirmed its commitment to the fundamental principle that deep and transformative teaching, learning, and research depend upon a community comprising people of many backgrounds, perspectives, and lived experiences,\" the university said in a prepared statement. \"As we said, in the weeks and months ahead, the University will determine how to preserve our essential values, consistent with the Court's new precedent.\"\n\nThe complaint was filed on behalf of Chica Project, African Community Economic Development of New England, and the Greater Boston Latino Network.\n\nAlso Monday, the NAACP launched a campaign aiming to get universities across the nation to promote campus diversity. The group called on 532 public and 1,134 private colleges and universities to end legacy preferences, eliminate \"racially biased\" entrance examinations, recruit diverse faculty, and support low-income and first-generation students with scholarships and mentoring, among other steps.\n\n\"It is our hope that our nation's institutions will stand with us in embracing diversity, no matter what,\" said Derrick Johnson president and CEO of the NAACP. \"Regardless, the NAACP will continue to advocate, litigate and mobilize to ensure that every Black American has access to the resources and opportunities they need to thrive.\"\n\nThat effort joins another campaign urging the alumni of 30 prestigious colleges to withhold donations until their schools end legacy admissions. That initiative, led by Ed Mobilizer, also targets Harvard and other Ivy League schools.\n\nPresident Joe Biden suggested last week that universities should rethink the practice , saying legacy admissions \"expand privilege instead of opportunity.\"\n\nSeveral Democrats in Congress demanded an end to the policy in light of the court's decision, along with Republicans including Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, who is vying for the GOP presidential nomination.\n\nIt's unclear exactly which schools provide a legacy boost and how much it helps. In California, where state law requires schools to disclose the practice, the University of Southern California reported that 14% of last year's admitted students had family ties to alumni or donors. Stanford reported a similar rate.\n\nAn Associated Press survey of the nation's most selective colleges last year found that legacy students in the freshman class ranged from 4% to 23%. At four schools - Notre Dame, USC, Cornell and Dartmouth - legacy students outnumbered Black students.\n\nSupporters of the policy say it builds an alumni community and encourages donations. A 2022 study of an undisclosed college in the Northeast found that legacy students were more likely to make donations, but at a cost to diversity - the vast majority were white.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press education team receives support from the Carnegie Corporation of New York.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Overturning Roe v. Wade and eliminating affirmative action in higher education had been leading goals of the conservative legal movement for decades.\n\nIn a span of 370 days, a Supreme Court reshaped by three justices nominated by President Donald Trump made both a reality.\n\nLast June, the court ended nationwide protections for abortion rights . This past week, the court's conservative majority decided that race-conscious admissions programs at the oldest private and public colleges in the country, Harvard and the University of North Carolina, were unlawful.\n\nPrecedents that had stood since the 1970s were overturned, explicitly in the case of abortion and effectively in the affirmative action context.\n\n\"That is what is notable about this court. It's making huge changes in highly salient areas in a very short period of time,\" said Tara Leigh Grove, a law professor at the University of Texas.\n\nAs ethical questions swirled around the court and public trust in the institution had already dipped to a 50-year low , there were other consequential decisions in which the six conservatives prevailed.\n\nThey rejected the Biden administration's $400 billion student loan forgiveness program and held that a Christian graphic artist can refuse on free speech grounds to design websites for same-sex couples, despite a Colorado law that bars discrimination based on sexual orientation and other characteristics.\n\nThe court, by a 5-4 vote, also sharply limited the federal government's authority to police water pollution into certain wetlands , although all nine justices rejected the administration's position.\n\nAffirmative action was arguably the biggest constitutional decision of the year, and it showcased fiercely opposing opinions from the court's two Black justices, Clarence Thomas and Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nThey offered sharply contrasting takes on affirmative action. Thomas was in the majority to end it. Jackson, in her first year on the court, was in dissent.\n\nThe past year also had a number of notable surprises.\n\nDiffering coalitions of conservative and liberal justices ruled in favor of Black voters in an Alabama redistricting case and refused to embrace broad arguments in a North Carolina redistricting case that could have left state legislatures unchecked and dramatically altered elections for Congress and president.\n\nThe court also ruled for the Biden administration in a fight over deportation priorities and left in place the Indian Child Welfare Act, the federal law aimed at keeping Native American children with Native families .\n\nThose cases reflected the control that Chief Justice John Roberts asserted, or perhaps reasserted, over the court following a year in which the other five conservatives moved more quickly than he wanted in some areas, including abortion.\n\nRoberts wrote a disproportionate share of the term's biggest cases: conservative outcomes on affirmative action and the student loan plan, and liberal victories in Alabama and North Carolina.\n\nThe Alabama case may have been the most surprising because Roberts had consistently sought to narrow the landmark Voting Rights Act since his days as a young lawyer in the Reagan administration. As chief justice, he wrote the decision 10 years ago that gutted a key provision of the law .\n\nBut in the Alabama case and elsewhere, Roberts was part of majorities that rejected the most aggressive legal arguments put forth by Republican elected officials and conservative legal advocates.\n\nThe mixed bag of decisions almost seemed designed to counter arguments about the court's legitimacy, raised by Democratic and liberal critics - and some justices - in response to last year's abortion ruling, among others. The narrative was amplified by published reports of undisclosed, paid jet travel and fancy trips for Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito from billionaire Republican donors.\n\n\"I don't think the court consciously takes opinion into account,\" Grove said. \"But I think if there's anyone who might consciously think about these issues, it's the institutionalist, the chief justice. He's been extremely concerned about the attacks on the Supreme Court.\"\n\nOn the term's final day, Roberts urged the public to not mistake disagreement among the justices for disparagement of the court. \"Any such misperception would be harmful to this institution and our country,\" he wrote in the student loans case in response to a stinging dissent by Justice Elena Kagan.\n\nRoberts has resisted instituting a code of ethics for the court and has questioned whether Congress has the authority to impose one. Still, he has said, without providing specifics, that the justices would do more to show they adhere to high ethical standards.\n\nSome conservative law professors rejected the idea that the court bowed to outside pressures, consciously or otherwise.\n\n\"There were a lot of external atmospherics that really could have affected court business, but didn't,\" said Jennifer Mascott, a George Mason University law professor.\n\nCurt Levey, president of the Committee for Justice, pointed to roughly equal numbers of major decisions that could be characterized as politically liberal or conservative.\n\nLevey said conservatives \"were not disappointed by this term.\" Democrats and their allies \"warned the nation about an ideologically extreme Supreme Court but wound up cheering as many major decisions as they decried,\" Levey wrote in an email.\n\nBut some liberal critics were not mollified.\n\nBrian Fallon, director of the court reform group Demand Justice, called the past year \"another disastrous Supreme Court term\" and mocked experts who \"squint to find so-called silver linings in the Court's decisions to suggest all is not lost, or they will emphasize one or two so-called moderate decisions from the term to suggest the Court is not as extreme as we think and can still be persuaded from time to time.\"\n\nBiden himself said on MSNBC on Thursday that the current court has \"done more to unravel basic rights and basic decisions than any court in recent history.\" He cited as examples the overturning of abortion protections and other decisions that had been precedent for decades.\n\nStill, Biden said, he thought some on the high court \"are beginning to realize their legitimacy is being questioned in ways it hasn't been questioned in the past.\"\n\nThe justices are now embarking on a long summer break. They return to the bench on the first Monday in October for a term that so far appears to lack the blockbuster cases that made the past two terms so momentous.\n\nThe court will examine the legal fallout from last year's major expansion of gun rights, in a case over a domestic violence gun ban that was struck down by a lower court.\n\nA new legal battle over abortion also could make its way to the court in coming months. In April, the court preserved access to mifepristone, a drug used in the most common method of abortion , while a lawsuit over it makes its way through federal court.\n\nThe conservative majority also will have opportunities to further constrain federal regulatory agencies, including a case that asks them to overturn the so-called Chevron decision that defers to regulators when they seek to give effect to big-picture, sometimes vague, laws written by Congress. The 1984 decision has been cited by judges more than 15,000 times.\n\nJust seven years ago, months before Trump's surprising presidential victory, then-Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg reflected on the term that had just ended and made two predictions. One was way off base and the other was strikingly accurate.\n\nIn July 2016, the court had just ended a term in which the justices upheld a University of Texas affirmative action plan and struck down state restrictions on abortion clinics.\n\nHer first prediction was that those issues would not soon return to the high court. Her second was that if Trump became president, \"everything is up for grabs.\"\n\nGinsburg's death in 2020 allowed Trump to put Justice Amy Coney Barrett on the court and cement conservative control.\n\nCommenting on the student loan decision, liberal legal scholar Melissa Murray wrote on Twitter that Biden's plan \"was absolutely undone by the Court that his predecessor built.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Paul Sancya)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court has sent shockwaves through higher education with a landmark decision that struck down affirmative action and left colleges across the nation searching for new ways to promote student diversity.\n\nLeaders of scores of universities said Thursday that they were disappointed by what they see as a blow to diversity. Yet many also voiced optimism that they would find new ways to admit more Black and Hispanic students, despite evidence that eliminating the practice often leads to steep enrollment decreases among them.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said he disagreed with the decision and asked the Education Department to explore policies that could help colleges build diverse student bodies. He also pushed against policies like legacy preferences - admissions boosts given to the children of alumni - that tend to help white, wealthy students.\n\n\"We should never allow the country to walk away from the dream upon which it was founded,\" Biden told reporters. \"We need a new path forward, a path consistent with the law that protects diversity and expands opportunity.\"\n\nYet evidence from states that previously outlawed affirmative action show it will be a daunting challenge.\n\nAs an alternative to affirmative action, colleges from California to Florida have tried a range of strategies to achieve the diversity they say is essential to their campuses. Many have given greater preference to low-income families. Others started admitting top students from every community in their state.\n\nBut years of experimentation - often prompted by state-level bans on considering race in admissions - left no clear solution. In states requiring race-neutral policies, many colleges saw enrollment drops among Black and Hispanic students, especially at selective colleges that historically have been mostly white.\n\nAt Amherst College, officials had estimated going entirely race-neutral would reduce Black, Hispanic and Indigenous populations by half.\n\n\"We fully expect it would be a significant decrease in our population,\" said Matthew McGann, Amherst's director of admission, earlier this year.\n\nFacing a conservative Supreme Court that appeared skeptical from the start, colleges have been preparing for a rollback. Some were considering adding more essays to get a better picture of an applicant's background, a strategy invited in Thursday's Supreme Court ruling.\n\n\"Nothing prohibits universities from considering an applicant's discussion of how race affected the applicant's life, so long as that discussion is concretely tied to a quality of character or unique ability that the particular applicant can contribute to the university,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the court's conservative majority.\n\nOther colleges were planning to boost recruiting in racially diverse areas, or admit more transfer students from community colleges .\n\nThe court took up affirmative action in response to challenges at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina . Lower courts upheld admission systems at both schools, rejecting claims that the schools discriminated against white and Asian American applicants. But at Supreme Court arguments in late October, all six conservative justices expressed doubts about the practice, which had been upheld under Supreme Court decisions reaching back to 1978, and as recently as 2016.\n\nNine states already have banned affirmative action , starting with California in 1996 and, most recently, Idaho in 2020.\n\nAfter Michigan voters rejected it in 2006, the University of Michigan shifted attention to low-income students.\n\nIt sent graduates to work as counselors in low-income high schools. It started offering college prep in Detroit and Grand Rapids. It offered full scholarships for low-income Michigan residents. More recently, it started accepting fewer early admission applications, which are more likely to come from white students.\n\nDespite those efforts, the share of Black and Hispanic undergraduates hasn't fully rebounded from a falloff after 2006. And while Hispanic enrollments have been increasing, Black enrollments continued to slide, going from 8% of undergraduates in 2006 to 4% now.\n\nThe campus is drawing more low-income students, but that hasn't translated to racial diversity, said Erica Sanders, director of undergraduate admissions at Michigan.\n\n\"Socioeconomic status is not a proxy for race,\" Sanders said.\n\nAt the same time, some of Michigan's less selective colleges have fared better. At nearby Eastern Michigan University, the number of students of color increased, reflecting demographic shifts in the state. It illustrates what experts say is a chilling effect seen most acutely at selective colleges - students of color see fewer of their peers at places like Ann Arbor, prompting them to choose campuses that appear more welcoming.\n\nGrowing up in Ann Arbor, there was an expectation that Odia Kaba would attend the University of Michigan. When her application was deferred, she started at Eastern Michigan with plans to transfer to Ann Arbor her sophomore year.\n\nBy then, Kaba was getting daily texts from her sister, who attended U-M, describing the microaggressions she faced as a Black student on campus. Rooms went silent when she walked in. She was ignored in group projects. She felt alone and suffocated.\n\n\"Why would I go to U of M?\" Kaba, 22, remembers thinking. \"I'm just going to be stuck with people that don't look like me, can't relate to me, and with no way to escape it.\"\n\nKaba stayed at Eastern Michigan and graduated with a degree in quantitative economics this year. Even though it's a mostly white campus, Kaba said she found pockets of diversity that helped make her comfortable.\n\n\"I'm in economics, which is a white male-dominated space. But I can walk out of the classroom and be surrounded by my people, and I just feel safe,\" she said.\n\nThe University of California also saw enrollment slides after a statewide ban in 1996. Within two years, Black and Hispanic enrollments fell by half at the system's two most selective campuses, Berkeley and UCLA. The system would go on to spend more than $500 million on programs aimed at low-income and first-generation college students.\n\nIt also started a program that promises admission to the top 9% of students in each high school across the state, an attempt to reach strong students from all backgrounds. A similar promise in Texas has been credited for expanding racial diversity, and opponents of affirmative action cite it as a successful model.\n\nIn California, the promise drew students from a wider geographic area but did little to expand racial diversity, the system said in a brief to the Supreme Court. It had almost no impact at Berkeley and UCLA, where students compete against tens of thousands of other applicants.\n\nToday at UCLA and Berkeley, Hispanic students make up 20% of undergraduates, higher than in 1996 but lower than their 53% share among California's high school graduates. Black students, meanwhile, have a smaller presence than they did in 1996, accounting for 2% of undergraduates at Berkeley.\n\nOpponents of affirmative action say some states have fared well without it. After Oklahoma outlawed the practice in 2012, the state's flagship university saw \"no long-term severe decline\" in minority enrollments, the state's attorney general told the Supreme Court.\n\nIt pointed to a recent freshman class at the University of Oklahoma that had more Hispanic, Asian and Native American students than in 2012. The share of Black students fell, but it wasn't far from flagship universities in other states that allow affirmative action, the state said.\n\nStill, many colleges expect racial diversity could take a hit. With affirmative action struck down, colleges fear they will unknowingly admit fewer students of color. In the long run, it can be self-perpetuating - if numbers fall, the campus can appear less attractive to future students of color.\n\nThat's a problem, colleges say, because racial diversity benefits the entire campus, exposing students to other worldviews and preparing them for a diverse workforce.\n\nBeyond race, the decision has the impact to reshape other admissions policies. To draw more underserved populations, experts say colleges may need to do away with policies that advantage white students, from legacy preferences and early admission to standardized test scores.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press education team receives support from the Carnegie Corporation of New York.

University of Texas at Austin affirmative action case. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Torn as ever over race, the Supreme Court on Wednesday weighed whether it's time to end the use of race in college admissions nationwide or at least at the University of Texas.\n\nWith liberal and conservative justices starkly divided, the justice who almost certainly will dictate the outcome suggested that the court may need still more information to make a decision in a Texas case already on its second trip through the Supreme Court.\n\n\"We're just arguing the same case,\" Justice Anthony Kennedy said, recalling arguments first held in 2012 in the case of Abigail Fisher. \"It's as if nothing has happened.\"\n\nKennedy said additional hearings may be needed to produce information that \"we should know but we don't know\" about how minority students are admitted and what classes they take to determine whether the use of race is necessary to increase diversity at the University of Texas.\n\nFisher has been out of college since 2012, but the justices' renewed interest in her case appeared to be a sign that the court's conservative majority is poised to cut back, or even end, affirmative action in higher education.\n\nTheir skepticism about it was on display during more than 90 minutes in a packed courtroom.\n\n\"What unique perspective does a minority student bring to a physics class?\" Chief Justice John Roberts asked at one point, challenging a part of Texas' argument that says its program is needed to increase diversity at the classroom level.\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia suggested it's possible that some black students would benefit from being at a \"slower-track school,\" instead of Texas' flagship campus in Austin, where some are \"being pushed ahead in classes that are too fast for them.\"\n\nBut it was not clear from the arguments whether Kennedy would go as far as his conservative colleagues to deal a blow to race as a factor in college admissions.\n\nPotentially complicating the outcome, Justice Elena Kagan is sitting out the case because she worked on it at an earlier stage at the Justice Department, before joining the court. Her absence creates the possibility of a 4-4 split. That would resolve the case in Texas' favor, but say nothing about the issue nationally. The other three liberal justices appeared solidly in favor of the Texas program.\n\nThe arguments focused on whether the university has compelling reasons to consider race among other factors when it evaluates applicants for about one-quarter of its freshman class. Most students are admitted to the university through a plan that guarantees slots to Texans who graduate in the top 10 percent of their high school classes.\n\nFisher says the \"top 10\" program works well to bring in Hispanic and African-American students, without considering race. Bert Rein, representing Fisher, said the university can take other steps to diversify its student body without explicit reference to race, including reducing its reliance on standardized test scores.\n\nBut Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who has said she benefited from affirmative action, said Rein was calling on Texas to take steps that would \"reduce its educational quality.\" Justice Clarence Thomas, an affirmative action opponent who has said he felt stigmatized by racial preferences, was customarily silent during the arguments.\n\nTexas says the \"top 10\" program alone is not enough and that the school needs the freedom to fill out incoming classes as it sees fit. Gregory Garre said on behalf of the university that minority enrollment plummeted at top public universities in California and Michigan after they ended the consideration of race.\n\n\"Now is not the time and this is not the case to roll back student-body diversity in America,\" Garre said.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito said the university is engaging in \"terrible stereotyping\" by suggesting there is something \"deficient about the African-American students and the Hispanic students who are admitted under the top 10 percent plan.\"\n\nTwelve years ago, the justices reaffirmed the consideration of race in the quest for diversity on campus. Their decision set a goal of doing away with such programs in 25 years.\n\n\"When do you think your program will be done?\" Roberts asked Garre, who would not provide a date.\n\nThe court first heard Fisher's case in 2012; the case ended inconclusively with a tepid decision that ordered a lower court review. The federal appeals court in New Orleans has twice upheld the Texas admissions program and rejected Fisher's appeal.\n\nFisher's case was conceived by Edward Blum, an opponent of racial preferences. Blum also is behind lawsuits against Harvard University and the University of North Carolina that aim to eliminate any consideration of race in college admissions.\n\nTexas is unique in marrying the top 10 plan to a separate admissions review in which race is one of many factors considered. The university's current freshman class is 22 percent Hispanic and 4.5 percent African-American. White students make up less than half the school's freshmen.\n\nEight states prohibit the use of race in public college admissions: Arizona, California, Florida, Michigan, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oklahoma and Washington.\n\nThe Obama administration, dozens of colleges and many of the nation's largest businesses support Texas in defending its program.\n\nThere also are competing arguments over whether racial preference programs actually limit the number of students from Asian backgrounds, who are disproportionately represented in student bodies relative to their share of the population.\n\nA decision in Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, 14-981, is expected by late June.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court on Thursday struck down affirmative action in college admissions, declaring race cannot be a factor and forcing institutions of higher education to look for new ways to achieve diverse student bodies.\n\nThe court's conservative majority effectively overturned cases reaching back 45 years in invalidating admissions plans at Harvard and the University of North Carolina, the nation's oldest private and public colleges, respectively.\n\nThe decision , like last year's momentous abortion ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade, marked the realization of a long-sought conservative legal goal, this time finding that race-conscious admissions plans violate the Constitution and a law that applies to colleges that receive federal funding, as almost all do.\n\nThose schools will be forced to reshape their admissions practices, especially top schools that are more likely to consider the race of applicants.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts said that for too long universities have \"concluded, wrongly, that the touchstone of an individual's identity is not challenges bested, skills built, or lessons learned but the color of their skin. Our constitutional history does not tolerate that choice.\"\n\nFrom the White House, President Joe Biden said he \"strongly, strongly\" disagreed with the court's ruling and urged colleges to seek other routes to diversity rather than let the ruling \"be the last word.\"\n\nBesides the conservative-liberal split, the fight over affirmative action showed the deep gulf between the three justices of color , each of whom wrote separately and vividly about race in America and where the decision might lead.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas - the nation's second Black justice, who had long called for an end to affirmative action - wrote that the decision \"sees the universities' admissions policies for what they are: rudderless, race-based preferences designed to ensure a particular racial mix in their entering classes.\"\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, the court's first Latina, wrote in dissent that the decision \"rolls back decades of precedent and momentous progress.\"\n\nBoth Thomas and Sotomayor, the two justices who have acknowledged affirmative action played a role in their admissions to college and law school, took the unusual step of reading summaries of their opinions aloud in the courtroom.\n\nIn a separate dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson - the court's first Black female justice - called the decision \"truly a tragedy for us all.\"\n\nJackson, who sat out the Harvard case because she had been a member of an advisory governing board, wrote, \"With let-them-eat-cake obliviousness, today, the majority pulls the ripcord and announces 'colorblindness for all' by legal fiat. But deeming race irrelevant in law does not make it so in life.\"\n\nThe vote was 6-3 in the North Carolina case and 6-2 in the Harvard case. Justice Elena Kagan was the other dissenter.\n\nThe Supreme Court has struck down affirmative action in college admissions, forcing institutions of higher education to look for new ways to achieve diverse student bodies. (June 29)\n\nBiden, who quickly stepped before cameras at the White House, said of the nation's colleges: \"They should not abandon their commitment to ensure student bodies of diverse backgrounds and experience that reflect all of America,\" He said colleges should evaluate \"adversity overcome\" by candidates.\n\nIn fact, an applicant for admission still can write about, and colleges can consider, \"how race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration or otherwise,\" Roberts wrote.\n\nBut the institutions \"may not simply establish through application essays or other means the regime we hold unlawful today,\" he wrote.\n\nPresidents of many colleges quickly issued statements affirming their commitment to diversity regardless of the court's decision. Many said they were still assessing the impact but would follow federal law.\n\n\"Harvard will continue to be a vibrant community whose members come from all walks of life, all over the world,\" school President Lawrence Bacow said in a statement.\n\nPresident Reginald DesRoches of Rice University in Houston said he was \"greatly disappointed\" by the decision but \"more resolute than ever\" to pursue diversity. \"The law may change, but Rice's commitment to diversity will not,\" he said in a campus message.\n\nFormer Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama offered starkly different takes on the high court ruling. The decision marked \"a great day for America. People with extraordinary ability and everything else necessary for success, including future greatness for our Country, are finally being rewarded,\" Trump, the current Republican presidential frontrunner, wrote on his social media network.\n\nObama said in a statement that affirmative action \"allowed generations of students like Michelle and me to prove we belonged. Now it's up to all of us to give young people the opportunities they deserve - and help students everywhere benefit from new perspectives.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court had twice upheld race-conscious college admissions programs in the past 20 years, including as recently as 2016.\n\nBut that was before the three Trump appointees joined the court. At arguments in late October , all six conservative justices expressed doubts about the practice, which had been upheld under Supreme Court decisions reaching back to 1978.\n\nLower courts also had upheld the programs at both UNC and Harvard, rejecting claims that the schools discriminated against white and Asian American applicants.\n\nThe college admissions disputes were among several high-profile cases focused on race in America, and were weighed by the conservative-dominated, but most diverse court ever. Among the nine justices are four women, two Black people and a Latina.\n\nThe justices earlier in June decided a voting rights case in favor of Black voters in Alabama and rejected a race-based challenge to a Native American child protection law .\n\nThe affirmative action cases were brought by conservative activist Edward Blum, who also was behind an earlier challenge against the University of Texas as well as the case that led the court in 2013 to end use of a key provision of the landmark Voting Rights Act.\n\nBlum formed Students for Fair Admissions, which filed the lawsuits against both schools in 2014.\n\nThe group argued that the Constitution forbids the use of race in college admissions and called for overturning earlier Supreme Court decisions that said otherwise.\n\nRoberts' opinion effectively did so, both Thomas and the dissenters wrote.\n\nThe only institutions of higher education explicitly left out of the ruling were the nation's military academies, Roberts wrote, suggesting that national security interests could affect the legal analysis.\n\nBlum's group had contended that colleges and universities can use other, race-neutral ways to assemble a diverse student body, including by focusing on socioeconomic status and eliminating the preference for children of alumni and major donors.\n\nThe schools said that they use race in a limited way, but that eliminating it as a factor altogether would make it much harder to achieve a student body that looks like America.\n\nAt the eight Ivy League universities, the number of nonwhite students increased from 27% in 2010 to 35% in 2021, according to federal data. Those men and women include Asian, Black, Hispanic, Native American, Pacific Islander and biracial students.\n\nNine states already prohibit any consideration of race in admissions to their public colleges and universities. The end of affirmative action in higher education in California, Michigan, Washington state and elsewhere led to a steep drop in minority enrollment in those states' leading public universities .\n\nThe other states are: Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Nebraska, New Hampshire and Oklahoma.\n\nIn 2020, California voters easily rejected a ballot measure to bring back affirmative action.\n\nA poll last month by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research showed 63% of U.S. adults say the court should allow colleges to consider race as part of the admissions process, yet few believe students' race should ultimately play a major role in decisions. A Pew Research Center survey released last week found that half of Americans disapprove of considerations of applicants' race, while a third approve.\n\nThe chief justice and Jackson received their undergraduate and law degrees from Harvard. Two other justices, Neil Gorsuch and Kagan, went to law school there, and Kagan was the first woman to serve as the law school's dean.\n\nEvery U.S. college and university the justices attended, save one, urged the court to preserve race-conscious admissions.\n\nThose schools - Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Notre Dame and Holy Cross - joined briefs in defense of Harvard's and UNC's admissions plans.\n\nOnly Justice Amy Coney Barrett's undergraduate alma mater, Rhodes College, in Memphis, Tennessee, was not involved in the cases.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Collin Binkley contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "The Failure of Affirmative Action\n\nFor the Black poor, a world without affirmative action is just the world as it is-no different than before.\n\nMost of my colleagues are college-educated. I am often the only product of felons, addicts, and foster care whom my peers have encountered outside of time spent volunteering in homeless shelters and group homes. Over the years, whenever affirmative action in higher education has come under threat, these folks have offered their sympathies. They believe that I-a child of a Black father and white mother who grew up in poverty and instability-feel the attacks more acutely. Most Americans seem to think affirmative action sits at the foundation of some beneficent suite of education policies that do something significant for poor Black kids, and that would disappear without the sanction of affirmative action. But the reality is that for the Black poor, a world without affirmative action is just the world as it is-no different than before.\n\nIn 2012, 6 percent of Harvard's freshmen identified as Black. At the time, Black Americans made up 14 percent of the population and 15 percent of the country's young adults. Harvard was then a far cry from racial parity. But in just three years, the university increased the number of Black freshmen by 50 percent . By 2020, The Harvard Crimson was reporting that more than 15 percent of incoming freshmen were Black, which meant the university had acquired perfect representation. This progress-Black progress-appears poised to recede with the expected loss of affirmative action due to the Supreme Court's coming decisions on the Students for Fair Admissions v. President and Fellows of Harvard College and Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina cases. But to endure a loss, one must have first enjoyed a gain. Diversity at Harvard was not the result of some intricate system for sourcing talent from the whole of Black America. With the permissions granted in 1978's Regents of the University of California v. Bakke , Harvard used race-conscious admissions to saturate itself with students drawn from the highest-earning segments of Black America.\n\nFrom the September 2021 issue: This is the end of affirmative action\n\nThe same year that Harvard achieved perfect Black representation, a group of celebrated economists published a study examining income segregation across America's colleges.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2004, the years examined by the study, about 16 to 18 percent of American children were living below the federal poverty line . Families living below the FPL struggle to afford enough food, clothing, or shelter to stave off biological decline. In the absence of income segregation, children from poverty would make up a proportional 16 to 18 percent of college students. But according to the study, only 3 percent of the students at Harvard in that time period came from families in the bottom 20 percent. (The researchers later found that the percentage had increased to about 5 percent for a cohort of students at Harvard from 2008 to 2013.)\n\nIn October of 2020, Harvard reported 154 Black first-year students. Given that the child-poverty rate in Black America hovers north of 30 percent , in an equitable society, some 40 Black freshmen would have come from poor families. The income-segregation study did not disaggregate income brackets by race, and neither does Harvard, but the university does disclose that about a quarter of its latest freshman class comes from families with incomes below $85,000, its threshold for full financial aid. This is far above the federal poverty line and therefore not a good indicator of how many poor students attend Harvard. But if we extrapolate the study's findings, only seven or eight of said 154 Black freshmen would have come from poor families. The other 140 or so Black students at Harvard were likely raised outside of poverty and probably as far from the bottom as any Black child can hope to be.\n\nWriting in the American Journal of Education in 2007 , the Princeton sociology professor Douglas Massey observed that 40 percent of Black students in the Ivy League were first- or second-generation immigrants. Black immigrants are the highest-earning and best-educated subset of Black America.\n\nThe Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., a director of the university's African American-studies center, once estimated that as many as two-thirds of Harvard's Black students in the early 2000s were the fortunate sons and daughters of Black immigrants or, to a lesser extent, children of biracial couples. A Black woman who was a Harvard senior at the time told The New York Times in 2004 that there were so few other Black students whose grandparents had been born in the U.S. that they had begun calling themselves \"the descendants.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court affirmed race to be an acceptable criterion within a holistic admissions framework in 1978. The regime described here persisted for 45 years without manifesting any progress of note for the Black poor, and it strains faith to imagine that the trickle-down was on its way in year 46. The coming eulogies for affirmative action should acknowledge this history. No policy that hesitates to say class prioritizes the impoverished, and the people we do nothing for should at least enjoy public acknowledgment of their abandonment.\n\nWhen I was in elementary school, my grandmother told me that I would go to college for free because I was Native American. I'm not Native. Rather, my father is from a light-skinned Black family, and for a long time, families like these presented sharp cheekbones and aquiline noses as evidence of Native roots. In nearly every case, it was plain white ancestry, but Black folks had been denied the supposed dignity of whiteness for so long that even those who had it did not want it. My dad told the Native fiction to my mom, and she told my grandmother, who was white working poor, and her fictions met with my father's. Like many in her class, she believed that the government was in the business of giving gifts to everyone but poor whites. In her view, the world worked like this: Asian Americans received loans to start businesses. Hospitals gave free medical care to Hispanic children. Native Americans enjoyed juiced-up welfare and free college. Black Americans received preferential hiring and a free education. Because she believed me to be both Black and Native, college appeared to be a given.\n\nMy grandmother's understanding of how college entry worked for Black Americans was shaped by decades of white-poor hearsay about affirmative action. She had no Black friends; ethnic gossip and popular culture were all she had to go on, and these gave her a wildly inaccurate view of what was to be my college experience. But I have found that even wealthier and more sophisticated Americans have absorbed similar fictions.\n\nAccording to The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education , out of 153,000 Black test-takers in 2005, only about 1,200 scored a 700 or above on either section of the SAT. I was among that handful. Unlike the stories my grandmother told me, a red carpet wasn't rolled out in front of me. The guidance counselor at my New Jersey public high school said nothing about my test scores and was similarly apathetic when I said I was not going to apply to college at all. When I came back a week later to recant after my father threatened to throw me out on the streets if I didn't apply, my counselor-rather than hand me a blank check from the office of affirmative action-handed me a thin packet about the Free Application for Federal Student Aid.\n\nDrew Gilpin Faust: The blindness of 'color-blindness'\n\nBeing a former foster youth with a missing mother and a father only just released from prison, I was legally eligible for quite a bit of aid via the FAFSA. But without legal documentation of my situation, which no adult around me had kept, acquiring that aid would require me to obtain signed statements from members of the community testifying to my fractured living conditions. As a transient youth suddenly crashing with a father I had known for barely two years and residing in an entirely new town, there was no community to vouch for me. Unable to meet the federal requirements, I slogged through an associate's, a bachelor's, and eventually a master's degree, accruing substantial loans despite eligibility for grants that could have paid for my entire undergraduate education.\n\nSince 2018, I have used what I learned (albeit too late) to help my foster sister navigate college and the FAFSA, which must be renewed every year (including resubmitting community testimony on official letterhead). On more than one occasion, she has been selected for \"additional verification,\" one of several variations of bureaucratic rigmarole that can result in the delay of aid long enough to force lower-income students to miss a semester if they cannot afford to pay tuition out of pocket. Even when you're prepared for this, as she and I were, the delay is demoralizing.\n\nEvery poor kid with aspirations of college faces a slightly different constellation of obstacles, but those differences abate beneath a homogenous disappointment. The National Center for Education Statistics found that, in 2012, just 14 percent of low-income high-school students  obtained a bachelor's or higher degree within eight years of high-school graduation. Rates of college attendance specifically among Black youth and kids below the federal poverty line-the lowest of low-income-are lower still. Given that the rate for foster or homeless youth is a meager 2 to 11 percent, it's safe to assume that the one for Black fosters is effectively zero. Meanwhile, compiling data scattered across publications, I've calculated that 85 percent of bachelor's degrees awarded to Black students go to Black folks raised in the middle and upper classes. For daily life, the result is this: In any office-in any room-where a bachelor's degree is a prerequisite, the odds that the person next to you has come from poverty, especially Black poverty, are staggeringly low.\n\nAffirmative-action policies are not directly responsible for the impediments that poor Black students face in higher education. Nevertheless, those policies have existed for nearly five decades and have demonstrably not been an obstacle to the formation of a status quo in which so few poor Black Americans obtain a bachelor's degree. Although that might be viewed as a policy failure, the oral arguments in the Supreme Court cases make this much clear: Affirmative action is not intended to combat the barriers faced by the poor, Black or otherwise. It is meant to achieve racial diversity. Where it finds the bodies does not matter.\n\nIn the case of Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College , all parties involved-the justices, the petitioners, and the respondents-agree that the intention of affirmative action is to produce the \"educational benefits of diversity.\" As described by Seth Waxman, the respondent on behalf of Harvard, \"a university student body comprising a multiplicity of backgrounds, experiences, and interests vitally benefits our nation. Stereotypes are broken down, prejudice is reduced, and critical thinking and problem-solving skills are improved.\" The contention of Students for Fair Admissions is that Harvard could use other metrics, particularly socioeconomic status, to achieve educationally significant diversity without the need for racial considerations.\n\nIn response to the SFFA plan, Justice Sonia Sotomayor suggested that weighting factors such as class in admissions amounts to \"subterfuges\" for reaching some sort of \"diversity in race.\" She probed the lawyers in oral arguments by saying that she did not \"understand why considering race as one factor but not the sole factor is any different than using any of those other metrics.\" The view that Sotomayor lays out here asserts that considering income and wealth, or considering them in conjunction with race, is just a tedious path to the same outcome achieved by considering race alone. But of course, an admissions scheme that considers class would not just be a subterfuge. Even if it yielded a student body with the same degree of racial diversity, the students themselves would be very different.\n\nMany Americans retain a certain dissonance about class, believing simultaneously that it does and does not matter. Would a classroom with one Black student who was raised by parents who met while studying business at Yale benefit from the added diversity of a Black student who was raised in the Cuney Homes projects that produced George Floyd? You would be hard-pressed to find someone who answers no, and it is doubtful that Sotomayor would either. But the only way to promote the admission of these two hypothetical Black students is with policies that recognize both class and race. Unfortunately, conversations about diversity too often focus solely on the gaps between Black and white Americans, excluding entirely the issue of class divides among Black Americans.\n\nKimberly Reyes: Affirmative action shouldn't be about diversity\n\nIn 2018, William Julius Wilson-a survivor of Jim Crow and a pioneer in the study of urban poverty- reported that Black Americans had the highest degree of residential income segregation of any racial group: Our top and bottom classes were then the least likely to live alongside each other. That same year, the Pew Research Center released a study on income inequality within races. From 1970 to 2016, the top 10 percent of Black workers earned nearly 10 times what the bottom 10 percent of Black workers did. For nearly 50 years, Black Americans experienced more income disparity than any other racial group in the country. The report received widespread coverage, including in The Atlantic , but mainly for its findings regarding Asian Americans, who had ( temporarily ) displaced Black Americans as the least equal group.\n\nI can only cheer on, and envy, the speed at which knowledge of class disparities among Asian Americans has permeated popular culture. I hope it continues, because the Asian parity that Harvard has achieved is certainly not the result of admitting impoverished Burmese Americans. In the time since the 2018 Pew study was released, we have seen not just class-focused journalism but Always Be My Maybe , Everything Everywhere All at Once , and Beef . Each pop-cultural work demonstrates not just that class exists for Asians, but that it drastically alters their lives, their opportunities, and their interactions in ways that- shockingly- mirror how class affects white Americans.\n\nThat no similar awareness is growing on behalf of disparities afflicting Black Americans is absurd. The fact that the white upper class had a median wealth more than 20 times that of the white poor helped fuel Occupy Wall Street, Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and a socialist revival among white youth that continues today. In 2015, the Black upper class had a median wealth 1,382 times greater than the Black poor, along with an incarceration rate nearly 10 times lower than what I inherited. Yet still, some of the best-educated minds in the country claim to not understand how taking this into consideration might yield a qualitatively different student body than what comes from treating Black Americans as a class-free blob.\n\nPowerful as they may be, elite institutions require support from the ground up. The social prestige that achieving racial diversity offers and the ability it has to smooth over the appearance of other inequities are too alluring for a university like Harvard to pass up. But, rich as it is, Harvard does not have the capital necessary to employ all of the country's poor, fix their neighborhoods, and fund their public schools, or the willingness to wait an entire generation for those social changes to generate a cohort of low-income children who are nevertheless academically excellent. It will always be cheaper and more expedient to simply recruit wealthy kids instead. If what comes after affirmative action penalizes the Black middle and upper classes, that is nothing to celebrate. But if we want to erect something that benefits all Black Americans, we cannot expect that to happen without policies that treat class as meaningful."

      "text": "The Harvard Case Is About the Future of Affirmative Action\n\nOne day before Harvard goes to court to defend its admissions practices, two warring rallies made clear that the trial is about much more than just the university.\n\nCAMBRIDGE, Mass. - On Wednesday, the newly minted Harvard president Lawrence Bacow delivered a sober message to the campus community. In less than a week, he said, Harvard would be heading to federal court to defend its use of race in admissions. \"This lawsuit has the potential to create divisions on our campus and in our broader alumni community,\" he wrote. And on a brisk Sunday here, those divisions were remarkably clear.\n\nOne day before the start of the trial, two warring rallies revealed the deep fissures in the Asian American community over affirmative action. Supporters of Harvard's race-conscious admissions practices-mostly students-began arriving at Harvard Square early Sunday morning. They grabbed prepared signs from a box, hung banners, and slipped on light blue shirts. The message was consistent: \"Defend diversity.\"\n\nIt was important that they made their voices heard, they argued, because this is bigger than Harvard. And they aren't wrong. This case, the latest in a string of challenges to affirmative action, seems poised to make it all the way to the Supreme Court, and could fundamentally change if and how race can be considered in admissions. The Supreme Court has upheld race-based affirmative action several times over the past 40 years, but as the court has lurched to the right with the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh, the future of the practice is more imperiled now than at any time in recent memory.\n\nRead: The Supreme Court Justice who forever changed affirmative action\n\nStarting today in federal district court, lawyers for a coalition of Asian American students, brought together by the conservative legal strategist Edward Blum and his group. Students for Fair Admissions, will argue that Harvard unfairly caps the number of Asian American students it admits in order to boost the enrollment of other racial groups. It will also argue that the college has not considered alternative strategies to diversify its campus.\n\nBlum has made a career of challenging race-specific policies. He previously spearheaded a case against affirmative-action practices at the University of Texas at Austin, and before that, he instigated Shelby County v. Holder , the landmark case from 2013 that nullified pieces of the Voting Rights Act. Several students at the rally were aware of Blum and his litigious past, arguing that he is using Asian Americans as a cudgel to advance a personal agenda of ending affirmative action in higher education.\n\nThe lion's share of students who had gathered in Harvard Square were themselves Asian American-including students and recent graduates who will testify in support of the university in court. That includes Thang Q. Diep, a senior who submitted portions of his admissions file to the court in an effort to bolster Harvard's case.\n\n\"As an Asian American, I do not believe that Harvard's race conscious admissions policy hurt me,\" Diep wrote in a statement to the court. \"I disclosed my race and I did not have stellar grades, but I was accepted to Harvard most likely based on my personal statement, which reflected the diversity that I brought to campus.\"\n\nAnd on Sunday, he forcefully declared why he was standing up for Harvard. \"My stance on affirmative action is a general reminder to the rest of America-and especially to Edward Blum,\" he said to a chorus of cheers, \"that I, along with so many other Asian Americans, refuse to be tools of white supremacy, and that we stand in alliance with all communities of color.\"\n\nDiep's argument is one that has resonated with Asian Americans: According to a survey by AAPI Data, nearly two-thirds of Asian Americans support affirmative-action policies. Yet specifically among Chinese Americans, support for the practice is substantially lower.  And some three miles away, across the Charles River, another group-dominated largely by Chinese Americans-voiced their displeasure with Harvard's policies.\n\nUnlike the student rally, that event, held in front of the historic Trinity Church, had the markings of a professionally produced rally, such as a surround-sound speaker system, an elevated stage, and metal barriers. And rather than the signs and shirts vowing to \"defend diversity,\" this rally featured placards decrying affirmative action. \"Discrimination in the name of diversity is wrong\" was the motto of the gathering, jointly hosted by the Asian American Coalition for Education, or AACE, and Students for Fair Admissions.\n\nYukong Zhao, the president of AACE, boasted during his speech to a crowd of roughly 250 people that the litigation is sending a message to other schools. \"If you don't stop your discrimination,\" Zhao said, \"we will file civil-rights complaints against you, we will take you to trial.\"\n\nThere were notably fewer students at the latter rally. Kelley Babphavong, a junior at Harvard, was a notable exception. Babphavong, whose parents are from Laos, and who spoke at the anti-affirmative-action rally, believes that the Asian American students supporting Harvard aren't considering the other possible alternatives to race-conscious admissions, such as class-based preferences. (Students for Fair Admissions has enlisted Richard Kahlenberg, a policy analyst at the Century Foundation, a left-leaning think tank, to make this point in court.)\n\nRead: The era of affirmative action may not last much longer\n\nBut there are doubts that tipping the scales in favor of socioeconomic diversity will do anything to racially diversify a campus, for a simple reason. As Sue Dynarski, an economist at the University of Michigan, put it , \"Most poor people are white. Putting a thumb on the scale for low-income students will help far more white students than black or Hispanic students.\"\n\nThe dueling rallies on Sunday revved up both sides for the three-week-long battle over Harvard's admissions practices. \"We're not at war with Harvard, we're not at war with higher education,\" Blum told me. But still, how the case plays out in court could ultimately have major ramifications for whether colleges in places far away from Cambridge will continue to consider race in admissions."

      "text": "How Affirmative Action Won the Day\n\nIn a 4-3 ruling on a case almost a decade in the making, the Supreme Court ruled that colleges can factor in race in admissions decisions.\n\nThe Supreme Court Thursday bid a surprisingly firm farewell to Abigail Fisher. Whatever the next chapter in the saga of affirmative action in higher education admissions, this peculiarly persistent plaintiff will not write it.\n\nFisher's campaign against affirmative action-which has lasted nearly a decade and occupied the Court's docket not once but twice-ended in substantial defeat. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for a four-Justice majority in Thursday's decision, Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin. For the first time in his judicial career, Kennedy gave his approval to a race-based affirmative-action program. And he did so in an opinion that clearly reaffirmed the constitutional rationale for such programs first enunciated by Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. in the 1978 case of Regents of University of California v. Bakke and reaffirmed by the court majority in the 2003 case of Grutter v. Bollinger .\n\nThursday's decision was only 4-3. Justice Elena Kagan, whose office participated in the case when she was Solicitor General, recused herself. Justice Antonin Scalia left little doubt how he felt at oral argument in December (African American students, he suggested, belonged at \"lesser schools\" than UT). But Scalia died in February, and the case was decided by the seven remaining justices. Kennedy was joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, and Sonia Sotomayor. Justice Samuel Alito wrote a sharp dissent, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Clarence Thomas. Thomas in a one-page dissent reaffirmed his conviction that all affirmative action is unconstitutional.\n\nKennedy was careful to clothe his opinion in narrow language that appeared to leave larger questions open. Thus, a nine-justice court (if such a unicorn is ever found in the wild) might one day reconsider the issue.\n\nBut Kennedy has now placed himself firmly in the Powell-O'Connor camp; he has bought the principle behind previous affirmative-action cases.\n\nTo begin with, it seems to have finally dawned on Kennedy that Fisher's rejection by the University of Texas is no longer a live question. Wearily, he described the case as \"a suit that has already persisted for eight years and cost the parties on both sides significant resources.\" Fisher, he noted, \"long since has graduated from another college, and the University's policy . . . may have evolved or changed in material ways\" since her rejection.\n\nThe rest of the opinion methodically refuted Fisher's arguments against affirmative action. There is no Kennedy-esque paean to the nation's greatness; but it is a careful refutation of arguments that have, to me at least, seemed grossly flawed from the beginning of the case.\n\nThe University's plan was unconstitutional, Fisher argued, because it seeks to enroll a \"critical mass\" or minority students, but does not \"set forth more precisely the level of minority enrollment\" that \"critical mass\" would require. This argument has a dreamlike, Alice in Wonderland elegance. Kennedy noted what should have been obvious: Fisher wanted the court to strike down the program for lack of a number, and if the university gave a number, the court would also be obligated to strike it down as a numerical quota. \"Since the University is prohibited from seeking a particular number or quota of minority students, it cannot be faulted for failing to specify the particular level of minority enrollment\" that would fulfill its goal. Critical mass, Kennedy said, cannot be \" elusory or amorphous\"-it must consist of \"concrete and precise goals.\" But here, Kennedy wrote, UT had done exactly that, in its initial proposal, the year-long educational study that preceded it, and its continuing monitoring of the program.\n\nFisher's also argued that only a relatively few students were affected by the race-conscious admissions program; because of this \"minimal impact,\" she argued, \"considering race was not necessary,\" and thus the program was not \"narrowly tailored.\" This argument is designed to burrow inside the rationale for affirmative action and explode it from the inside. If a program is unconstitutional because it only uses race a little, could it really become constitutional by using race a lot? Of course not; the court's precedents make clear that the bigger the role race plays in an admissions system, the more suspect the system will be. \"[I]t is not a failure of narrow tailoring for the impact of racial consideration to be minor,\" Kennedy wrote. \"The fact that race consciousness played a role in only a small portion of admissions decisions should be a hallmark of narrow tailoring, not evidence of unconstitutionality.\"\n\nFisher also argued that UT has already achieved a \"critical mass\" of minority students. That's because the Texas legislature in 1998 adopted the \"top 10 percent\" plan, which guarantees admission to a UT school to any Texas student who graduates from a public high school in the top 10 percent of the class. Because Texas school districts are very racially segregated, that program produced a surge of minority enrollment. That diversity gain was the aim of the program, though by its terms it is \"race-neutral.\"\n\nThis argument, in effect, asked the court to set a kind of constitutional ceiling to the number of minority students a school can seek to enroll. This the Court refused to do. Instead, Kennedy noted that the university had studied how the 10 percent plan had affected campus atmosphere, and the degree to which some minority students in some of the institution's schools still felt, and were, isolated in their field of study. \"At no stage in this litigation has petitioner challenged the University's good faith in conducting its studies,\" he wrote with some asperity-aiming both at Fisher and her lawyers and at Alito's dissent, which alleged the university was unworthy of trust.\n\nThis \"good-faith\" statement-echoed elsewhere in the opinion-is crucial. Opponents of affirmative action have argued for years that educational administrators cannot be trusted to use race, because they will employ hidden quotas. The Court remanded Fisher to the Court of Appeals with instructions to look closely at the university's chosen means of achieving its diversity goals. The lower court approved those means, and Thursday the Supreme Court did as well. Kennedy included stern language about the need for universities to provide reasons and data, and lower courts to review them; but the import of the decision echoes Bakke and Grutter-universities know their business better than courts. \"Once . . . a university gives 'a reasoned, principled explanation' for its decision,\" Kennedy wrote, \"deference must be given to its conclusions.\"\n\nFinally, Fisher argued that, if UT wants more diversity, it should just expand the 10 percent plan. But, Kennedy wrote, \"to compel universities to admit students based on class rank alone is in deep tension with the goal of educational diversity as this court's cases have defined it.\"\n\nProperly read, the majority opinion tells lower courts to give significant weight to the opinions of educational administrators. It is an important practical result, because it reduces the burden they must carry to justify a program. And it is precisely this result that Justice Alito targeted in his dissent-a fact-heavy argument that weighs in at 50 pages, two and a half times the length of the majority opinion. The central thread of the dissent is that courts shouldn't defer at all to educational administrators-and especially not those at UT: \"The majority's willingness to cite UT's 'good faith,'\" he wrote, \"is particularly inappropriate in light of UT's well-documented absence of good faith.\" Alito echoed Fisher's argument that the University had simply decided it wanted a race-based plan and created one without any facts to back it up. It is again the argument that without numerical goals and precise tracking of racial numbers, an affirmative-action plan can't be judged at all.\n\nAs for deference, Alito regards the university as a cesspool of corruption; he cited, among other evidence, investigative reports that UT had a \"clandestine admissions program\" that favored the children of \"politically connected individuals,\" and that officials tried to cover that up. The relevance of that scandal to the Fisher case, however, is, to borrow Kennedy's word, \"elusory,\" except to suggest that as a matter of law these are people of thoroughly bad character. Kennedy's opinion dismissed \"the extrarecord materials the dissent relies upon, many of which are tangential to this case at best.\"\n\nFisher v. University of Texas will not end the legal battle over affirmative action in higher education. This fall, the voters will decide roughly which of two directions the post-Scalia court will take; one of those roads leads eventually to the overthrow of all race-conscious programs. But Kennedy's opinion makes that goal, for the moment, significantly more distant."

      "text": "Justice Jackson's Crucial Argument About Affirmative Action\n\nThe Court's newest member wanted to know what fairness looks like if you take race out of the equation.\n\nYesterday, an hour and a half into the marathon hearings about whether colleges can use race as a factor in admissions decisions, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson began to rub her temples as she looked down at her notes.\n\n\"We're entertaining a rule where some people can say what they want about who they are and have that valued in a system,\" she said. \"And I'm worried that that creates an inequity in the system with respect to being able to express our identity.\" Black and Latino applicants would be limited if they can't express their race in the selection process, she said. She almost laughed with exasperation. \"Is that a crazy worry or is that something I should be thinking about and concerned about?\"\n\nIn previous arguments this term, Jackson was a forceful voice on issues of racial discrimination and the intent of the constitutional amendments designed to protect against it. For many in favor of race-conscious admissions, she has been a welcome presence on the Court, asking, in a way, the question at the center of the cases: Have less than 50 years of affirmative action put enough of a dent in the inequality fostered over more than two centuries of racial discrimination in higher education to merit eliminating the practice?\n\nFrom the September 2021 issue: This is the end of affirmative action\n\nFor roughly five hours, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in cases of Students for Fair Admissions, a coalition of unnamed Asian American students brought together by the conservative legal strategist Edward Blum, against the University of North Carolina and Harvard. If the cases are successful and the justices side with SFFA-which a majority of the justices seemed quite open to in their questioning yesterday-the decision would overturn the precedent established in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke in 1978, which has been upheld for more than 40 years. Because of her previous tenure on Harvard's Board of Overseers, Jackson recused herself from the Harvard case and sat for only the UNC case. But she did not waste the time she had.\n\nAlthough relatively few colleges are selective enough to have reason to consider race in admitting students, there is significant evidence about what happens at those schools when such programs go away. Michigan and California, for example, saw precipitous declines in Black enrollment at their flagship campuses after those states banned the practice. (By SFFA's own estimates, described during oral argument, Black enrollment at Harvard would fall from 14 to 10 percent without affirmative action.) In some ways, that's the backdrop to Jackson's questions. She was driving toward a fundamental statement about what the programs are for: Race-conscious admissions are designed to help students get into college, not to exclude students as a result of their existence.\n\nJackson's point is well worn. In 1978, during the oral arguments in the Bakke case, Justice Thurgood Marshall identified it. In an exchange where he prodded Reynold Colvin, who argued for the plaintiff, Allan Bakke, Marshall pointed out, \"You're arguing about keeping somebody out and the other side is arguing about getting somebody in.\" Colvin agreed. \"So, it depends on which way you look at it, doesn't it?\"\n\nOnce again, Colvin agreed. \"It depends on which way you look at the problem,\" Colvin said.\n\nMarshall's voice changed. \"It does?\" he said, with a rise in inflection.\n\n\"The problem-\" Colvin began to say before Marshall cut him off.\n\n\"It does?\" Marshall said, frustrating Colvin. \"You're talking about your client's rights; don't these underprivileged people have rights too?\"\n\nYesterday, Jackson was less direct, but no less potent, in an exchange with Patrick Strawbridge, the lawyer for SFFA. She offered a hypothetical to emphasize her point. There are two applicants who would like their family backgrounds recognized. One writes that their family has been in North Carolina since before the Civil War, and that if they were admitted to the university, they would be a fifth-generation student there. The other student is also a North Carolinian whose family has been in the state since before the Civil War-but their ancestors were enslaved and, because of years of systemic discrimination, were not allowed to attend the university. But now that they have the opportunity, they would like to attend. \"As I understand your no-race-conscious-admissions rule, these two applicants would have a dramatically different opportunity to tell their family stories and to have them count.\" Both applicants were qualified, Jackson offered, but the first applicant's qualifications could be recognized in the process, whereas \"the second one wouldn't be able to [get credit for those qualifications] because his story is in many ways bound up with his race and the race of his ancestors.\"\n\nLee C. Bollinger and Geoffrey R. Stone: The end of affirmative action would be a disaster\n\nStrawbridge thought for a moment, then offered that UNC does not have to give a legacy benefit to the first applicant if it doesn't want to. This is true, but it was not Jackson's point: \"No, but you said it was okay if they gave a legacy benefit.\" Race, she said, would be the only thing that couldn't be considered under that program. And that would disadvantage the Black student who, in a similar set of circumstances, wants \"the fact that he has been in North Carolina for generations through his family\" considered.\n\nIn a day filled with questions about the meaning of \"true diversity\" or the educational benefits of diversity, Jackson's questions cut through the muck. Some students had historically been denied access to some of the nation's most well-resourced institutions of higher education-feeder campuses for prominent roles throughout society-because of their race. If SFFA wins, that fact will be one of the only things a university cannot consider in its admissions process, as though that history never happened-as though the system is fair enough already."

      "text": "Asian Americans and the Future of Affirmative Action\n\nThe way members of the 'model minority' are treated in elite-college admissions could affect race-based standards moving forward.\n\nIn his new book, Earning Admission: Real Strategies for Getting Into Highly Selective Colleges, the strategist Greg Kaplan urges Asians not to identify as such on their applications. \"Your child should decline to state her background if she identifies with a group that is overrepresented on campus even if her name suggests affiliation,\" he advises parents, also referencing Jews. Such tips are increasingly common in the college-advising world; it's not unusual for consultants, according to The Boston Globe, to urge students to \"deemphasize the Asianness\" in their resumes or avoid writing application essays about their immigrant parents \"coming from Vietnam with $2 in a rickety boat and swimming away from sharks.\"\n\nIt's sad that this is what elite-college admissions have come to: a soul-deadening process that encourages students to distort their identities solely for the sake of getting in. But the rampant racism to which these pointers allude, if real, is even sadder. According to some activists, brilliant, accomplished, and well-rounded Asian students are consigned to gaming a system that's rigged against them. Either that, or they have to prove themselves extra brilliant, extra accomplished, and extra well-rounded to ensure they're on equal footing with non-Asian applicants. The premise is that affirmative action enables colleges and universities to discriminate against Asian applicants simply because there are so many of them on campus already.\n\nSome Asian Americans have had a beef with race-conscious admissions for decades. Traditionally one of affirmative action's biggest beneficiaries-so much so that the practice originally contributed to their reputation as the \"model minority\"-Asian Americans started to turn against it once they were no longer considered underrepresented. They've since been inundated with stories about prodigiously accomplished Asians being rejected from top schools . Today, they've in many ways become the face of the anti-affirmative action movement.\n\nLast Thursday, the Supreme Court upheld the race-conscious admissions policy at the University of Texas at Austin, a decision many observers described as \" a victory for affirmative action .\" For many Asian Americans who would like the admissions process to be more colorblind, though, the fight is far from over. Fisher v. The University of Texas at Austin , they argue , only scraped the surface of a much deeper, much more insidious problem: the exclusion of deserving Asian Americans from higher education.\n\nBut it's far from clear that race-conscious admissions policies actually put the so-called \"model minority\" at a disadvantage. Nor is it clear that Asians and affirmative action are the foes that the headlines and lawsuits and petitions make them out to be.\n\nCalifornia has prohibited affirmative action at public institutions for two decades, and the ban certainly hasn't hurt Asian Americans, who today account for a plurality -about a third-of the students at University of California schools despite making up just 15 percent of the state's population. But when the state senate introduced a Democrat-backed amendment that would've asked voters whether to lift the ban, Asian Americans staged public demonstrations and wrote blistering editorials; they hosted a Republican-registration drive (\"to scare the Democratic Party\") and gathered on TV talk shows to warn viewers of the proposal's implications.\n\n\"This is the most racist bill ever,\" said a participant on one such show. \"We come from a faraway land, China, and [we came] here to pursue fairness, equal education opportunities. Education is an essence and a core value of our culture, and we pass it along to generations and generations ... In the future, when [our kids] grow up, it doesn't matter how much we devote to their education, it doesn't matter how much effort they put into their own education-years of work will be gone, only because of their skin color.\"\n\nMuch of the wrath has been targeted at Ivy League schools, which consider a range of academic and non-academic factors in the admissions process. Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA)-a group representing primarily Asian American students and parents- contends in a lawsuit that Harvard College uses implicit racial quotas even though they're illegal . (It accuses the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill of similar allegations in a separate lawsuit .) Despite being the country's fastest-growing minority group , and despite applying to college in greater and greater numbers , the percentage of Asians admitted at elite schools has, according to SFFA, essentially flatlined over the last two decades. \"That suggests that Harvard and the other Ivies have a hard-fast, intractable quota limiting the number of Asians that they will expect,\" said Edward Blum, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and the president of SFFA.\n\nWhereas Asian American enrollment at the California Institute of Technology, which bases admission strictly on academics , grew from 25 percent in 1992 to 43 percent in 2013, it slightly decreased at Harvard-from 19 percent to 18 percent. SFFA also points to a widely cited Princeton study , which in 2005 found that an Asian American applicant must score 140 points more than her white counterpart on the 1600-point SAT.\n\nThe Asian American Coalition for Education (AACE) uses similar logic in a separate civil-rights complaint , which requests that the Education and Justice departments investigate the admissions processes at Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College. The AACE, which represents more than 130 organizations, contends that the schools, in relying on de facto racial quotas and stereotypes, deny admission to highly qualified Asian American applicants while admitting non-Asian students of equal caliber.\n\nAsians have been victimized by race-based policies throughout the country's history pointing to the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act and the WWII-era Japanese internment camps , among other injustices. The Asian race, critics argue, includes countless ethnicities that are sorely underrepresented in higher education yet all clumped together in a single category on application forms: Cambodians, Laotians, and Hmong, for example. According to the AACE, the complaint represents the largest joint action ever taken by Asian Americans against the Ivy League.\n\nDiscrimination against Asian American students even came up in Fisher . In his dissent, Justice Samuel Alito emphasized that the University of Texas-which automatically admits students from the top 10 percent of each public high school in the extremely segregated state -enrolls fewer Asian Americans than it does Hispanics. Unless the university is illegally massaging the racial composition of its student body so that it reflects the state's population, in which Hispanics outnumber Asians, he argued, \"it seemingly views the classroom contributions of Asian-American students as less valuable than those of Hispanic students.\"\n\nWhat may be at issue in all these cases is colleges' \"holistic\" approach to admissions -the fact that they don't admit students based entirely, or at least almost entirely, on academic merit alone and consider more subjective factors such as diversity of experience, nonacademic achievements, and field of interest. Despite its prevalence and nice-sounding name , some polls suggest Americans aren't too fond of holistic admissions. In 2013, Gallup asked respondents to choose one of the following: \"Applicants should be admitted solely on the basis of merit, even if that results in few minority students being admitted\" or \"An applicant's racial and ethnic background should be considered to help promote diversity on college campuses, even if that means admitting some minority students who otherwise would not be admitted.\" It found that two in three adults answered in the former.\n\n\"Primarily, [admissions] should be merit-based because a college is an educational institution,\" said YuKong Zhao, the president of the AACE. \"In our view, the fundamental way to improve [disadvantaged students'] education conditions, the fundamental way to improve diversity, is really through improving the K-12 education in [those] disadvantaged communities.\"\n\nIn using holistic admissions, colleges are trying to build a class of students with varied interests and backgrounds, which can mean quotas for the number of admitted people who want to go into engineering, for example, or the number who come from California. This practice, Zhao argues, amount to a dangerous, underhanded form of \"social engineering.\" In fact, critics say that holistic admissions were actually the brainchild of the then-Harvard president A. Lawrence Lowell as a means of reducing the number of Jews on campus in the early 1900s. On top of test scores and academic records, the school started asking applicants to provide personal essays, an interview, and even a photo, ostensibly to ensure opportunity for \" serious and ambitious students of average intelligence .\"\n\nWhen I asked Blum, the SFFA president, whether the holistic-admissions policy effectively means fewer Asians on campus-because, say, they generally pursue fields like engineering and computer science and physics at higher rates than other students-he was quick to describe that as a stereotypical assumption. \"I just don't believe that out of the 15,000 Asians applying to Harvard that they're all little computer geeks, I don't believe it , \" he said. Why should a perfectly eligible Asian student be denied admission to a top school just because she expresses interest in a particularly popular major?\n\nIt's possible, however, that the sentiments embodied in the complaints and calls to action reflect just a vocal minority of the country's Asian American communities. In 2012, the National Asian American Survey found that three in four Asian Americans support affirmative action. The 2016 Asian American Voter Survey similarly found substantial support when it asked respondents, \"Do you favor or oppose affirmative action programs designed to help blacks, women, and other minorities get better access to higher education?\" A majority of respondents-64 percent-said they think it's a good thing, while just 25 percent said it's a bad thing. Even when the question was framed in less positive terms-\"Do you think the affirmative action program designed to increase the number of black and minority students on college campuses are a good thing or bad thing?\"-most respondents still said they think it's a good thing. Interestingly, opinions on both questions varied depending on the ethnicity, with most Chinese respondents opposing affirmative action and overwhelming majorities of Vietnamese and Filipinos, for example, supporting it.\n\nIt's statistics such as these that organizations such as Asian Americans Advancing Justice (AAJC) and scholars such as Karthick Ramakrishnan , a political-science professor at UC Riverside, highlight when suggesting that the Asian Americans who vociferously oppose affirmative action don't reflect Asian Americans as a whole.\n\nMore than 160 Asian American groups filed briefs in support of UT's affirmative-action program, representing organizations including (AAJC) and the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund. \"Such broad support for race conscious admissions policies sends a clear message that AAPIs overwhelmingly support these policies and will not be used as a racial wedge to disenfranchise other communities of color,\" Laboni Hoq, the litigation director at Asian Americans Advancing Justice - Los Angeles, said in a statement . Affirmative action, these supporters argue, benefits all Americans promoting the short- and long-term benefits of diversity.\n\nAAJC believes that race-conscious holistic admissions actually benefit Asian Americans, particularly groups like Cambodians and Laotians that do face significant barriers to education . \"Many of the things we have fought for in continuing to maintain both the policies and principles behind affirmative action are designed not only to help the overall population but also specific subgroups such as my community,\" said Mee Moua, a Hmong American who serves as the president and executive director of AAJC. \"The way in which the story [about Asian American opposition to affirmative action] is being told is through this assumption of the model-minority myth ... There's a presumption that somehow this highly achieving community doesn't care about the impact of affirmative-action policies.\"\n\nAccording to Moua, \"the faction of Asian Americans publicly opposed to affirmative action is misguided and doesn't understand that what they're opposed to is 'negative action'\"-i.e., quotas and discrimination, even though such practices are blatantly illegal. Indeed, some research has suggested that it isn't affirmative action that hurts Asian Americans, but rather negative action, and that eliminating affirmative action would hurt Asian Americans. AAJC, Moua said, strongly opposes negative action, but \"we can't do anything about that until there's a set of facts.\"\n\nThere's little, if any, concrete evidence to suggest that elite colleges are indeed using racial quotas. The Education Department, for example, last September said it didn't have enough proof to conclude Princeton University had discriminated against Asian students, as alleged in a complaint. And although groups like SFFA cite Asian American enrollment statistics in California as evidence that the Ivy League schools are proactively capping their Asian numbers, the reality is that such students have long attended UC schools in large numbers-even before the affirmative-action ban. In 1992, Asian Americans accounted for about 40 percent of new freshmen at UC Berkeley, for example; in 2012, it was 43 percent. Perhaps that relative stagnation is because Berkeley-like Harvard and Yale and Brown and Dartmouth- practices holistic admissions. And perhaps holistic admissions effectively result in some racial leveling.\n\nAs for the apparent inconsistencies in public opinion, what it may come down to is a generational fissure in America's Asian population. The groups behind the lawsuit and federal complaints, as researchers point out , are comprised largely of foreign-born immigrants, many of them from China. These are people who believe , deeply, in the premise of the American Dream-the idea that the U.S. is a meritocracy. The Asian American organizations that support affirmative action tend to be older, comprised largely of people who were born in the country, and have well-established alliances with other civil-rights groups-including those advocating for blacks and Latinos.\n\nUltimately, facts may, according to Moua, be key to closing that divide. \"It doesn't serve our purpose to isolate our community members who have stood in opposition to affirmative action,\" she said. \"It's important to recognize that ... while they may mislabel their rationale [for opposing race-conscious admissions], underlying that is a deep and likely valid concern about discriminatory practices.\""

      "text": "Supreme Court to Revisit Affirmative Action Ruling - What You Need to Know\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court will again hear a challenge to affirmative action, and this time the justices could rule against it.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court will again hear a challenge to affirmative action in college admissions, a decision with the potential to decrease the numbers of black and Latino students accepted into selective colleges. It's the second time in three years that the Court will hear arguments in Fisher v. University of Texas , a fact that already has affirmative-action advocates scared.\n\nThe case revolves around Abigail Fisher, a white woman who sued the University of Texas at Austin for what she calls discrimination. In Texas, the top 10 percent of students in their class are automatically accepted into any public university . Fisher didn't make that cut. When she applied through general admission in 2008 she was also denied. The school, which factors race into its general admission process, rejected her application. Fisher sued, saying other accepted students were less qualified and \"the only other difference between us was the color of our skin .\"\n\nIn June, the Supreme Court announced it would hear the case again, a decision that required four votes (out of nine justices) and that might signal how the Court will rule.\n\nA little background\n\nThe Supreme Court heard the case in 2013. But the legal challenge to affirmative action began before that, including the 2003 case Grutter v. Bollinger .\n\nThat case was similar to Fisher in that a white woman-Barbara Grutter-applied to a university and was denied admission, she believed, because of affirmative-action-based admission policies. The University of Michigan Law School admitted that it factored race into its application process, and the Supreme Court still ruled in favor of the school (in a 5-4 decision), with then-Justice Sandra Day O'Connor saying that the \"race-conscious admissions program does not unduly harm non-minority applicants.\"\n\nIt was a huge blow to critics of affirmative action. Then Fisher came along.\n\nFirst, a federal district court upheld the university's policy, so Fisher appealed to the 5th Circuit Court. She lost there, too. When she appealed to the Supreme Court, the justices voted to vacate the decision in a 7-1 vote-essentially a non-ruling-saying the lower court hadn't demanded enough evidence in reviewing the University of Texas's admission policies. The lower court stood by its ruling. This year, the case was again appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\nWhat it would mean\n\nIt is likely that there will be only eight justices in the decision. For the 2013 ruling, Justice Elena Kagan recused herself because she had filed briefs in the Fisher case when she was solicitor general. If the justices are tied, the decision would stand. But it takes four justices to grant a hearing, meaning four have already decided the case is questionable.\n\nCritics of affirmative action hope that Justice Anthony Kennedy will bring the swing vote they need, making it a 5-3 ruling, a possibility given that Kennedy dissented in Grutter v. Bollinger . And there's also a very real possibility that this case could be the end of affirmative action. Currently, eight states, which account for 29 percent of the nation's students , already ban affirmative action."

      "text": "The Myth of Reverse Racism\n\nThe idea of white victimhood is increasingly central to the debate over affirmative action.\n\nContrary to initial indications, the civil-rights division of the Department of Justice won't be dismantling affirmative action after all. At least, that's the current word from Trump administration officials, after a New York Times article claimed the department would be using the broad powers of justice to take on universities that it decided had discriminated against white people. The DOJ since clarified that it was gearing up to investigate complaints from dozens of organizations alleging that certain universities used quotas-which are illegal-to limit the number of Asian American enrollees.\n\nStill, the beacons have been lit, and America's annual heated argument about affirmative action has begun anew, this time against the background of racial tensions that have helped define the early goings of the Trump presidency. As always, those tensions and long-held beliefs about racial advantages rule the debate.\n\nAs my colleague Alia Wong notes , that debate is still hamstrung by a number of misconceptions about affirmative action, including the tendency to flatten issues pertaining to Asian Americans. These misconceptions are often exploited to serve the interests of white resentment that's surrounded the use of race in job- and university-application processes since the 1960s. To quote a 1995 Boston College Third World Law Journal article : \"The deployment of Asian Americans as an exemplary group in race relations is nothing new. The model minority myth of Asian Americans has been used since the Sixties to denigrate other nonwhites.\"\n\nThe Times article jumped immediately to that white resentment. It identified \"affirmative action admissions policies deemed to discriminate against white applicants\" as the key target for the Justice Department. It also cited the former Reagan administration and Bush administration official Roger Clegg, who claimed that \"it is frequently the case that not only are whites discriminated against now, but frequently Asian Americans are as well.\"\n\nThough the Times ' focus on \"reverse racism\" may not have entirely captured the actual policy issue in front of the DOJ, the connection was understandable. White animus against affirmative action is a driving force in the debate over race-conscious admissions.\n\nThe usage of \"reverse racism\" and \"reverse discrimination\" arose in direct response to affirmative and race-based policies in the 1970s. Even as outright quotas and more open attempts to equalize the numbers of minority enrollees were defeated, the term stuck. A 1979 California Law Review article defines \"reverse discrimination\" as a phenomenon where \"individual blacks and members of other minority groups began to be given benefits at the expense of whites who, apart from race, would have had a superior claim to enjoy them.\"\n\nReverse racism-or any race-conscious policy-became a common grievance, one that helped shape a certain post-civil-rights-movement view of America where black people were the favored children of the state, and deserving white people were cast aside.\n\nA recent Twitter thread from the Refinery29 writer Ashley Ford illustrates an example of just how common and extreme that grievance has become. She recounted personal anecdotes about acquaintances who assumed that black people could simply attend college for free:\n\nDo you know how many white people truly and genuinely believe that black people get to go to college for free?\n\nThey had all these stories about white people they knew getting passed over for jobs and promotions in favor of less qualified black folks.\n\nIn a follow-up story , Ford describes two prevailing responses to the thread. \"There were many people who were shocked to hear anyone could believe Black people got to go to college for free,\" she writes, \"and others who insisted we actually do .\"\n\nIt's difficult to quantify the extent to which this distorted fear of \"reverse racism\" actually animates opposition to race-conscious admissions, but there are clues as to its ubiquity. Every few years, donors use those kinds of grievances as a rationale for creating white-only scholarships, such as the $250 Caucasian Achievement and Recognition Scholarship offered by Boston University's chapter of the College Republicans. Op-eds and lawsuits from individuals who believe they faced discrimination in admissions processes often rely on claims of reverse racism. The controversial Fisher v. University of Texas lawsuit was one such case that spawned columns alleging extensive reverse racism. (In that case, the Supreme Court upheld University of Texas at Austin's affirmative-action program, which allows the consideration of race for certain applicants, on the condition that the school regularly assess the program's merits and ensure all other methods fail to produce adequate student diversity.)\n\nData show that many Americans do perceive reverse racism to be a significant societal problem. A 2016 Public Religion Research Institute poll indicates that half of all Americans, 57 percent of all white people, and 66 percent of the white working class believe that discrimination against white people is as big a problem in America as discrimination against black people.\n\nOther studies take that claim further, suggesting that white belief in reverse racism has steadily increased since the civil-rights movement and in their view has become the dominant racial bias in America. This trend appears to parallel the rise of Donald Trump, as a 2016 HuffPost /YouGov poll found that Trump voters think anti-white discrimination is a much more prevalent problem than discrimination against any minority group.\n\nWith respect to higher education in particular, a 2005 Gallup Poll found that, given a scenario with equally qualified applicants, white people were more likely to believe a black candidate would have a higher chance of getting into a given school than a white candidate of equal caliber. White people are generally much more likely to oppose affirmative action than they were two decades ago, and several polls indicate that the majority of white people do oppose it now.\n\nFears of reverse racism fly in the face of data. White students still make up almost three-quarters of all private external scholarship recipients in four-year bachelor's programs , almost two-thirds of all institutional grants and scholarship recipients, and over three-quarters of all merit-based grants and scholarships, although white people only make up about 62 percent of the college-student population and about half of all people under 19 . White students are more likely than black, Latino, and Asian students to receive scholarships.\n\nAlso, existing data suggest that race-conscious admissions policies are the main factors keeping overall enrollment roughly representative of America's racial demographics. A FiveThirtyEight analysis from 2015 found that colleges in states with affirmative-action bans are less representative of the state's demographics than colleges that are still allowed to consider race. Other simulations suggest that replacing race-conscious policies with color-blind policies that take into account applicants' socioeconomic status yields less racial diversity on college campuses.\n\nStill, in today's political climate, sentiment is probably more important than reality. And that's why the move by the DOJ matters, even though it's limited to an investigation on behalf of Asian American plaintiffs. Asian Americans have often been treated as \" a racial wedge to disenfranchise other communities of color .\" In short, achievement by Asian Americans is used by people decrying reverse racism as the grounding logic to assail race-based programs. Those attacks are useful to white grievance only insofar as they remedy widespread perceptions of white disadvantage. For example, white support for a perceived \"meritocracy\" without affirmative action plummets amid overrepresentation of and competition from Asian American students, according to one 2013 study .\n\nA 1993 article in this magazine by Stanley Fish perhaps best describes the paradox of that grievance. \"Reverse racism is a cogent description of affirmative action,\" Fish wrote, \"only if one considers the cancer of racism to be morally and medically indistinguishable from the therapy we apply to it.\" The current debate provides a showcase on just how-despite all evidence-the cancer and remedy have converged."

      "text": "The Complicated History of Affirmative Action: A Primer\n\n7 stories that look at the policy's complex past\n\nThe Justice Department is poised to investigate and potentially sue universities over admissions policies that it believes practice race-based discrimination, according to an internal document obtained Tuesday by The New York Times . The document invites interested lawyers to apply to participate in the initiative, which according to the Times will be overseen by the department's political appointees.\n\nThe project's objective, though not explicitly stated, is to clamp down on affirmative-action policies deemed to put white and Asian American students at a disadvantage. Numerous lawsuits have already accused colleges and universities of doing that, including the high-profile Fisher v. University of Texas . In that case, the Supreme Court upheld UT Austin's program, which allows the consideration of race as one factor in admissions. Several pending lawsuits allege that the admissions practices at institutions such as Harvard and the University of California are discriminatory as well. The Supreme Court has previously ruled that the benefits of diversity justify the use of race as one consideration among many in what colleges often refer to as \"holistic admissions.\" That ruling also confirmed that \"negative action\"-such as racial quotas-is illegal.\n\nIn light of the Justice Department announcement, here's a roundup of our best writing on affirmative action:\n\nWho Is Most Disadvantaged by Affirmative Action?\n\nAlia Wong | June 28, 2016\n\nAccording to some activists, brilliant, accomplished, and well-rounded Asian students are consigned to gaming a system that's rigged against them. Either that, or they have to prove themselves extra brilliant, extra accomplished, and extra well-rounded to ensure they're on equal footing with non-Asian applicants. The premise is that affirmative action enables colleges and universities to discriminate against Asian applicants simply because there are so many of them on campus already. ...\n\nBut it's far from clear that race-conscious admissions policies actually put the so-called \"model minority\" at a disadvantage. Nor is it clear that Asians and affirmative action are the foes that the headlines and lawsuits and petitions make them out to be.\n\nUnderstanding the 'Mismatch' Debate\n\nMikhail Zinshteyn | March 24, 2016\n\nThe definitions that are central to the debate over racial preferences can overlap, but keeping them in order is key. Affirmative action means giving a group of students some kind of preference, like for students who are poor or come from certain zip codes. Racial preferences are just that-admissions policies that take into account an applicant's race. The role of mismatch in this debate is to determine whether students who are admitted with the aid of admissions preferences-like race, income, or being related to alumni-perform well academically despite at times having lower grades and college-entrance test scores than the average scores for the incoming class of students at a particular college.\n\nThere are two more related concepts-overmatching and undermatching. An undermatched student is someone whose academic performance in high school exceeds those of fellow students at a particular college, suggesting that the student could have gotten into a more selective university but for various reasons did not. Overmatched students are the opposite-those whose high school performances suggest they may struggle in a more selective school and are better off at a less challenging college.\n\nDiversity Debates: Income or Race-Based Affirmative Action?\n\nEmily Deruy | June 24, 2016\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court's decision Thursday to uphold affirmative action surprised legal experts, college presidents, and civil-rights activists. And although the ruling will let some colleges use race as a factor in admissions, that right is by no means guaranteed long term or across the board. ...\n\nBut would focusing on income really result in as much racial diversity as focusing on race? It's a complicated question and different researchers have arrived at very different answers. The short answer seems to be: it depends. ...\n\nWhile there's clearly debate about the benefits and drawbacks of focusing on income in lieu of race, there's general agreement among researchers that when students arrive on campuses because of affirmative action, whatever the kind, they are entirely capable of succeeding. Georgetown University's Center on Education and the Workforce found that white students who score in the bottom half on tests have a graduation rate of 75 percent at the country's most selective schools, while those in the top half have a graduation rate of 88 percent. For students of color, the graduation rate are 73 and 85 percent, respectively. The center also found that when average students attend the country's best colleges, their rate of graduation goes up by 26 percent.\n\nAn Argument for Moving From Race to Class\n\nRichard D. Kahlenberg | June 4, 2015\n\nStill, critics ask: Is the country ready to move beyond racial preferences when skin color so patently continues to matter in American society? Is a nation in which the headlines are dominated by the disgraceful deaths of unarmed black men-from Eric Garner to Walter Scott to Freddie Gray-really in a position to get beyond race? Not if moving beyond race means repealing civil-rights laws. Explicit race-based laws still play a crucial role in fighting ongoing discrimination in housing, employment, education, voting, and the criminal-justice system, as will police body cameras and more resources for civil-rights enforcement.\n\nRacial preferences in education are a different matter. Factoring in skin color at select private colleges is worth the equivalent of a 310 SAT-point boost (on a 400-1600-point scale) for black students over white students, according to one study . As Johnson, King, and Moynihan recognized, class-based alternatives to these programs don't ignore the continuing role of race; they leverage the reality of discrimination to promote the kind of racial and ethnic diversity that America's colleges need. ...\n\nThe attacks on racial affirmative action, including those from voters and from conservative judges, may represent an opportunity to pick up the progressive thread of thought first developed a half century ago by Johnson, King, Moynihan, and Rustin, filling a need for economic affirmative action that has only grown stronger over time.\n\nCan Outreach Programs Do the Work of Affirmative Action?\n\nBrenda Iasevoli | February 28, 2014\n\nThe Early Academic Outreach Program aims to provide poor students with the benefits equivalent to those enjoyed by their affluent counterparts: individualized college counseling, help filling out applications and financial aid forms, free PSAT and SAT prep, campus visits, even enrichment classes on Saturdays and during the summer. ...\n\nGandara's upcoming book on UCLA's outreach programs aims to offer EAOP as an alternative model to the use of affirmative action for universities everywhere, so that students like Membreno don't lose their way. The model is simple: share the steps for getting to college, and help students take the steps one by one. Advisers say students can use a little reassurance along the way, too.\n\nFrom time to time, Membreno returns to her old middle school in central LA to encourage students by her own example.\n\n\"I wasn't the best student,\" she tells them. \"I could be a troublemaker. I could get loud sometimes. But I still went to college. So can you.\"\n\nHow the Fisher Case Reignited a Long-Simmering Controversy\n\nSarah Garland | October 10, 2012\n\nIn 2008, two young women with similar academic records applied to the University of Texas at Austin for spots in the freshman class. One of the women, Abigail Fisher, was rejected. The other, Tedra Jacobs, was accepted. Fisher is white. Jacobs is black. Fisher sued, saying the university's admission process was discriminatory. Now, her case is before the Supreme Court, which will hear arguments today. The decision, which may be issued as late as next summer, could set new limits on the use of racial preferences in higher education, or even ban affirmative action outright.\n\n\"It could have been me who took her spot,\" says Jacobs. She is not apologetic, and neither is the university. Admitting students like Jacobs through affirmative action is part of the school's strategy to ensure that that the next generation of leaders is more representative of the nation's diversity than the last one. (There may be a black president in the White House, but there are no African Americans and only two Hispanics in the Senate.)\n\nThe court's decision in Fisher v. University of Texas could deal a major blow to efforts to promote racial diversity in education. In a 2007 decision, the court already significantly restricted the use of race in elementary and secondary school assignments; now, only a handful of districts around the nation actively attempt to integrate their schools, and racial separation in schools is back to levels not seen since the 1950s. The decision to take up the Fisher case suggests the justices may be willing to reverse precedents in a 2003 University of Michigan case and the 1978 Bakke decision, which both upheld the use of race in college admissions.\n\nDoes Affirmative Action Hurt Minority Students?\n\nRichard Sander and Stuart Taylor Jr. | October 2, 2012\n\nThe single biggest problem in this system-a problem documented by a vast and growing array of research-is the tendency of large preferences to boomerang and harm their intended beneficiaries. Large preferences often place students in environments where they can neither learn nor compete effectively -even though these same students would thrive had they gone to less competitive but still quite good schools .\n\nWe refer to this problem as \"mismatch,\" a word that largely explains why, even though blacks are more likely to enter college than are whites with similar backgrounds, they will usually get much lower grades, rank toward the bottom of the class, and far more often drop out. Because of mismatch, racial preference policies often stigmatize minorities, reinforce pernicious stereotypes, and undermine the self-confidence of beneficiaries, rather than creating the diverse racial utopias so often advertised in college campus brochures."

      "text": "Enriching Diversity Beyond Affirmative Action\n\nBy considering both race and class, Colorado's flagship university is increasing minority enrollment.\n\nMichigan's 2006 ban on affirmative action means de-facto segregation, a coalition fighting the ban argues in a brief filed to the Supreme Court. The challenge to the law, which the Court is now considering, starts with the assumption that the number of minority students admitted to Michigan's top colleges would shrink under the ban.\n\nA new approach at the University of Colorado (Boulder) suggests that some colleges could maintain racial diversity while de-emphasizing race in the admissions process. Since 2011, the state flagship has given extra consideration to disadvantaged applicants and to those whose grades and test scores are above average for their economic circumstances.\n\nEven if the state were to ban race-based affirmative action, the class-based framework should increase low-income admissions, maintain minority representation, and even better, predict success in college. It's a model that could help other universities become more diverse.\n\n\"What we hope is that this result will ease fears - at least a little bit - that an end to race-based affirmative action will be absolutely devastating for racial diversity on college campuses,\" says Matthew Gaertner, a research scientist in the center for college and career success at Pearson. Gaertner helped the admissions office devise its new framework while a graduate student at Boulder.\n\nCU-Boulder is a moderately selective institution that primarily serves Colorado and the West. Only about 20 percent of the university's over 29,000 students are African-American, Asian-American, Hispanic, or Native American. The university has been working to increase underrepresented-minority enrollment for the past six years.\n\nLike other selective colleges, CU-Boulder has a set of criteria it uses to weigh marginal applicants - those whose grades and test scores aren't high enough to guarantee admission, but who would still add value to the freshman class. Factors include extracurricular activities, strength of the senior schedule, and race.\n\nThe university had to rethink its approach in 2008, when a state ballot initiative threatened to ban affirmative action. \"I was very concerned about what could potentially happen to our campus,\" says Kevin MacLennan, CU-Boulder's director of admissions. He visited flagship institutions in some of the eight states that have banned affirmative action, and he found that they had experienced a significant drop in ethnic and racial diversity.\n\nEven in Texas, where the majority of public-school students are Latino and where the top 10 percent of every high school class gain automatic admission to state universities, the state flagship has found it necessary to consider race in order to increase diversity. Earlier this year, the Supreme Court sent a challenge to the affirmative-action plan at the University of Texas (Austin) back to a lower court.\n\nSocial and economic forces are making elite schools both more white and more affluent, a trend documented by Anthony Carnevale and Jeff Strohl of Georgetown University's Center on Education and the Workforce. Inequality is a big part of the problem. Low-income African-Americans and Latinos tend to grow up in more-concentrated areas of poverty than their white peers. Other factors may also be at work: African-American and Latino students are less likely to enroll in selective colleges even when they have solid grades and test scores.\n\nGaertner set out to create a class-based affirmative-action framework for CU-Boulder that would take into account resources available to a child at home and in high school. He came up with two measures. The \"disadvantage index\" measures the likelihood that the applicant will enroll in college at all, given his socioeconomic status. The \"overachievement index\" measures whether an applicant's grades and test scores exceed the scores usually achieved by students of his socioeconomic status.\n\n\"When students apply and they demonstrate severe socioeconomic disadvantage, or extraordinary overachievement relative to that disadvantage, they're given a substantial boost in the admissions process,\" Gaertner says. Overachievers from all backgrounds get extra consideration, and so do severely disadvantaged students, even those who aren't achieving at high levels.\n\nEach index is a statistical model that weighs many factors, including the teacher-student ratio at the applicant's high school, the number of dependents the applicant's parents are supporting, and whether the student's first language was English. Gaertner created a computer program that runs the math and produces a number that admissions officers use to classify students as moderately disadvantaged, severely disadvantaged, or not disadvantaged; and as exhibiting high overachievement, extraordinary overachievement, or none at all.\n\nTwo experiments prove that the indicies are working. In 2009, Gaertner had admissions officers review 478 applications, first under CU-Boulder's race-based policy and then under the new class-based policy, with all racial identifiers removed. Officers ended up admitting 9 percent more underrepresented minority students under the race-blind policy than and 20 percent more students of very low socioeconomic status.\n\nIn 2010, CU-Boulder ran another experiment, this time on 2,000 applications deemed borderline for admission. Half were evaluated using the new class-plus-race approach, and half using the old approach that used race alone. The hybrid approach resulted in a 13 percent increase in acceptance rates for the poorest students, a 17 percent increase for underrepresented minority students, and a 32 percent increase in the lowest-income, minority students. The results of both experiments were recently published in Harvard Law and Policy Review .\n\nColorado's ballot initiative didn't pass, so today CU-Boulder uses both race and the new indicies as factors in admissions decisions. In general, disadvantaged students admitted through this process don't perform as well at CU-Boulder as the typical student, Gaertner says. \"Their grades and test scores don't indicate they're automatic admits, so you'd sort of expect them to have a little bit lower outcomes than typical undergraduate,\" he says.\n\nBut students identified as overachievers excel. \"Their college outcomes - that's grades, credit hours earned, and graduation at four years and six-year graduation rate - is actually higher than typical undergraduates,\" Gaertner says of overachievers.\n\nConstructing the new admissions factors has had an additional benefit. \"The more we got into this, it actually expanded our view of diversity,\" MacLennan says. The admissions team now pays more attention to rural students and students coming from under-resourced high schools.\n\nWhile the indicies are a good fit for CU-Boulder, it's not clear whether they'd work just as well at very selective schools, Gaertner says. And it's important to remember that improving on-campus diversity involves a spectrum of efforts.\n\n\"The indicies are wonderful, but they can't just stand by themselves - or even part of the admissions process,\" MacLennan says. Outreach and recruitment comes first. Then, once students are admitted, the university needs to help every admitted student make it to graduation."

      "text": "Were Asian Americans Forgotten in SCOTUS Arguments Over Affirmative Action?\n\nIn Monday's five-hour long Supreme Court arguments about the future of affirmative action it was easy to forget that the cases first arose from alleged discrimination against Asian American applicants in the admission processes.\n\nAt issue are challenges to the admissions procedures at the University of North Carolina and Harvard that use race among other factors in the goal of seeking a diverse student body. Both universities have defended their policies as compliant with the decades of Supreme Court precedent governing \"affirmative action\" policies that tried to remedy the history of segregated education first struck down in the landmark decision of Brown v. Board of Education in 1954.\n\nThe petitioners, however, claim that Brown's prohibition of racial segregation means that any admissions policies must be colorblind, meaning no consideration of race would be allowed in making admission decisions.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn Monday, the bulk of the arguments focused on whether the decades-long precedents of allowing race-conscious admissions would be overruled as unconstitutional.\n\nAs anticipated, extreme conservatives like Justice Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito made their views plain. Said Thomas: \"I've heard the word diversity quite a few times, and I don't have a clue what it means - it seems to mean everything for everyone.\"\n\nAlito expressed similar confusion over the term \"underrepresented minority,\" asking, \"What does that mean?\" But little time was devoted to such issues as Harvard's admitted practice of scoring Asian American applicants lower in \"personality\" than applicants of other races.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch brought up the point that some Asian American applicants have been advised to hide their identities in order to improve their chances at getting into highly competitive colleges and universities, to which the Solicitor General of the United States responded that she found such reports \"appalling.\"\n\nThe group that brought the cases, Students for Fair Admissions, also raised the point but spent the majority of the time answering questions about whether it was time to dispense with affirmative action particularly in light of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 's writing in 2003 that the need for such race-conscious policies would likely be gone within twenty-five years. O'Connor's optimism seems particularly naïve today with the question of Asian American admissions being a highly controversial issue even among elite high schools like Lowell in San Francisco and Thomas Jefferson in Virginia.\n\nIronically, Asian Americans have been flagging this kind of prejudice since the 1980s - UC Berkeley apologized in 1989 for admissions policies that caused a decline in Asian undergraduate enrollment  - but now a struggle that began in solidarity with other under-represented minorities seems to have pivoted to a position where Asian Americans are often being portrayed as being anti-affirmative action. That is wrong.\n\nSurveys demonstrate that the majority of Asians favor affirmative action but supporting affirmative action doesn't mean supporting prejudices like the racist trope that Asians are dull and boring, which seems to be supported by Harvard's system of giving Asians lower personality scores.\n\nIn its defense, Harvard had testified that these scores were justified by the fact that teacher and guidance counselor recommendations for Asian American applicants were not as strong. Assuming that is true, such a fact only demonstrates that stereotypes of Asian Americans are baked into the educational system long before the college admissions process starts.\n\nOf course, a major factor in the cases before the Supreme Court is that the group bringing the cases is spear-headed by conservative activist Edward Blum who was also behind the law suits that curtailed Voting Rights and has previously brought suit over race-based admissions - and lost - over policies at the University of Texas.\n\nThere is little doubt that Blum saw an opportunity with Asian Americans to give the newly conservative SCOTUS the opportunity to strike down affirmative action and given the questions Monday there is little doubt that the votes exist to do just that.\n\nBut one solution did emerge in the back and forth with the Solicitor General who suggested that if the Court determined that the original district court failed to properly apply strict scrutiny to the allegations of improper use of race then the case could be remanded back for further work.\n\nSuch a path might give Chief Justice Roberts an argument to prevent another wholesale overturning of precedent and also serve the function of deserved closer review of Harvard's admissions process. Recall that despite the lower scoring of Asian American applicants, the trial judge found that Harvard had not engaged in intentional discrimination based on the mere fact that Harvard administrators testified that they did not engage in intentional discrimination.\n\nThis solution might only delay SCOTUS's conservative majority appetite for overturning precedent in order to impose their political views but it would also serve to give the judicial system another chance to force a look at what goes into the supposed \"holistic\" look at Asian American candidates.\n\nChief Justice Roberts is famous for his statement that the \"best way to stop discrimination on basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\"  Sending these cases back to the trial courts for a harder look at how Asian Americans are treated in college admissions would be a good step towards accomplishing that goal.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Affirmative Action Isn't Oppressive, but the Roberts Court Wants to End It Anyway\n\nThe Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that a state, through a voter referendum, can prohibit a practice-race-conscious admissions in public education-that the U.S. Constitution doesn't require. The 6-2 decision (Justice Elena Kagan was recused) in Schuette v. BAMN preserves the status quo for Michigan and the seven other states that have banned affirmative action, beginning with California in 1996 .\n\nEven for supporters of affirmative action, then, the Court's decision is not the travesty Justice Sonia Sotomayor's 58-page dissent would have us believe.\n\nThe travesty, instead, is the Roberts Court's inevitable march toward its virtual eradication of affirmative action in the 42 states it remains permitted.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAffirmative action only exists today because Justice Sandra Day O'Connor deemed it so in 2003's Grutter v. Bollinger . But O'Connor's retirement in 2006, and her replacement by the decidedly un-swinging Justice Samuel Alito, allowed the new chief justice, John Roberts, to renew conservative efforts to end race-conscious admissions. Back in 2007, Roberts threw his first salvo in the affirmative action wars. \" The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race ,\" Roberts wrote in Parents Involved v. Seattle , joined by Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito. Justice Anthony Kennedy gave them his fifth vote to strike down two school districts' re-integration plans, but he did not join Roberts' now-famous quip because, in theory, he supports the use of race-conscious admissions . In practice, though, he has not approved of an affirmative action policy since he arrived on the court in 1988.\n\nJust last term, in Fisher v. University of Texas , the Court seemed poised to strike at the heart of Grutter , which upheld racial preferences in university admissions (which, in turn, provoked the Michigan referendum at issue in Schuette ). At oral argument in Fisher , the conservative justices-including O'Connor's successor Alito-all expressed antagonism towards the University of Texas at Austin's race-conscious admissions scheme used to boost minority enrollment after the school found that the state's race-neutral \" Top-Ten Percent Rule \" did not result in a \"critical mass\" of diversity in the classroom.\n\nBut then, eight months after the argument, the Court punted. By a 7-1 vote (again, Justice Kagan recused), Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the Court, sent the Fisher case back to the appeals court to give the admissions policy a harder look. Such a short opinion after such a long gestation screamed \"compromise\" between every line, perhaps because the Court's four die-hard foes of affirmative action could not bring along Kennedy to go the whole hog. Still, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote separately to deride affirmative action from his position of lived experience. Rather than engage in moral authority mortal combat with Thomas, Sotomayor, the self-proclaimed \" perfect affirmative action baby \" who had yet to preside over such a case since arriving on the Court, stayed silent, leaving Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg alone in dissent.\n\nIn Schuette , Sotomayor made clear she will be silent no more. She, joined by Ginsburg, went all-in for the challengers' argument that a majority can't use the political process to make it especially difficult for racial minorities to pursue their own interests.\n\nProblem is, the Court has held since 1978 's seminal Regents of the University of California v. Bakke decision that the educational benefit of a diverse student body is the sole compelling interest under the Equal Protection Clause for a public university to prefer a student of one race over another in admissions. And, as Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in his separate opinion, \"[w]ere a public university to stake its defense of a race-based-admissions policy on the ground that it was designed to benefit primarily minorities (as opposed to all students, regardless of color, by enhancing diversity), we would hold the policy unconstitutional .\"\n\nHad the Michigan ban \"forbid[den] the use of race-conscious admissions programs designed to remedy past exclusionary racial discrimination or the effects of that discrimination,\" as Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in his concurring opinion, the case should have gone Sotomayor's way.\n\nAnd there's the rub. Back in Bakke , then-swing Justice Lewis Powell, fearing the open floodgates of race-based claims that would come from recognizing the obvious-that affirmative action is motivated first and foremost by reparative justice and that the Fourteenth Amendment endorses such programs -glommed onto diversity as a safer, more universal justification for his baby-splitting Bakke decision to strike down racial quotas in college admissions but preserve, at least in theory, racial preferences.\n\nJustice Thurgood Marshall saw this sidestep for what it was. In his solo dissent detailing the myriad injustices done to African-Americans for three centuries, he wrote, \"[i]t is because of a legacy of unequal treatment that we now must permit the institutions of this society to give consideration to race in making decisions about who will hold the positions of influence, affluence, and prestige in America.\"\n\nSotomayor's dissent, while couching her argument in terms of diversity, is also about such reparative justice. And her words, as well as her passion, echo Marshall's righteous stand 36 years ago. \"Race matters,\" she writes, not only \"because of the long history of racial minorities' being denied access to the political process\" or \"because of persistent racial inequality in society,\" but also \"because of the slights, the snickers, the silent judgments that reinforce that most crippling of thoughts: 'I do not belong here.'\"\n\nOne gets the sense that these are the words Sotomayor stifled, or perhaps drafted and circulated, in Fisher . Indeed, we may see them reappear sooner rather than later: the Fifth Circuit is due out with its decision in Fisher 's remand any day now and the Roberts Court has demonstrated its willingness to double - dip when the lower courts don't do as the justices please.  And in Schuette , Sotomayor has laid the groundwork for an argument in a future case where the diversity rationale, for all its flaws, will hold some currency beyond the deaf ears of her more conservative colleagues.\n\nUntil then, Schuette seems to be a cost-free way for the justices to blow off steam and signal where they stand. Kennedy, joined by Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts, made it a point to emphasize that Tuesday's decision \"is not about the constitutionality, or the merits, of race-conscious admissions policies in higher education.\" Roberts, in a short concurrence, defended his public spirit against the dissenting opinion's imputation of bad faith by noting that \"racial preferences may themselves have the debilitating effect of reinforcing precisely that doubt, and-if so-that the preferences do more harm than good.\" And true to form, Justice Scalia, joined by Thomas, railed against \"this Court's sorry line of race-based admissions cases,\" and tipped the Court's hand that \" Grutter 's bell may soon toll.\"\n\nWhatever does happen to Grutter , it is true that campus diversity-indeed, diversity anywhere-is a wonderful thing. Yet diversity alone does not create a right to be admitted to the school of one's choice. Sure, as Sotomayor wrote, \"democratically approved legislation can oppress minority groups.\" But the the Michigan ban is not oppression. And as today's victors must-but surely won't-understand, neither is affirmative action.\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

The 2023 Supreme Court ruling against affirmative action on college campuses opened the door for more than 20 states to reverse the course on DEI. In what it called a \"backlash against 'wokeism,'\" The New York Times observed that \"the eradication of D.E.I. programs has become both a cause and message suffusing the American right.\"\n\nThe loss of yet another generation of people of color to bias, exclusion, and racism is too high a price. But there is another cost as well: $16 trillion. This comes from a Citibank report , which estimated that if four key gaps experienced by Blacks-in wages, education, housing, and investment-had been closed 20 years earlier, the U.S. GDP would see a $5 trillion increase over the next five years.\n\nEven though companies supposedly recognize that \"diversity is good for business,\" racism remains entrenched in the corporate world, just as it is in American society. It's time to evolve-or die.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCapitalism is a philosophy, and like all good philosophies, it evolves with the times. Founding economic thought leaders such as Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill were aiming to define a new way forward based on individual rights, private ownership, and industrialism. The hypocrisy and weakness in this philosophy are exposed by the growth of capitalism based on stealing land and owning individuals. Even Adam Smith saw the power dynamics when he observed, \"The persons who make all the laws in that country are persons who have slaves themselves. These will never make any laws mitigating their usage; whatever laws are made with regard to slaves are intended to strengthen the authority of the masters and reduce the slaves to a more absolute subjection.\" It is in this hypocrisy that we see our evolution with the idea that capitalism can be more than extractive.\n\nThe challenge, however, is that corporate leaders may not know how to change or respond to these new expectations. In addition to the fear of getting it catastrophically wrong, there is a gap between intention and impact into which many executives have fallen. It's no surprise that their DEI efforts have become largely a series of checkboxes forced on middle managers, while excluded communities are blamed for the efforts not working.\n\nTo understand how to respond to this moment, we first must understand how we got here. While the narrative starts centuries ago when all those European philosophers were figuring out how to be free, we will focus on recent American history to see the cycles that push the country toward justice. The 1980s is the decade in which most millennials were born and the era that shaped their childhoods. The country was healing from the civil rights movement wins and murders, a presidential resignation, and an oil crisis. Affirmative action and other results of the civil rights movement were being scrutinized as overreaching and unsustainable. White society was ready to claw back the gains made by people of color generally and Black people in particular.\n\nTaking the race playbook from Barry Goldwater's presidential run in 1964, Ronald Reagan entered national politics with a Republican National Committee (RNC) slogan that might sound familiar: Let's Make America Great Again. The RNC used the fear of losing a white, male-dominated society as a campaign message, putting gains for minorities in the crosshairs. Reagan's legacy became one of civil rights rollbacks, draconian drug laws featuring mandatory minimum sentences, and a widening of the wealth gap. The policies of Reagan actively dismantled the legislative wins of the civil rights movement and took actions such as supporting seniority over diversity goals, waging a racist war on drugs, and creating the welfare queen narrative, which dehumanized working-class Black women.\n\nIf the Reagan administration was the end of the New Deal era, then the 2008 financial crisis marked the beginning of the end of over-romanticizing Reaganomics and scapegoating people of color. Americans were ready for a real conversation about what's next. Yet what came next was disappointing for Main Street: When Wall Street got bailed out, America found out some banks were \"too big to fail,\" even as families lost homes and retirement savings.\n\nCut to the summer of 2010. It was a busy one for direct action organizers. Tired of watching Wall Street recover at the expense of Main Street, anticonsumerism organizations were about to launch a movement that would change how we talk about class in America. The growing tension culminated on September 17, 2011, when over 1,000 people joined the call to march to the opening bell of the stock exchange after gathering in Zuccotti Park and then continued to occupy the park for two months. In a few weeks, the world would see this tactic used around the globe to call attention to wealth inequality.\n\nMillions of people globally occupied their economic centers, including hundreds of thousands in cities around the United States. Occupy Wall Street reinvigorated direct action and a class conversation for the fed-up 99 percent. Unions, social justice organizers, and class activists joined forces again to reignite consumer activism. Occupy, whose story is often told as one of failure, actually marks a new dawn of tactical organizing that would be a catalyzing force toward evolving capitalism in the twenty-first century.\n\nA movement against systemic oppression was ready to break new ground. Police killing Black people is nothing new, but more people were paying attention and becoming outraged. Three young Black women, Alicia Garza, Opal Tometi, and Patrisse Cullors, started a hashtag on Twitter that would go on to become the rallying cry for an end to the state-sanctioned police killing of Black people. #BlackLivesMatter was a call for dignity in response to George Zimmerman claiming self-defense and subsequently being found not guilty in the 2012 shooting death of Trayvon Martin, a child holding Skittles. It continued to be used to express love for Black life after Michael Brown was killed by a police officer and his body remained lying in the street, uncovered, for hours.\n\nThen in 2020, COVID-19 stopped us all in our tracks, literally. The virus destroyed much, but sadly not racism. Alongside the souls claimed by the pandemic, the inaction to stop oppression in our society claimed the lives of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Aubery, and so many more publicly lynched people. So even in the middle of a global pandemic, the movement could not and did not stop. The spirit of activism is alive and well, and corporate America will soon face greater accountability.\n\nCorporations have been spurred to action by consumer pressure. They have made bold commitments to address all manner of social ills, including the extreme socioeconomic imbalance in the United States.\n\nAmerica is not changing; it has changed. Consumers are holding corporations to a higher level of accountability as a result of the desire to innovate toward a more equitable culture. The question is, how well do corporations understand what is being asked of them in this moment of cultural shift? CEOs can be trailblazers instead of roadblocks to this new society.\n\nAdapted from From Intention to Impact: A Practical Guide to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion by Malia Lazu (MIT Press).\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "A Lack of Affirmative Action Isn't Why Minority Students Are Suffering\n\nShortly before his assassination President Kennedy addressed the nation on June 11, 1963 to explain his decision to federalize the Alabama National Guard to integrate the University of Alabama.  In part, Kennedy offered:\n\nIt ought to be possible in short for every American to enjoy the privileges of being an American, without regard to his race or his color.  In short, every American ought to have the right to be treated, as he or she would wish to be treated...Race has no place in American life or law .\n\nTo this end, the Supreme Court's decision Tuesday in Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action upholding the ban on affirmative action in public-university admissions takes America one step closer to President Kennedy's dream. In a 6-2 decision, the Court held that a ballot initiative by Michigan residents to bar the use of race preferences as a factor of admission was constitutional.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn a Court that has consistently issued closely contested opinions-often in 5-4 decisions-the overwhelming majority of the Justices recognized the importance and the legality of people in several states like Michigan to prohibit the use of race as a factor in admissions.  Despite the commentary to the contrary which is likely to follow in the coming days, the Court did not address whether colleges or universities could use race as a factor of admission-they wisely left the decision to the voters in individual states to make such a decision.\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Kennedy opined:\n\nHere, the principle that the consideration of race in admissions is permissible when certain conditions are met is not being questioned.... The decision by Michigan voters reflects the ongoing national dialogue about such practices.\n\nIndeed it does.  How have we gone so far astray as a nation where we would sanction the use of discrimination in favor of one individual at the expense of another based on the color of his skin?  How can some speak out against the racially neutral practice of requiring the presentation of identification to vote as being racist while having no problem of discriminating on the basis of race to admit students to colleges and universities?  A noxious double standard is in play here.\n\nI do not question the conviction or sincerity of those who believe that affirmative action is a necessary tool to address past discrimination in a country not far removed from Jim Crow and other forms of racism utilized to keep blacks from being treated as equal citizens.  What I do question is the validity of the mindset as expressed by Justice Sotomayor in her dissenting opinion that sanctions discrimination on the basis of skin color-even if her stated goal is a noble one.  Here, Justice Sotomayor wrote:\n\n...Without checks, democratically approved legislation can oppress minority groups.  For that reason, our Constitution places limits on what a majority of the people may do.  This case implicates one such limit: the guarantee of equal protection of the laws.\n\nI take strong exception to the notion that a voter ballot initiative in Michigan to eliminate the consideration of race-and view all applicants based on their academic and extracurricular achievement-is oppressive of minority groups while limiting the Equal Protection provisions in the Bill of Rights.  President Kennedy was prescient in his speech more than a half century ago when he touched on the very issues Justice Sotomayor addressed.\n\nOur 35th president recognized that students should be allowed to learn in institutions of higher learning in which they were qualified to attend-not based on their skin color but on their record of achievement.  In the aforementioned speech on civil rights, Kennedy noted:\n\nTo give a chance for every child to be educated to the limit of his talents.  As I've said before not every child has an equal talent or an equal ability or equal motivation.  But they should have the equal right to develop their talent, and their ability and their motivation to make something of themselves.\n\nKennedy's remarks years ago should be used as the true \"teachable moment\" to have an honest discussion about race in America today in light of the Supreme Court's decision. We ought to have an honest conversation on many of the factors that impede the academic development of children across America-particularly in our communities of color.  Is it racist to point out that with an out-of-wedlock birthrate of more than 70 percent, many black students will be raised by a single parent-usually their mother-which could well condemn them to a cycle of dependency and poverty?\n\nAre we really preparing the next generation of minority students to be accepted by our best colleges (and graduate) by shuffling them from grade to grade, often in failing schools that do not provide sufficient foundations in English, math, science, and civics?  The Supreme Court decision has provided us a unique opportunity to move forward together as a nation where we can embark on a long and difficult path forward to ensure our students are given an equal opportunity to learn-regardless of the color of their skin color-to achieve the American Dream.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "How Affirmative Action Became an Upper-Middle Class Benefit\n\nThat the Supreme Court keeps grappling with affirmative action while Washington lawmakers keep their distance makes it clear that elected lawmakers are content to let the Justices take the fore.\n\nThe Court is grappling this term with the constitutionality of preferential admissions at the University of Texas , and recently announced that it will review next fall the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative (MCRI) that amends the Michigan Constitution to prohibit preferential treatment based upon \"race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin\" in admissions, employment or public contracts.\n\nRegardless of when and how the Supreme Court rules on the pending challenges to affirmative action, here are three takeaways:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOne, opposition to affirmative action does not necessarily translate into opposition to Barack Obama. Two, interest groups that opposed racial preferences in the 1970s may now be among its backers. Three, liberal support for affirmative action as we know it may be ebbing, as \"diversity\" has become a shorthand for race.\n\nAs David Leonhardt put it in the New York Times , \"low-income students, controlling for race, receive either no preference or a modest one, depending on which study you believe.\"  In other words, affirmative action is now another upper-middle class benefit.\n\nSo how did we reach this point? Ten years ago the Supreme Court struck down the University of Michigan's undergraduate admissions policies as impermissible racial quotas, but left intact the University's Law School race-based preference policy. Michigan voters responded to the Court's decisions by approving by a nearly a 3-2 margin the MCRI in 2006.\n\nExit polls showed nearly every demographic group backing the measure by large margins .  White voters, independents, non-church-goers, evangelicals, college graduates, and high school drop-outs all whole heartedly backed the MCRI. Subsequently, a legal challenge ensued and in a November 2012 decision an 8-7 majority of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit struck down the MCRI as unconstitutionally burdening minorities .  Enter the Supreme Court, which recently announced that it would hear arguments next fall on the MCRI's legality.\n\nMore significantly as a matter of politics, passage of the MCRI did not presage Barack Obama's defeat in Michigan or elsewhere in the Midwest. In Michigan, Obama ran ahead of John McCain among white voters, the working class and independents .  Indeed, Obama even won Michigan's Reagan Democrat epicenter, which had voted in the 1972 Democratic Primary for George Wallace, Alabama's late segregationist governor.\n\nTimes had changed and the outcome in Michigan was re-told throughout the Rust Belt. For example, Nate Silver reported a canvasser who approached a home in western Pennsylvania - God and Guns Country, where the husband yelled to his wife \"We're votin' for the African-American!\"-except he didn't say African-American .  Beer-track voters in the Midwest and Northeast resoundingly stood with Hillary Clinton in the primaries and resisted buying into McCain-Palin a half year later.\n\nAffirmative action also is about where the descendants of Ellis Island stand and once stood, and amicus briefs filed with the Supreme Court tell a story. One of the more dramatic shifts occurred within the position of the Anti-Defamation League. Founded in 1913 \"to combat racial and religious prejudice,\" the ADL historically took a dim view of racial and ethnic preferences. In a brief filed in the 1978 Bakke case where the Court weighed the constitutionality of admissions preferences at the University of California's medical school, the ADL together with an Italian-American civil rights group, UNICO, attacked the California admissions program as \"reverse discrimination\" that was \"inconsistent with the mandates of the Fourteen Amendment's Equal Protection Clause...\"\n\nBut then something happened. The grandchildren of Ellis Islanders became alumni, their children became legacies and they stopped demanding meritocracy and instead began supporting carve outs that could help boost their own kids into the Ivy League .  Dink Stover lives. That is, the stereotypical WASP Yalie of 1912 has been joined a century later by another child of privilege, albeit one likely reflecting America's waves of immigration. And so a defense of civil rights has morphed into support for \"diversity.\"\n\nThe ADL also filed an amicus brief filed in connection with the present challenge to the University of Texas's admissions policies, and stood with the school - not the student plaintiff. It announced that through its own programs the ADL had reached \"literally hundreds of thousands of teachers and peer trainers and, through them, millions of students, in an effort both to eradicate bias and hate before it hardens, as well as to promote diversity and pluralism.\"\n\nOver the same time frame, however, fissures have emerged within the Asian-American community over affirmative action. In the Texas case, Asian-America groups have filed briefs on each side of the issue. Echoing sentiments expressed by the ADL forty years earlier, the Asian American Legal Foundation attacked the Texas program as \"odious\" and lobbed this rhetorical grenade, by quoting Supreme Court precedent and positing that perhaps Texas \"believes that Hispanics are somehow more valuable than Asians in promoting 'cross-racial understanding,' breaking down 'racial stereotypes,' and enabling students to 'better understand persons of different races.'\"\n\nThe cacophony surrounding racial preferences comes against the backdrop of the Great Recession, and growing inequality coupled with diminished upward mobility. In today's America, wealth and class are calcifying at the same time as our population becomes less racially and ethnically homogeneous. Whether or not someone's parents went to college matters, more and more. Race and ethnicity-based admissions may ultimately prove unconstitutional. But, we as a country will need to find a way to bring everyone along.\n\nIdeally, education should serve as a vehicle for advancement by poor and working class students regardless of race or ethnicity. However, given cash-strapped endowments, the avalanche of student debt and the diminished value of many college degrees in a globalized economy, getting there will not be easy.\n\nTo put things in perspective, almost half of college graduates hold jobs that do not require a college degree - 15 percent of cab drivers hold a B.A. as do a quarter of all sales clerks. Still, with college graduates earning 50 percent more than high school drop-outs and the unemployment rate of college graduates at half the national level, don't expect the demand for college entry to slacken.\n\nWhether the Court rules on the Texas case by the end of June or waits until it decides the Michigan challenge remains to be seen .   But whenever and however the Court decides, expect a fight to create winners and losers in any new system - and then a continuing one between those winners and losers.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Asians vs. Affirmative Action\n\nNearly 18 years ago, 61 percent of California's Asian-American electorate opposed California's Proposition 209, a statewide referendum, which barred race and ethnicity as considerations in state university admissions, government jobs and contracts . Notwithstanding, their opposition, Proposition 209 became law. Fast forward to March 2014, when California's Asian-American community helped blunt an effort in the state's legislature to gut the affirmative action ban. This recent pushback by California's Asian-American community is a reminder that upward mobility attained can reshape attitudes, and that the interests of the so-called Coalition of the Ascendant are not monolithic.\n\nTo be sure, emergent Asian-American opposition towards ethnicity-based affirmative action is grounded in personal experience, and is a long time coming. Already, back in 2005, a Princeton University study reported Asian-Americans, as opposed to whites, drew the short straw when it came to racial preferences . According to the study, if race conscious admissions were ended , \"Asian students would fill nearly four out of every five places in the admitted class not taken by African-American and Hispanic students.\"\n\nNot surprisingly then, Asian-American dissatisfaction with affirmative action has grown over time. In 2011, in a brief filed in the U.S. Supreme Court challenging affirmative action at the University of Texas, the Asian American Legal Foundation (AALF) attacked Texas' program as \"odious,\" and posited that perhaps Texas \"believes that Hispanics are somehow more valuable than Asians in promoting 'cross-racial understanding,' breaking down 'racial stereotypes,' and enabling students to 'better understand persons of different races.'\" Yes, the AALF was not the only Asian-American voice on the issue. But, it was a clear signal as to where the Asian-American community was trending.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnd then there are the differences in ethnic experiences and realities. According to Pew Research , a majority of third generation Asian-Americans hold college degrees and have a median household income of over $91,000.  In contrast, third generation median Hispanic household income has stalled at under $44,000, with fewer than one-in-five third generation Latinos holding a college degree.  The latest figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics tell a similar story, with Asian-American unemployment below the national average . Amy Chua's Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mom may be over the top, but it is not fiction .\n\nIndeed, it is not just Asian-Americans who have grown skeptical of affirmative action.  Rather, it is America as well. According to a 2013 Gallup survey, two-thirds of Americans-including nearly three-fifths of Hispanics-agreed that \"applicants should be admitted solely on the basis of merit, even if that results in few minority students being admitted.\"\n\nIn a sense, the latest kerfuffle over race-based entitlements is reminiscent of the 1960s and 1970s when the Democratic Party's core was at war with itself, and Jewish and African-Americans scuffled over university admissions quotas, as well as in teaching assignments in New York City public schools. Unlike California, it was physical, ugly and acrid back then.\n\nStill, if history is a guide, the Republican Party can only expect a limited upside. For all of the heat generated by skirmishes past, both Jews and African-Americans retained their fealty to the Democratic Party. The neo-conservative movement emerged from these clashes, and in 1980 Ronald Reagan captured nearly two-fifths of the Jewish vote. But, Reagan v. Carter was the highpoint of American Jews' flirtation with the GOP, and after that things essentially returned to the way they were. To put things into perspective, Barack Obama carried 93 percent of African-Americans, 73 percent of Asian-Americans, 71 percent of Latinos, and 69 percent of Jews.\n\nThe past has not been lost on the Asian-American community. According to Neil Malhotra , a Stanford University Business School Professor who has written on why Asian-Americans have switched their allegiance to the Democratic Party , \"Despite the differences I wouldn't call Jews a racial group, there are definitely some parallels.\"\n\nMalhotra continued, \"Jews attachment to the Democratic Party stretched back to the New Deal, and they have been politically socialized across multiple generations in the U.S. Asians are unique given that many of them are 'new' Americans, and the switch to the Democratic Party has been more dramatic and quick.\" As for why the quick switch by Asian-Americans, \"identity issues-whether they be racial, religious, etc.-is a major explanation, as the Republican Party has become more white and Christian very quickly over time.\"\n\nStill, affirmative action remains a potentially potent issue, albeit a limited one. Malhotra explains, \"unlike immigration, affirmative action is sort of a niche issue that is very important to select groups (e.g. parents of high-achieving college students and college students themselves).\"  However, he adds,    \"The GOP runs the risk of further alienating Hispanics at the risk of gaining Asians, which is why this is a wedge issue they haven't really touched much since the 1990s, where it clearly worked in their favor.\"\n\nIf 2012 is any indication, don't bet on the Republican Party going there. First, it is immigration-not affirmative action-that has captured the GOP's attention. For all of Mitt Romney's support for self-deportation, Romney actually backed affirmative action.  Presented with an opportunity to voice opposition to government sanctioned racial preferences during the run-up to the Michigan and Ohio primaries, Romney balked.\n\nSecond, as Malhotra described, opposition to affirmative action resonates with the identifiably upwardly mobile, and that is not where the Republicans' white working class base is today. As Ross Douthat trenchantly writes : \"Some of the most religious areas of the country-the Bible Belt, the deepest South-struggle mightily with poverty, poor health, political corruption and social disarray.\" Immigration and competition for jobs come first there. College? If only.  And as far as the GOP donor class goes, can you say legacies? After all is said and done, the squabble over affirmative action will most likely remain a low-key Democratic Party family feud, with the courts being  called in from time-to-time to referee.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Affirmative Action Lives! What Happened at the Supreme Court\n\nIn a surprising outcome, the Supreme Court today in a 7-1 decision allowed the University of Texas's policy on affirmative action in admissions to survive. Many court watchers were expecting the justices to outlaw or seriously curtail all uses of race by government actors. Instead, the justices simply overturned a lower-court decision because that court didn't analyze the law properly. But the court did not say that UT's policy was unconstitutional; indeed, on remand, it's possible the courts will uphold UT's policy.\n\nWhat's most interesting about today's decision is what it doesn't say. This case was argued in the first week of the Supreme Court's term, way back in October. Yet the opinion delivered today, which is only 13 pages in length and has only one, short, four-page dissent, did not take eight months to write. This is a case whose opinions, more likely, were written in a few days, probably within the last few weeks.\n\nMany people expected the court to overturn an important ruling from 2003, Grutter v. Bollinger. In that case, the court upheld the use of race in admissions to the University of Michigan, saying that such policies could survive even the most stringent judicial scrutiny. Diversity, the court held, was a compelling reason for universities to take race into account, so long as they avoided using quotas and considered each applicant individually. While Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia wrote separately in today's case that they were open to overturning Grutter, none of the other justices expressed agreement. Instead, all the others voted to maintain Grutter as the supreme law of the land. (Justice Elena Kagan was recused from the case because she participated in the suit as solicitor general.)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSo why did the short, do-nothing opinions in the UT case take over eight months to write? Almost certainly because these weren't the opinions being written for the past eight months. In all likelihood, the justices were writing different opinions, perhaps even a bold, forceful one from the court's conservatives outlawing all uses of race. That would explain the delay. Such a decision would have been difficult to write because it would have been contrary to nearly a half century of Supreme Court cases allowing some uses of race, like Grutter. The liberals would certainly have written impassioned dissents, calling out the conservatives for their judicial activism and assertive rewriting of the Constitution. The conservatives would have responded in kind, defending their approach. The back and forth could easily have gone on for months.\n\nWe don't know what happened, but one possibility is that the chief justice had cold feet. After a series of quite activist decisions early in his tenure-including the widely denounced ruling in Citizens United, permitting corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money to influence elections-Chief Justice John Roberts may finally be living up to his promise to support narrow, consensus rulings that don't upset current law. That certainly seems to be what happened in last year's Obamacare case, when he changed his vote at the last minute and decided to uphold the president's signature legislative accomplishment. Perhaps it happened here again, and the chief justice brokered a compromise to kick this case down the road for another day.\n\nThat he was able to do so in the UT case-if, indeed, that's what happened-it would be a remarkable accomplishment. Justice Anthony Kennedy, the author of today's opinion, has previously been highly critical of Grutter, dissenting in that case and castigating the majority for its \"abandonment of strict scrutiny.\" Yet, today, Kennedy wrote approvingly of Grutter and its approach to strict scrutiny.\n\nThe court's biggest affirmative-action case thus ends, like the world itself in T.S. Eliot's The Hollow Men : \"Not with a bang but a whimper.\"\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "In Affirmative-Action Case, History of 14th Amendment Is Inconvenient\n\nThe Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday ( PDF ) in a potentially landmark case that could spell the end of race-based affirmative action in higher education. The case involves a challenge to the University of Texas's admissions policy that makes race one relevant factor-along with the usual assortment of other criteria, like SAT score, grade-point average, being a legacy, and skills such as playing football or the tuba. Abigail Fisher, a white applicant who was denied admission, claims that UT's policy violates the 14th Amendment, which guarantees the \"equal protection of the laws.\"\n\nJudging from the justices' comments at oral arguments-which, lest we forget, can be misleading -her prospects of winning look quite good.\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court upheld the use of race as an admissions factor less than a decade ago , the current conservatives on the court were dismissive of the rationale used in that case. Chief Justice John Roberts suggested UT's effort to seek a \"critical mass\" of minority students was unworkable; Justice Antonin Scalia said Fisher \"was not treated fairly\"; and Justice Samuel Alito suggested that UT's policy privileges successful minorities over the interests of whites \"whose parents are absolutely average in terms of education and income.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, the one thing missing from today's oral argument was history. Justices Scalia and Clarence Thomas-both hostile to affirmative action-claim to be constitutional originalists. In other words, they say the Constitution in 2012 should be read to mean precisely what (we presume) the Framers meant in 1787, give or take a few decades.\n\nBut the irony is that the authors of the 14th Amendment believed that race-based affirmative action was entirely consistent with that provision . As their rulings on affirmative action show, Scalia and Thomas love history-but only when it suits them.\n\nThe 14th Amendment was adopted right after the Civil War as a way of insuring that the rights of the freedmen would not be denied by the Southern states. While the amendment's language is broad, it was not thought at the time to outlaw any and all uses of race by the government. In fact, the same men who drafted and ratified the 14th Amendment enacted a variety of laws intended to achieve, in the words of one congressman at the time, \"the amelioration of the condition of the colored people.\"\n\nSome of these laws are well known, such as the Freedmen's Bureau Acts, which established a federal agency to assist the freedmen secure housing, food, education, and education. But like today's affirmative-action policies, these laws were opposed by some on the grounds that they used race (or some equivalent proxy) to dole out benefits. West Virginia Sen. Waitman Willey criticized the Freedmen's Bureau Act because it made \"a distinction on account of color between the two races.\" One congressman insisted the Freedmen's Bureau was \"in opposition to the plain spirit\" of the Constitution, which required that \"congressional legislation should in its operation affect all alike.\"\n\nThese men thought that the Constitution should be completely colorblind. Today, that view is represented best perhaps by Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote in a 2007 school integration case \" The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race .\"\n\nRoberts's line was pithy, but also far removed from the original meaning of the 14th Amendment. In fact, time after time, the framers of that amendment rejected the idea that laws intended to help historically oppressed racial minorities had to be racially neutral.\n\nIn addition to the Freedmen's Bureau laws, Congress passed race-conscious laws designed to help secure enlistment bounties for \"colored soldiers\" who served in the Union Army and to provide for \"the relief of destitute colored women and children.\" The next year, a separate poverty bill was enacted for \"colored\" people of the District of Columbia.\n\nNo objective was more important to the framers of the 14th Amendment than improving access to education by racial minorities. Within a few years of establishment of the Freedmen's Bureau, the federal agency had created nearly 3,000 schools serving more than 150,000 students. Many of today's legendary black schools, like Howard University, can trace their origins to these post-Civil War efforts to integrate and educate African-Americans.\n\nAnd yet it looks like a case about affirmative action in education may well be the downfall of all race-conscious government policies.\n\nSo how do justices like Scalia and Thomas, who purport to be governed by historical understanding of the Constitution, square these laws with their consistent votes to overturn race-based affirmative action? They don't. Instead, they ignore this history entirely.\n\nScalia sometimes says that he'll break from history where there's a long line of Supreme Court cases that have settled expectations about the law. In the affirmative-action context, however, the court has repeatedly upheld the ability of colleges and universities to use race as one factor in admissions. The most recent case clearly holding that- Grutter v. Bollinger -was decided less than a decade ago. Yet no Supreme Court expert expects Scalia to respect that established tradition.\n\nPerhaps the lesson of the affirmative-action cases is that Justices Scalia and Thomas are originalists only when history and tradition match their preconceived notions of right and wrong.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "I Was for Affirmative Action, but Now I Think It Should Go Away\n\nHello affirmative action , my old friend . It's time to talk about you again.\n\nIn the Fall of 1984 as a high school senior in Central California, I had to write a 10-page paper on any topic for my American Government course. I chose to write about affirmative action in college admissions. The paper stretched 20 pages long.\n\nAs a Mexican-American applying to highly selective universities, I was carrying five advanced placement classes with a 4.0 GPA. I did five hours of homework every night, and I would eventually graduate with 96 A's and 22 A+'s on my high school transcript. Still, classmates with lower grades informed me that if I got accepted to an Ivy League school, it would only be because I was \"Mexican.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nI got accepted to three Ivies, including Harvard. That's where I earned my degree. At 25, I wrote my memoir . The first chapter was titled: \"If You Hadn't Been Mexican.\"\n\nMy friends were wrong. I was not a beneficiary of affirmative action. Harvard claims that it rewards excellence, and that's what I delivered. Conservatives insist I took the spot of a more well-deserving white kid, while liberals expect me to spend my life on bended knee out of gratitude for all they gave me. I reject what both camps are peddling.\n\nBut today, I also reject affirmative action. The concept has been in existence for more than 60 years . It almost certainly served a purpose for the first half of its existence-from 1961 to 1991. But, over the last 30 years, it has done its intended beneficiaries more harm than good by lowering academic standards, stigmatizing recipients, and masking severe inequalities at the K-12 level between white students and students of color.\n\nNow, affirmative action is once again the talk of the nation.\n\nThe Supreme Court has said that it will soon hear two cases- Students for Fair Admissions v. President and Fellows of Harvard College ; and Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina -that could spell the end for affirmative action in college and university admissions.\n\nIn the 2003 case Grutter v. Bollinger , the Supreme Court held that the social benefits of a diverse student body justified letting universities take applicants' race into account-with guidelines. It's Grutter that the plaintiffs in the Harvard and UNC cases aim to overturn.\n\nIn the landmark 1978 affirmative action case, Regents of the University of California v. Bakke , SCOTUS split the baby. It found that outright racial or ethnic quotas for applicants were unlawful, while also permitting colleges and universities to take race and ethnicity into account as long as it was just one factor among several.\n\nWhen Bakke was decided, I was just 11 years old. But my father was 37, and a third of the way into a law enforcement career that would last more than three decades.\n\nMy dad had always dreamed of being a police officer despite the fact that, for Mexican-Americans growing up in the 1940s, this concept wasn't much more fanciful than becoming an astronaut. By the 1970s, he was on his way toward living that dream. And following a stint in the U.S. Army, he went to night school and earned his bachelor's degree, helping him get promoted to police sergeant.\n\nHe continued to climb the ladder, and he'd be the first to admit that affirmative action helped him get hired at other law enforcement agencies. That makes sense. Police departments aren't the most progressive institutions. They sometimes need a nudge.\n\nMy parents' generation suffered real and overt discrimination, and so it made sense for affirmative action to give them a leg up. But it makes less sense to transfer that privilege to my children, who were raised in a wealthy suburb by parents with master's degrees.\n\nIn a July 2021 Gallup poll , roughly 62 percent of Americans supported affirmative action programs for people of color. But according to the analytics firm that conducted the poll, respondents might have been thinking about affirmative action in employment. When asked about college admissions, public support typically drops, as many Americans see alleged \"reverse discrimination\" against white people-and, more recently, against Asian-Americans.\n\nSorry, but the math doesn't pencil out. For instance, the undergraduate student body at Harvard is now about 37 percent white and 21 percent Asian. So, whites and Asians together account for a total of 58 percent of students. And that is someone's absurd definition of racial discrimination?\n\nConsider the Harvard case headed to the Supreme Court. It alleges the university set a quota to limit the number of Asians admitted and that it holds Asians to a higher standard than other applicants. In 2019, U.S. District Court Allison D. Burroughs rejected the plaintiff's claims, finding that Harvard was not unconstitutionally discriminating against Asian Americans. The plaintiff appealed, and lost again in the First Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld Burroughs' ruling.\n\nNonetheless, Americans are confident in what they know-even when they don't know much. The way many white people see it, affirmative action is a race hustle that rewards the unqualified and cheats the qualified, all to make up for past injustices.\n\nAs we approach 40 years together, that is not how I see affirmative action.\n\nFirst, I see that social engineering by race and ethnicity is a messy business, one that colleges and universities should stay out of. Employers are a different case. If a corporation decides-perhaps because of the product it sells-that it stands to benefit from hiring more women than men, that is its prerogative.\n\nNext, I see the absurdity in the claim that white Americans and Asian-Americans are being systematically discriminated against in a manner akin to how Dixiecrat Gov. Ross Barnett tried to prevent a Black student named James Meredith from enrolling at the University of Mississippi in 1961-the same year affirmative action was born. Meredith was thought by the racists of that era to be inferior. Is anyone suggesting that whites and Asians are inferior?\n\nFinally, I see that Americans have again missed the chance to have the conversation that we really need to have. We need to ask whether the real victims of affirmative action are actually its intended beneficiaries: Latinos and African Americans. Those groups are woefully shortchanged by the public school system, and no one talks about it because there is a sprinkling of Black and Latino students in the Ivy League?\n\nAffirmative action is a Band-Aid on a bullet wound. It benefits well-to-do minorities who have suffered little or no hardship while overlooking the truly needy who still need a leg up. Something that was invented to eliminate racism winds up promoting elitism.\n\nIf conservatives get their wish, the Supreme Court might soon end affirmative action in college and university admissions. If that occurs, the Band-Aid will be ripped off and the bullet wound will be exposed.\n\nOur public schools will finally have to step up and do a better job of teaching Black and Latino students so they can succeed on their own. They'll need to eliminate low expectations, require teachers to be more culturally competent, hire language and speech therapists to help students with special needs, and shelve the usual condescension long enough to involve parents in their children's education.\n\nI'm here for all of it. It was never the job of colleges and universities to attempt to cover up the educational inequalities of public schools. Americans might have seen through this facade decades ago, but affirmative action blocked our view.\n\nIt's time for it to go. Adios , old friend.\n\nruben@rubennavarrette.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "You turn to us for voices you won't hear anywhere else.\n\nSign up for Democracy Now!'s Daily Digest to get our latest headlines and stories delivered to your inbox every day.\n\nThe conservative majority of the U.S. Supreme Court has declared race-conscious admissions policies at colleges and universities across the country to be unlawful, effectively ending affirmative action in education. The landmark 6-3 ruling was along ideological lines and strikes down decades of precedent, but stops short of banning legacy admissions and allows military academies to continue using affirmative action. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman to serve on the court, assailed the majority's \"let-them-eat-cake obliviousness\" to questions of racism and equity. We host a roundtable discussion on the ruling and its impact with Wisdom Cole, national director of the NAACP Youth and College Division; Janelle Wong, director of Asian American studies and a professor of American studies and government and politics at the University of Maryland; and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Maria Hinojosa, founder of Futuro Media and host of the Latino USA podcast.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nToday, we spend the hour looking at new U.S. Supreme Court decisions that will have far-reaching implications in the lives of millions of people. We begin with the court's landmark ruling Thursday that gutted affirmative action when it ruled Harvard and the University of North Carolina's programs considering race in college admissions are unconstitutional. The 6-to-3 decision overturns long-standing precedent. The court stopped short of barring legacy admissions and will allow military academies to continue using affirmative action.\n\nWriting for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts assailed race-conscious admissions as \"elusive,\" \"imponderable\" and \"opaque,\" ruling they violate the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.\n\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman appointed to the court, wrote in her dissent the decision, quote, \"is truly a tragedy for us all.\" She added, \"With let-them-eat-cake obliviousness, today, the majority pulls the ripcord and announces 'colorblindness for all' by legal fiat.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Justice Clarence Thomas, who's now the longest-serving justice on the conservative-majority court and is African American, sided with the majority and read his concurrence from the bench, saying, quote, \"Even in the segregated South where I grew up, individuals were not the sum of their skin [color]. ... While I am painfully aware of the social and economic ravages which have befallen my race and all who suffer discrimination, I hold out enduring hope that this country will live up to its principles so clearly enunciated in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States: that all men are created equal, are equal citizens, and must be treated equally before the law.\" That was Justice Clarence Thomas Thursday.\n\nDuring the oral arguments for this case, Justice Thomas questioned North Carolina state Solicitor General Ryan Park, who represented the University of North Carolina.\n\nJUSTICE CLARENCE THOMAS : I didn't go to racially diverse schools, but there were educational benefits. And I'd like you to tell me expressly, when a parent sends a kid to college, that they don't necessarily send them there to have fun or feel good or anything like that. They send them there to learn physics or chemistry or whatever they're studying. So, tell me what the educational benefits are.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This comes as PBS Frontline examined Justice Thomas's stance on affirmative action from his time in law school to Thursday's ruling. Frontline reported on how Thomas arrived at Yale Law School as one of 12 Black students, and interviewed his classmate John Bolton, former national security adviser.\n\nJOHN BOLTON : He believed that people assumed he was there as a beneficiary of affirmative action, and it grated on him.\n\nMICHAEL FLETCHER : He has this feeling of, \"Oh, I'm around these white students,\" who he senses question his presence at Yale. How is it that you - not just you, Clarence Thomas, but you, all you Black students - are here? Is it because of merit? Or is it because of affirmative action?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Today, we begin today's show with a roundtable discussion on the Supreme Court's restriction of consideration of race in college admissions, effectively overturning decades of court precedent. Wisdom Cole, NAACP national director of Youth and College Division, is with us. Janelle Wong is director of Asian American Studies, professor of American studies and government and politics at the University of Maryland. Her piece for the Los Angeles Times , \"Affirmative action isn't hurting Asian Americans. Here's why that myth survives.\" And Maria Hinojosa, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, founder of Futuro Media, host of Latino USA , co-host of the podcast In the Thick .\n\nWe welcome you all to Democracy Now! Wisdom Cole, let's begin with you. The Supreme Court has gutted affirmative action in colleges and universities around the country - oh, well, not in military academies. But can you, overall, respond?\n\nWISDOM COLE : You know, this was a devastating decision. You know, a rogue court bowed down to an extremist-minority influence that is going to impact the next generation of thought leaders and Americans. You know, in this moment in time, we need to see our colleges, universities and even corporations commit to diversity, no matter what.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And if you can talk further about the significance of this decision and what has puzzled many, that while chief justice, who read the decision out for the majority, said that this doesn't apply - this cannot apply anymore to colleges - this actually, by the way, goes into effect in 2028, 25 years after an affirmative action decision in 2003 that was authored by the Republican Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor - that this applies to colleges and universities, but not to military academies, where he saw value in officer diversity - the idea of fine for the barracks but not the boardroom?\n\nWISDOM COLE : Yeah, you know, the same value that we have in making sure that we are having diversity in our military, we have to have that same value for higher education, because oftentimes higher education is the access to the halls of power. Right? We want to make sure that our colleges and universities truly reflect America when it comes to diversity of thought. You know, we need to make sure that we have some of the most diverse minds thinking about the best solutions to some of the most difficult problems that we are facing in America today. And if we are removing that access for diverse students to that space and place in higher education, then we are not meeting the mark, and we're going to miss the moment, and we're not going to be able to solve the problems that are coming our way.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You wrote in social media, \"Our future depends on racial equity and diversity in higher education, the SCOTUS Affirmative Action decision has put us on a path to re-segregate our educational system.\" Can you explain?\n\nWISDOM COLE : You know, this decision is going to have impacts for generations to come. And when we think about the way in which young people have the options and choices to go to different colleges and universities, we shouldn't think that the gutting of affirmative action is now an influence or push for young people just to go to HBCUs. Yes, we need to highly invest in our HBCUs and our MSIs and ensure that young people have access to those places and spaces, but young people need to have options and choices to go to whatever universities they want to see. I think it's important for us to understand that we cannot be on a path to resegregate higher education as we know it today, because that is effectively rolling back the rights that are being fought for each and every single day.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to turn to Janelle Wong, who's director of Asian American Studies, professor of American studies and government and politics at the University of Maryland. You wrote a piece with the great writer Viet Thanh Nguyen titled \"Affirmative action isn't hurting Asian Americans. Here's why that myth survives.\" Now, this is extremely significant for people to understand where this case came from. If you can talk about the Students for Fair Admissions, this done supposedly to stop discrimination against Asian Americans?\n\nJANELLE WONG : Well, this is an extremely disappointing ruling, especially because, as you say, a false narrative about an Asian American penalty was used for target one essential tool - affirmative action - that helps open up doors to diversity and opportunities for education. And that is, the group suing Harvard intentionally went to Asian Americans to provide cover for its white supremacist agenda. And there's evidence that the person who brought this case, Edward Blum, actually went to an open dinner and said, \"I need to find an Asian American plaintiff.\" And many Asian Americans - certainly not all, but way too many - fell for the trap.\n\nCivil rights lawyer Mark Rosenbaum gets it right: Race blind is blind to systemic racism. And the truth is that the lower courts found no evidence of racial discrimination against Asian Americans. Not one single Asian American student testified to racial discrimination. Not one single Asian American came forward because they were rejected due to affirmative action.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that, despite the headlines, the consideration of race in admissions is not banned in totality. Affirmative action is gutted, severely weakened, but colleges can ask students to discuss in their essays how race shapes their lives. This is permissible. So, it's also important, I think, that the ruling also applies only to the higher education context, not to other programs, such as minority contracting programs.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to go to Christine Lee. Democracy Now! reached her last night. She just graduated from Harvard in May. She was the head of the Harvard Korean Association, which is one of 25 Harvard student and alumni organizations that filed an amicus brief in support of college admissions policies that foster diversity.\n\nCHRISTINE LEE : My name is Christine Lee. I'm a recent graduate from Harvard College and former co-president of the Harvard Korean Association, or HKA . I assumed leadership of HKA while the amicus brief preparations were underway with the Legal Defense Fund through the NAACP . I already felt rather strongly, I think, about the importance of building diverse educational environments and understanding how affirmative action played a critical role in that, but I think seeing the collective efforts from other student organizations in advocating for this cause was the greatest privilege.\n\nI can only speak to my own experiences as one student, an Asian American woman at Harvard, but I can say with full confidence that those who subscribe to the widely publicized view of what it means to, quote-unquote, \"deserve\" a position at an Ivy League position, what it means to champion, quote-unquote, \"merit-based admissions,\" they haven't met the incredible students, especially students of color, I was lucky enough to call my peers at Harvard. I mean, I didn't know the test scores or GPA of every student I sat next to in class or every student I ate meals with in the dining hall, but what I did know was that their unique stories, the stories that they had to share, they enhanced my own life and journey in a very singular way. And I truly believe that universities have something of an obligation to create rich, diverse, unique learning environments in this way. And I also believe that's an obligation not only to their students and the university, but to the greater public, as well.\n\nI think this is on my mind a lot more just as a recent graduate, but I can imagine the implications that the recent Supreme Court decision will have reaching into the professional world, as well. Legal experts will definitely know far more on this subject than me, but I can't help but feel like there's a likely danger of us seeing fewer people of color going into academia as professors, fewer people of color going into medicine, law, environmental policy. And I worry that those vital perspectives are in danger of fading away, if not right away, then definitely over time.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You were just listening to and watching Christine Lee, just graduated from Harvard University, former head of the Harvard Korean Association. And, Professor Wong, what's so interesting about this is that, really, her comments concur with the majority of Asian Americans in the country. A Pew poll just found that the majority of Asian Americans favor affirmative action. So, talk more deeply about who the organization is that brought this lawsuit that ended up in the Supreme Court.\n\nJANELLE WONG : The organization is called Students for Fair Admissions. And that organization is led by Ed Blum, who is a conservative white male who has gone on the attack for race-conscious programs beyond affirmative action. Affirmative action is one of a suite of policies that seek to consider race to ensure racial equality. So, Ed Blum successfully brought a case against - the Shelby v. Holder case, which gutted the Voting Rights Act. He has also tried to undermine immigrant voting rights.\n\nAnd so, he had brought this case against - brought a case against affirmative action to the University of Texas, and his key plaintiff there was Abigail Fisher, a white woman. When that was not successful, he purposefully sought out an Asian American plaintiff, again, because it provides not only cover for his white supremacist agenda, but also because Asian Americans - there is a narrative about Asian Americans facing a penalty in college admissions. That narrative is very powerful, even though it was adjudicated thoroughly in the lower courts, and the courts, with hundreds and hundreds of pages of evidence, statistical modeling and testimony from Asian American students who supported affirmative action, that - the lower courts found there was no intentional discrimination against Asian American students.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to bring Maria Hinojosa into this discussion. Chief Justice John Roberts said for too long universities have \"concluded, wrongly, that the touchstone of an individual's identity is not challenges bested, skills built, or lessons learned but the color of their skin. Our constitutional history does not tolerate that choice.\" You have Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the court's first Latina, writing in dissent, the decision rolls back \"decades of precedent and momentous progress.\" And, of course, you have Justice Jackson saying, though she had to recuse herself from the Harvard case because of her involvement with Harvard, weighed in on the North Carolina case, talked about deciding that - she wrote - let me see if I can find her quote - she said \"deeming race irrelevant in law does not make it so in life.\" Maria, your response?\n\nMARIA HINOJOSA : Thanks, Amy.\n\nThis is - it is a historic day in our country, and yet it is not shocking. In many ways, as I'm listening to the reporting that's coming up, I mean - and this is, for me, kind of writ large, which is, actually, how this Supreme Court will be devalued in the rest of the country because of decisions like this. That's a broad structural issue - right? - where you have a country that says this Supreme Court does not represent us, nor does it represent the majority opinion in the United States. And so, that, to me, is of concern, because, as you know, I wasn't born in this country, and there's this kind of image for immigrants that we hold the Supreme Court in this kind of esteem. Well, we're seeing through that.\n\nAs you point out, the fact that they're saying, \"It's OK for the barracks. We'll take your bodies and use them for war\" - by the way, if you're an immigrant or even undocumented, the possibilities of getting into the military ease your road in this country. So the pathway to military is completely open, and the pathway to legacy, which is, essentially, if we're going to be honest in our country, white supremacy.\n\nNow, I'm a professor. I've been in academia for a decade now. And I will tell you that what the data shows is that Latinos and Latinas have the highest rate of going from high school to college at this point. So, there's hard data there. And I have met college presidents, Amy, who have told me, \"We have a financial plan for, you know, this small, independent liberal arts college in the Midwest.\" And I was like, \"Well, what's your financial plan?\" \"We're making sure that we're getting every single Latino that we can to come here.\" It's a market decision, it's a business decision, that colleges and universities are going to be faced with, because look at the demographics of our country. It is unsustainable if you're only accepting white legacy students. That's not sustainable.\n\nSo, I'm trying to bring a different analysis. I understand everything - the shock, the horror, the disgust, the rage, the disappointment. But I'm also - I want to make sure that our kids understand that this is not - this cannot stop them. Cannot stop them. All of us on this call have - and you, as a white woman, Amy - we have gone through not just microaggressions, frontal aggressions. It makes us stronger. It makes us understand exactly what we represent in this country, what kind of country we want to have.\n\nSo, this - I'm going to quote Dolores Huerta, right? This is a moment to organize. This is a moment to build solidarity. And this is a moment to tell our young people, \"You got this. We are behind you. And by the way, you have power in this conversation. Do not cede your power. Do not give up, because we need you.\" And it's very important for me to continue to reiterate this message: Do not take this as a defeat. We've been defeated so many times in this country, and we're not going to give up. There's no other option. We cannot just give up and just say, \"OK, affirmative action, well, what do we\" - give up on what? We're going to to double down, because the future of this country, as we know - and I think that this is central to this decision - is increasingly not white. That is at the core of what we're talking about. But that's just data. That is the future of this country.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Maria Hinojosa, you have also been very vocal about the lack of diversity in newsrooms. After the Supreme Court affirmative action decision, the award-winning journalist, Reveal investigative journalist Aura Bogado said on Twitter, \"Universities will soon look like newsrooms.\" If you can respond to that? And also, I keep going back to this issue of John Roberts saying we're going to carve out military academies, because there is value in officer diversity, and this whole issue of they can go to the barracks, but when it comes to the boardroom and other places in civil society in this country, they're going to stand firm, these conservative justices, and say no to affirmative action.\n\nMARIA HINOJOSA : It's right in front of us, Amy. You know, there isn't - we don't have to pull the wool off of anybody's eyes. They are saying it clearly and, to me, doubling down on the question of legacy, which is legacy is fine, but - and legacy is - it is so clear what is happening. And this is why, again, the horror - not just disappointment, the horror of this Supreme Court, right? And I think about Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown having to sit with these so-called colleagues.\n\nAnd, yes, everybody, by the way, should watch that Frontline documentary on Clarence Thomas, because I understood that people - you know, I was the first Latina hired at NPR , right? I was one of very few Latinas at Barnard College, where I'm now a professor. I have been that one, that first one. And so, that kind of \"What are you doing here?\" always it's just a part of my life. And again, for the young people, so, what you do is you internalize that, and you say, \"And this is part of my struggle\" - right? - \"to be the best possible.\" Again, I know people don't want to hear this, \"Oh, you know, you've got to be the best possible,\" but that is the name of the game in the United States of America, where white supremacy is trying to hold on as much as possible. Again, for Latinos and Latinas, very important. And this is a very important moment for their understanding of where they put their alliances. Right? This is not - and we have to talk about this, where Latinos and Latinas can easily identify as white, because it's privilege. This is a moment to understand solidarity and what this means for the future of our country, working together for true representation.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Wisdom Cole, if you can talk about the kind of organizing that's going around now? I mean, with these affirmative action decisions, you always see NAACP out in front of the Supreme Court. You have, for example, University of California, that outlawed affirmative action years ago, people of color, particularly the Latinx population and the Black population, their representation being gutted in the UC college system. How are people organizing right now?\n\nWISDOM COLE : You know, I myself am a graduate of the University of California, Santa Cruz. And we consistently saw less and less Black folks enrolled in the universities, but even those who were enrolled in those universities were not graduating. Right? You know, the retention level and the work necessary to ensure that young people of color, young Black people were retained at these institutions of power was not there. And so, we had to institute student outreach programs, where we made sure that we were actually working to outreach to young people who were interested in coming to the university, but also making sure there were supports on campus to ensure that they stay at that university and are supported, and not facing the micro and macroaggressions that happen at these predominantly white institutions.\n\nSo, across the nation now, we are really pushing and telling universities and colleges to commit to diversity, no matter what. That looks like instituting outreach and retention programs. That looks at looking at debt-free college options. That looks at making sure that the student population is aware of what they are doing to contribute to white supremacist culture, and creating a society and creating a campus culture that is truly about diversity, equity, inclusion.\n\nYou know, in this moment in time, young people are looking for solutions. They're looking for answers. Young people are scared. Young people are thinking about their future. They're thinking about their nephews. They're thinking about their sisters, their brothers, the generations that are to come who are going to be entering those college spaces in the next couple years.\n\nIn this moment in time, we have to set up the structures that are going to allow those young people not just to survive on campus, but to thrive on campus. And we have to all do our part. And so, that means making sure that we are working hand in hand with these universities, making sure there is guidance, and making sure that young people are at front of this movement and that we are uplifting the voices of the most marginalized.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And, Wisdom, what about the issue of class or income as a factor in admission? And this goes directly with the decision today of the Supreme Court on student debt.\n\nWISDOM COLE : You know, we have to understand that the decision around affirmative action and the decision around Biden's student loan forgiveness program are not mutually exclusive. You know, if the Supreme Court strikes down Biden's student loan plan today, you know, like I said, effectively, we are on a pathway to resegregate education as we know it today, but also declare that the American dream is dead. You know, higher education is the pathway to economic mobility in this country. And so it's absolutely important that we understand all the factors that contribute to a young person entering into higher education today. We have to make sure that there is pathways to ensure that they are successful, and not barriers that are going to deter them from being a part of these institutions.\n\nYou know, again, we want to make sure that we are promoting diversity of thought, we are promoting diversity of ideology, we're promoting diversity of experience. All of these things are necessary to contribute to a thriving society in America today. We have gone through so much over the past couple years.

The plaintiffs argued the admissions process discriminates against white and Asian American applicants by giving priority consideration to Black, Hispanic and Native American applicants. The decision could jeopardize affirmative action initiatives implemented after the civil rights movement to give more equal opportunities to people disadvantaged by centuries of racial discrimination and the legacy of slavery. John C. Yang, president and executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice, says his organization investigated the allegations against Harvard and found no discrimination, but rather that \"allowing race to be considered benefited Asian Americans.\" Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women's Law Center, says rescinding affirmative action programs risks harming students of color and will dramatically decrease the racial diversity that has shown to benefit colleges.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The Supreme Court heard arguments Monday in two cases that aim to end race-conscious admissions decisions by colleges and universities. During nearly five hours of arguments, the court's far-right supermajority indicated it's open to ruling that the consideration of race in the admissions process violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution and the Civil Rights Act.\n\nThe two cases involve Harvard and the University of North Carolina. In both cases, plaintiffs argued the school's admissions process discriminates against white and Asian American applicants by giving extra preference to Black, Latino and Native American applicants. In the Harvard case, the plaintiffs argued Asian American applicants faced specific discrimination.\n\nThis is Supreme Justice Clarence Thomas, the only conservative justice of color, questioning the lawyer representing University of North Carolina, Ryan Park.\n\nJUSTICE CLARENCE THOMAS : I didn't go to racially diverse schools, but there were educational benefits. And I'd like you to tell me expressly, when a parent sends a kid to college, they don't necessarily send them there to have fun or feel good or anything like that. They send them there to learn physics or chemistry or whatever they're studying. So, tell me what the educational benefits are.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Meanwhile, the Supreme Court's first Black woman justice and newest member, Ketanji Brown Jackson, recused herself from arguments in the Harvard case because of her ties to the university, but she was a prominent voice in the first half of the arguments involving the University of North Carolina. She repeatedly asked about the harm in considering race as a factor in admissions to ensure a diverse student body. Here she questions attorney Patrick Strawbridge, who argued on behalf of so-called Students for Fair Admissions, a group founded by white conservative lawyer Ed Blum, who has brought multiple cases before the Supreme Court that challenge race-conscious policymaking as unconstitutional.\n\nJUSTICE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON : I'm hoping to get your reaction to this hypothetical. The first applicant says, \"I am from North Carolina. My family has been in this area for generations, since before the Civil War, and I would like you to know that I will be the fifth generation to graduate from the University of North Carolina. I now have that opportunity to do that, and given my family background, it's important to me that I get to attend this university. I want to honor my family's legacy by going to this school.\"\n\nThe second applicant says, \"I'm from North Carolina. My family has been in this area for generations, since before the Civil War, but they were slaves and never had a chance to attend this venerable institution. As an African American, I now have that opportunity, and given my family background, it's important to me to attend this university. I want to honor my family legacy by going to this school.\"\n\nNow, as I understand your no-race-conscious-admissions rule, these two applicants would have a dramatically different opportunity to tell their family's stories and to have them count. The first applicant would be able to have his family background considered and valued by the institution as part of its consideration of whether or not to admit him, while the second one wouldn't be able to, because his story is, in many ways, bound up with his race and with the race of his ancestors.\n\nSo I want to know, based on how your rule would likely play out in scenarios like that, why excluding consideration of race in a situation in which the person is not saying that his race is something that has impacted him in a negative way, he just wants to have it honored, just like the other person has their personal background family story honored - why is telling him \"no\" not an equal protection violation?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in oral arguments Monday. The Supreme Court's rulings in the two cases are due next year, likely in June.\n\nFor more, we're joined by two guests from Washington, D.C. John Yang is president and executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice, was one of the speakers at a rally for affirmative action outside the court Monday. We're also joined by Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women's Law Center.\n\nWe welcome you both to Democracy Now! Fatima Goss Graves, let's begin with you. You were tweeting nonstop yesterday. Talk about the significance of the arguments and where you think the supermajority is going right now.\n\nFATIMA GOSS GRAVES : Well, I have to begin with the fact that this is the fourth time the Supreme Court has heard what is essentially the same question, and before this year, each time they had come down with real clarity that you could consider race in the context of a holistic admissions process. What is different this time is the dramatic shift in the composition of the court, and that's why we went into the argument worried and skeptical that the three new justices would join their conservative colleagues, despite the fact that there's clear precedent to rely on and despite the fact that there is a broad case to be made, as you heard Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson make, of not only the ongoing discrimination, but the historical discrimination that these programs in part help to address.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, Fatima, could you talk about specifically the Harvard case, what happened at the lower court, at the district court level, and how this case wound its way up to the Supreme Court?\n\nFATIMA GOSS GRAVES : Well, you have to begin with the fact that there is a very conservative lawyer who has brought these set of cases, named Ed Blum. And Ed Blum has made arguments that the affirmative action program at Harvard inherently discriminates against the Asian American community. It's really important to actually understand that Ed Blum is not a student, and Ed Blum is not Asian American himself. In fact, one of the things that you saw both outside of the court and participating in this case is Asian American students naming the many benefits that they receive from participating in diverse education programs.\n\nAnd I will tell you, along the way, what courts have found, really importantly, is two things. One, that the admissions programs considered race not as sole factors, not as only factors, but as one of many factors as part of a program that was holistic. So, it's a part of the background and experiences and interests and talents that people put on display when they're seeking to be admitted into schools.\n\nBut the second thing that I think was really important, both in the Harvard and the UNC case, is that the courts, along the way, reiterated the initial holding from Bakke , that was - that 20 years ago you had come again in Gratz and Grutter , where the court said that consideration of race as one of many factors to create a diverse student body, that schools have a compelling interest in doing so. So, if the court rejects that idea, rejects the idea that race actually is one of many factors that a court consider in its admissions program, we will see dramatic differences in admissions processes.\n\nWe already have states that have had that experiment, and we know that it has not only reduced the number of students of color who have attended those schools, but it also has dramatically changed their experience there. It has left them more isolated, more subject to additional discrimination. And so we will have effects not only for the students who are in those classes, but for the generations to come, for the workforce, for the community around it, for how people's feelings of belonging actually endure and their connection to their community.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And I'd like to bring in John Yang, as well, president and executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice. John, the prior Supreme Court cases have focused on how affirmative action is to the detriment of white students, but now in this set of cases there's also the issue of how, allegedly, affirmative action affects Asian Americans. Why did you feel your organization had to get involved in this case? And your perspective on how - whether Harvard was indeed discriminating against Asian Americans?\n\nJOHN YANG : Well, thank you very much, Juan, for that question. And let me pick up on something that Fatima mentioned, which is Ed Blum, when he lost a case in Fisher , he explicitly said, \"I need to find Asian American plaintiffs.\" Now, why he did that was - we knew this - he would try to use us as a political wedge, to drive us between other communities of color.\n\nLook, if there was actual discrimination against Asian Americans at Harvard or UNC , my organization would probably sue. But when we looked at the evidence, it was clear to us that Asian Americans were not being discriminated against. The policies in place at Harvard and UNC , this using race-conscious admissions, allowing race to be considered, benefited Asian Americans. So we were actually involved in the case on the side of Harvard representing Asian American what are called interveners, so that they could tell their stories in court about how affirmative action, how race-conscious admissions actually helped them, and how having a diverse campus at Harvard really benefited their educational process.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to go back to the oral arguments Monday. U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued Supreme Court precedent has been key to increasing diversity in higher education, which then shapes representation in the workforce. She gave this example of \"gross disparity\" in representation.\n\nELIZABETH PRELOGAR : The second category I would point to is the one I've already referenced, demographics. I think that that can be relevant, again, not to set a quota, not to identify a precise numerical threshold, but in recognition that when there are extreme disparities in representation of certain groups, it can cause people to wonder whether the path to leadership is open.\n\nAnd if I could, maybe I could just give, I think, a commonsense example of that, that I would hope would resonate with this court. The court is going to hear from 27 advocates in this sitting of the oral argument calendar, and two are women, even though women today are 50% or more of law school graduates. And I think it would be reasonable for a woman to look at that and wonder, \"Is that a path that's open to me, to be a Supreme Court advocate?\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Fatima Goss Graves, you tweeted about this. Your response? And talk about what this means, the people that would be brought forward, their stories.\n\nFATIMA GOSS GRAVES : You know, I thought that the solicitor general's argument was very powerful here. It's not a secret that the Supreme Court Bar is one of the least diverse places. Very few women, hardly any women of color, argue before the court in any given term. And when we take a similar example of what you might see and experience in some settings, in the brief that the National Women's Law Center filed in the case, we talked about how you could have some programs where a student of color or a woman of color, in particular, might be the only student like them.\n\nAnd that isolation has real-time effects, not only because of the leadership questions that the solicitor general named, but also it reminds you that you are the own. You might have to, by yourself, represent your whole race when you are the own. You know, so, there are both the many benefits from diverse institutions, but the real harm of segregation and isolation that could come from a decision that overturns Grutter , it really is startling.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, John Yang, I'd like to ask you - as has been mentioned previously, this is the fourth time in 20 years that the Supreme Court has tackled this issue. Obviously, there was the Bakke decision. There was the University of Michigan case. Why has affirmative action been so contentious and been forced - been brought up to the highest court in the land so often in recent decades?\n\nJOHN YANG : Well, at the end of the day, I think people are still uncomfortable - certain people are uncomfortable with the fact that we are still grappling with race issues in the United States. Now, let's be clear: It's only been about 60 years since the Civil Rights Acts of the 1960s were passed. So, for people to suggest that we are in a post-racial society, that we could be somehow race-blind, I think is just being naive. Now, obviously, there are those that want to bring up these cases because they want to enforce this notion that we shouldn't look at race, that race shouldn't matter. But we know that it matters. In everyday life, we know that it matters.\n\nAnd so, when we're talking about educational decisions, admissions to colleges, certainly the notion that students should be able to talk about their race, their ethnicity, what that meant to their upbringing and the challenges that they faced, as well as the legacies that they are trying to honor, it should be important to that process. And one of the things that we find very disturbing is if race-conscious admissions are not allowed in colleges, then it really would be silencing a large group of students, students of color, in terms of talking about their own experiences. That's why we think these cases matter, and that's what we want to drive home to the courts.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to thank you both for being with us, John Yang, president and executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice, and Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women's Law Center, both speaking to us from Washington, D.C.\n\nComing up, as Israel holds its fifth national election in less than four years, we speak to Jan Egeland, head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, calling on Israel to end its decades-long occupation. Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

The landmark 6-3 ruling was along ideological lines and strikes down decades of precedent, but stops short of banning legacy admissions and allows military academies to continue using affirmative action. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman to serve on the court, assailed the majority's \"let-them-eat-cake obliviousness\" to questions of racism and equity. We host a roundtable discussion on the ruling and its impact with Wisdom Cole, national director of the NAACP Youth and College Division; Janelle Wong, director of Asian American studies and a professor of American studies and government and politics at the University of Maryland; and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Maria Hinojosa, founder of Futuro Media and host of the Latino USA podcast.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nToday, we spend the hour looking at new U.S. Supreme Court decisions that will have far-reaching implications in the lives of millions of people. We begin with the court's landmark ruling Thursday that gutted affirmative action when it ruled Harvard and the University of North Carolina's programs considering race in college admissions are unconstitutional. The 6-to-3 decision overturns long-standing precedent. The court stopped short of barring legacy admissions and will allow military academies to continue using affirmative action.\n\nWriting for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts assailed race-conscious admissions as \"elusive,\" \"imponderable\" and \"opaque,\" ruling they violate the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.\n\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman appointed to the court, wrote in her dissent the decision, quote, \"is truly a tragedy for us all.\" She added, \"With let-them-eat-cake obliviousness, today, the majority pulls the ripcord and announces 'colorblindness for all' by legal fiat.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Justice Clarence Thomas, who's now the longest-serving justice on the conservative-majority court and is African American, sided with the majority and read his concurrence from the bench, saying, quote, \"Even in the segregated South where I grew up, individuals were not the sum of their skin [color]. ... While I am painfully aware of the social and economic ravages which have befallen my race and all who suffer discrimination, I hold out enduring hope that this country will live up to its principles so clearly enunciated in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States: that all men are created equal, are equal citizens, and must be treated equally before the law.\" That was Justice Clarence Thomas Thursday.\n\nDuring the oral arguments for this case, Justice Thomas questioned North Carolina state Solicitor General Ryan Park, who represented the University of North Carolina.\n\nJUSTICE CLARENCE THOMAS : I didn't go to racially diverse schools, but there were educational benefits. And I'd like you to tell me expressly, when a parent sends a kid to college, that they don't necessarily send them there to have fun or feel good or anything like that. They send them there to learn physics or chemistry or whatever they're studying. So, tell me what the educational benefits are.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This comes as PBS Frontline examined Justice Thomas's stance on affirmative action from his time in law school to Thursday's ruling. Frontline reported on how Thomas arrived at Yale Law School as one of 12 Black students, and interviewed his classmate John Bolton, former national security adviser.\n\nJOHN BOLTON : He believed that people assumed he was there as a beneficiary of affirmative action, and it grated on him.\n\nMICHAEL FLETCHER : He has this feeling of, \"Oh, I'm around these white students,\" who he senses question his presence at Yale. How is it that you - not just you, Clarence Thomas, but you, all you Black students - are here? Is it because of merit? Or is it because of affirmative action?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Today, we begin today's show with a roundtable discussion on the Supreme Court's restriction of consideration of race in college admissions, effectively overturning decades of court precedent. Wisdom Cole, NAACP national director of Youth and College Division, is with us. Janelle Wong is director of Asian American Studies, professor of American studies and government and politics at the University of Maryland. Her piece for the Los Angeles Times , \"Affirmative action isn't hurting Asian Americans. Here's why that myth survives.\" And Maria Hinojosa, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, founder of Futuro Media, host of Latino USA , co-host of the podcast In the Thick .\n\nWe welcome you all to Democracy Now! Wisdom Cole, let's begin with you. The Supreme Court has gutted affirmative action in colleges and universities around the country - oh, well, not in military academies. But can you, overall, respond?\n\nWISDOM COLE : You know, this was a devastating decision. You know, a rogue court bowed down to an extremist-minority influence that is going to impact the next generation of thought leaders and Americans. You know, in this moment in time, we need to see our colleges, universities and even corporations commit to diversity, no matter what.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And if you can talk further about the significance of this decision and what has puzzled many, that while chief justice, who read the decision out for the majority, said that this doesn't apply - this cannot apply anymore to colleges - this actually, by the way, goes into effect in 2028, 25 years after an affirmative action decision in 2003 that was authored by the Republican Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor - that this applies to colleges and universities, but not to military academies, where he saw value in officer diversity - the idea of fine for the barracks but not the boardroom?\n\nWISDOM COLE : Yeah, you know, the same value that we have in making sure that we are having diversity in our military, we have to have that same value for higher education, because oftentimes higher education is the access to the halls of power. Right? We want to make sure that our colleges and universities truly reflect America when it comes to diversity of thought. You know, we need to make sure that we have some of the most diverse minds thinking about the best solutions to some of the most difficult problems that we are facing in America today. And if we are removing that access for diverse students to that space and place in higher education, then we are not meeting the mark, and we're going to miss the moment, and we're not going to be able to solve the problems that are coming our way.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You wrote in social media, \"Our future depends on racial equity and diversity in higher education, the SCOTUS Affirmative Action decision has put us on a path to re-segregate our educational system.\" Can you explain?\n\nWISDOM COLE : You know, this decision is going to have impacts for generations to come. And when we think about the way in which young people have the options and choices to go to different colleges and universities, we shouldn't think that the gutting of affirmative action is now an influence or push for young people just to go to HBCUs. Yes, we need to highly invest in our HBCUs and our MSIs and ensure that young people have access to those places and spaces, but young people need to have options and choices to go to whatever universities they want to see. I think it's important for us to understand that we cannot be on a path to resegregate higher education as we know it today, because that is effectively rolling back the rights that are being fought for each and every single day.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to turn to Janelle Wong, who's director of Asian American Studies, professor of American studies and government and politics at the University of Maryland. You wrote a piece with the great writer Viet Thanh Nguyen titled \"Affirmative action isn't hurting Asian Americans. Here's why that myth survives.\" Now, this is extremely significant for people to understand where this case came from. If you can talk about the Students for Fair Admissions, this done supposedly to stop discrimination against Asian Americans?\n\nJANELLE WONG : Well, this is an extremely disappointing ruling, especially because, as you say, a false narrative about an Asian American penalty was used for target one essential tool - affirmative action - that helps open up doors to diversity and opportunities for education. And that is, the group suing Harvard intentionally went to Asian Americans to provide cover for its white supremacist agenda. And there's evidence that the person who brought this case, Edward Blum, actually went to an open dinner and said, \"I need to find an Asian American plaintiff.\" And many Asian Americans - certainly not all, but way too many - fell for the trap.\n\nCivil rights lawyer Mark Rosenbaum gets it right: Race blind is blind to systemic racism. And the truth is that the lower courts found no evidence of racial discrimination against Asian Americans. Not one single Asian American student testified to racial discrimination. Not one single Asian American came forward because they were rejected due to affirmative action.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that, despite the headlines, the consideration of race in admissions is not banned in totality. Affirmative action is gutted, severely weakened, but colleges can ask students to discuss in their essays how race shapes their lives. This is permissible. So, it's also important, I think, that the ruling also applies only to the higher education context, not to other programs, such as minority contracting programs.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to go to Christine Lee. Democracy Now! reached her last night. She just graduated from Harvard in May. She was the head of the Harvard Korean Association, which is one of 25 Harvard student and alumni organizations that filed an amicus brief in support of college admissions policies that foster diversity.\n\nCHRISTINE LEE : My name is Christine Lee. I'm a recent graduate from Harvard College and former co-president of the Harvard Korean Association, or HKA . I assumed leadership of HKA while the amicus brief preparations were underway with the Legal Defense Fund through the NAACP . I already felt rather strongly, I think, about the importance of building diverse educational environments and understanding how affirmative action played a critical role in that, but I think seeing the collective efforts from other student organizations in advocating for this cause was the greatest privilege.\n\nI can only speak to my own experiences as one student, an Asian American woman at Harvard, but I can say with full confidence that those who subscribe to the widely publicized view of what it means to, quote-unquote, \"deserve\" a position at an Ivy League position, what it means to champion, quote-unquote, \"merit-based admissions,\" they haven't met the incredible students, especially students of color, I was lucky enough to call my peers at Harvard. I mean, I didn't know the test scores or GPA of every student I sat next to in class or every student I ate meals with in the dining hall, but what I did know was that their unique stories, the stories that they had to share, they enhanced my own life and journey in a very singular way. And I truly believe that universities have something of an obligation to create rich, diverse, unique learning environments in this way. And I also believe that's an obligation not only to their students and the university, but to the greater public, as well.\n\nI think this is on my mind a lot more just as a recent graduate, but I can imagine the implications that the recent Supreme Court decision will have reaching into the professional world, as well. Legal experts will definitely know far more on this subject than me, but I can't help but feel like there's a likely danger of us seeing fewer people of color going into academia as professors, fewer people of color going into medicine, law, environmental policy. And I worry that those vital perspectives are in danger of fading away, if not right away, then definitely over time.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You were just listening to and watching Christine Lee, just graduated from Harvard University, former head of the Harvard Korean Association. And, Professor Wong, what's so interesting about this is that, really, her comments concur with the majority of Asian Americans in the country. A Pew poll just found that the majority of Asian Americans favor affirmative action. So, talk more deeply about who the organization is that brought this lawsuit that ended up in the Supreme Court.\n\nJANELLE WONG : The organization is called Students for Fair Admissions. And that organization is led by Ed Blum, who is a conservative white male who has gone on the attack for race-conscious programs beyond affirmative action. Affirmative action is one of a suite of policies that seek to consider race to ensure racial equality. So, Ed Blum successfully brought a case against - the Shelby v. Holder case, which gutted the Voting Rights Act. He has also tried to undermine immigrant voting rights.\n\nAnd so, he had brought this case against - brought a case against affirmative action to the University of Texas, and his key plaintiff there was Abigail Fisher, a white woman. When that was not successful, he purposefully sought out an Asian American plaintiff, again, because it provides not only cover for his white supremacist agenda, but also because Asian Americans - there is a narrative about Asian Americans facing a penalty in college admissions. That narrative is very powerful, even though it was adjudicated thoroughly in the lower courts, and the courts, with hundreds and hundreds of pages of evidence, statistical modeling and testimony from Asian American students who supported affirmative action, that - the lower courts found there was no intentional discrimination against Asian American students.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to bring Maria Hinojosa into this discussion. Chief Justice John Roberts said for too long universities have \"concluded, wrongly, that the touchstone of an individual's identity is not challenges bested, skills built, or lessons learned but the color of their skin. Our constitutional history does not tolerate that choice.\" You have Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the court's first Latina, writing in dissent, the decision rolls back \"decades of precedent and momentous progress.\" And, of course, you have Justice Jackson saying, though she had to recuse herself from the Harvard case because of her involvement with Harvard, weighed in on the North Carolina case, talked about deciding that - she wrote - let me see if I can find her quote - she said \"deeming race irrelevant in law does not make it so in life.\" Maria, your response?\n\nMARIA HINOJOSA : Thanks, Amy.\n\nThis is - it is a historic day in our country, and yet it is not shocking. In many ways, as I'm listening to the reporting that's coming up, I mean - and this is, for me, kind of writ large, which is, actually, how this Supreme Court will be devalued in the rest of the country because of decisions like this. That's a broad structural issue - right? - where you have a country that says this Supreme Court does not represent us, nor does it represent the majority opinion in the United States. And so, that, to me, is of concern, because, as you know, I wasn't born in this country, and there's this kind of image for immigrants that we hold the Supreme Court in this kind of esteem. Well, we're seeing through that.\n\nAs you point out, the fact that they're saying, \"It's OK for the barracks. We'll take your bodies and use them for war\" - by the way, if you're an immigrant or even undocumented, the possibilities of getting into the military ease your road in this country. So the pathway to military is completely open, and the pathway to legacy, which is, essentially, if we're going to be honest in our country, white supremacy.\n\nNow, I'm a professor. I've been in academia for a decade now. And I will tell you that what the data shows is that Latinos and Latinas have the highest rate of going from high school to college at this point. So, there's hard data there. And I have met college presidents, Amy, who have told me, \"We have a financial plan for, you know, this small, independent liberal arts college in the Midwest.\" And I was like, \"Well, what's your financial plan?\" \"We're making sure that we're getting every single Latino that we can to come here.\" It's a market decision, it's a business decision, that colleges and universities are going to be faced with, because look at the demographics of our country. It is unsustainable if you're only accepting white legacy students. That's not sustainable.\n\nSo, I'm trying to bring a different analysis. I understand everything - the shock, the horror, the disgust, the rage, the disappointment. But I'm also - I want to make sure that our kids understand that this is not - this cannot stop them. Cannot stop them. All of us on this call have - and you, as a white woman, Amy - we have gone through not just microaggressions, frontal aggressions. It makes us stronger. It makes us understand exactly what we represent in this country, what kind of country we want to have.\n\nSo, this - I'm going to quote Dolores Huerta, right? This is a moment to organize. This is a moment to build solidarity. And this is a moment to tell our young people, \"You got this. We are behind you. And by the way, you have power in this conversation. Do not cede your power. Do not give up, because we need you.\" And it's very important for me to continue to reiterate this message: Do not take this as a defeat. We've been defeated so many times in this country, and we're not going to give up. There's no other option. We cannot just give up and just say, \"OK, affirmative action, well, what do we\" - give up on what? We're going to to double down, because the future of this country, as we know - and I think that this is central to this decision - is increasingly not white. That is at the core of what we're talking about. But that's just data. That is the future of this country.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Maria Hinojosa, you have also been very vocal about the lack of diversity in newsrooms. After the Supreme Court affirmative action decision, the award-winning journalist, Reveal investigative journalist Aura Bogado said on Twitter, \"Universities will soon look like newsrooms.\" If you can respond to that? And also, I keep going back to this issue of John Roberts saying we're going to carve out military academies, because there is value in officer diversity, and this whole issue of they can go to the barracks, but when it comes to the boardroom and other places in civil society in this country, they're going to stand firm, these conservative justices, and say no to affirmative action.\n\nMARIA HINOJOSA : It's right in front of us, Amy. You know, there isn't - we don't have to pull the wool off of anybody's eyes. They are saying it clearly and, to me, doubling down on the question of legacy, which is legacy is fine, but - and legacy is - it is so clear what is happening. And this is why, again, the horror - not just disappointment, the horror of this Supreme Court, right? And I think about Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown having to sit with these so-called colleagues.\n\nAnd, yes, everybody, by the way, should watch that Frontline documentary on Clarence Thomas, because I understood that people - you know, I was the first Latina hired at NPR , right? I was one of very few Latinas at Barnard College, where I'm now a professor. I have been that one, that first one. And so, that kind of \"What are you doing here?\" always it's just a part of my life. And again, for the young people, so, what you do is you internalize that, and you say, \"And this is part of my struggle\" - right? - \"to be the best possible.\" Again, I know people don't want to hear this, \"Oh, you know, you've got to be the best possible,\" but that is the name of the game in the United States of America, where white supremacy is trying to hold on as much as possible. Again, for Latinos and Latinas, very important. And this is a very important moment for their understanding of where they put their alliances. Right? This is not - and we have to talk about this, where Latinos and Latinas can easily identify as white, because it's privilege. This is a moment to understand solidarity and what this means for the future of our country, working together for true representation.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Wisdom Cole, if you can talk about the kind of organizing that's going around now? I mean, with these affirmative action decisions, you always see NAACP out in front of the Supreme Court. You have, for example, University of California, that outlawed affirmative action years ago, people of color, particularly the Latinx population and the Black population, their representation being gutted in the UC college system. How are people organizing right now?\n\nWISDOM COLE : You know, I myself am a graduate of the University of California, Santa Cruz. And we consistently saw less and less Black folks enrolled in the universities, but even those who were enrolled in those universities were not graduating. Right? You know, the retention level and the work necessary to ensure that young people of color, young Black people were retained at these institutions of power was not there. And so, we had to institute student outreach programs, where we made sure that we were actually working to outreach to young people who were interested in coming to the university, but also making sure there were supports on campus to ensure that they stay at that university and are supported, and not facing the micro and macroaggressions that happen at these predominantly white institutions.\n\nSo, across the nation now, we are really pushing and telling universities and colleges to commit to diversity, no matter what. That looks like instituting outreach and retention programs. That looks at looking at debt-free college options. That looks at making sure that the student population is aware of what they are doing to contribute to white supremacist culture, and creating a society and creating a campus culture that is truly about diversity, equity, inclusion.\n\nYou know, in this moment in time, young people are looking for solutions. They're looking for answers. Young people are scared. Young people are thinking about their future. They're thinking about their nephews. They're thinking about their sisters, their brothers, the generations that are to come who are going to be entering those college spaces in the next couple years.\n\nIn this moment in time, we have to set up the structures that are going to allow those young people not just to survive on campus, but to thrive on campus. And we have to all do our part. And so, that means making sure that we are working hand in hand with these universities, making sure there is guidance, and making sure that young people are at front of this movement and that we are uplifting the voices of the most marginalized.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And, Wisdom, what about the issue of class or income as a factor in admission? And this goes directly with the decision today of the Supreme Court on student debt.\n\nWISDOM COLE : You know, we have to understand that the decision around affirmative action and the decision around Biden's student loan forgiveness program are not mutually exclusive. You know, if the Supreme Court strikes down Biden's student loan plan today, you know, like I said, effectively, we are on a pathway to resegregate education as we know it today, but also declare that the American dream is dead. You know, higher education is the pathway to economic mobility in this country. And so it's absolutely important that we understand all the factors that contribute to a young person entering into higher education today. We have to make sure that there is pathways to ensure that they are successful, and not barriers that are going to deter them from being a part of these institutions.\n\nYou know, again, we want to make sure that we are promoting diversity of thought, we are promoting diversity of ideology, we're promoting diversity of experience. All of these things are necessary to contribute to a thriving society in America today. We have gone through so much over the past couple years. We can't forget all the things that we learned in 2020 facing the horrors of the murder of George Floyd, of Breonna Taylor, of Ahmaud Arbery. You know, America is in a period of time where we are in a social awakening. It's important that we continue that work and not roll back those rights that we have received, and making sure that we are promoting young people in those places and spaces to ensure that they have access to the halls of power.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Wisdom Cole, I want to thank you for being with us, NAACP national director of Youth and College Division; Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Maria Hinojosa, founder of Futuro Media; and we want to thank professor Janelle Wong, director of Asian American Studies at University of Maryland.\n\nNext up, today the Supreme Court is issuing two more decisions, on student debt and whether businesses with religious objections can refuse to offer their services for same-sex weddings. We'll look at how both cases were brought by right-wing groups that are based on questionable evidence. Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

The Times says the Justice Department sent out an internal announcement looking for lawyers to lead \"investigations and possible litigation related to intentional race-based discrimination in college and university admissions.\" The Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of affirmative action policies, which take race and ethnicity into account in college admissions in efforts to address centuries of institutionalized discrimination against people of color and women. We speak with Nikole Hannah-Jones, an award-winning reporter covering racial injustice at The New York Times Magazine.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The New York Times is reporting the Justice Department is preparing to investigate and sue universities' affirmative action policies for anti-white bias, in the latest assault against civil rights by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The Times says the Justice Department sent out an internal announcement looking for lawyers to lead, quote, \"investigations and possible litigation related to intentional race-based discrimination in college and university admissions,\" unquote. The NAACP Legal Defense Fund promised to sue the administration if it targets affirmative action policies, saying, \"We will bring the full force of the law if this Justice Department attempts to resegregate our institutions of higher learning,\" unquote. Former Justice Department attorneys have expressed alarm that the project will be run out of an office staffed by Trump administration political appointees instead of the Educational Opportunities Section, which would normally handle such inquiries.\n\nThe Trump administration is claiming The New York Times report is inaccurate. A Department of Justice spokesperson said the internal memo dealt not with anti-white bias but an administrative complaint filed by a coalition of 64 Asian-American associations in 2015.\n\nThe Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of affirmative action policies, which take race and ethnicity into account in college admissions in efforts to address centuries of institutionalized discrimination against people of color and women.\n\nWe're joined now by Nikole Hannah-Jones, an award-winning reporter covering racial injustice at The New York Times Magazine .\n\nWelcome back to Democracy Now! , Nikole.\n\nNIKOLE HANNAH - JONES : Thanks for having me.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about what the Times found, even though the Trump administration has said that the reports are inaccurate?\n\nNIKOLE HANNAH - JONES : Well, the Times received a memo that said that they were looking-the Justice Department was looking to hire people to look into intentional discrimination in college admissions. And so, people on-who are opponents and proponents of affirmative action take that to mean that they are going to go after anti-white, or what they consider anti-white, bias in the admissions process.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And explain exactly what you believe they're taking on.\n\nNIKOLE HANNAH - JONES : Well, I think they're going to start investigating college admissions processes that are designed to help alleviate this nation's long history of racial discrimination. We understand that we have a segregated K-12 system that produces very unequal results for black and Latino students, who receive an inferior education. And so, oftentimes colleges will take that into account in the admissions process. And so, the expectation is that the administration, instead of working to vindicate the rights of traditionally, historically marginalized and oppressed minorities, is now going to be going after what they consider a white majority being oppressed, apparently, by these minority groups.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : During the news briefing on Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was questioned about The New York Times article.\n\nJUSTIN SINK : Does the president believe that white applicants to college are the victim of discrimination?\n\nPRESS SECRETARY SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS : I'm not aware of that opinion at all. I certainly haven't had that conversation or have any reason to-\n\nJUSTIN SINK : Well, then can you explain why the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division is devoting its limited time and resources to-\n\nPRESS SECRETARY SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS : Quite an accusatory question, but I'd be happy to respond. The New York Times article is based entirely on uncorroborated inferences from a leaked internal personnel posting in violation of Department of Justice policy. And while the White House does not confirm or deny the existence of potential investigations, the Department of Justice will always review credible allegation of discrimination on the basis of any race. And I don't have anything further on that.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Your response? Your response to the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders?\n\nNIKOLE HANNAH - JONES : Well, I think, one, it's important to have understanding of what affirmative action is supposed to do. Affirmative action is not disadvantaging white students. And it is not a program to advantage black students. It is a program designed to address the nation's legacy of discrimination, where, for centuries, black Americans were barred from institutions of higher learning. I think it might be helpful to read a quote from Lyndon B. Johnson, who actually created affirmative action. And what he said is, \"You do not take a person who, for years, has been hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line ... and then say, 'You are free to compete with all the others,' and still ... believe that you have been completely fair.\" So, what we know is that at elite colleges and universities in this country, black Americans make up only 5 percent of students enrolled, with affirmative action. So, it's kind of hard to prove that large numbers of white Americans are being discriminated against, when black and Latino students are still underrepresented in four-year institutions.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in Fisher v.  University of Texas and held that that the University of Texas at Austin's race-conscious admission program is lawful under the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution. I want to turn to a video of the petitioner in the case, Abigail Fisher, who said she was rejected by the University of Texas because she's white.\n\nABIGAIL FISHER : There were people in my class with lower grades, who weren't in all the activities I was in, who were being accepted into UT, and the only other difference between us was the color of our skin. ... A good start to stopping discrimination would be getting rid of the boxes on applications-male, female, race, whatever. Those don't tell the admissions people what type of student you are or how involved you are. All they do is put you into a box. Get rid of the box.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, that is Abigail Fisher. You've written extensively about this case. Can you talk about it?\n\nNIKOLE HANNAH - JONES : Sure. So, I think the most interesting aspect of this case, and a case that doesn't appear to be widely known among Americans, is that Abigail Fisher actually cannot prove that she was discriminated against. What the record shows is that there were black and Latino students with better test scores than her who also didn't get in, and that there were white students who had worse test scores than Abigail Fisher who did get in. So, in fact, that case is not about her being discriminated against. It's about this belief, by certain conservatives, that you should never take race into account, even if you're trying to address an historical legacy of discrimination and ongoing discrimination. They will tell you-the lawyer who brought this case, I interviewed him, and he admitted that he could not prove that Abigail Fisher was discriminated against, and, really, that was irrelevant to him. But that's not what the common reporting has been understanding of this case. The understanding of the case is that she was treated unfairly.\n\nWhat also wasn't talked about is, in Texas, the way Texas's affirmative action works is, if you're a white student, you also can get points for your race. If you're a white student who happened to go to a heavily black or Latino high school, you would also get points in the admissions process at Texas.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about here, in New York City-you've done a lot of reporting here, where we are-saying, in secondary education, it's actually the most segregated system in the country, and that-how that is reflected in higher education?\n\nNIKOLE HANNAH - JONES : So, we pretend that college admissions is based on a meritocracy, that every student is coming from an even playing field, and the best students, the students who work the hardest, are the ones who get the highest test scores and have the best grades and should get in. But we know that that is fundamentally untrue. In New York City, which is the most segregated large school system in the country, and all across the country, black and Latino students are in schools that are the least likely to have college prep curriculum, they're the least likely to have higher-level sciences, higher-level math classes. And so, what that means is that they cannot compete on ACTs and SATs with the test scores that white students, who are in far better-resourced schools, can achieve. So, to then, when we start looking at college admissions, to say every student should be treated the same, I think, is just a denial of the facts on the ground, that we know that black and Latino students, no matter how hard they work, are not getting the same education, as a whole, as white students are getting.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Nikole Hannah-Jones, this whole issue of who is preferred when it comes to getting into college, what about this piece that ProPublica -where ProPublica points out, and others, how, for example, Jared Kushner's family basically bought Jared a spot at Harvard? Explain that history.\n\nNIKOLE HANNAH - JONES : Right. So, there was a book that was written about legacy admissions. And legacy admissions are how many elite universities and other universities give extra points to children of alumni. And it was looking at how the elite are able to kind of buy their way or buy their children's way into Ivy League and other elite schools. Jared Kushner's father gave, I believe, $2.5 million to Harvard. And this journalist went back and looked at the high school that Jared Kushner went to, and said that the counselors there said he was not a good student, he should not have gotten into Harvard, and actually said that there were other students at that school who had far greater merit, who they assumed would get in, and who didn't.\n\nSo I think what's important to understand is what the Justice Department is doing is not about fairness. It is specifically about race, because if they were going to address fairness, there are a whole host of issues in college admissions that disadvantage certain students over others and advantage the same students who traditionally have always been advantaged. And they're not going after these other issues. They're only going after programs that are having really a minute effect on the number of black and Latino students at institutions of higher learning.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We'll link to that ProPublica piece that's headlined \"The Story Behind Jared Kushner's Curious Acceptance into Harvard,\" by Daniel Golden. Golden wrote a book a decade ago called The Price of Admission . In ProPublica , he writes, quote, \"My book exposed a grubby secret of American higher education: that the rich buy their under-achieving children's way into elite universities with massive, tax-deductible donations. It reported that New Jersey real estate developer Charles Kushner had pledged $2.5 million to Harvard University in 1998, not long before his son Jared was admitted to the prestigious Ivy League school.\" He also wrote, \"I also quoted administrators at Jared's high school, who described him as a less than stellar student and expressed dismay at Harvard's decision.\" Now, Nikole, I wanted to ask you about the front-page piece in your paper today, The New York Times , \"Asians Become Focus of Battle on Admissions.\" Talk about this.\n\nNIKOLE HANNAH - JONES : Well, I think that there-the people who are trying to challenge affirmative action are very savvy about how to do this. There's a reason why the big affirmative action cases that have gone before the Supreme Court were brought by white women and not white men, because there's a sense that people will not feel that sympathetic towards white men, but they will feel sympathy towards white women, believing that women have been historically discriminated against. And now they are moving to the next level, which is to try to use another racial minority group to prove that their efforts are not racist, that their efforts are not racially motivated.\n\nThe problem is, Asian Americans, of course, have a very, very different experience than black Americans. They were not brought here enslaved. They were not codified under Jim Crow. And most Asian Americans who came to this country came after the civil rights movement, because prior to the civil rights movement there were quotas on how many people of color could be allowed in the country. Asian Americans tend to come in on work visas and on education visas, meaning that they are coming in more educated and more resourced. They're the most integrated group of racial minorities in the country. They're the most likely to live in white neighborhoods and to attend middle-class white schools. So they're just not facing the same disadvantages that black and Latinos are facing. But it's a very convenient way to argue that what they're doing is fundamentally about fairness and not about race.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, it's interesting you say that. In our next piece, we're going to be talking with Congressmember Jayapal about the new anti-immigration legislation that the Trump administration would like to put forward and support, and one of the arguments the extreme anti-immigrant adviser to President Trump, Stephen Miller, put forward yesterday in the White House press briefing was his concern for African Americans being-losing jobs because of Latinos and others coming into this country and stealing them, so championing the African-American community.\n\nNIKOLE HANNAH - JONES : I mean, it would be great if they were championing the African-American communities in other ways-for instance, not attacking affirmative action, not attacking voting rights, not deciding to no longer investigate police departments that have been accused of violating the rights of black citizens. So, I think, clearly, they are using black Americans in this instance in the same way that the right is trying to use Asian Americans in affirmative action.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, we're going to leave it there.

On Monday, the court ruled on a challenge to the use of race-conscious affirmative action in college admissions. The petitioner in the case, Abigail Fisher, is a white woman who accused the University of Texas of discrimination for rejecting her application. Many had expected the court's conservative members to seize upon the case as part of a right-wing effort to end affirmative action for good. But instead, the court came down with an opinion that gives both sides reasons to cheer.\n\nIn a seven-to-one decision, justices sent the case back to a federal appeals court and told it to consider affirmative action under a harsher standard. But they also refused to overturn the 2003 decision in Grutter v. Bollinger , which rejected the use of racial quotas in college admissions but allowed for less direct methods of affirmative action.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Although affirmative action in college admissions stays alive for now, it continues to face an uncertain future. It's long been a target of right-wing groups, and Monday's ruling could lead to more lawsuits in the next year.\n\nMeanwhile, another major decision on racial equality could come as early as today. The court is set to rule on a challenge to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which requires several states and counties with a history of racial discrimination to clear election-related changes with the federal government.\n\nFor more, we're joined by Damon Hewitt, director of the Education Practice Group at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. The group filed a number of amicus briefs in the Texas case on behalf of the Black Student Alliance at the University of Texas-Austin.\n\nI want to welcome you to Democracy Now! Can you start off by saying, Damon, what your response is to the Supreme Court ruling? It surprised many.\n\nDAMON HEWITT : Well, it certainly did surprise many, but we weren't totally surprised. What the court essentially told us is that the lower courts should more faithfully apply the existing standard. There really is no new law coming out of yesterday's decision. It's essentially the same strict scrutiny standard that always applied. But, at base, we think that this is really a victory for supporters of diversity and opportunity in higher education, and it's certainly a loss, certainly, at this point, for Abigail Fisher's counsel, who really thought that they would really get to a chance to undo what's been settled precedent for some time.\n\nAARON MATÉ: Damon, I wanted to get your response to Justice Clarence Thomas. He wrote in a concurring opinion the case-he wrote in a concurring opinion that was longer than the majority opinion. Justice Thomas said he wanted the court to, quote, \"hold that a State's use of race in higher education admissions is categorically prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause.\" He compared the arguments in favor of affirmative action to those used to support segregation, calling them, quote, \"virtually identical.\" He added, quote, \"The use of race has little to do with the alleged educational benefits of diversity,\" and said, quote, \"Slaveholders argued that slavery was a 'positive good' that civilized blacks and elevated them in every dimension of life.\" Can you respond? And can you also talk about what you expect to happen once this case moves back down to the appeals court?\n\nDAMON HEWITT : Certainly. You know, in that-that opinion really assumes facts not in evidence. It assumes social science that simply doesn't exist. If it does exist, it's basically junk science. Really, it contemplates a world that ignores the fact that the Supreme Court upheld race-conscious affirmative action programs in Grutter v. Bollinger . I think the chief frustration that that opinion suggests or conveys is that the court didn't overrule Grutter , or that it decided Grutter in the first place. If you even look at the citations to all of the different types of so-called evidence indicated in that opinion, it's actually information that predates the court's ruling in Grutter . So it's really not dealing with contemporary realities. It's not even dealing with contemporary law. And frankly, to compare chattel slavery and legally mandated segregation to race-conscious affirmative action programs really defies logic. And we believe not only have most of the justices rejected that, because no other justices joined that opinion, but most Americans would eject-reject, rather, that kind of logic, as well. In terms-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Damon, the petitioner in the case is Abigail Fisher, the woman who says she was rejected by the University of Texas because she's white. In this online video, Fisher billed her lawsuit against affirmative action as a challenge to discrimination.\n\nABIGAIL FISHER : There were people in my class with lower grades who weren't in all the activities I was in who were being accepted into UT, and the only other difference between us was the color of our skin. A good start to stopping discrimination would be getting rid of the boxes on applications-male, female, race, whatever. Those don't tell the admissions people what type of student you are or how involved you are. All they do is put you into a box. Get rid of the box.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That's Abigail Fisher. Officially, she's the plaintiff in the Supreme Court case, but that's not the whole story. What's not widely known is that the case was in fact spearheaded by a man named Edward Blum. A former stockbroker, he recruited Fisher after a long search for a student who could challenge affirmative action in court. He came across her because she happens to be the daughter of one of his old friends. Backed by the secretive right-wing group Donors Trust, Blum has ensured that wealthy right-wing donors are covering Fisher's legal bills. In this video from 2008, Blum makes an open appeal for Texas students to join his cause against affirmative action.\n\nEDWARD BLUM : This student here in Houston and thousands of other students throughout the state of Texas have been unfairly punished after UT decided to reintroduce race-based affirmative action. It's time for UT to stop. I encourage all high school students who have been rejected from UT to visit at utnotfair.org , tell us your story, contact us. If you've been rejected from UT, we want your story, and we want to try to help you.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : According to Reuters, Edward Blum has launched at least a dozen lawsuits against race-based protections in the United States. These also include the challenge to the Voting Rights Act by Alabama's Shelby County, which the Supreme Court could decide on today. Damon Hewitt, your response about his significance?\n\nDAMON HEWITT : Well, look, we won't disparage any individual in trying to seek access to the courts, but what we see here and what Ed Blum and his organization have done is that they're telling-they're trying to tell America that race doesn't matter. But essentially what they're really saying in subtext is that the facts don't matter, the fact that Abigail Fisher would not have been admitted to the University of Texas regardless of her race, based upon undisputed evidence in the record in this case, the fact that in the Voting Rights Act case, which one of my colleagues argued before the Supreme Court in the Shelby County case, that Shelby County, Alabama, has one of the very worst records of discrimination of any jurisdiction in the country. Those facts don't matter to him, and that's troubling to us. And we think that's why the court will move cautiously and in a measured way. It did that certainly in the Fisher case, and we hope it also does that in the Voting Rights Act case, as well.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to read a quote for you from Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who wrote the only dissent in the seven-to-one ruling, noting Fisher argued that, quote, \"Texas' Top Ten Percent Law and race-blind holistic review of each application achieve significant diversity, so the University must be content with those alternatives. I have said before and reiterate here that only an ostrich could regard the supposedly neutral alternatives as race unconscious. ... I have several times explained why government actors, including state universities, need not be blind to the lingering effects of 'an overtly discriminatory past,' the legacy of 'centuries of law-sanctioned inequality.'\" Damon, the importance of what Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg had to say?\n\nDAMON HEWITT : Well, Justice Ginsburg has really, you know, put the lie to the notion that there's this kind of dichotomy between race-conscious and race-neutral. In fact, what universities do today is really along a spectrum of race consciousness, considering the race of the individual or considering race in a way that the Top Ten Percent Plan does, ironically, relying upon the hypersegregation of schools, drawing the top 10 percent in its program from hypersegregated black schools, Latino schools and white schools to try to manufacture some modicum of diversity. And she also noted the danger of camouflage, the notion that without full information about an applicant, that people will make assumptions based upon an individual's surname or even their given name, their first names. So, you know, I think Justice Ginsburg is really saying, \"Let's be honest about what's really at play here. Let's not pretend that we cannot see race.\" In fact, many people would say in order to try to claim not to see race, you actually have to first acknowledge it in order to ignore it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Voting rights-we just have 30 seconds-a decision could come down as early as today, Damon.\n\nDAMON HEWITT : It could. And, look, we argued in the U.S. Supreme Court, and we argued below, that the Voting Rights Act is still necessary. Justice-Chief Justice Roberts said the South has changed, and that's true, but Shelby County certainly hasn't changed as much as some would like to claim, nor has Alabama. And the Voting Rights Act is still necessary there and all of the covered jurisdictions, as well.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Damon Hewitt, we want to thank you for being with us, director of the Education Practice Group at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, where he's become known as one of the nation's leading experts on the civil rights implications of school discipline policies. In 2002, he launched LDF's Dismantling to School-to-Prison Pipeline Initiative, which challenges racial disparities that criminalize students and push them out of schools.\n\nThis is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report .

George Wallace more than a half-century ago. His proudly racist rhetoric was matched by heinous actions: Murders, lynchings and systemic violence, often endorsed or organized by state and local governments, were inflicted on African Americans and their allies struggling for civil rights. Despite that, those fighting for equality prevailed. Among the successes were the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, affirmative action and court-ordered integration of schools. But with this week's U.S. Supreme Court decision supporting Michigan's ban against affirmative action in state university admissions, and with the increasing resegregation of schools, it seems like Wallace's dream of \"segregation forever\" may be alive and all too well.\n\nNikole Hannah-Jones is an investigative journalist with the nonprofit news organization ProPublica, which has just published her yearlong, 9,000-word piece on the resegregation of public schools in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. This remarkable report, \"Segregation Now,\" notes that \"In Tuscaloosa today, nearly one in three black students attends a school that looks as if Brown v. Board of Education never happened.\" The Brown decision, issued in May of 1954, covered several pending court cases (all organized by the NAACP ) challenging school segregation. U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren authored the unanimous decision, writing, \"We conclude that in the field of public education the doctrine of 'separate but equal' has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.\"\n\nHannah-Jones tells the history of school desegregation in Tuscaloosa through the lens of three generations of the Dent family. James Dent grew up in Jim Crow Alabama, never sharing a classroom with a white student. His daughter, Melissa, first went to an integrated middle school in 1980. It had taken decades for Tuscaloosa to implement desegregation, and then only by additional court orders. The city's two high schools were consolidated into one, Central High, which became a state powerhouse of excellence, both academic and athletic. Melissa went on to become the first in her family's history to graduate from college.\n\nBut this golden era of desegregation was short-lived. \"Tuscaloosa has become one of the most rapidly resegregating school districts in the country,\" Hannah-Jones explained on our \"Democracy Now!\" news hour. \"In 2000, when a federal judge released Tuscaloosa from its court order, the school board immediately voted to split up Central [High School]. Because of fears of white flight ... they created three high schools-two integrated and one that was entirely black.\" Here is her key finding: a new kind of segregation. While there are no \"whites only\" schools in Tuscaloosa, as there were up until 1979, there is now a struggling \"blacks only\" school-Central High. \"The irony is that Central High School is actually located in an integrated neighborhood, but the white students right across the street from the school are gerrymandered into a district to go to an integrated school, and that Central was created as a black school by the intentional drawing of district lines.\"\n\nThe problem is not limited to the Deep South. UCLA's Civil Rights Project has been tracking national trends. Surprisingly, it found that \"New York has the most segregated schools in the country. ... Heavily impacting these state rankings is New York City, home to the largest and one of the most segregated public school systems in the nation.\" The UCLA report repeatedly uses a term that is now common in academic circles studying resegregation: \"apartheid schools\"-those schools with less than 1 percent white student enrollment. The report continues, \"Across New York City, 73 percent of charters were considered apartheid schools and 90 percent were intensely segregated (less than 10 percent white enrollment) schools in 2010.\"\n\nThis week's Supreme Court decision will surely continue the trend of resegregation from high schools into colleges. The 6-to-2 vote upheld the Michigan ban on race-based affirmative action in state university admissions. Chief Justice John Roberts expressed his feelings about race in 2007, when he controversially said, \"The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in her dissent from the majority this week, wrote, \"My colleagues are of the view that we should leave race out of the picture entirely and let the voters sort it out. ... It is a sentiment out of touch with reality.\"\n\nThe reality is, racial discrimination and segregation go hand in hand. Racism may not boom from a governor's podium as it did in 1963 with George Wallace, but a racially divided America can never be equal.\n\nAmy Goodman is the host of \"Democracy Now!,\" a daily international TV/radio news hour airing on more than 1,200 stations in North America.

That consideration is supplementary, and taken in tandem with other factors such as applicants' test scores, grades and extracurricular activities.\n\nEven with race-conscious admissions, however, many selective public and private colleges and universities struggle to enroll diverse student populations that accurately reflect society. At the University of North Carolina, for example, in a state where 21% of people are Black, just 8% of the school's undergraduates are Black.\n\nOpponents of affirmative action, such as the advocacy group Students for Fair Admissions, argue that considering race as a factor in the admissions process amounts to racial discrimination - particularly against Asian Americans.

Ultimately, it hopes that race considerations will be nixed from the admissions process entirely, and replaced by race-neutral or \"color-blind\" policies.\n\nThe concept of affirmative action originated in 1961 when President John F Kennedy issued an executive order directing government agencies to ensure that all Americans get an equal opportunity in employment. President Lyndon Johnson took it one step further in 1965, barring public and private organizations that had a federal contract from discriminating based on race, color, religion and national origin. The prohibition was added to the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nIn 1969, President Richard Nixon's assistant labor secretary, Arthur Fletcher, who would eventually be known as the \"father of affirmative action\", pushed for requiring employers to set \"goals and timetables\" to hire more Black workers. That effort, known as the Revised Philadelphia Plan , would later influence how many schools approached their own race-conscious admissions programs.\n\nThe practice was challenged when Allan Bakke, a white man who was twice denied entry to the medical school at the University of California at Davis, sued the university, arguing that its policies, which included allocating seats for \"qualified\" students of color, discriminated against him. In 1978, the supreme court narrowly rejected the use of \"racial quotas\", but noted that colleges and universities could use race as a factor in the admissions process.

In 1965, Black students accounted for roughly 5% of all undergraduates. And between 1965 and 2001, the percentage of Black undergraduates doubled . The number of Latino undergraduates also rose during that time. Still, the practice of factoring race into the admissions process faced repeated attacks. In 1998, during an era of conservatism, California voters approved Proposition 209, which outlawed affirmative action in any state or government agency, including its university system. Since then, eight more states have eliminated such race-conscious policies.\n\nThe end of affirmative action at those state levels shows just how impactful the consideration of race in admissions has been: a UC Berkeley study found that after the ban in California, the number of applicants of color in the UC system \"sharply shifted away from UC's most selective Berkeley and UCLA campuses, causing a cascade of students to enroll at lower-quality public institutions and some private universities\". Specifically, the number of Black freshmen admitted to UC Berkeley dropped to 3.6% between 2006 and 2010 - almost half of its population before the ban.\n\nIn an amicus brief in the Harvard case, attorneys for the University of Michigan, which had to stop considering race in admissions in 2006 , argued that despite \"persistent, vigorous and varied efforts\" to achieve diversity, it has struggled to do so without race-consciousness. The number of Black and Native American students has \"dramatically\" dropped since the end of affirmative action in the state.\n\nThough students of color remain underrepresented at selective colleges and universities today, institutions argue that their presence helps shape students' on-campus experiences.

      "text": "'A cautionary tale': colleges in states with affirmative action bans report racial disparities\n\nData from Universities of California and Michigan show how the bans have adversely affected Black and Indigenous student enrollment\n\nT he supreme court's decision to strike down race-consciousness in college admissions will upend the academic landscape for millions of people. But students in nine states already live in a post-affirmative action world.\n\nIn 1996, Californians voted to ban race-conscious affirmative action policies in the state's public universities. Since then, eight other states - Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Michigan, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oklahoma and Washington - have also barred race-based considerations, often through ballot initiatives approved by the states' voters. Some universities in these states report that the bans have made it significantly harder to achieve racial diversity on their campuses.\n\nThe University of California and the University of Michigan , whose representatives submitted arguments to the supreme court in support of race-conscious admissions, are two such schools. In the years since Michigan voters ended affirmative action in 2006, for instance, the number of Black and Indigenous American students at the University of Michigan has plummeted. The same happened at UC Berkeley and UCLA after voters approved a ban in 1996. And despite developing numerous strategies to supplement the lack of affirmative action policies with other outreach tactics, the representatives wrote, their efforts have failed.\n\nThe California data shows that freshmen attending its nine public UC schools do not accurately reflect the state's high school graduate population. In 2019, just a quarter of freshmen who attended UC schools identified as Latinx. By contrast, Latinx students accounted for more than half of high school graduates in California that year. During that same period, Black students accounted for just 4% of UC freshmen, even though they made up nearly 6% of high school graduates. The numbers were worse at the system's more selective institutions: at UC Berkeley, for example, Latinx students accounted for just 15% of freshmen, and Black students accounted for only 3%.\n\nSince affirmative action was banned in the state, the UC system has spent more than $500m on outreach efforts to students from low-income backgrounds, students whose families had marginal, if any, college experience, and students who \"attend an educationally disadvantaged school\". It has also adopted a \"holistic\" review process, which takes into account 13 factors beyond grades and test scores to determine admission. But the amicus brief notes: \"Although these programs have increased geographic diversity, they have not substantially increased the racial diversity of students admitted to UC. They have had little impact at the most selective campuses.\"\n\nAt the University of Michigan, similar attempts at a solution have had little effect. Representatives from that school wrote: \"The University's 15-year-long experiment in race neutral admissions thus is a cautionary tale that underscores the compelling need for selective universities to be able to consider race as one of many background factors about applicants.\" The statewide affirmative action ban caused a \"marked and sustained drop especially among the most underrepresented groups, Black and Indigenous American students\".\n\nDespite the creation of a Center for Educational Outreach, specialized recruitment programs and efforts to consider applicants' financial backgrounds, the university found that the \"admission and enrollment of underrepresented minority students have fallen precipitously in many of U-M's schools and colleges since Proposal 2 was adopted\". Further, Black student enrollment has fallen 44% and a quarter of students from underrepresented backgrounds at the University of Michigan reported that they didn't \"belong\". The university noted that that was a 66% increase from the last decade.\n\nNot all statewide programs that have barred affirmative action agree with Michigan's and California's findings, however. An amicus brief by the state of Oklahoma (which barred affirmative action in 2012) and 18 other states in favor of race-conscious policy bans noted that the University of Oklahoma had \"no long-term severe decline in minority admissions\". It said that the states that had barred race consideration in admissions were \"no less diverse\" than states that \"permit such discrimination\".\n\nThe brief compares 2019 data on the Black and Latino freshmen at University of Oklahoma with other states that have comparable Black and Latino populations, such as Massachusetts, Minnesota and Wisconsin. It argues that those states' flagship universities admit similar numbers of Latino students and \"do not admit substantially more African American students'' than Oklahoma.\n\nStill, the authors of the University of California amicus brief challenged that argument, noting that, upon closer inspection, enrollment of Black and Indigenous American students significantly fell at the University of Oklahoma's flagship campus in Norman. In the years since Oklahoma barred affirmative action, Black students at the university's main campus fell from 5% of the 2019 freshman class to roughly 4%. Even if that decline isn't considered significant by the University of Oklahoma's standards, a single point drop on an already low number could have material effects on students from underrepresented backgrounds as they become less and less visible on campus.\n\nIn his majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts noted that the college admissions process was \"zero-sum\". But Zachary Bleemer, an assistant professor of economics at Princeton University, who studied the impact of California's affirmative action ban on the state's public university system, challenged that notion. He told me that the bans' long-term effects on students of different backgrounds were fundamentally uneven. \"The gains for white and Asian students were measurably very small, compared to the losses for Black and Hispanic students,\" Bleemer said.\n\nThursday's decision means that the current reality for several universities around the country will now be extended nationwide: When schools are barred from factoring race into the admissions process, they lack meaningful tools that would help facilitate a more racially diverse student population."

      "text": "How Clarence Thomas orchestrated a new obstacle for Black students\n\nThe supreme court's ruling ending race-conscious admissions shifts the burden of 'proving' racism to the college essay\n\nT hose who knew Justice Clarence Thomas during his formative years at College of the Holy Cross and Yale Law School have long noted the sharp ideological turn he took over the course of his life: from admiring Malcolm X and protesting racism alongside his Black classmates to deeply resenting the affirmative action policies that afforded him his success.\n\nThat switch may have occurred most pointedly during his time at Yale, when, in Thomas's own recollection, a white admissions officer told him and a group of Black students that none of them was qualified to be there.\n\nBy the time Thomas had experienced rounds of law firm rejections - despite attending one of America's top law schools - he didn't blame the ever-persistent racism of white employers in the early 1970s, or even seem to consider that he was outshined academically when compared to his Black peers. Instead, he adopted the belief that job recruiters, like his Yale admissions officer, associated him with \"undeserving\" Black law school admits. Thomas came to view corrective policies like affirmative action as a zero-sum game in which the merits of Black students and the considerations of historical harms against Black people could not coexist. He wholly ingested the racist take of the admissions officer in his ascendency to the supreme court, and that take steers his judicial opinions to this day.\n\nThursday's supreme court decision to strike down affirmative action policies in college admissions will be Thomas's lone legacy in a judiciary in which he has been otherwise taciturn. His decades-long rejection of the idea that his success is tied to race-conscious policies is core to his self-image. In Thomas's estimation, he has singularly overcome racism with grit and perseverance, and any considerations of structural racism in education and employment run counter to the idea that Black people belong in those spaces.\n\nThat narrative is in direct contention with the spirit of affirmative action, which considers the uneven starting line that sets Black Americans in particular back as a group. But that narrative is also the one that will proliferate most in the post-affirmative action college essay - because while the court banned affirmative action programs, it did not entirely forbid schools from considering an applicant's discussion of how race affected their life. Now, the court's ruling shifts the burden of \"proving\" the effects of racism to the college essay. As a result, Black students will increasingly try to set themselves apart in admissions by telling triumphant stories of individualism, bootstrapping and resilience in the face of racial hardships.\n\nSome schools of research have shown that these triumphant stories are the exact narratives of Black life that white colleges reward. In a 2019 study , the sociologist Ted Thornhill surveyed 500 American admissions counselors (an occupation that is 75% white nationally) to show how they judge the stories Black prospective students tell in their essays. Thornhill found that applicants who discussed organized Black resistance to white racial domination, for instance, were penalized in score. But it wasn't activism itself that turned off admissions officers; the study included Black applicants who were environmental activists and found that they ranked highly.\n\nWhat admissions officers sought to avoid, according to Thornhill, were Black students who would \"rock the boat\" with antiracist activism and whose essays discussed structural racism both in their lives and on college campuses. Of the college essays he surveyed, the ones that were considered top applicants and potential admits to predominantly white institutions were ones that closely resembled Thomas's depiction of himself.\n\nI talked to Aya Waller-Bey, a sociology PhD candidate at the University of Michigan, who studies the role of race and racial narratives in college essays. In her dissertation research, she found that not only are Black applicants rewarded when they disclose trauma and vulnerability in their essays, but they're also viewed favorably when they appear as \"someone who can not only endure hardship but overcome\". This approach is reminiscent of Thomas's insistence that he triumphed over the poverty of his sharecropping youth on his own and never benefited from any race-conscious program. Such essays, Waller-Bey told me, \"put Blackness into a frame of what white universities think Black experiences should be, and penalize students who discuss Blackness in positive ways or discuss racism as an act of white political and economic power\".\n\nIn the aftermath of affirmative action's ban, white students, contrastingly, will continue to write self-exploration essays that do not ask them to frame their success within a confined view of whiteness. They will not feel pressured to describe the leg-ups they have received from generational wealth (the median white household in the US has nearly 10 times the wealth of the median Black family). They will not be penalized for attending all-white K-12 schools or for being raised in segregated neighborhoods. And none of their unearned advantages will be framed as a knock on their academic merits or as privileges they should account for in assessing their academic success. Another racial divide - this one tied to the imbalanced labor of establishing worthiness - will no doubt emerge.\n\nAs a set of legal statutes and governmental policies, affirmative action policies in college admissions intended to account for historical wrongdoings against entire groups of marginalized people - expressly Black Americans. They aimed to address Jim Crow, lynching, white terroristic violence, redlining, segregation in housing and schooling, and exclusionary government assistance policies like the GI bill, the greatest expansion of the middle class in US history that benefitted white people almost exclusively.\n\nBut as of Thursday, those policies are effectively barred on a systemic scale. To fill the gap that the ban will inevitably leave, Black students will have to make individual cases as to why their own resilience over racial hardships makes them worthy of consideration. They will rely on Thomas's brand of exceptionalism and individualism, further undermining the intention and legacy of one of the few successful efforts at racial redress in this country.\n\nSaida Grundy is an associate professor of sociology and African American studies at Boston University, and the author of Respectable: Politics and Paradox in Making the Morehouse Man ."

      "text": "Seven organizations the far right is targeting for diversity efforts post-affirmative action\n\nConservatives are taking legal action against public and private organizations that aim to aid women and people of color\n\nL ast year's supreme court decision to ban affirmative action in college and university admissions was a watershed moment for far-right conservative activists and groups, who have used the momentum to target not only public institutions, but also private organizations that aim to aid women and people of color.\n\nMany of the targeted groups are being sued by complainants who allege that they have been discriminated against because they do not fit diversity requirements. In some cases, the would-be applicants are engaging in presumptive suing - alleging the organizations have engaged in discriminatory behavior without even applying.\n\nSince the ruling, some companies, such as Zoom, Lyft and Meta have dismantled their own efforts to promote and increase diversity willingly, without any specific legal spur. But several other entities have been forced to do so following legal challenges. Fearless Fund\n\nFearless Fund, which is based in Atlanta, became the country's first VC firm founded by women of color when it launched in 2019. It awards pre-seed, seed-level or series A financing grants to Black women who own small businesses. (A 2023 study by McKinsey and Company found that Black and Latino women entrepreneurs received 0.1% of venture capital funds.) Over the past four years, in partnership with corporations, Fearless Fund supplied business owners $3.7m in grants.\n\nThe American Alliance for Equal Rights (AAER), a non-profit founded, according to its website, specifically to challenge \"distinctions made on the basis of race and ethnicity in federal and state courts\", sued Fearless Fund in August 2023, shortly after the supreme court decision. The lawsuit argues that Fearless Fund is violating the Civil Rights Act of 1866, the first civil rights bill in US history, which bars racial bias in private contracts and became an early template of the 14th amendment. As a result of the lawsuit, a judicial panel has blocked the fund from continuing its grant program. All but two of the fund's backers have withdrawn support.\n\nEdward Blum, who is white and one of the founders of the AAER, was also instrumental in the initial supreme court decision to repeal affirmative action, as his group, Students for Fair Admissions, brought forward that suit.\n\nHello Alice Last August, Hello Alice, an online platform which has a grant program for Black small-business owners, was sued by America First Legal (AFL) , a far-right non-profit formed by the former senior Trump White House adviser Stephen Miller. The lawsuit alleges that Hello Alice's grant program for Black business owners is unconstitutional, and that it should be accessible to all business owners regardless of race.\n\nLaunched in 2022 by Elizabeth Gore and Carolyn Rodz, both of whom are white, this specific grant program helps Black people across the country purchase commercial vehicles. Nathan Roberts, a white Ohio resident who owns Freedom Truck Dispatch, a trucking dispatch company, alleged that he experienced reverse discrimination because he was ineligible for the grants.\n\nRoberts filed a lawsuit in August 2023 which argues that he is \"suffering past and future injury in fact because he was barred from applying for this grant\".\n\n\"We think this case is meritless and sets the nation, and small businesses, back,\" Hello Alice executives said in a joint statement . The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) responded in February by filing an amicus brief with Hello Alice in order to give additional information relating to the case.\n\n\"Empowering employers to take voluntary measures to remedy past discrimination remains an important component of our nation's progression toward equal employment opportunity,\" the brief reads . \"This court should take care not to hinder such efforts.\"\n\nNascar AFL also targeted Nascar for the organization's \"diversity driver development program\", \"diversity pit crew development program\", and the \"Nascar diversity internship program\", arguing that the programs violate the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the country's benchmark civil rights legislation, which prohibits discrimination based on race and sex and outlawed segregation.\n\nNascar had predicted the potential for such a lawsuit and preemptively walked back its programs, widening it to applicants of \"diverse backgrounds and experiences\", instead of specifically calling for \"top minority and female\" applicants as it had previously. The AFL's letter to the EEOC alleged that the change still perpetuated discrimination.\n\n\"Nascar's and Rev Racing's commitment to race and sex-based hiring has not wavered - the website changes described above seem to have been designed only to conceal their ongoing, deliberate, and illegal discrimination against white, male Americans,\" the complaint, which is currently pending, alleged.\n\nMorrison Foerster Morrison Foerster, a California-based international law firm, changed the eligibility for the Keith Wetmore Fellowship for Excellence, Diversity, and Inclusion after AAER filed a lawsuit alleging in August of 2023 that the program was unlawfully discriminatory.\n\nInitially, the program was only eligible for 1L students \"who are members of historically underrepresented groups in the legal industry\". Now, the 12-year-old program seeks students \"with a demonstrated commitment to diversity and inclusion in the legal profession\".\n\nWisconsin Bar Late last year, a white member of the state bar of Wisconsin filed a complaint against the association alleging that its summer hiring program, the \"diversity clerkship program\", was discriminatory. The program initially required that applicants be members of minority groups. However, following the supreme court's affirmative action decision, before the complaint, the eligibility requirements were changed to include students with \"backgrounds that have been historically excluded from the legal field\". Without defining which groups count as \"historically excluded\", applicants could be from non-traditional backgrounds regardless of their race.\n\nDespite the program's race-neutral wording, the plaintiff still alleges that the bar's program is unconstitutional in that it implicitly prioritizes minority groups. The complaint also alleges that the program constitutes compelled speech and compelled freedom of association, in violation of the first amendment, a common tactic by suits against DEI initiatives.\n\nLast Friday, the Wisconsin Bar and the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty reached a partial settlement . Under the terms, beginning this September, the program will be open to all first-year law students attending either Marquette University Law School or the University of Wisconsin Law School who are in good standing. Specifically, the bar is prevented from stating, suggesting or insinuating \"in its materials that only law students from diverse backgrounds, with backgrounds that have been historically excluded from the legal field, or who have been socially disadvantaged are eligible\".\n\nThe partial settlement also created a definition for the state bar to use for \"diversity\" as it applies to the program. Per the definition in the partial settlement, diversity \"means including people with differing characteristics, beliefs, experiences, interests, and viewpoints\".\n\nNational Museum of the American Latino In February, AAER filed a complaint and motion for a preliminary injunction against Jorge Zamanillo, the director of the National Museum of the American Latino. The complaint alleges that the museum's internship program, which seeks to provide Latino undergraduates with non-curatorial art museum careers, is unconstitutional.\n\nFollowing a settlement agreement in March, the program's website now says that the internship \"is equally open to students of all races and ethnicities, without preference or restriction based on race or ethnicity. The museum does not use racial or ethnic classifications or preferences in selecting awardees for the undergraduate internship\".\n\nGeorge Floyd Memorial scholarship North Central University, in Minneapolis, is being accused of violating the Civil Rights Act in a federal complaint filed by Legal Insurrection Foundation, a far-right advocacy organization.\n\nTo be eligible for the scholarship, which is named after George Floyd, whose murder at the hands of police sparked international protests in 2020, applicants must \"be a student who is Black or African American, that is, a person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa\".\n\nAccording to the complaint , which is pending, the college's George Floyd Memorial scholarship \"engages in invidious discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin\".\n\nThis article was amended on 17 April 2024. An earlier version said that Hello Alice was founded in 2022; that was the date when its grant program for Black small-business owners was launched. And the lawsuit from America First Legal alleges that this specific grant program is unconstitutional, rather than Hello Alice's grant program in general."

We're not going to let this break us.\"\n\nBiden signaled that he may consider taking executive action from the White House.\n\n\"Today, I am directing the Department of Education to analyze what practices help build more inclusive and diverse student bodies and what practices hold that back,\" Biden said. He noted: \"Practices like legacy admissions and other systems expand privilege instead of opportunity.\"\n\nBiden continued by asking colleges not to reject the cause of diversity in admissions.\n\n\"We cannot let this decision be the last word.

      "text": "Affirmative action appears in jeopardy after US supreme court hearing\n\nRace-conscious admission programs, twice upheld by highest court, now under scrutiny by skeptical conservative supermajority\n\nThe survival of affirmative action in higher education appeared to be in serious trouble on Monday at a conservative-dominated US supreme court after hours of debate over difficult questions of race.\n\nThe court is weighing challenges to admissions programs at the University of North Carolina and Harvard University that use race among many factors in seeking a diverse student body.\n\nThe court's six conservative justices all expressed doubts about the practice, while the three liberals defended the programs, which are similar to those used by many other private and public universities.\n\nFollowing the overturning of the half-century abortion precedent of Roe v Wade in June, the cases offer a big new test of whether the court, now dominated 6-3 by conservatives, will jolt the law to the right on another of the nation's most contentious cultural issues.\n\nVeteran conservative Clarence Thomas , the court's second-ever Black justice, who has a long record of opposition to affirmative action programs, noted he didn't go to racially diverse schools. \"I've heard the word 'diversity' quite a few times, and I don't have a clue what it means,\" he said at one point on Monday. At another, he challenged defenders: \"Tell me what the educational benefits are.\"\n\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett, another ultra-conservative , pointed to one of the court's previous affirmative action cases and said it anticipated a halt to its use in declaring that it was \"dangerous\" and had to have an end point. When, she asked, is that end point?\n\nJustice Samuel Alito, who wrote the opinion that scrapped the federal rights afforded US women by Roe, likened affirmative action to a race in which a minority applicant gets to \"start five yards closer to the finish line\".\n\nBut the liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the court's first Hispanic justice, who joined the blistering dissent in the Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization decision that overturned Roe, rejected that comparison, saying what universities were doing was looking at students as a whole.\n\nLikewise, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson , the court's newest justice and its first Black woman, also said that race was being used at the University of North Carolina as part of a broad review of applicants along with 40 different factors.\n\n\"They're looking at the full person with all of these characteristics,\" she said.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan called universities the \"pipelines to leadership in our society\" and suggested that without affirmative action minority enrollment will drop.\n\n\"I thought part of what it meant to be an American and to believe in American pluralism is that actually our institutions, you know, are reflective of who we are as a people in all our variety,\" she said.\n\nThe supreme court has twice upheld race-conscious college admissions programs in the past 19 years, including just six years ago.\n\nBut that was before the three appointees of former president Donald Trump joined the nine-member bench. After Barrett was nominated to replace the late liberal champion Ruth Bader Ginsburg shortly before the 2020 presidential election and was confirmed by the Senate, the court had a conservative supermajority. Jackson was nominated this year by Joe Biden.\n\nLower courts have upheld the programs at both UNC and Harvard, rejecting claims that the schools discriminated against white and Asian American applicants.\n\nThe cases are brought by the conservative activist Edward Blum, who also was behind an earlier affirmative action challenge against the University of Texas as well as the case that led the court in 2013 to end the use of a key provision of the landmark Voting Rights Act.\n\nBlum formed Students for Fair Admissions, which filed the lawsuits against both schools in 2014.\n\nThe group argues that the US constitution forbids the use of race in college admissions and calls for overturning earlier supreme court decisions that said otherwise.\n\nUNC says its freshman class is about 65% white, 22% Asian American, 10% Black and 10% Hispanic. The numbers amount to more than 100% because some students report belonging to more than one category, a school spokesman said.\n\nWhite students account for just over 40% of Harvard's freshman class, the school said. The class also is just under 28% Asian American, 14% Black and 12% Latino.\n\nA decision in the affirmative action cases is not expected before late spring."

      "text": "US supreme court rules against affirmative action in Harvard and UNC cases\n\nBiden said he was considering executive action following court's decision to limit power of universities to consider an applicant's race in admissions\n\nThe US supreme court , driven by its conservative supermajority, on Thursday ended race-conscious admissions at universities across the country, tossing out decades of precedent in American life and delivering a huge blow to the cause of greater student diversity on campuses.\n\nThe conservative justices concluded that admissions policies at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina violated the US constitution's equal protection clause. This effectively prohibits the use of affirmative action policies in the US that acted as a tipping point, among many other admission factors, to raise the number of Black, Hispanic and other underrepresented minority students at selective US higher education colleges and universities.\n\nThe court concluded that Harvard and the University of North Carolina's race-conscious admissions programs failed to abide by the narrow restrictions laid out by the court in previous cases, noting that university programs \"must comply with strict scrutiny, may never use race as a stereotype or negative, and must - at some point - end\".\n\nThe six conservative-leaning justices on the nine-strong court prevailed over the three liberal leaning justices, with the newest member and first Black woman on the court, Ketanji Brown Jackson , issuing a stark dissent saying the ruling meant it would \"take longer for racism to leave us\".\n\nJoe Biden said he was considering executive action and will ask the Department of Education to look into ways to maintain diversity in university student bodies.\n\nThe US president said \"this is not a normal court\" of the bench, which has swung far to the right with the appointment of three rightwing justices during Donald Trump's presidency, giving it a 6-3 conservative supermajority.\n\nSpeaking at the White House, Biden said: \"Discrimination still exists in America. Today's decision does not change that. It's a simple fact.\"\n\nAn analysis of student records by Students for Fair Admissions, a conservative activist group representing Asian American students in the lawsuit against Harvard, found that the institution, on average, rated Asian American applicants lower in personality and likability ratings than others. In oral arguments, Harvard's attorney, Seth Waxman, argued that the university did not discriminate against Asian Americans, noting that the university weighed multiple factors in their admissions process.\n\nThe court found that the universities' reasons for using race as a factor as a means of improving diversity \"fail to articulate a meaningful connection between the means they employ and the goals they pursue\".\n\nIn a majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that despite the universities' \"commendable\" goals, they fell short of constitutional standards. The \"opaque\" categories universities used to measure racial composition were \"plainly over broad\" and \"undermines, instead of promotes, respondents' goals,\" Roberts wrote. Roberts added that Harvard's program resulted in fewer Asian American students being admitted to the university, violating the Equal Protection Clause's standard that \"race may never be used as a \"negative\".\n\n\"Yet by accepting race-based admissions programs in which some students may obtain preferences on the basis of race alone, respondents' programs tolerate the very thing that Grutter foreswore: stereotyping,\" Roberts wrote.\n\n\"Respondents' assertion that race is never a negative factor in their admissions programs cannot withstand scrutiny,\" Roberts wrote. \"College admissions are zero-sum, and a benefit provided to some applicants but not to others necessarily advantages the former at the expense of the latter.\"\n\nThe court's decision against Harvard University and the University of North Carolina will limit the power of colleges and universities, particularly at selective institutions, to consider an applicant's race as a factor in the admissions process. Past research shows that the end of race-consciousness in university admissions, which affects roughly a quarter of US colleges and universities, will result in declines in Black, Latino and Indigenous students admitted to highly selective universities. That may cause a cascading reshuffling of those students to other, less selective universities and is likely to make the elite institutions less diverse.\n\nHighly selective private and state universities will now scramble to pursue race-neutral alternatives to improving diversity, a phenomenon that past research in states where affirmative action is already banned shows will not reach the same level of diversity as race-conscious admissions would.\n\nThe court noted that students could still discuss their race in their applications but that universities \"wrongly concluded\" that \"the touchstone of an individual's identity is not challenges bested, skills built, or lessons learned, but the color of their skin\".\n\nThe court argued that the universities' underlying goal of using race-conscious admissions until \"meaningful representation and meaningful diversity\" is achieved on their campuses lacked a \"logical endpoint\" and resulted in unconstitutional \"racial balancing\".\n\nThe court's decision on Thursday tears against the fabric of college campuses, going against decades of precedent consistently upheld by the highest court in the land. In the 1960s, after John F Kennedy first ordered government contractors to \"take affirmative action\" to combat racial discrimination, colleges and universities developed policies to further diversify who enrolled.\n\nSign up to First Thing\n\nOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what's happening and why it matters\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nThe idea met its first challenge in 1978, in a case involving Allan Bakke, a white man who was denied admission to the University of California at Davis medical school. The court concluded that race could be factored in the admissions process but stopped colleges from setting racial quotas.\n\nIn 2003, in the case Grutter v Bollinger, the US supreme court ruled that higher education institutions can factor in race as a means of achieving diversity at colleges and universities because it represented a \"compelling governmental interest\".\n\nFrom that moment, though, the clock ticked for race-conscious admissions: Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote in a majority opinion that \"25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary.\"\n\nIn the last decade, the conservative activist Edward Blum has led challenges seeking to curtail racial preferences in different aspects of American society, mostly recently in a 2013 case gutting the Voting Rights Act.\n\nMore than a decade later, in 2016, the US supreme court narrowly voted to uphold race-conscious admissions in a Blum-backed case by Abigail Fisher, a white woman denied admission to the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nBut since then the court has shifted further to the right, with a supermajority of six conservative justices following new appointments during the Trump administration.\n\n\"The entire point of the Equal Protection Clause is that treating someone differently because of their skin color is not like treating them differently because they are from a city or from a suburb, or because they play the violin poorly or well,\" Roberts wrote.\n\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson recused herself from the Harvard case but issued a blistering dissenting opinion in the UNC case, noting: \"Although formal race-linked legal barriers are gone, race still matters to the lived experiences of all Americans in innumerable ways, and today's ruling makes things worse, not better.\n\n\"If the colleges of this country are required to ignore a thing that matters, it will not just go away,\" Jackson wrote. \"It will take longer for racism to leave us. And, ultimately, ignoring race just makes it matter more.\"\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor also issued a dissent, warning that the ruling would \"entrench segregation in higher education.\"\n\nThe results of bans on affirmative action have been devastating and long-lasting, seeing the number of Black and Latino students plummet."

Last week, those challenges finally prevailed, as the court struck down race-conscious admissions, ruling them unconstitutional. Breaking away from decades of precedent, the chief justice, John Roberts, wrote in his opinion that universities had \"concluded, wrongly, that the touchstone of an individual's identity is not challenges bested, skills built, or lessons learned but the color of their skin. Our constitutional history does not tolerate that choice.\"\n\nI spoke to several civil rights advocates who are now hoping to curtail the fallout from the supreme court's decision. Some noted what they saw as a loophole: the court did not explicitly rule out consideration of a student's race in all situations. Roberts's statement continued: \"Nothing in this opinion should be construed as prohibiting universities from considering an applicant's discussion of how race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration or otherwise.\"\n\nReNika Moore , the director of the racial justice program at the American Civil Liberties Union, told me that Roberts's distinction leaves the door open for some interpretation. For instance, universities could acknowledge prospective students' background on a case-by-case basis, such as when the applicant brings it up in an essay. \"I don't think that the majority has provided a clear roadmap of 'OK, you can consider race, and this is how,'\" Moore said. \"I suspect that there will be additional litigation to make sense of what that fine line looks like, and what colleges and universities can do to consider an applicant's story and discussion of race.\"\n\nMoore also said that the ACLU would hold universities accountable for restrictive policies that act as barriers for applicants of color. It will advocate for schools to \"halt using metrics that don't predict success\", such as standardized testing, as well as legacy and athletic admissions and other factors that disproportionately benefit white students (43% of white students admitted to Harvard between 2009 and 2014 were legacy students, children of faculty or staff, children or relatives of donors, or recruited athletes; by comparison, Black, Latino and Asian student groups each accounted for less than 16% of admitted students characterized similarly during the same period). A trio of advocacy groups representing students of color has already taken on legacy admissions: Lawyers for Civil Rights sued Harvard University , alleging that the school's legacy admissions practices were \"exclusionary and discriminatory\" toward applicants of color and gave white students an \"unfair and unearned benefit that is conferred solely based on the family that the applicant is born into\".\n\nAdditionally, the ACLU, along with others, plans to lobby for the expansion of access to need-based financial aid, and the revision of college course requirements so that students who lacked access to certain courses in high school can still pursue majors in those fields. When I talked to Michaele Turnage Young , the senior counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, she explained that the inequities that race-conscious admissions programs sought to rectify actually manifest long before students of color step on college campuses. They arise in racially segregated neighborhoods , they stem from AP courses which students of color tend to have less access to, and they're solidified by a lack of qualified teachers , college prep instructors and counselors . Therefore, she said, colleges and universities should be pushed to take those factors into account. \"All of these things are disadvantaging applicants of color,\" Turnage Young said. \"Talent is everywhere, but opportunity is not.\" Education advocates are still combing through the supreme court's 237-page opinion in search of outlets for action. Whether their proposed tactics and strategies result in change remain to be seen. But their approach - lobby and litigation - has longstanding precedent.\n\nIn 1999, less than a year after California's ban on affirmative action went into effect, the ACLU represented a group of Black, Latino and Filipino American students in a lawsuit against the University of California system. The group argued that UC's admissions processes violated federal civil rights law by failing to account for the \"full range of indicators of 'merit'\". The case settled soon thereafter: by 2002, UC campus admissions programs adopted the \"holistic review\", which evaluates candidates based on the opportunities available to them. The system is still in place in California today. \"I imagine that there will be more days in court with this ruling, not less,\" Moore said. In that sense, civil rights leaders today refuse to see this moment - in which a conservative supermajority on the supreme court outlawed affirmative action - as settled. They still see opportunities for change, just as their predecessors did decades before them."

      "text": "For most Asian Americans, diversity is a core value - even if a loud minority contests it\n\nEdward Blum's group used Asian Americans for display to serve a longstanding anti-affirmative action agenda\n\nD uring last October's oral arguments in the supreme court's affirmative action cases, Justice John Roberts interrupted Harvard's lawyer, Seth Waxman, to ask: \"Isn't that what the case is about, the discrimination against Asian Americans?\"\n\nIn a word, no.\n\nThe decisions in the twin cases filed against Harvard and the University of North Carolina did not turn significantly on the alleged harms done to Asian Americans, but rather on how the justices interpreted the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment.\n\nInstead Asian Americans - who, in the American racial hierarchy, have always been placed between complicity and justice - were mainly there for display, as mostly white lawyers on both sides Asiansplained their history and positions to the court.\n\nAfter failing in their 2015 case Fisher v University of Texas to end affirmative action, calling it discriminatory against whites, Ed Blum and his former plaintiff, a white woman named Abigail Fisher, co-founded a group they called Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA). They pivoted to highlighting Asian American plaintiffs, gambling correctly that the court would be more likely to accept that a historically excluded minority group had been discriminated against by affirmative action.\n\nThey adopted the tactics, methods, and even some of the arguments of pro-affirmative action Asian Americans who had been fighting universities for decades. They tapped into a network of conservative Asian American activists, funded and supported by groups like the Pacific Legal Foundation, a conservative thinktank. Mike Yukong Zhao and his Asian American Coalition for Education mobilized immigrant parents for demonstrations on WeChat. These efforts were furthered by waves of disinformation .\n\nBut in order to win at court, SFFA deployed some stage trickery - disappearing Asian Americans at just the right moment. From the district court to the supreme court, SFFA produced exactly zero students and Asian Americans to testify. Even after forcing Harvard to turn over nearly 100,000 pages of documents, they could not produce a single individual case of discrimination.\n\nHarvard introduced four students, two of whom were Asian American. Sally Chen , a low-income, first-generation Chinese immigrant student accepted in 2015, testified that she was accepted amid a vast pool of valedictorians with perfect SATs and 4.5 GPAs only because of the school's holistic admissions process. She was able to tell her story, be seen, and valued. Judge Sotomayor noted this in her dissent, writing: \"At bottom, race-conscious admissions benefit all students, including racial minorities. That includes the Asian American community.\"\n\nSFFA stacked its legal team with former clerks of Judge Clarence Thomas. Then it gave its case gravitas with a blinkered history of anti-Asian discrimination that ignored everything after the 1940s. Thomas later included this version of events in his concurring opinion.\n\nHe added: \"Given the history of discrimination against Asian Americans, especially their history with segregated schools, it seems particularly incongruous to suggest that a past history of segregationist policies toward blacks should be remedied at the expense of Asian American college applicants.\"\n\nBut when Asian Americans first brought complaints of exclusion to the universities like Harvard, the University of California at Berkeley , Brown, Stanford and UCLA in the 1980s, they did not see a zero-sum game of competing oppressions - just more of the same racist exclusion that had affected Blacks and Asians alike. They felt they were exposing the lies of colorblind merit and colorblind meritocracy.\n\nIn 1983, Asian American Ivy League students, including Harvard students who had worked in their school's admissions office, wrote a damning expose of implicit bias in the institutions' practices: \"We feel that some admissions officers think all Asian Americans are passive - or should be. So they penalize those who do not conform to their racist stereotypes.\"\n\nForty years later, university lawyers could not offer satisfactory explanations for why Asian Americans still scored lower on personal ratings than other groups. Harvard claimed those scores had no impact on final admissions decisions, but this defense did them no favors with skeptical Asian Americans who had not forgotten.\n\nWorse, Harvard claimed that discrimination against Asian Americans had never been proven in court, a cynical bit of sophistry. And hundreds of pro-affirmative action Asian American civil rights lawyers, scholars and non-profit professionals signed briefs that failed to even reference this history or their community's heroic 75-year fight for equal opportunity and affirmative action. They seemed to believe the best strategy was to silence themselves and parrot Harvard's line - nothing to see here.\n\nFrom October to March every year, existential questions about self-presentation -should I hide my Asianness? Should I be myself? - and stories of possible past admissions discrimination - was it? Was it not? - ratchet up anxiety in households from Cupertino to McLean. Perhaps more than any other group, Asian Americans are invested in the ideal of meritocracy and feel betrayed by the practice of it.\n\nYet polls conducted just before the decision still found anywhere from 53% to 69% of Asian Americans support affirmative action programs. Diversity remains a core value for most Asian Americans, even if a loud minority contests it.\n\nThe spotlight will shift now to public magnet high schools like Thomas Jefferson high, Lowell high, and Stuyvesant high, where Asian Americans constitute a majority of students, and pro- and anti-diversity Asian Americans have been fighting over admissions policies. To paraphrase the question the writer Hua Hsu once posed to affirmative action opponents: \" How much is enough? \"\n\nNot long after SFFA's white lawyers explained the model minority myth to the justices, Florida's Governor Ron DeSantis moved to ban the study of African American studies while requiring schools to teach a pothole-strewn version of Asian American studies. Asian and Black educators decried DeSantis's move as a naked ploy to weaponize their histories of exclusion in a game of racial respectability politics.\n\nSome Asian American voices against affirmative action now recognize they were used. Michael Wang, the 27-year old whose meetings with Ed Blum over his failed attempt to get into Harvard helped propel the creation of Students for Fair Admissions, recently conceded : \"A part of me regrets what I've put forward.\" After being denied admission to Harvard, Wang enrolled at Williams College and characterized his time there as wonderful.\n\n\"Affirmative action is a Band-Aid to the cancer of systemic racism,\" he said. \"All I wanted was an answer. Instead of an answer, all I got was 10 years of questions.\" His frustration is now our national tragedy.\n\nJeff Chang's books include We Gon' Be Alright: Notes on Race and Resegregation . He was a co-founder of the Student Coalition for Fair Admissions , organized at UC Berkeley in 1987 by Asian American and other students to fight discrimination against Asian Americans and defend affirmative action"

      "text": "Here's Why The End Of Affirmative Action Will Be Devastating For People Like Me\n\nGuest Writer\n\nThe news alert consisted of just six words, but they made my stomach sink: \"Supreme Court Strikes Down Affirmative Action.\"\n\nPlease don't let it be true.\n\nI clicked through to find that the court had ruled the affirmative action programs at the University of North Carolina and Harvard violate the equal protection clause of the Constitution and are therefore unlawful.\n\nI never attended college. But I was 6 years old when I first walked through the doors of the Friends School, a Quaker-based private school in Cambridge, Massachusetts. I remember how cold the monkey bars on the playground were, even with mittens. I remember having my first scones when my teacher brought lemon ones in for snack one day. And I remember how the other girls wore their long, glossy hair loose down their backs, while my coarse curls, tamed into two fat braids, barely touched my shoulders.\n\nMy mother removed me from that school before the year was over because I was the only Black child there. I would go on to be removed from two more schools for the same reason. Wanting me to have the best education, she had carefully selected schools with excellent reputations. But she was unwilling to accept a school that didn't make diversity a priority. These schools would have to do better than offering me scholarships. They would need to ensure that I saw myself reflected back in their classrooms.\n\nAs I understand it, one of the early references to affirmative action in the U.S. was made by President John F. Kennedy in 1961 in an executive order directing government contractors to take \"affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\"\n\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson spoke about the idea of affirmative action in a 1965 speech shortly before issuing executive order 11246 to establish enforcement guidelines and documentation procedures for federal contractors.\n\nIn an America where, from its inception, discrimination was not only \"best practices\" but the law, affirmative action was viewed as our nation's effort to make good on harms done and level a distinctly unlevel playing field.\n\nBy 2017, when my youngest was applying to colleges, two of the five schools to which he was applying still had dismally low percentages of diversity. I encouraged him to include the Black American experience in his college essay, not because I wanted him to be only one, or one of a few, as has been my experience for my entire life, but because I hoped that affirmative action could create a pathway for someone who looks like my son to gain access to the elite college campuses that have traditionally excluded us.\n\nDuring his junior year, there was a backlash (or as some of us called it, a \"Blacklash\") against his school regarding its nationally ranked basketball team, of which my son was a member. Rumors swirled around about how Black players were \"recruited\" and financial aid dollars were unfairly distributed to certain members of the team. Despite the fact that affirmative action is intended to guarantee equal opportunity for all qualified persons, my son knew there would always be people who believed he got in \"just because he was Black.\"\n\nNo matter how qualified you are or what you are able to achieve, if you are Black, you are not safe from this insinuation. I was reminded of this on Thursday when I saw former first lady Michelle Obama's Instagram post in response to the Supreme Court decision.\n\n\"Back in college, I was one of the few Black students on my campus, and I was proud of getting into such a respected school. I knew I'd worked hard for it. But still, I sometimes wondered if people thought I got there because of affirmative action,\" she wrote.\n\nThis assumption, that an accomplishment by a person of color must be due to receiving an unfair advantage, is par for the course, despite the fact that the group that has actually benefited most from affirmative action is white women. With affirmative action helping to level the playing field for decades, white women today are more educated and make up a bigger slice of the workforce. And yet, no other group has done more to challenge these policies .\n\nThis ruling is sure to have a ripple effect beyond college campuses. In 2003, when I enrolled my two sons in a Los Angeles independent school, I was dismayed to find that decades after my own private school experience, some things hadn't changed. When we found out one of our sons was the only Black student in his class, their father and I considered pulling them out and placing them in a school where they would have other classmates of color. But instead, I joined the school's board of trustees in an effort to affect change from the inside - not just for my kids, but for all the kids to come.\n\nAt the beginning of my tenure, I created what is now a nationally recognized committee on diversity, equity, inclusion and justice. At first, it was just me, the lone Black board member, asking the 19 white (and one Asian) board members to put themselves in my children's shoes.\n\n\"Envision that as you gather for snack time or soccer, there are no other students at the table or on the field who look like you. Can you imagine what it's like to be the only Black child in a classroom while slavery or the civil rights movement is being discussed? Can we say that we are providing an equitable learning experience for all of our students when we still have singletons in almost every classroom? Not to mention the exceptional Black and brown children whose parents don't even know that our school exists, let alone that we would welcome their applications. Why aren't we doing more to reach these families?\"\n\nBut it soon became clear to me that the emotional appeal simply wouldn't suffice for my fellow board members. It was a Black woman who joined the board four years after me, later becoming my dear friend, who clued me in on how to accomplish our goal.\n\n\"The board can't respond to whether or not a single child might be struggling in their classroom because of their differences. The board responds to statistics. They need numbers,\" she said.\n\nWe board members were charged with ensuring that our school was among the top independent schools in the country. And the way to best accomplish this was to make sure that our graduates had the most options when it came to institutions of higher learning. The Ivy League universities were particularly interested in schools that offered a diverse pool of graduates, so we gathered some figures to present to the board.\n\n\"We can offer better options to our graduates if we provide them with a diverse learning environment. Our target schools are looking for kids who have been raised in and are comfortable in a global environment. For instance, Princeton literally put their diversity and inclusion building in the center of their campus in order to showcase their commitment to diversity.\"\n\nOur case hinged on the fact that in order to give our graduates the best options, schools like ours had to provide a diverse academic environment. It wasn't long before our metric for successful admission periods included increasingly higher percentages of Black and brown students. And although it will take years before our campus is more reflective of the world around us, we were getting there.\n\nMy fear now is that if diversity is no longer mandatory in higher education, then it won't be valued anywhere.\n\nThe hope of affirmative action was that by integrating colleges and universities, we could eventually integrate our nation's C-suites and public offices, so that the group making the decisions that affect us all is reflective of our population.\n\nBut this is not our reality, far from it. Only 5.9% of chief executives in the U.S. are Black. There are currently just three Black U.S. senators , and out of the 435 members of the U.S. House (which has one vacancy right now), about 13% are Black . As Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said so eloquently in her dissent, \"But deeming race irrelevant in law does not make it so in life.\"\n\nIn another Supreme Court decision last week, Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote the majority opinion, joined by the court's five other conservatives, in favor of a Christian web designer in Colorado who refuses to create websites to celebrate same-sex weddings based on religious objections. On Friday, after the same court struck down Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness program , the president said, \"This court has done more to unravel basic rights than any other court in history.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Supreme Court Declares Affirmative Action In Education Unconstitutional\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nThe Supreme Court declared affirmative action programs at public and private colleges and universities unconstitutional on Thursday in a decision written by Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nThe decision puts an end to most systems designed to help Black and Latino students access higher education after centuries of racial discrimination. Colleges and universities will no longer be allowed to seek greater diversity of their student bodies by preferencing race, although student applicants will not be precluded from discussing their race during the application process as it relates to their individual experience. The most immediate effect will be a decrease in the number of Black and Latino students admitted to the most selective schools, studies show .\n\nIn his opinion, Roberts stated that schools are not permitted to judge candidates for admissions based on their race.\n\n\"Many universities have for too long done just the opposite,\" Roberts wrote. \"And in doing so, they have concluded, wrongly, that the touchstone of an individual's identity is not challenges bested, skills built, or lessons learned but the color of their skin. Our constitutional history does not tolerate that choice.\"\n\nAdopted in the late-1960s in the wake of the Civil Rights Movement, college affirmative action policies aimed to increase Black and Latino attainment in higher education. They faced instant opposition from many white Americans and conservative politicians who came to see them as a form of \"reverse racism\" that favored Black and Latino students over white students. In the 21st century, the artificially low admittance rate of Asian American applicants became a focus of opposition to affirmative action.\n\nAsian American plaintiffs were at the center of the challenges in Students for Fair Admissions v. President and Fellows of Harvard College and Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. University of North Carolina, which have now ended affirmative action programs nationwide.\n\nThe court split along ideological lines in both cases. Conservative justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh, Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett joined Roberts in the North Carolina case while liberal justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented. The result in the Harvard case split on the same lines, but the vote was 6-2 because Jackson recused from the case.\n\nThe majority opinion rejected the affirmative action policies used by both Harvard and UNC as failing to meet the standards the court previously set out, for not having a \"logical end point\" and, most importantly for the majority, for violating the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause.\n\n\"[T]he Harvard and UNC admissions programs cannot be reconciled with the guarantees of the Equal Protection Clause,\" Roberts wrote. \"Both programs lack sufficiently focused and measurable objectives warranting the use of race, unavoidably employ race in a negative manner, involve racial stereotyping, and lack meaningful end points. We have never permitted admissions programs to work in that way, and we will not do so today.\"\n\nRoberts' opinion pointed back to Justice John Marshall Harlan's dissent in the 1896 \"separate but equal\" case of Plessy v. Ferguson to argue the use of race ― even to promote the equality of a long-discriminated-against minority group ― was unconstitutionally \"pernicious.\"\n\n\"[I]n view of the Constitution, in the eye of the law, there is in this country no superior, dominant, ruling class of citizens,\" Harlan wrote and Roberts quoted. \"There is no caste here. Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.\"\n\nThis outcome was not a surprise. The court's conservatives have long taken a dim view of affirmative action. The last major case, 2016's Fisher v. University of Texas, only achieved a majority that upheld some uses of affirmative action due to Justice Antonin Scalia's death. With Anthony Kennedy's departure in 2018 and Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death in 2020, affirmative action's fate was all but sealed.\n\nAffirmative action programs in education grew out of efforts to promote racial equality. This began in the post-Civil War period known as Reconstruction through the establishment of the Freedmen's Bureau, educational institutions like Howard University, and failed efforts to redistribute land and wealth. The 14th Amendment was also approved in the spirit of promoting racial equality following the end of slavery.\n\nThe reactionary movements of ex-slavers, however, blunted these efforts and, by the 1890s, defeated them. In 1896, the Supreme Court approved segregation policies in its infamous decision in Plessy v. Ferguson.\n\nIn 1961, amid the civil rights ferment in the Jim Crow South, President John F. Kennedy signed an executive order that ordered government contractors to \"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\" His successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson, followed with a similar order using the \"affirmative action\" phrasing. He also signed the Civil Rights Act, which banned racial discrimination in employment and established the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n\nThe spirit of affirmative action was voluntarily adopted at colleges and universities. Many of these programs operated on a quota system, with a set number of admissions guaranteed for Black students.\n\nBut these policies faced strong opposition from white Americans across the country, particularly as economic growth slowed in the 1970s. They splintered liberal coalitions as white people saw affirmative action as reducing their and their children's chances of reproducing or exceeding their parents' economic position.\n\nIn 1978, the Supreme Court heard arguments in its first big affirmative action case: Regents of the University of California v. Bakke. In a splintered decision, the court ruled that racial quotas for admissions were unconstitutional, but upheld the ability of schools to use race to some degree in admissions. The question was to what degree and for what reason.\n\nIn a solo opinion, Justice Lewis Powell decreed that increasing student body diversity was the lone reason to allow race-based admissions. The court fully adopted this reasoning in its 2003 decision in Grutter v. Bollinger while declaring points-based admissions policies that considered race unconstitutional. In that decision, however, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor declared that race-based admissions must have some endpoint.\n\n\"The Court takes the Law School at its word that it would like nothing better than to find a race-neutral admissions formula and will terminate its use of racial preferences as soon as practicable,\" O'Connor wrote at the time. \"The Court expects that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today.\"\n\nThe court has now ended gutted those precedents and ended affirmative action 21 years later.\n\nThe dissenting justices to Thursday's ruling noted the extreme irony of the majority's use of the 14th Amendment to end programs aimed at producing greater racial equality.\n\n\"The Court subverts the constitutional guarantee of equal protection by further entrenching racial inequality in education, the very foundation of our democratic government and pluralistic society,\" Sotomayor wrote in a dissent on the Harvard case.\n\n\"It is no small irony that the judgment the majority hands down today will forestall the end of race-based disparities in this country, making the colorblind world the majority wistfully touts much more difficult to accomplish,\" Jackson wrote in her dissent on the UNC case.\n\nWhile the decision ends race-based admissions policies, it does not deny the use of all forms of racial identification in admissions so long as they are through the lens of an applicant's experience as an individual.\n\n\"[N]othing in this opinion should be construed as prohibiting universities from considering an applicant's discussion of how race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration, or otherwise,\" Roberts wrote.\n\nStill, Roberts added, \"universities may not simply establish through application essays or other means the regime we hold unlawful today.\"\n\nIn a footnote, Roberts also stated that the decision does not apply to military academies.\n\nIt is not clear how colleges and universities will respond. Nine states, including California and Michigan, have already banned the use of affirmative action in state school admissions. Despite these bans, they have sought other ways to create racially diverse student bodies.\n\nIt is not immediately clear what the court's decision means for schools seeking alternative approaches to achieving a diverse student body.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Affirmative Action For White People? Legacy College Admissions Come Under Renewed Scrutiny.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - The next big fight over college admissions already has taken hold, and it centers on a different kind of minority group that gets a boost: children of alumni.\n\nIn the wake of a Supreme Court decision that strikes down affirmative action in admissions, colleges are coming under renewed pressure to put an end to legacy preferences - the practice of favoring applicants with family ties to alumni. Long seen as a perk for the white and wealthy, opponents say it's no longer defensible in a world with no counterbalance in affirmative action.\n\nPresident Joe Biden suggested colleges should rethink the practice after the court's ruling, saying legacy preferences \"expand privilege instead of opportunity.\" Several Democrats in Congress demanded an end to the policy in light of the court's decision to remove race from the admissions process. So did Republicans including Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, who is vying for the GOP presidential nomination.\n\n\"Let's be clear: affirmative action still exists for white people. It's called legacy admissions,\" Rep. Barbara Lee, a California Democrat, said on Twitter.\n\nFor critics of legacy admissions, the renewed debate over fairness in admissions has offered a chance to swing public sentiment behind their cause.\n\nAs colleges across the U.S. pledge their commitment to diversity following the court's ruling, activists have a simple response: prove it. If schools want to enroll more Black, Hispanic and Indigenous students, activists say, removing legacy preferences would be an easy first step.\n\n\"Now more than ever, there's no justification for allowing this process to continue,\" said Viet Nguyen, a graduate of Brown and Harvard who leads Ed Mobilizer, a nonprofit that has fought legacy preferences since 2018. \"No other country in the world does legacy preferences. Now is a chance to catch up with the rest of the world.\"\n\nUsing the Supreme Court decision as a catalyst, Nguyen's group is rallying the alumni of top colleges to press their alma maters to end the practice. The goal is to get graduates of the 30 schools to withhold donations until the policy ends. The schools include Harvard and the University of North Carolina, which were at the center of the court case, along with the rest of the Ivy League and the University of Southern California.\n\nIt builds on other efforts taking aim at the practice. Colorado banned it at public universities in 2021, and lawmakers in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York have introduced similar bills. In Congress, Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York and Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, both Democrats, are reviving legislation that would forbid it at all universities that accept federal money.\n\nLegacy preferences have become an easy target in the wake of a Supreme Court decision that hinged on questions of merit in the college application process, said Julie Park, who studies college admissions and racial equity at the University of Maryland. Instead of getting in on their own merit, she said, legacy students are just \"standing on their parents' shoulders.\"\n\n\"It's just low-hanging fruit,\" she said. \"People want something to do, and there's a strong rationale to get rid of it.\"\n\nSecretary Miguel Cardona urged colleges to \"ask themselves the tough questions,\" adding that legacy admissions and other types of special treatment \"have long denied well-qualified students of all backgrounds a level playing field.\"\n\n\"In the wake of this ruling, they could further tip the scales against students who already have the cards stacked against them,\" Cardona said in a statement to The Associated Press.\n\nIn the hazy world of college admissions, it's unclear exactly which schools provide a legacy boost and how much it helps. In California, where state law requires schools to disclose the practice, USC reported that 14% of last year's admitted students had family ties to alumni or donors. Stanford reported a similar rate.\n\nAt Harvard, which released years of records as part of the lawsuit that ended up before the Supreme Court, legacy students were eight times more likely to be admitted, and nearly 70% were white, researchers found.\n\nAn Associated Press survey of the nation's most selective colleges last year found that legacy students in the freshman class ranged from 4% to 23%. At four schools - Notre Dame, USC, Cornell and Dartmouth - legacy students outnumbered Black students.\n\nSupporters of the policy say it builds an alumni community and encourages donations. A 2022 study of an undisclosed college in the Northeast found that legacy students were more likely to make donations, but at a cost to diversity - the vast majority were white.\n\nSome prestigious colleges have abandoned the policy in recent years, including Amherst College and Johns Hopkins University. In the first year after dropping it, Amherst saw its share of legacy students in the freshman class fall by about half, while 19% of first-year students were the first in their families to attend college, the most in the school's history.\n\nSome colleges argue that, as their student bodies become more racially diverse, the benefits of legacy status will extend to more students of color. Opponents argue that white families still have an advantage, with generations of relatives who had access to any college.\n\nIvory Toldson went to college at Louisiana State University, but it wasn't an option for his parents in the Jim Crow South.\n\n\"My parents couldn't legally go to LSU. Discrimination is a lot more recent in our history than a lot of people seem to understand,\" said Toldson, a Howard University professor and the director of education, innovation and research for the NAACP.\n\nToldson said there's growing awareness of the irony that preferences for athletes and legacy students are still allowed, while race must be ignored.\n\nIn May, an AP-NORC poll found that few Americans think legacy admissions or donations should play much of a role in college admissions. Just 9% say it should be very important that a family member attended and 18% say it should be somewhat important. Likewise, only 10% say donations to the school should be very important and 17% say that should be somewhat important.\n\nThat same poll found that most Americans support affirmative action in higher education but think race should play a small role. Sixty-three percent said the Supreme Court should not block colleges from considering race in admissions, but 68% said it should not be a big factor.\n\nSeveral colleges declined to say whether they will continue providing a boost for legacy students next year, including Cornell and the University of Notre Dame.\n\nMeanwhile, Nguyen said he's more optimistic than ever. In the past, colleges have been reluctant to be among the first to make the change, he said. Now he thinks that's changing.\n\n\"In the next few months, I think the hesitancy will actually be who will be the last,\" he said. \"No university wants to be the last.\"\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press education team receives support from the Carnegie Corporation of New York.

      "text": "Supreme Court Declares Affirmative Action In Education Unconstitutional\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nThe Supreme Court declared affirmative action programs at public and private colleges and universities unconstitutional on Thursday in a decision written by Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nThe decision puts an end to most systems designed to help Black and Latino students access higher education after centuries of racial discrimination. Colleges and universities will no longer be allowed to seek greater diversity of their student bodies by preferencing race, although student applicants will not be precluded from discussing their race during the application process as it relates to their individual experience. The most immediate effect will be a decrease in the number of Black and Latino students admitted to the most selective schools, studies show .\n\nIn his opinion, Roberts stated that schools are not permitted to judge candidates for admissions based on their race.\n\n\"Many universities have for too long done just the opposite,\" Roberts wrote. \"And in doing so, they have concluded, wrongly, that the touchstone of an individual's identity is not challenges bested, skills built, or lessons learned but the color of their skin. Our constitutional history does not tolerate that choice.\"\n\nAdopted in the late-1960s in the wake of the Civil Rights Movement, college affirmative action policies aimed to increase Black and Latino attainment in higher education. They faced instant opposition from many white Americans and conservative politicians who came to see them as a form of \"reverse racism\" that favored Black and Latino students over white students. In the 21st century, the artificially low admittance rate of Asian American applicants became a focus of opposition to affirmative action.\n\nAsian American plaintiffs were at the center of the challenges in Students for Fair Admissions v. President and Fellows of Harvard College and Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. University of North Carolina, which have now ended affirmative action programs nationwide.\n\nThe court split along ideological lines in both cases. Conservative justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh, Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett joined Roberts in the North Carolina case while liberal justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented. The result in the Harvard case split on the same lines, but the vote was 6-2 because Jackson recused from the case.\n\nThe majority opinion rejected the affirmative action policies used by both Harvard and UNC as failing to meet the standards the court previously set out, for not having a \"logical end point\" and, most importantly for the majority, for violating the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause.\n\n\"[T]he Harvard and UNC admissions programs cannot be reconciled with the guarantees of the Equal Protection Clause,\" Roberts wrote. \"Both programs lack sufficiently focused and measurable objectives warranting the use of race, unavoidably employ race in a negative manner, involve racial stereotyping, and lack meaningful end points. We have never permitted admissions programs to work in that way, and we will not do so today.\"\n\nRoberts' opinion pointed back to Justice John Marshall Harlan's dissent in the 1896 \"separate but equal\" case of Plessy v. Ferguson to argue the use of race ― even to promote the equality of a long-discriminated-against minority group ― was unconstitutionally \"pernicious.\"\n\n\"[I]n view of the Constitution, in the eye of the law, there is in this country no superior, dominant, ruling class of citizens,\" Harlan wrote and Roberts quoted. \"There is no caste here. Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.\"\n\nThis outcome was not a surprise. The court's conservatives have long taken a dim view of affirmative action. The last major case, 2016's Fisher v. University of Texas, only achieved a majority that upheld some uses of affirmative action due to Justice Antonin Scalia's death. With Anthony Kennedy's departure in 2018 and Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death in 2020, affirmative action's fate was all but sealed.\n\nAffirmative action programs in education grew out of efforts to promote racial equality. This began in the post-Civil War period known as Reconstruction through the establishment of the Freedmen's Bureau, educational institutions like Howard University, and failed efforts to redistribute land and wealth. The 14th Amendment was also approved in the spirit of promoting racial equality following the end of slavery.\n\nThe reactionary movements of ex-slavers, however, blunted these efforts and, by the 1890s, defeated them. In 1896, the Supreme Court approved segregation policies in its infamous decision in Plessy v. Ferguson.\n\nIn 1961, amid the civil rights ferment in the Jim Crow South, President John F. Kennedy signed an executive order that ordered government contractors to \"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\" His successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson, followed with a similar order using the \"affirmative action\" phrasing. He also signed the Civil Rights Act, which banned racial discrimination in employment and established the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n\nThe spirit of affirmative action was voluntarily adopted at colleges and universities. Many of these programs operated on a quota system, with a set number of admissions guaranteed for Black students.\n\nBut these policies faced strong opposition from white Americans across the country, particularly as economic growth slowed in the 1970s. They splintered liberal coalitions as white people saw affirmative action as reducing their and their children's chances of reproducing or exceeding their parents' economic position.\n\nIn 1978, the Supreme Court heard arguments in its first big affirmative action case: Regents of the University of California v. Bakke. In a splintered decision, the court ruled that racial quotas for admissions were unconstitutional, but upheld the ability of schools to use race to some degree in admissions. The question was to what degree and for what reason.\n\nIn a solo opinion, Justice Lewis Powell decreed that increasing student body diversity was the lone reason to allow race-based admissions. The court fully adopted this reasoning in its 2003 decision in Grutter v. Bollinger while declaring points-based admissions policies that considered race unconstitutional. In that decision, however, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor declared that race-based admissions must have some endpoint.\n\n\"The Court takes the Law School at its word that it would like nothing better than to find a race-neutral admissions formula and will terminate its use of racial preferences as soon as practicable,\" O'Connor wrote at the time. \"The Court expects that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today.\"\n\nThe court has now ended gutted those precedents and ended affirmative action 21 years later.\n\nThe dissenting justices to Thursday's ruling noted the extreme irony of the majority's use of the 14th Amendment to end programs aimed at producing greater racial equality.\n\n\"The Court subverts the constitutional guarantee of equal protection by further entrenching racial inequality in education, the very foundation of our democratic government and pluralistic society,\" Sotomayor wrote in a dissent on the Harvard case.\n\n\"It is no small irony that the judgment the majority hands down today will forestall the end of race-based disparities in this country, making the colorblind world the majority wistfully touts much more difficult to accomplish,\" Jackson wrote in her dissent on the UNC case.\n\nWhile the decision ends race-based admissions policies, it does not deny the use of all forms of racial identification in admissions so long as they are through the lens of an applicant's experience as an individual.\n\n\"[N]othing in this opinion should be construed as prohibiting universities from considering an applicant's discussion of how race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration, or otherwise,\" Roberts wrote.\n\nStill, Roberts added, \"universities may not simply establish through application essays or other means the regime we hold unlawful today.\"\n\nIn a footnote, Roberts also stated that the decision does not apply to military academies.\n\nIt is not clear how colleges and universities will respond. Nine states, including California and Michigan, have already banned the use of affirmative action in state school admissions. Despite these bans, they have sought other ways to create racially diverse student bodies.\n\nIt is not immediately clear what the court's decision means for schools seeking alternative approaches to achieving a diverse student body.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "4 Key Points That Debunk Misconceptions Around Affirmative Action\n\nBlack Voices Editor/Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost\n\nIt's 2017 and some people still think affirmative action is unnecessary.\n\nThe New York Times reported Tuesday that it had obtained an internal announcement from the Trump administration stating that it would launch an investigation into universities that it believed were using affirmative action to discriminate against white people.\n\nThough the White House and Department of Justice have yet to confirm this investigation, it brought up a debate as old as the policy itself about whether affirmative action is fair.\n\nA year after the Supreme Court upheld the consideration of race in college admissions in Fisher v. University of Texas , there are people who still think affirmative action puts white people at a disadvantage. In the policy's more than 50-year history, myths of universities and companies promoting \"reverse racism\" have stuck. There are assumptions about affirmative action that don't take into account how and why people from marginalized communities gain access to opportunities. This is because some people don't understand how the policy works and why it's still relevant.\n\nHere's what affirmative action actually does and doesn't do:\n\nOne of the biggest misconceptions about affirmative action is that it's only based on race. This couldn't be further from the truth. Though the executive order President John F. Kennedy initially signed in 1961 made it unlawful to discriminate based on \"race, creed, color, or national origin\" for government contractors, in 1967 President Lyndon B. Johnson extended the policy to all employees nationwide and included sex and religion as well.\n\nFor more than five decades, affirmative action has sought to eliminate unlawful discrimination for all marginalized people.\n\nAffirmative action has always been meant to level the playing field in a way that civil rights laws alone could not. In 1965, Johnson underscored that point while speaking about the executive order at a commencement ceremony for Howard University, a historically black college.\n\n\"It is not enough just to open the gates of opportunity. All our citizens must have the ability to walk through those gates,\" he said. \"This is the next and the more profound stage of the battle for civil rights. We seek not just freedom but opportunity. We seek not just legal equity but human ability, not just equality as a right and a theory but equality as a fact and equality as a result.\"\n\nOpponents fail to realize that minorities, especially people of color, still face institutional disadvantages when it comes to being admitted to certain schools. And though race isn't the only identifying factor in admission processes, people of color are often accused of being unqualified for high-performing school and taking white students' places (even though Ivy League schools admit more legacy students than black students ).\n\nAnd though the candidates can gain access to education opportunities, affirmative action isn't about a \"quota,\" preferential treatment or a free ride. Race, ethnicity, religion and sex are used in a holistic approach to consider what candidates would be a good fit for the school.\n\nWriter Ashley C. Ford debunked these myths in a Twitter thread about her own experiences:\n\nDo you know how many white people truly and genuinely believe that black people get to go to college for free?\n\nPrograms stemming from affirmative action have been critical in ensuring gender equity and creating opportunities for women in business and in educational institutions that they've traditionally been shut out of. As beneficial as affirmative action has been for white women, a majority of them ( 67 percent ) oppose it, according to the 2014 Cooperative Congressional Election Study.\n\nIn the first two decades of affirmative action, white women saw more growth in their careers than any racial group. Columbia University law professor Kimberlé Crenshaw explained in her 2006 essay \" Framing Affirmative Action \" why depicting a black person as the poster child for affirmative action is flawed. \"The primary beneficiaries of affirmative action have been Euro-American women,\" she wrote.\n\nToday, women outnumber men on college campuses and are more likely to earn their bachelor's degrees and attend graduate school than men. More than 30 years after affirmative action was extended to include women, the percentage of female physicians jumped from 7.6 to 25.2 . However, these improvement are more likely to benefit white women than women of color.\n\nDiversity matters. And college campuses and companies still have a long way to go before they more accurately reflect America's demographics. Affirmative action, however, has played a big part in helping close some of the race gaps in higher education.\n\nMarginalized students have a harder time getting accepted into public research universities in states where affirmative action is banned, according to one 2013 study from the University of Washington. Researchers saw a 23 percentage-point drop in the chance of minority students being admitted compared to white students in states where the policy was not allowed, but just a 1 percentage-point drop in states where it was enforced.\n\nA diverse population on campus helps all students gain a greater awareness of social issues, promotes a higher level of academic engagement and leads to an overall better college experience, as noted by the University of Arizona .\n\nEmily Choi, an Asian American student at Harvard, told the Times that the policy has made a positive impact on her experience at the Ivy League institution.\n\n\"I firmly believe in affirmative action,\" she said. \"The diversity at Harvard has been key to my learning, and I think that if there weren't so many people of different backgrounds, I wouldn't be forced to think about things in new ways.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Affirmative Action Is In Danger, Again\n\nBarbara Grutter, a white lady from Michigan, filed suit when she was rejected by the University of Michigan Law School, which admitted that it took steps to ensure a racially diverse student body. In Grutter v. Bollinger , a landmark case on affirmative action that caught national attention in 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court determined the law school's admissions policies were not unconstitutional.\n\nHowever, the companion case, Gratz v. Bollinger, saw a different ruling: The Supreme Court deemed Michigan's undergraduate affirmative action process - in which an automatic 20 extra points were given to Blacks, Latinos and Native Americans on a 150-point admission scale - unconstitutional.\n\nI was in my senior year at Michigan in 2003, and I remember all the eyes on us. As I was wrapping up an enriching and life-changing scholastic career at the university, I'd hoped against hope that the high court - and the rest of the world - saw the value in having more people who looked like me matriculate at such a prestigious university.\n\nTwo decades later, we're back at it as bored septuagenarian Edward Blum continues his tireless crusade toward keeping universities as white as possible with not one but two lawsuits by his nonprofit Students for Fair Admissions against the University of North Carolina and Harvard University.\n\nPerhaps the most visible and vocal plaintiff in these cases is Jon Wang, a Chinese American teenager who believes he was rejected by Harvard and five other top universities despite stellar grades and a 1590 SAT score because of affirmative action.\n\nHowever, one of those six schools, the University of California, Berkeley, cannot employ race-based affirmative action in its admissions policies, making Wang one of the many qualified applicants who simply didn't get in.\n\nConsidering we have the most conservative Supreme Court in generations , no one is optimistic about the future of affirmative action as a means of diversifying American universities. Justice Clarence Thomas, who has been engaged in a personal battle against affirmative action despite benefiting from it as a highly successful Black man born in the 1940s South, will almost certainly disappoint the ancestors (once again) by voting against it later this month.\n\nMy personal experiences may seem inconsequential in the grand scheme of the affirmative action discussion, but, while whole books have been written about affirmative action in scope, not enough ink has been spilled about what diversity, or lack of it, feels like.\n\nThe University of Michigan had a roughly 6% Black student population when I started attending in 1999. At a bit under 50,000 students, that's roughly 3,000 Black folks - less than the population of my entire high school.\n\nWe kept things tight - there was never more than a degree of separation between any Black student - because culture dictated that we do so. Our parties were policed harder than others' and we leaned hard on each other, as well as the university's Black support staff, to make it to caps and gowns at one of the most challenging state universities in the country.\n\nWe had our Black homecomings, our Black graduation ceremonies, a Black Student Union and even \"Black dorms\" (word to Markley Hall in the mid-1990s). I'm a core member of a Black male support group that exists to this day; I remain connected to current students after 20 years away.\n\nI couldn't give you exact numbers, but most of the Black folks with whom I attended Michigan are unqualified winners in life. Even in my immediate crew of close Black male friends, I'm the only liberal arts chump among engineers and a medical doctor.\n\nThere's a good chance a lot of us wouldn't have even made it to Michigan without affirmative action.\n\nMy high school GPA wasn't mind-blowing. But my ACT score was decent, I wrote a damn good essay for my application and I attended a selective enrollment Detroit public school with a 90-plus-percent Black student population that fed to the University of Michigan - at some other school with the same grades, I might not have been accepted.\n\nConsidering it's a state institution a half-hour drive from Detroit, one of the Blackest major U.S. cities, Michigan recognized the importance of race-based admissions policies. But Gratz v. Bollinger made things harder for us: Michigan had only 4% Black enrollment in 2021 - a one-third drop from my time there.\n\nWhen I visit the campus today, I can feel the change: The spaces we carved out for ourselves have been either transformed or no longer exist. Testimonies from Black students from the last 15 years suggest that the university is simply ... whiter.\n\nRichard Sander and Stuart Taylor Jr. argue in their piece \"The Painful Truth About Affirmative Action\" for The Atlantic that lower-performing minority students placed in high-performing environments are set up for failure, but I disagree: Michigan didn't accept the scrubs skipping school four times a week to kick it at McDonald's just because they were Black. The 20 points it added were for students who took care of business in high school ... the valedictorians and folks active in extracurriculars.\n\nSome beneficiaries of affirmative action did flame out of Michigan, but so did many of the white students who made it in - depending on your major, the university can be brutally difficult, and the work requires discipline regardless of how you got admitted.\n\nFew opponents of affirmative action account for the positive effects a diverse student body has on everyone : Nothing bad will come of exposing students and staff to multiculturality on a collegiate level. To that end, the abolition of affirmative action in schools could also have a detrimental effect on the job market as it pertains to corporate diversity programs and the fact that businesses could again suffer the consequences of having C-suites that resemble a frat from \"Animal House.\"\n\nHarvard has admitted that there's no more efficient means of diversifying its student population than affirmative action policies; if the Supreme Court ruling goes badly, hopefully, universities can get creative and backdoor their ways into affirmative action.\n\nBlack matriculation and graduation from four-year universities remain frustratingly lower than for any other ethnicity , and data suggests that white women (who tend to push back against affirmative action) have historically been affirmative action's biggest beneficiary .\n\nThe sad irony is that many right-wing Black folks and other underrepresented minorities love to suggest that racism is all gone because ... hey, they worked really hard and became winners without handouts! A very notable exception is Colin Powell, who became the first Black secretary of state following a storied military career that began in a U.S. Army that had just been desegregated.\n\nPowell was a Republican, and he wasn't exactly loud on behalf of Black folks, but even he recognized the value of affirmative action .\n\nI've always empathized with the classic affirmative action counterpoint: the idea that a white male can work hard his entire life to get accepted to a prestigious school, only to \"lose\" his spot to an underrepresented minority whose grades weren't as good as his.\n\nHowever, as is the case with Wang, one cannot prove that affirmative action is the explicit reason they aren't accepted to one or several schools that weigh several factors to determine who gets in. Sometimes, you just get a bad break, and it's easier to point the finger at Black and brown folks.\n\nAlso, to understand socioeconomic and ethnic disadvantages is to realize why two candidates with different ethnicities and high school scores might be more comparable than what we see on paper. Since I'm sure Black Americans will be given the runaround for reparations until our great-grandkids are pushing daisies, I'll take whatever academic bonuses we can get - especially when applied to someone who will do them justice.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Activists Spurred By SCOTUS Affirmative Action Ruling Sue Harvard Over Legacy Admissions\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - A civil rights group is challenging legacy admissions at Harvard University, saying the practice discriminates against students of color by giving an unfair boost to the mostly white children of alumni.\n\nIt's the latest effort in a growing push against legacy admissions, the practice of giving admissions priority to the children of alumni. Backlash against the practice has been building in the wake of last week's Supreme Court's decision ending affirmative action in college admissions.\n\nLawyers for Civil Rights, a nonprofit based in Boston, filed the suit Monday on behalf of Black and Latino community groups in New England, alleging that Harvard's admissions system violates the Civil Rights Act.\n\n\"Why are we rewarding children for privileges and advantages accrued by prior generations?\" said Ivan Espinoza-Madrigal, the group's executive director. \"Your family's last name and the size of your bank account are not a measure of merit, and should have no bearing on the college admissions process.\"\n\nOpponents say the practice is no longer defensible without affirmative action providing a counterbalance. The court's ruling says colleges must ignore the race of applicants, activists point out, but schools can still give a boost to the children of alumni and donors.\n\nA separate campaign is urging the alumni of 30 prestigious colleges to withhold donations until their schools end legacy admissions. That initiative, led by Ed Mobilizer, also targets Harvard and other Ivy League schools.\n\nPresident Joe Biden suggested last week that universities should rethink the practice, saying legacy admissions \"expand privilege instead of opportunity.\"\n\nSeveral Democrats in Congress demanded an end to the policy in light of the court's decision, along with Republicans including Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, who is vying for the GOP presidential nomination.\n\nThe new lawsuit draws on Harvard data that came to light amid the affirmative action case that landed before the Supreme Court. The records revealed that 70% of Harvard's donor-related and legacy applicants are white, and being a legacy student makes an applicant roughly six times more likely to be admitted.\n\nIt draws attention to other colleges that have abandoned the practice amid questions about its fairness, including Amherst College and Johns Hopkins University.\n\nThe suit alleges that Harvard's legacy preference has nothing to do with merit and takes away slots from qualified students of color. It asks the U.S. Education Department to declare the practice illegal and force Harvard to abandon it as long as the university receives federal funding. Harvard did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.\n\n\"A spot given to a legacy or donor-related applicant is a spot that becomes unavailable to an applicant who meets the admissions criteria based purely on his or her own merit,\" according to the complaint. If legacy and donor preferences were removed, it adds, \"more students of color would be admitted to Harvard.\"\n\nThe suit was filed on behalf of Chica Project, African Community Economic Development of New England, and the Greater Boston Latino Network.\n\nIt's unclear exactly which schools provide a legacy boost and how much it helps. In California, where state law requires schools to disclose the practice, the University of Southern California reported that 14% of last year's admitted students had family ties to alumni or donors. Stanford reported a similar rate.\n\nAn Associated Press survey of the nation's most selective colleges last year found that legacy students in the freshman class ranged from 4% to 23%. At four schools - Notre Dame, USC, Cornell and Dartmouth - legacy students outnumbered Black students.\n\nSupporters of the policy say it builds an alumni community and encourages donations. A 2022 study of an undisclosed college in the Northeast found that legacy students were more likely to make donations, but at a cost to diversity - the vast majority were white.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "SCOTUS Ruled Against Affirmative Action And Abortion. And It's Not Done.\n\nSaturday, June 24, marked the first annive rsary of the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision, in which the Supreme Court - in an act of unfettered ashiness - saw fit to overturn Roe v. Wade, the la ndmark 1973 ruling that federally protected abortion rights.\n\nIf the high court has any mandate - expressed or otherwise - to protect U.S. citizens, it dropped the ball: Over turning Roe has made it harder for women to seek proper medical care and for doctors to fulfill the Hippocratic oath to do their job . Never mind the fact that the general public is in support of abortion rights - a meaningful aspect of health care is now at the mercy of certain idiotic governors (and, by proxy, some of their idiotic constituents).\n\nBut this piece isn't about abortion. This is about how the Supreme Court could start down the path of redeeming itself - and why it probably won't.\n\nThis week, the court is delivering some of its biggest decisions of the term before justices head to summer break. Apparently, the court often saves the most contentious rulings for the end of the term, and this time is no different.\n\nThese decisions will have reverberating social and political effects, with the largest impact on the most vulnerable communities. Unfortunately, the court is the most conservative it's been in generations , with six of the nine justices apparently willing to turn the country into the Republic of Gilead, thanks in large part to former President Donald Trump's appointments.\n\nMaybe the high court will pleasantly surprise me, but breath is not being held. Let's look at the issues that will likely have many of us fussing on social media this week and next:\n\nI wrote about this recently. On Thursday, the court, as expected, axed race-based admissions at the University of North Carolina and Harvard University, effectively ending the practice across the country.\n\nThe high court first dealt with these kinds of affirmative action policies in the 1970s , when it voted against the use of race-based quotas. But around half a century later, despite all we know about the positive impacts of affirmative action in schools and the potential negative effects of its abolition, even a diverse court featuring women and ethnic minorities ruled against it .\n\nThe court voted along ideological lines, which means I don't even need to look to see how Clarence Thomas voted, given his weird-ass beef with affirmative action .\n\nUnsurprisingly, Black and Latino students will most acutely feel this decision . Expect a tiki torch-laden party or three thrown by white conservatives thrilled to maintain the racial achievement gap.\n\nThis is a nother school-related decision. President Joe Biden endeared himself to many of us, if for no other reason, with his student loan forgiveness program, which aims to erase at least $10,000 in debt for individuals making less than $125,000 a year and families making less than $250,000.\n\nThis plan could impact more than 40 million Americans saddled with student loan debt. But Republicans are obvio usly in a tizzy because they think it's unfair to people who have paid off their loans - hence Biden v. Nebraska and Department of Education v. Brown , two cases on deck for the high court.\n\nSure, if you take out loans, you should expect to pay them back. But student loans aren't quite the same as credit card debt from copping a new pair of Jordans: You earn more money with a college degree, but obtaining one puts you into debt - so sayeth the system.\n\nCogent arguments exist on either side of the fence, but in a country that generally plays fast and loose with debt, we don't have proof of the long-term impact of student loan erasure.\n\nWe do know two things. First, our three years of student loan deferment amid the COVID-19 pandemic didn't tank the economy or the American college system. If anything, the end of the forbearance, expected Sept. 1, will have a detrimental effect on the economy .\n\nSecond, the university system is a goddamn racket to begin with. College costs have risen sharply in the past few decades, such that starting an OnlyFans page has become an increasingly attractive proposition for new college graduates. Meanwhile, some of the top universities are sitting on 11-figure endowments. (I chuckle when my alma mater calls asking for money. Then I hang up.)\n\nI'm not sure which way the court will go on this, but I simply don't wish to hear baby boomer Republicans who finished four years of college for $27.99 and a pack of No. 2 pencils complain about loan forgiveness.\n\nIt might be my imagination, but it feels like this Pride month has been more of a thorn in the boat shoe of the religious right than in recent years. Something about the practice of gender expression has really made these conservatives uncomfortable - it's both sad and amusing to watch.\n\nThey'll tack on another win if the court sides with Lorie Smith, the owner of Colorado-based design company 303 Creative, in 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis. Smith is suing the state for the right to refuse creating wedding websites for same-sex couples, as Jesus apparently preve nts her from doing so with a good conscience.\n\nSmith has reportedly never built wedding websites for anyone , so this is one of those ideological battles that she wants to be the face of because ... Karen. The problem is that the court voting in Smith's favor may create a precedent that allows businesses, for any reason, to refuse service to marginalized groups.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Affirmative Action Supporters Could Finally Revive It In California\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nIn 1996, California became the first of 10 states to pass a ban on affirmative action at its public institutions, outlawing them from considering race or gender when offering people employment, education or contracting opportunities. Twenty-four years later, that legislation is under the spotlight again, forcing Californians to grapple with just how progressive they really want to be.\n\nProposition 16 ― a measure that made its way on to the California ballot amid a pandemic that largely affects Black and Latinx people and a reckoning against racist police violence ― could reverse that 1996 law, known as Prop 209.\n\n\"I started working on this repeal the night Proposition 209 passed,\" the campaign's co-chair, litigator and civil rights activist Eva Paterson, told HuffPost.\n\nThe motivation behind Prop 16 is that as soon as California banned its public institutions from using affirmative action ― a policy of including groups of people in spaces that have historically discriminated against them ― women and people of color were immediately pushed out , its proponents say.\n\n\"People could no longer say, 'I don't see color. We're post-racial.' People went, 'No, systemic racism is here.'\"\n\nPaterson, president and co-founder of the Equal Justice Society, has helped to do polling on affirmative action in the years since Prop 209 passed. For years, the group didn't see the numbers it needed to overturn it. But the pandemic's outsized effect on people of color and the police killing of George Floyd, Paterson believes, helped tip the scales for the first time.\n\n\"People could no longer say, 'I don't see color. We're post-racial,'\" she said. \"People went, 'No, systemic racism is here.'\"\n\nBut it's been a tough fight for the Yes on Prop 16 campaign. Polls earlier this month showed it trailing badly, fighting an uphill battle with conservative white and Asian Americans who believed it would hurt them in university admissions, even though its proponents say no quotas will be established.\n\nThe No On Prop 16 campaign is led by Ward Connerly, a former member of the University of California Board of Regents who led the Prop 209 campaign in 1996. He recently praised President Donald Trump as the nation's first truly \"color-blind\" president. The campaign's biggest donation came from an Austin, Texas, group, called Students for Fair Admissions, which gave $50,000.\n\nJustin Phillips, a staff writer at the San Francisco Chronicle, reflected on how disheartening it is to see Prop 16 struggle in a state that prides itself on its liberal values.\n\n\"One thing Prop. 16 has done, even before people vote yes or no on it, is reveal California's true face. It's not one we should be proud of,\" wrote Phillips, who believes himself to be the only Black man working as a full-time food writer at a major daily news publication in the U.S. \"California is a place for a dialogue. But in 2020, it doesn't appear to be a place for action.\"\n\nPaterson isn't too fazed by those polls. She said the campaign always knew it wouldn't get a majority of support on the measure without helping people see through the confusing ballot language. They're making big strides doing that in the final weeks of the election, she said, by conducting heavy outreach with Latinx voters in Southern California and highlighting their big endorsements: Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the Golden State Warriors and other cultural icons in the Black community, from Tracee Ellis Ross to Dwayne Wade. It's also racked up endorsements from nearly every major newspaper in the state and The New York Times .\n\nWith just a few days to go, the tides may be turning enough for Prop 16 to eke out a win. A new poll by David Binder Research found that it's currently tied at 45% yes and 45% no, with 10% undecided. The campaign also pointed to a new Capitol Weekly poll showing it ahead 53-47.\n\n\"[W]e are confident that as voters continue to learn more about how Prop 16 levels the playing field for women and people of color they will continue to come over to our side,\" Prop 16 campaign manager Andy Wong said in a statement when the new polling came out.\n\nOne of the biggest misconceptions with affirmative action, Paterson said, is that it gives employment or educational opportunities to people who are under-qualified. In reality, she argued, there are discriminatory factors at play that make some candidates simply appear more qualified than others.\n\nWhite students at well-funded high schools, for example, have more access to Advanced Placement courses than Black students at schools with less funding. Students from both schools could get an A grade in every class, but the students with access to AP courses will have an inflated grade point average because of the way those grades are weighted.\n\n\"[W]e are confident that as voters continue to learn more about how Prop 16 levels the playing field for women and people of color they will continue to come over to our side.\"\n\n\"I was a part of 30 Black students admitted in my class in 1972 at Berkeley Law,\" Paterson recalled. \"The year after affirmative action was eliminated, there was not one Black student admitted to Berkeley Law. Not one.\"\n\nStudies show that the affirmative action ban had little impact on white and Asian American university applicants, who go on to attend selective universities and graduate with good career prospects at the same rates regardless of diversity policies.\n\nWhile the ban on affirmative action is often discussed in the context of school admissions, it has left its mark elsewhere, too.\n\nBefore 1996, the California government used to award nearly a quarter of its public contracts to minority- and women-owned businesses. When Prop 209 disbanded that program, those businesses lost out on around $825 million a year, according to a study from the Equal Justice Society .\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

The U.S. government had previously filed an amicus brief in the lawsuit asking for an exception for military academies. That brief stated that U.S. military leaders \"have learned through hard experience that the effectiveness of our military depends on a diverse officer corps that is ready to lead an increasingly diverse fighting force.\" Although the court rejected the same logic being applied to elite colleges, it evidently accepted the need for diversity among future generations of West Point graduates, stating in a footnote to the majority opinion that:\n\nThe United States as amicus curiae contends that race-based admissions programs further compelling interests at our Nation's military academies. No military academy is a party to these cases, however, and none of the courts below addressed the propriety of race-based admissions systems in that context. This opinion also does not address the issue, in light of the potentially distinct interests that military academies may present.\n\nA common criticism of affirmative action programs at universities is that they undermine merit as a primary criterion for selection. Yet the same concern seems equally, if not more, relevant to U.S. military leadership, particularly given the strong emphasis on national security normally espoused by U.S. politicians and the electorate.\n\nThe court is apparently hesitant to prioritize demographic diversity in admissions to colleges that, ultimately, determine the future appearance of the country's elite. But the same concerns do not seem to apply to the military, where one of the possibilities of membership, rather than joining the gilded class, is being severely injured or killed in one of the U.S.'s many foreign military conflicts.\n\nDespite the court's ruling, which has been widely celebrated among opponents of affirmative action, it is not entirely clear how much that the composition of elite colleges will change. The decision says that universities may continue to consider in admissions \"an applicant's discussion of how race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration or otherwise.\"\n\nThis apparent loophole potentially allows applicants to continue to be accepted on the basis of racial background, provided they also give a personal statement about their race that could easily become de rigueur in the future.\n\nThe far more pervasive form of elite affirmative action - embodied by preferential treatment for legacy admissions, the children of financial donors, athletes, and relatives of school staff - was left untouched by the court ruling. The oversight is a significant one.\n\nThere was, however, one mention of it: In his concurring opinion, Justice Neil Gorsuch chastised elite schools like Harvard for their attempts to uphold affirmative action while continuing to defend legacy admissions. Harvard's \"preferences for the children of donors, alumni, and faculty are no help to applicants who cannot boast of their parents' good fortune or trips to the alumni tent all their lives,\" he wrote.\n\nNonetheless, a 2019 study found that a whopping 43 percent of white students at Harvard were beneficiaries of one of these forms of preferential access. While 70 percent of legacy admissions were white, only 16 percent of Black, Latino, and Asian students benefitted from these preferential considerations.\n\nIn effect, while rolling back affirmative action, the court left unscathed a backdoor means of demographic engineering in college admissions that is equally indifferent to merit as a criterion.\n\nThe reversal of affirmative action at elite schools will likely have reverberations well beyond the institutions themselves, including downstream changes in the internal culture of workforces and non-governmental institutions that had been encouraged for years to make demographic diversity a priority in hiring.\n\nYet the apparent inconsistencies in the ruling, including carve-outs for the military and continued preferential treatment for the wealthy and well connected, will likely make the decision a bitter one for many who had supported affirmative action to address America's history of racial inequity.\n\nIn her dissent to the ruling, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that the military exemption in particular \"highlights the arbitrariness\" of the court's decision. Sotomayor minced few words in expressing the depths of her objections to the ruling, which will likely be a landmark one in the history of America's post-civil rights legal movement.\n\n\"When proponents of those arguments, greater now in number on the Court, return to fight old battles anew, it betrays an unrestrained disregard for precedent,\" Sotomayor wrote in her dissent. \"It fosters the people's suspicions that 'bedrock principles are founded ... in the proclivities of individuals' on this Court, not in the law, and it degrades 'the integrity of our constitutional system of government.'\"\n\nWAIT!

The decision says that universities may continue to consider in admissions \"an applicant's discussion of how race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration or otherwise.\"\n\nThis apparent loophole potentially allows applicants to continue to be accepted on the basis of racial background, provided they also give a personal statement about their race that could easily become de rigueur in the future.\n\nThe far more pervasive form of elite affirmative action - embodied by preferential treatment for legacy admissions, the children of financial donors, athletes, and relatives of school staff - was left untouched by the court ruling. The oversight is a significant one.\n\nThere was, however, one mention of it: In his concurring opinion, Justice Neil Gorsuch chastised elite schools like Harvard for their attempts to uphold affirmative action while continuing to defend legacy admissions. Harvard's \"preferences for the children of donors, alumni, and faculty are no help to applicants who cannot boast of their parents' good fortune or trips to the alumni tent all their lives,\" he wrote.\n\nNonetheless, a 2019 study found that a whopping 43 percent of white students at Harvard were beneficiaries of one of these forms of preferential access. While 70 percent of legacy admissions were white, only 16 percent of Black, Latino, and Asian students benefitted from these preferential considerations.\n\nIn effect, while rolling back affirmative action, the court left unscathed a backdoor means of demographic engineering in college admissions that is equally indifferent to merit as a criterion.\n\nThe reversal of affirmative action at elite schools will likely have reverberations well beyond the institutions themselves, including downstream changes in the internal culture of workforces and non-governmental institutions that had been encouraged for years to make demographic diversity a priority in hiring.\n\nYet the apparent inconsistencies in the ruling, including carve-outs for the military and continued preferential treatment for the wealthy and well connected, will likely make the decision a bitter one for many who had supported affirmative action to address America's history of racial inequity.\n\nIn her dissent to the ruling, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that the military exemption in particular \"highlights the arbitrariness\" of the court's decision. Sotomayor minced few words in expressing the depths of her objections to the ruling, which will likely be a landmark one in the history of America's post-civil rights legal movement.\n\n\"When proponents of those arguments, greater now in number on the Court, return to fight old battles anew, it betrays an unrestrained disregard for precedent,\" Sotomayor wrote in her dissent. \"It fosters the people's suspicions that 'bedrock principles are founded ... in the proclivities of individuals' on this Court, not in the law, and it degrades 'the integrity of our constitutional system of government.'\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Yale Legacy Admission Brett Kavanaugh Is Now the Swing Vote on Affirmative Action at Universities\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nA decades-old policy is now facing a legal challenge from the same conservative movement that shaped the ideology of Yale graduate Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nDuring his Senate Judiciary Committee testimony, new Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh took obvious pride in getting into Yale, citing it as evidence that he didn't have a drinking problem. \"I got into Yale Law School. That's the No. 1 law school in the country. I had no connections there. I got there by busting my tail in college.\"\n\nBut, as with much of his testimony, this wasn't exactly true: Kavanaugh's grandfather had gone to Yale University for undergrad, just as Kavanaugh later did, making him a legacy student. And admission to an undergraduate institution can more than double a student's chance of getting into that institution's graduate schools. Getting into college, especially Ivy League schools, is traditionally as much a matter of who you know as it is what you know.\n\nFor this and other long-recognized structural reasons, it has historically been more difficult for minority applicants to get accepted into institutions of higher learning. The remedy for this society-wide disadvantage became known as affirmative action - the idea that admissions officers would affirmatively work to consider the relative advantages of wealthier, whiter candidates against less affluent, browner candidates, in order to level the playing field.\n\nThe practice of considering race in admissions processes now faces a new legal challenge, and with Kavanaugh on the bench, the Supreme Court could be poised to strike it down. The Wall Street Journal editorial page on Monday anticipated just that outcome, if Chief Justice John Roberts decides to go for it:\n\nWith the politics surrounding the Court so polarized, [Roberts] might be more cautious than warranted on issues where the Court needs to clear up its own indecision. One of those issues is the constitutionality of racial preferences, about which former Justice Anthony Kennedy continued the legal hair-splitting of Sandra Day O'Connor. Justice Kavanaugh is likely to join the other four conservatives.\n\nThat the blow would be dealt by a legacy Yale admission from Georgetown Preparatory School is perhaps as fitting as it is ironic.\n\nThe elite hold over the American college admissions process has slightly lessened in past decades, provoking a backlash from conservatives who claim that considering race in that process is a form of discrimination. One of the leading voices in that fight is Edward Blum, a conservative political activist who is most famous for his 2016 attempt to dismantle affirmative action in Fisher v. University of Texas. That effort flopped, losing 7-1, in part because the plaintiff objectively and demonstrably did not meet the admission standards of the school she claimed she was entitled to attend.\n\nRead our complete coverage\n\nOn October 15, Blum will be back, this time with a potential Supreme Court majority. A group called Students for Fair Admissions , which Blum founded, will go to trial in Massachusetts District Court, claiming that Harvard University is discriminating against Asian-American applicants to the school.\n\nIn late September, Jeff Sessions's Justice Department brought its own suit against Yale, claiming the university's admissions policies unfairly disadvantage whites.\n\nThere's a lot of money behind Blum's efforts. The SFFA is funded primarily by right-wing dark money filtered through groups like Donors Trust, a 501(c)3 organization that benefits right-wing charities by bundling donations from the Koch brothers and the Mercer family, among others. Lawson Bader, the president of Donors Trust , told The Intercept in an email that SFFA is just one of the many organizations his group funds. \"We have made over $1 billion in grants to nearly 2,000 such organizations focused on social welfare, religion, health, medicine, education, public policy, the environment, economics, governance, foreign relations, and arts and culture,\" said Bader.\n\nAccording to filings reviewed by The Intercept, at its founding in 2015, SFFA received $500,000 from the Project on Fair Representation , another Blum foundation. In 2015 and 2016, SFFA received a total of $699,350 from the Project on Fair Representation; in 2016, Donors Trust gave to SFFA directly, pouring some $250,000 into the organization.\n\nSFFA cites the low \"personal rating\" scores Harvard gives to Asian-American applicants to demonstrate that the university's admissions process discriminates against them. The ratings , which range from 1 to 6 in descending order (1 is \"outstanding,\" while 6 is \"worrisome\"), consider \"humor, sensitivity, grit, leadership, integrity, helpfulness, courage, kindness and many other qualities.\" Asian-American students have consistently scored on the lower end, the suit claims.\n\nMore broadly, the case challenges the constitutionality of using race as a factor in admissions altogether. Although racial quotas have long been deemed unconstitutional, the limited use of race in the admissions process alongside race-neutral factors has been upheld by a number of Supreme Court decisions, including most recently in Fisher v. University of Texas. In the Fisher case, the court held that the University of Texas had a \"compelling interest\" in considering race, satisfying the standard of scrutiny required to establish whether the government's raced-based interventions are constitutional.\n\nIt's important to separate those two prongs of the complaint in order to parse out the question of motive, explained Nicole Gon Ochi , an attorney with Asian Americans Advancing Justice, or AAAJ, a group which filed an amicus brief with Harvard in the lawsuit. If Harvard is giving an advantage to white applicants over Asian-American applicants, that's unrelated to the constitutionality of affirmative action - though Blum has tried to muddy the waters. \"These two distinct issues have been intentionally conflated by Edward Blum to drive a wedge between Asian-Americans and other communities of color, in a play that will ultimately benefit the white majority if it is successful,\" Ochi told The Intercept.\n\nKavanaugh provided legal counsel to President George W. Bush during the 2000 Florida recount litigation, and was in the White House when the administration pushed against the University of Michigan's use of race as a factor in admissions. He declined to comment on affirmative action at his hearing. \"As a lawyer in the White House, any views I expressed would have been in keeping with trying to advance President Bush's legal and policy agenda. As a judge and a nominee, your question implicates issues that remain in dispute and that may come before me as a judge. As I discussed at the hearing, and in keeping with nominee precedent, it would be improper for me as a sitting judge and a nominee to comment on cases or issues that might come before me,\" he said .\n\nHe was later asked why it was okay for him to take pride in his ability to hire diverse clerks, but universities ought to be barred from doing the same thing.\n\n\"I am proud of my record of hiring the best to serve as my law clerks - including women and minorities - and of my efforts to promote diversity. The extent to which public universities may consider certain factors as admissions criteria is the subject of precedent and ongoing litigation,\" he said.\n\nIn his follow-up hearing sparked by sexual assault allegations, Kavanaugh was much less reticent to express opinions, blasting Senate Democrats on the committee and decrying what he called a conspiracy against him to exact \"revenge on behalf of the Clintons.\" He noted that \"what goes around comes around,\" denouncing the \"special interests\" who he said were engaged in the conspiracy. The policy of affirmative action is most closely associated with Democrats - or \"you people,\" as Kavanaugh referred to them at his hearing - which suggests he is unlikely to look dispassionately at the case.\n\n\"If you have Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court replacing Kennedy, then yeah, I do think\" Harvard will lose the case, said University of Pennsylvania law professor Kermit Roosevelt . \"Not because Harvard was doing anything wrong under current law, but because the Supreme Court is going to change its interpretation.\"\n\nKavanaugh was pressed by Sen. Cory Booker , D-N.J., during the confirmation process on a number of comments he made that suggest he opposes affirmative action in admissions, but the judge deflected those questions.\n\nPedestrians walk past a Harvard University building on Aug. 30, 2018, in Cambridge, Mass.\n\nJennifer Holmes is a member of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund team working on the case on behalf of a coalition of Harvard alumni and students. In an interview with The Intercept, she pointed out that SFFA and Blum have no history of supporting or advocating for Asian-American students. Blum's history of fighting anti-discrimination laws, on the other hand, provides more of a window into the reasons for SFFA bringing the suit, said Holmes. \"They want to undermine affirmative action,\" Holmes said. \"And it's important that those motivations are laid bare.\"\n\nThe lawsuit is expected to go to trial on October 15, and the Justice Department has joined SFFA's side in the litigation. That's in contrast to the Obama administration, which backed the University of Texas in the Fisher case. \"No American should be denied admission to school because of their race,\" said Sessions in a statement that was highly critical of Harvard's admissions process.\n\nIn an email, general counsel for the American Council on Education, Peter McDonough , said Blum's strategy would force universities and colleges across the country to completely revamp their admissions processes. According to McDonough, if SFFA wins out in the lawsuit, schools would be forced to use a uniform set of requirements for admission which won't allow for considerations of race. \"SFFA, in substance, asks the Court to require fundamental changes to university admissions processes, and to mandate a more mechanical process in which educators' ability to choose which academic and other criteria they wish to use, weigh, and apply play next to no role,\" said McDonough.\n\nPeter Wood is president of the National Association of Scholars , a right-wing advocacy group that concentrates on education, and which filed an amicus brief in the Harvard case on SFFA's behalf. He told The Intercept that his organization provided support to Blum's case because of his association's 30-year-long commitment to resisting racial considerations in student admissions. \"From our founding, we've opposed racial preferences in higher education,\" said Wood.\n\n\"Supporting the suit by Asian students against Harvard was an easy decision for us,\" Wood told The Intercept. \"We believe the law should be colorblind - students should be assessed on their abilities.\"\n\nBlum agrees. The SFFA's case, in his mind, is part of a history of American activism. \"The lawsuit's goal is to reclaim the cornerstone of the civil rights movement,\" said Blum, \"which is the proposition that your race and ethnicity should not be used to help you or harm you in your life's endeavors.\"\n\nOriginal reporting.

Rather, the intent is to create an equal playing field for groups that have been hindered both historically and currently. And beyond that historical course correction, there's an argument to be made for affirmative action and any laws that provide ways to diversify the student body: It's good for everyone. Indeed, one criticism of affirmative action from the left is that its main purpose, from a university's perspective, is not to benefit the minority applicants themselves but to provide the white students with a rich and diverse experience, while they remain sheltered in an elite environment. Learning in a diverse environment has been shown to provide students with better educational outcomes and better outcomes in the workforce. Those outcomes are part of the reason, Holmes said, that her clients are supporting Harvard in the case. \"Harvard is an important place to learn alongside people of different backgrounds,\" said Holmes.\n\nBlum is perhaps best known for his involvement in the Fisher case, where plaintiff Abigail Fisher - backed by Blum's Project on Fair Representation - contended that her race was the determining factor preventing her admission to the University of Texas. However, it was Fisher's subpar grades and test scores that proved the deciding factor in her rejection, not her race. A Supreme Court ruling in 2016 rejected Fisher's argument, upholding the university's right to use race as one of the considerations for admission.\n\nBlum's litigation has a pattern of aiming for decisions that would result in negative consequences for minorities, particularly blacks and Hispanics. He brought Shelby County v. Holder to the Supreme Court in 2013, where a ruling in Blum's favor vacated a major piece of the Voting Rights Act. The main beneficiaries of a rule change regarding Harvard's application process would be white applicants, whose numbers in the student body would increase the most, according to experts consulted by the university. \"The laws he's attacked are ones that were conceived of to remedy former negative outcomes for blacks and, in some places, Hispanics,\" said Holmes.\n\nMaybe that's why Blum doesn't want to testify - taking the focus off the plaintiffs and placing it onto the conservative activist might imperil the case. Blum's attorneys filed a motion to keep him from being called to testify in the case, claiming that \"Mr. Blum has nothing to add.\" Blum's name was not on the witness list provided by Harvard on Monday.\n\nDescribing his past, his opinions, and his involvement with the organization as irrelevant to the lawsuit, Blum dismissed the possibility of testifying in the lawsuit in an email to The Intercept. \"My role in this case has no bearing on the evidence SFFA has assembled in the last 3 1/2 years,\" said Blum.\n\nThat makes sense, said Oren Nimni , an attorney with the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice and the legal editor for Current Affairs magazine, if only from a political point of view. It's well-documented that Blum has founded groups that focus on attacking affirmative action; exposing that connection in open court could be damaging. \"It's not to his advantage if he's seen as the architect of the case,\" said Nimni, arguing that Blum learned from his loss in the Texas case. \"He probably, and rightly, assumes this is harder to call foul on.\"\n\nCorrection: October 10, 2018 A previous version of this article incorrectly referred to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund as part of the NAACP. The LDF is a separate entity.\n\nTop photo: Students attend Harvard University's 367th commencement exercises on May 24, 2018, in Cambridge, Mass.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Columbia Law Professor Smeared by Israel Supporters Could Lose Her Job\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\n\"There's a very good chance that they will fire me,\" said Katherine Franke, a tenured professor who has defended students protesting for Gaza.\n\nWhile the Columbia University campus has mostly emptied out for summer vacation, the school is charging forward with an investigation into a prominent law school professor over comments that were misconstrued by supporters of Israel.\n\nThe university recently deposed tenured law professor Katherine Franke as part of an investigation stemming from an interview she gave to \"Democracy Now!\" in January. During that interview, Franke was asked about allegations that two students who had previously served in the Israeli army had sprayed a chemical at their classmates at an on-campus rally for Gaza.\n\nFranke, who has worked at the school for decades, responded by linking the incident to a documented pattern of on-campus harassment that Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim students have alleged for years.\n\n\"Columbia has a program with older students from other countries, including Israel,\" Franke said, referring to the school's General Studies program. \"It's something that many of us were concerned about because so many of those Israeli students who then come to the campus are coming right out of their military service. And they've been known to harass Palestinian and other students on our campus, and it's something the university has not taken seriously in the past.\"\n\nThe remarks set off a firestorm, with commentators suggesting that Franke was calling to ban all Israeli students from campus. Within a few days of the interview, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz published an article titled \"Columbia University Pushes Back Against Professor Who Vilified Israeli Students,\" citing a statement from the university affirming its support for Israeli students.\n\nBy February 13, Franke was notified of a complaint against her based on the interview, filed by two law school professors who alleged violations of university discrimination policy. Online, supporters of Israel continued to misconstrue Franke's statements, while a Republican lawmaker asked University President Minouche Shafik about Franke during an April hearing about campus antisemitism.\n\nColumbia refused to answer The Intercept's questions on the pending investigation, but referred to its equal opportunity and affirmative action policies and procedures . The document lists a range of possible disciplinary action, including probation, administrative leave or suspension, and dismissal or restriction from employment.\n\nFranke is one of several Columbia staff to face investigation - many of whom have defended Palestinian rights - while the House Committee on Education and the Workforce continues to apply pressure on the school. Recently, three deans were placed on indefinite leave for exchanging text messages the university says \"touched on ancient antisemitic tropes.\" Professors elsewhere across the country have had their livelihoods imperiled upon speaking out in defense of Palestinians.\n\n\"What's of greatest concern is not really my 20-year-plus career at Columbia, but what this says about peaceful protest on our campuses, around the lives and dignity of Palestinians,\" Franke said in an interview with The Intercept.\n\n\"What's happening to me is happening to our students, it's happened to people on many other campuses. And it's, to me, shocking at a place like Columbia - which prides itself on being a home for, if not only tolerating, maybe welcoming student engagement with public events or public affairs like the crisis in the Middle East,\" she continued. \"And yet they're punishing me and others for standing up for our students who I think are engaging in appropriate protest.\"\n\nRead our complete coverage\n\nFranke's career as a lawyer and legal scholar has focused on gender and sexuality law, and she has also done human rights work focused on Israel's occupation of Palestine. In 2018, Israel deported Franke upon her arrival in the country to take part in a human rights delegation. As Israel's ongoing war on Gaza has roiled the Columbia campus, Franke has defended students speaking out on behalf of Palestinians or criticizing the Israeli government. She has also been unabashed in her criticism of the university administration's response to student protests.\n\nIn its statement to Haaretz on the heels of Franke's \"Democracy Now!\" interview, a university spokesperson said, \"We are disheartened to see some members of our community and beyond use this moment to spread antisemitism, Islamophobia, bigotry against Palestinians and Israelis. Especially at a time of pain and anger, we must avoid language that vilifies, threatens, or stereotypes entire groups of people. It is antithetical to Columbia's values and can lead to acts of harassment or violence.\"\n\nAs the controversy persisted ahead of the April congressional hearing, Franke reached out to Shafik through another senior administrator to relay her concerns. (Franke said she did so because she had been unable to get Shafik to meet with her or respond to her efforts to connect). In an email that she asked the administrator to forward to Shafik, she rebutted the misinformation that had circulated about her interview and reiterated that she wasn't calling to ban Israeli students from campus.\n\nRather, she wrote, she was voicing concern \"about students coming onto our campus who have just completed their military service in Israel - the transition to civilian life - after having been taught that Palestinians are evil and want to kill Israelis/Jews - can be a rough one for some people.\"\n\nFranke said she never heard from Shafik about the email.\n\nShe was right to be on guard. At the April 17 hearing , Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., asked Shafik what she was doing about Franke, who, Stefanik falsely claimed, said \"all Israeli students who have served in the IDF are dangerous and shouldn't be on campus.\"\n\n\"I agree with you that those comments are completely unacceptable and discriminatory,\" Shafik said, accepting Stefanik's framing. \"I think she will be finding a way to clarify her position.\" The president added that \"a very senior person in the administration\" spoke to Franke, who said the comments were not what she intended to say.\n\nWhile Shafik's comments indicated knowledge of Franke's interaction with the senior administrator, the president misconstrued the core point of Franke's outreach: She didn't mean those \"unacceptable\" comments because she did not say them.\n\nShafik's office did not respond to The Intercept's questions.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nAs part of the school's investigatory process, the university deposed Franke for a couple of hours on June 13. The deposition was handled by outside investigators at the insistence of Franke and her lawyer, who argued that she had been prejudged by the school's president.\n\n\"Today, it's Palestine. Tomorrow could be abortion.\"\n\n\"It seemed clear to me that they had made their mind up already, coming into the deposition, that I was generalizing in a way that would make people who served in the IDF or Israelis feel bad, and so there's a very good chance that they will fire me,\" Franke said. She said that the person who deposed her seemed to be trying to goad her into agreeing with the premise of the violations alleged, asking questions like, \"You can understand that somebody might hear what you said and take it as discriminatory?\"\n\nFranke is expecting a decision any day now. She was told the university would make a decision in a matter of weeks.\n\n\"Today, it's Palestine. Tomorrow could be abortion. It could be, you know, criticizing the Trump administration. It could be climate change,\" Franke said. \"I feel like it's Palestine today, but what's at stake here is something much larger, of the imposition of a kind of orthodoxy around a very contested political concept or context.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Trump Brags He \"Brought Back Free Speech\" Hours After Calling to Ban \"Illegal\" Protests\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nOn the same day he floated cutting funding at schools hosting \"illegal\" protests, Trump took a free speech victory lap.\n\nDuring his joint address to Congress on Tuesday night, President Donald Trump laid out his vision for the next four years and carefully revised the legacy of his first seven weeks in office.\n\nAmid a slew of actions to chill speech and root out political opponents from federal agencies, Trump claimed that his administration had \"stopped all government censorship and brought back free speech in America.\" Earlier on Tuesday, Trump threatened to cut funding from schools that allow \"illegal\" protests.\n\n\"Our country will be woke no longer,\" Trump said to applause after he celebrated orders making English the official language of the U.S. and renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. He cheered the Supreme Court's ending of affirmative action and his administration's efforts to \"remove the poison of critical race theory from our public schools\" and make it the official policy of the U.S. \"that there are only two genders.\"\n\nIn practice, Trump has accomplished those tasks by ending federal environmental protections for minority communities, making it easier for employers to discriminate based on race, stripping money from schools that teach about racial inequality, and threatening to upend programs that provide mental health support for homeless children .\n\n\"You can't claim to stand for free speech while threatening schools' funding to silence anti-war students.\"\n\nSince taking office, Trump has signed executive orders to threaten to deport students who take part in pro-Palestine and anti-genocide protests and announced a list of schools that will receive visits from the Department of Justice over their handling of campus protests. He has also eliminated civil rights work and diversity and equity initiatives across federal agencies, and made plans to defund schools that teach \"discriminatory equity ideology,\" which includes teaching basic facts about racism in U.S. history like the idea that \"the United States is fundamentally racist, sexist, or otherwise discriminatory.\"\n\n\"You can't claim to stand for free speech while threatening schools' funding to silence anti-war students,\" said Tariq Habash, a former staffer in president Joe Biden's Department of Education who resigned over Biden's handling of the war on Gaza. Habash is now co-founder and director of the advocacy group A New Policy. \"These efforts are not just antidemocratic, they're illegal and a direct attack on academia, students, and faculty.\"\n\nSelf-described liberals at universities around the country opened the door for Trump's attacks on civil rights by making exceptions for freedom of speech on Palestine, said Democratic National Committee delegate Nadia Ahmad. \"University leaders across the country are more than happy to carry out Trump's anti-Palestinian deportation orders while publicly lamenting his attacks on DEI initiatives,\" said Ahmad.\n\n\"They condemn him in rhetoric, yet eagerly enforce his agenda by silencing and expelling students. Their complicity reveals how shallow institutional commitments to human rights really are.

      "text": "Elizabeth Warren Reveals DNA Evidence of Native American Ancestry, Replying to Trump's Taunts\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren took a DNA test which suggests that she has some Native American ancestry, and she made sure Donald Trump knew all about it.\n\nIn a direct response to President Donald Trump's taunts, Sen. Elizabeth Warren revealed on Monday that a DNA test provides compelling evidence that she does, in fact, have Native American ancestry.\n\nWarren announced the test results in a highly produced biographical video that looks like the opening salvo in a campaign against Trump for the presidency, which the Massachusetts senator said last month she would \"take a hard look at\" pursuing after her likely re-election in November.\n\nThe video, which points to a new section of the Massachusetts Democrat's website dedicated to facts about her heritage , begins with images of the senator returning to meet her brothers in Norman, Oklahoma, where she was raised, as audio of Trump mocking her as a \"fake Pocahontas\" rings out on the soundtrack.\n\nClips of Trump and other Republicans deriding Warren for what they assumed was her false claim about her Native ancestry are interwoven with the senator and her brothers recounting family lore about Native roots , which appears to trace their ancestry back to a great-great-great-grandmother , O.C. Sarah Smith, once described as Cherokee.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nWarren is then shown getting the test results from Carlos Bustamante , a professor of biomedical data science, genetics, and biology at Stanford University, who has advised the genetic testing services Ancestry.com and 23andMe, as well as the PBS series \" Finding Your Roots .\"\n\n\"The president likes to call my mom a liar,\" Warren tells Bustamante. \"What do the facts say?\"\n\n\"The facts suggest that you absolutely have a Native American ancestor in your pedigree,\" Bustamante replies.\n\n\"In the senator's genome,\" Bustamante explains to the video crew, \"we did find five segments of Native American ancestry with very high confidence, where we believe the error rate is less than 1 in a 1,000.\"\n\nA copy of the full report from Bustamante's lab, posted online by the Boston Globe, makes it clear that the \"identity of the sample donor, Elizabeth Warren, was not known to the analyst during the time the work was performed.\"\n\n\"My family (including Fox News-watchers) sat together and talked about what they think of @realDonaldTrump's attacks on our heritage,\" Warren wrote on Twitter Monday morning. \"And yes, a famous geneticist analyzed my DNA and concluded that it contains Native American ancestry.\"\n\nThe video also sets out to debunk the false claim that Warren had gained a professional advantage in her previous career as a law professor by identifying herself as part Native American. A series of law school administrators and professors who took part in her hiring repeatedly dismiss that claim as nonsense. Last month, the group spoke to the Boston Globe, which was given access to Warren's personnel files, for a debunking of the falsehood .\n\nWarren also pointed to that evidence on Twitter, in a thread encouraging readers to \"review every document for yourself.\"\n\nI never expected my family's story to be used as a racist political joke, but I don't take any fight lying down. I want you to have the power to fight lies with the truth, so here's a new site for you to review every document for yourself. https://t.co/900SsAMNjb\n\n- Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 15, 2018\n\nNews of the DNA test, and the video, was first provided by Warren's office to the Boston Globe reporter Annie Linskey, who described it as evidence that the senator, if she runs for president, \"plans to be a very different candidate than Hillary Clinton was.\"\n\n\"The 2016 Democratic nominee for president,\" Linskey wrote , \"chafed at releasing personal information and was dogged throughout her campaign by her use of a private server while she was secretary of state.\"\n\nThe campaign-style video, raising and debunking attacks on her, could also be seen as evidence that Warren has learned the lessons of another failed Democratic nominee: John Kerry, who refused to aggressively confront false claims about his service in Vietnam that were raised by an outside group, Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, in 2004.\n\nLinskey's report, which features a more extensive interview with Bustamante, notes that the genetic expert estimated that Warren's Native American ancestor appears in her family tree \"in the range of 6-10 generations ago.\" That would seem to fit the story that Warren's parents told their children about their maternal great-great-great-grandmother.\n\nHowever, the Boston Globe report could also point to ways the story might soon be attacked by Warren's political opponents, as they seek to cast doubt on the results. Bustamante was careful to say that his lab is \"confident it is not an error\" to say Warren has Native American ancestry, but the imprecision of genetic testing will no doubt soon be a subject of national debate should the senator run for president.\n\nAs Linskey explains, Bustamante was also forced to use a creative method to identify Native American genetic material, which could give Trump supporters an opportunity to dispute the findings:\n\nDetecting DNA for Native Americans is particularly tricky because there is an absence of Native American DNA available for comparison. This is in part because Native American leaders have asked tribal members not to participate in genetic databases.\n\n\"The tribes have felt they have been exploited,\" explained Lawrence Brody, a senior investigator with the Medical Genomics and Metabolic Genetics Branch at the National Institutes of Health. \"The amount of genetic data that is available from Native Americans is sparse.\"\n\nTo make up for the dearth of Native American DNA, Bustamante used samples from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia to stand in for Native American. That's because scientists believe that the groups Americans refer to as Native American came to this land via the Bering Straight about 12,000 years ago and settled in what's now America but also migrated further south. His report explained that the use of reference populations whose genetic material has been fully sequenced was designed \"for maximal accuracy.\"\n\nBustamante said he can tease out the markers that these South Americans would have in common with Native Americans on the North American continent.\n\nDespite a total lack of evidence, Trump's attacks on Warren have already convinced millions of his supporters that she somehow gained an unfair advantage through the affirmative action programs they despise. If Warren declares her candidacy in the months ahead, expect to hear a lot about the fact that Bustamante's lauded work on genetics has focused, in part, on what his lab's website describes as \"broadening representation of understudied groups, particularly U.S. minority populations and those from Latin America\" and \"calling attention to the problem raised by >95% of participants in large-scale studies being of European descent.\"\n\nQuite apart from the implications for electoral politics, the news of Warren's DNA test struck several Native American observers as problematic for the assumptions about identity, race and belonging that it revealed.\n\nUsing a DNA test to prove \"race\" is pure racist and eugenicist garbage. ?\n\n- Nick Estes (@nickwestes) October 15, 2018\n\nLast winter @SenWarren made a beautiful address to @NCAI1944 to rebuke some of the awful, racist things @realDonaldTrump said about Natives.

      "text": "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton Is a Linchpin of the Right-Wing Judicial Strategy\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nPaxton is up for reelection. A case before the Supreme Court this week, Haaland v. Brackeen, is a window into his efforts to expand corporate rights.\n\nThe Supreme Court is back in session and once again has taken cases that could result in major anti-regulatory wins. In the next few months, Supreme Court rulings could gut the Clean Water Act, kill off affirmative action , and undermine tribal sovereignty . While the pipeline of right-wing jurists built by operatives like longtime Federalist Society executive Leonard Leo has been well-documented , less attention has been paid to another key part of the strategy to expand corporate rights: state attorneys general and the cases they craft, often in concert with corporate law firms, to push forward constitutional changes. It's the parallel track that makes all those judgeships really pay off.\n\nWhen Ken Paxton was first announced as Texas attorney general-elect in 2014, he listed Leo as part of his transition team . Now Paxton, who declined to comment for this story, is up for reelection for the second time since taking office. Although his Democratic challenger, Rochelle Garza, is proving to be a bigger threat than anyone expected, Paxton is still favored to win despite the fact that no attorney general has been more beleaguered by scandal.\n\nPaxton has been under indictment on securities fraud charges the entire time he's been in office; he pleaded not guilty but has yet to stand trial. In 2020, Paxton's deputy attorneys general, along with several other senior staffers, blew the whistle on their boss, accusing him of bribery and abuse of office. The FBI is investigating the allegations, which Paxton has denied, and the whistleblowers were subsequently fired in what they alleged in a complaint was an act of retaliation. Paxton argued that Texas's whistleblower protection law didn't apply to him, but so far the courts have not agreed. He's now asking the Texas Supreme Court to weigh in. Meanwhile, he recently made headlines after a process server accused him of fleeing his home to avoid being served a subpoena for an abortion case. Paxton tweeted that he fled because he was trying to avoid \"a stranger lingering outside.\"\n\nThe attorney general may have legal woes, but he also has an outsize hand in shaping the law. He is a key element of a right-wing judicial operation that aims to dismantle protections for the environment, marginalized groups, and workers while expanding rights for corporations and Christian churches. In his seven years in office, Paxton has successfully fought the federal government over immigration policy , fishing limits , pollution permitting , the EPA's mercury rule , voter ID laws , and trans rights . A case he is arguing before the Supreme Court this week - Haaland v. Brackeen - is a window into how it all works.\n\nThe case calls into question the constitutionality of the Indian Child Welfare Act, or ICWA, a law that passed with unanimous support in 1978 to combat a history of forced family separation in the United States. First there was the Indian boarding school period, from the late 1860s to the 1940s, which saw Native children sent across the country to live in boarding schools, where their names were changed, their hair was cut, and they were no longer allowed to speak Indigenous languages. That was followed by the Indian Adoption Project, a U.S. government program that lasted well into the 1960s and incentivized the removal of Native children from their homes to be placed with white Christian families. By the mid-1970s, nearly a third of Native kids had been separated from their families and tribes. ICWA was drafted as a solution, making it harder to terminate Native parental rights and establishing placement preferences for kids: first with extended family, then members of the same tribe, then members of any tribe, and then non-Native families.\n\nICWA went relatively unchallenged for decades but became a target of conservative legal groups beginning with the 2013 Supreme Court case Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl. The case involved a young girl, the white couple who wanted to adopt her, her birth mother (who supported the adoption), and her biological father, a citizen of the Cherokee Nation who invoked ICWA to fight for custody. The adoptive couple argued that far from protecting anyone from discrimination, ICWA actually discriminated on the basis of race, violating the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment by applying different child welfare policies to Native families. That argument didn't hold, but the adoptive couple won the case anyway on narrow technical grounds.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., where the justices are scheduled to hear arguments from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton in Haaland v. Brackeen.\n\nThe case, and the media circus that surrounded it, prompted a lot of interest from various pro-industry groups in the question of ICWA's constitutionality - not because they were suddenly interested in family or Indian law, but because of the opportunity it presented. The Goldwater Institute, a libertarian think tank in Arizona, launched an anti-ICWA program with funding from the Bradley Foundation, best known for its role leading the charter school movement and, more recently, \" Stop the Steal \" and related voter suppression efforts. Goldwater has filed more than a dozen cases attacking ICWA, with supporting briefs from organizations like the Koch-funded Cato Institute.\n\nThe case currently before the Supreme Court, Brackeen , repeats the equal protection claim, arguing that the placement preferences laid out in ICWA are race-based. But ICWA, like the rest of Indian Law, is politically based. Its legal justification is derived from the sovereignty of tribal nations and the sanctity of the treaties those nations signed with the U.S. government. If ICWA is found to be race-based, it could call into question all of Indian Law, from certain cultural allowances like the ability to possess eagle feathers to broad-reaching land and water rights. Which brings us back to Texas, a state with very few federally recognized tribes, and its attorney general, who has spearheaded this constitutional challenge.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nIt starts with the hunt for the perfect plaintiffs, which for Paxton has more to do with location than demographics. The bulk of his constitutional cases are filed in one county - Tarrant County - where U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor, who has repeatedly sided with Paxton, is highly likely to hear them. That's where the Brackeen case began.\n\nIn June 2016, a Navajo baby referred to as \"ALM\" in court documents was placed in foster care in Fort Worth, Texas. The foster parents, Jennifer and Chad Brackeen, were told from the beginning that the child's custody fell under ICWA and thus, the chances for adoption were slim. \"It's very unlikely he'll be ours forever,\" Jennifer Brackeen wrote in her blog , \"so we aren't even going to pretend it might happen.\"\n\nA year later, however, they decided to fight for custody. Their initial petition to adopt ALM was denied, and according to Jennifer Brackeen's blog, appealing the decision was too expensive a proposition. But then \"God moved some very big mountains\" to bring them an attorney pro bono: Matthew McGill, a partner at Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher. Gibson Dunn does not have a family law practice, let alone an ICWA practice. But it does have a lot of clients in the two industries most likely to benefit from an erosion of tribal sovereignty: fossil fuels and gaming .\n\nMcGill added a new argument to the anti-ICWA arsenal, one he previously used to win a gaming case . Now in addition to arguing that ICWA violates the Equal Protection Clause, McGill is arguing that it violates the anti-commandeering doctrine of the 10th Amendment. That doctrine stipulates that any rights not explicitly granted to the federal government or prohibited to the states are automatically reserved to the states. According to McGill, both gaming and child welfare policy fall into that camp. It's an argument that makes ICWA an even more compelling Trojan horse for anti-regulatory interests, which have long seen a bolstering of states' rights as the most effective way to limit the federal government's regulatory powers.\n\nWith Gibson Dunn on board, the Brackeens were no longer fighting an uphill battle. Now they had one of the world's most powerful corporate law firms working for them pro bono - and the Texas attorney general was suddenly on their side. In September 2017, the Brackeens headed to family court in Tarrant County with their new law firm and an unusual document in support of their case: an aggressively worded brief from Paxton, alleging not only that ICWA shouldn't apply to the Brackeens' case, but also that the law was unconstitutional.\n\n\"It's extraordinary for high-level attorneys in the state AG's office to step down into the trial level,\" said University of Michigan law professor and Indian Law expert Matthew Fletcher. Normally, \"a state AG's office would not participate in a case like that at all unless it reached perhaps an appellate or even a Supreme Court level within the state.\"\n\nBut that's what happens when the corporate law firm that's decided to take up your adoption case not only has deep industry ties, but also shares a revolving door with the state attorney general's office. At least three attorneys who worked on the Brackeen case while at the Texas AG's office worked for Gibson Dunn either before or after their time there.\n\nJames C. Ho, who led the firm's Dallas office and co-chaired its national appellate and constitutional law practice group when the Brackeens' federal case was filed, previously worked as solicitor general of Texas . Today, Ho is a justice for the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ; he recused himself when the Brackeen case hit the 5th Circuit, citing a conflict of interest. His wife, Allyson , also a successful appellate lawyer, slotted into his partnership in the Gibson Dunn Dallas office, where she now co-chairs the same practice group. Allyson Ho is also vice chair of the Federal Judicial Evaluation Committee, appointed by U.S. Sens. John Cornyn (former Texas AG) and Ted Cruz (former solicitor general of Texas) to evaluate potential appointments of federal judges and U.S. attorneys in Texas. James Ho served on that panel during the years that O'Connor, the judge in Tarrant County, was appointed.\n\nAll of which is to say that when Gibson Dunn and the attorney general tag team on your custody hearing in Texas, the tide tends to turn your way. On October 27, 2017, Navajo Nation sent a letter to the court stating that they would not oppose the Brackeens' adoption of ALM. So the Brackeens won custody. Nonetheless, two days before that letter was officially stamped as received by the court, the Brackeens and the Texas attorney general filed a federal suit challenging the constitutionality of ICWA. Less than a year later, when they learned that ALM's birth mother had another baby who was being fostered elsewhere in Texas, the Brackeens filed for custody of that child as well. They were awarded custody over a blood relative last year; yet the Brackeens, Gibson Dunn, and Paxton still argue that ICWA violated their constitutional rights. On Wednesday, they will make that argument before the Supreme Court.\n\nDocuments received via a Freedom of Information Act request to the Ohio Attorney General's Office reveal the mechanics behind another key component to the Texas judicial approach: recruiting other states as co-plaintiffs. It's a strategy pioneered by the Republican Attorneys General Association, or RAGA, the organization co-founded by Cornyn when he was Texas AG in the late 1990s as a way to keep anything like the sweeping litigation against tobacco companies from happening again.\n\nIn its first decade of existence, RAGA concentrated primarily on getting more Republican attorneys general elected. Then Citizens United, a case Gibson Dunn argued and won before the Supreme Court, made anonymous political donations legal, and RAGA's coffers exploded. McGill was second chair on that case. Today, the organization, along with its 501(c)(4) arm, the Rule of Law Defense Fund, funnels millions of dollars to state attorneys general in support of the cases and candidates its donors choose.\n\n\"It's had an enormously distorting effect on U.S. law,\" said Lisa Graves, executive director of True North Research, who has been following RAGA's evolution over the past 20 years. \"It provides a mechanism for corporations to pass money through to help attorneys general in ways that they would not be able to individually solicit for their own campaigns, given their regulatory role over those very industries.\"\n\nGraves said the Brackeen case is a perfect example of the sort of suit that has been made possible by the rise of RAGA. \"So you have this attorney general in a state that is particularly friendly and warm to Koch, to the other oil and refinery companies,\" she said. \"It has very, very few tribal holdings in the state, but yet it's getting involved here.\"\n\nThe same day the Brackeen case was filed, David Hacker, an attorney in Paxton's office, wrote an email to the RAGA member list with the subject line \"New Federalism Case Opportunity.\"\n\n\"Friends, today, Texas filed a new complaint against the federal government concerning application of the Indian Child Welfare Act,\" he wrote. \"I write to ask if any of you want to join this effort as co-plaintiffs. ... ICWA creates foster-care and adoption preferences that require state courts to choose Indian families over non-Indian families when determining placement of an Indian child. These preferences set aside state law that would look to the best interest of the child in favor of racial discrimination that violates the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n\nCompared to Paxton's anti-abortion, anti-immigration, and anti-climate policy cases, which typically entice a dozen or so co-plaintiffs, Hacker's efforts were relatively unsuccessful. Indiana and Louisiana signed on as co-plaintiffs, and Ohio wrote an amicus brief. Indiana and Louisiana have since dropped out of the case. Despite that, the Brackeen case shows how well the Republican judicial machine works in Texas, and how critical the AG's office is to making it all run, not just in Texas but on a national level. \"What you have now with the judicial selection committee in Texas and the very strategic composition of the 5th Circuit and then the Supreme Court now too is an extreme form of forum shopping, where all you need is someone willing to file the initial complaint,\" Graves said. \"The Texas AG's office sets the docket for the 5th Circuit - it's a really important role.\"\n\nWhich raises the question: What if the Texas AG's office suddenly, after more than 20 years, stopped playing ball?\n\nThe Democrats have their own version of RAGA, the Democratic Attorneys General Association, but its funding could best be described as anemic. \"They don't have the option of calling up the tobacco companies or the oil companies, or Leonard Leo, so they're at a distinct competitive disadvantage,\" Graves explained.\n\nIn the 20 years since RAGA began winning races and courting donors, the Democrats have never mounted any sort of counter effort. According to Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa, Paxton is \"the most vulnerable Republican in statewide office in Texas,\" and defeating him \"could open the door for Democrats to start winning statewide elections.\" The party \"would have to have not read any of the stories involving the litigation he's been filing and not be paying attention to national news not to notice his influence on national Democratic policy,\" Hinojosa added.\n\nAnd yet, Paxton outraised his Democratic opponent, Garza, 8 to 1 , and outspent her by an even wider margin. \"Texas hasn't had a Democratic statewide official in a generation,\" Hinojosa said. \"There's a big interest on behalf of the national party to do that. Whether or not they're putting resources toward it, that I don't know.\"\n\nWith additional reporting from Rebecca Nagle\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Columbia Law Professor Smeared by Israel Supporters Could Lose Her Job\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\n\"There's a very good chance that they will fire me,\" said Katherine Franke, a tenured professor who has defended students protesting for Gaza.\n\nWhile the Columbia University campus has mostly emptied out for summer vacation, the school is charging forward with an investigation into a prominent law school professor over comments that were misconstrued by supporters of Israel.\n\nThe university recently deposed tenured law professor Katherine Franke as part of an investigation stemming from an interview she gave to \"Democracy Now!\" in January. During that interview, Franke was asked about allegations that two students who had previously served in the Israeli army had sprayed a chemical at their classmates at an on-campus rally for Gaza.\n\nFranke, who has worked at the school for decades, responded by linking the incident to a documented pattern of on-campus harassment that Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim students have alleged for years.\n\n\"Columbia has a program with older students from other countries, including Israel,\" Franke said, referring to the school's General Studies program. \"It's something that many of us were concerned about because so many of those Israeli students who then come to the campus are coming right out of their military service. And they've been known to harass Palestinian and other students on our campus, and it's something the university has not taken seriously in the past.\"\n\nThe remarks set off a firestorm, with commentators suggesting that Franke was calling to ban all Israeli students from campus. Within a few days of the interview, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz published an article titled \"Columbia University Pushes Back Against Professor Who Vilified Israeli Students,\" citing a statement from the university affirming its support for Israeli students.\n\nBy February 13, Franke was notified of a complaint against her based on the interview, filed by two law school professors who alleged violations of university discrimination policy. Online, supporters of Israel continued to misconstrue Franke's statements, while a Republican lawmaker asked University President Minouche Shafik about Franke during an April hearing about campus antisemitism.\n\nColumbia refused to answer The Intercept's questions on the pending investigation, but referred to its equal opportunity and affirmative action policies and procedures . The document lists a range of possible disciplinary action, including probation, administrative leave or suspension, and dismissal or restriction from employment.\n\nFranke is one of several Columbia staff to face investigation - many of whom have defended Palestinian rights - while the House Committee on Education and the Workforce continues to apply pressure on the school. Recently, three deans were placed on indefinite leave for exchanging text messages the university says \"touched on ancient antisemitic tropes.\" Professors elsewhere across the country have had their livelihoods imperiled upon speaking out in defense of Palestinians.\n\n\"What's of greatest concern is not really my 20-year-plus career at Columbia, but what this says about peaceful protest on our campuses, around the lives and dignity of Palestinians,\" Franke said in an interview with The Intercept.\n\n\"What's happening to me is happening to our students, it's happened to people on many other campuses. And it's, to me, shocking at a place like Columbia - which prides itself on being a home for, if not only tolerating, maybe welcoming student engagement with public events or public affairs like the crisis in the Middle East,\" she continued. \"And yet they're punishing me and others for standing up for our students who I think are engaging in appropriate protest.\"\n\nRead our complete coverage\n\nFranke's career as a lawyer and legal scholar has focused on gender and sexuality law, and she has also done human rights work focused on Israel's occupation of Palestine. In 2018, Israel deported Franke upon her arrival in the country to take part in a human rights delegation. As Israel's ongoing war on Gaza has roiled the Columbia campus, Franke has defended students speaking out on behalf of Palestinians or criticizing the Israeli government. She has also been unabashed in her criticism of the university administration's response to student protests.\n\nIn its statement to Haaretz on the heels of Franke's \"Democracy Now!\" interview, a university spokesperson said, \"We are disheartened to see some members of our community and beyond use this moment to spread antisemitism, Islamophobia, bigotry against Palestinians and Israelis. Especially at a time of pain and anger, we must avoid language that vilifies, threatens, or stereotypes entire groups of people. It is antithetical to Columbia's values and can lead to acts of harassment or violence.\"\n\nAs the controversy persisted ahead of the April congressional hearing, Franke reached out to Shafik through another senior administrator to relay her concerns. (Franke said she did so because she had been unable to get Shafik to meet with her or respond to her efforts to connect). In an email that she asked the administrator to forward to Shafik, she rebutted the misinformation that had circulated about her interview and reiterated that she wasn't calling to ban Israeli students from campus.\n\nRather, she wrote, she was voicing concern \"about students coming onto our campus who have just completed their military service in Israel - the transition to civilian life - after having been taught that Palestinians are evil and want to kill Israelis/Jews - can be a rough one for some people.\"\n\nFranke said she never heard from Shafik about the email.\n\nShe was right to be on guard. At the April 17 hearing , Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., asked Shafik what she was doing about Franke, who, Stefanik falsely claimed, said \"all Israeli students who have served in the IDF are dangerous and shouldn't be on campus.\"\n\n\"I agree with you that those comments are completely unacceptable and discriminatory,\" Shafik said, accepting Stefanik's framing. \"I think she will be finding a way to clarify her position.\" The president added that \"a very senior person in the administration\" spoke to Franke, who said the comments were not what she intended to say.\n\nWhile Shafik's comments indicated knowledge of Franke's interaction with the senior administrator, the president misconstrued the core point of Franke's outreach: She didn't mean those \"unacceptable\" comments because she did not say them.\n\nShafik's office did not respond to The Intercept's questions.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nAs part of the school's investigatory process, the university deposed Franke for a couple of hours on June 13. The deposition was handled by outside investigators at the insistence of Franke and her lawyer, who argued that she had been prejudged by the school's president.\n\n\"Today, it's Palestine. Tomorrow could be abortion.\"\n\n\"It seemed clear to me that they had made their mind up already, coming into the deposition, that I was generalizing in a way that would make people who served in the IDF or Israelis feel bad, and so there's a very good chance that they will fire me,\" Franke said. She said that the person who deposed her seemed to be trying to goad her into agreeing with the premise of the violations alleged, asking questions like, \"You can understand that somebody might hear what you said and take it as discriminatory?\"\n\nFranke is expecting a decision any day now. She was told the university would make a decision in a matter of weeks.\n\n\"Today, it's Palestine. Tomorrow could be abortion. It could be, you know, criticizing the Trump administration. It could be climate change,\" Franke said. \"I feel like it's Palestine today, but what's at stake here is something much larger, of the imposition of a kind of orthodoxy around a very contested political concept or context.\"\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "What Elizabeth Warren Still Doesn't Get\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nRather than defend her Native ancestry, Warren should acknowledge that diversity means more than genetics.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren addresses a town hall meeting in Roxbury, Mass., on Oct. 13, 2018.\n\nOn Monday morning , Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., released a video in response to President Donald Trump, who has persistently mocked her as \"Pocahontas.\" For years, Trump has derided Warren for identifying as a Native American faculty member at Harvard Law School, and in other contexts, despite presenting as white. The implication by Trump and other conservatives has been that Warren secured her position at Harvard Law as a result of affirmative action, and that consequently, she was not qualified for the job.\n\nHe returned that line of attack on Tuesday.\n\nNow that her claims of being of Indian heritage have turned out to be a scam and a lie, Elizabeth Warren should apologize for perpetrating this fraud against the American Public. Harvard called her \"a person of color\" (amazing con), and would not have taken her otherwise!\n\n- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2018\n\nWarren's response has been to insist that she does have Native American ancestry, but to deny that her racial background played a role in the hiring process. In Monday's video, she recruited several Harvard Law professors involved in her hiring, including Randall Kennedy and Charles Fried, to corroborate that her race wasn't considered during her hiring process. Warren also offered new evidence in the form of a DNA test, as well as testimony from her brothers, which appears to back up her claim that she has a distant Native American relative.\n\nBut whether or not Warren has some Native ancestry has never been the basis of any legitimate concern, and her video failed to address the only action for which she needs to answer: her role in enabling Harvard Law School to hold her out as a diversity hire.\n\nWarren's response unwisely focuses on bad-faith arguments - namely, the implication that she wouldn't have achieved a tenured faculty position at Harvard without relying on her Native American heritage. But that claim is easily dismissed without trotting out former colleagues to attest to her merits. Warren wasn't just any Harvard Law professor. Her reputation as one of the most distinguished law professors in recent history speaks for itself. Importantly, the partisan ideologues who insist she isn't qualified aren't likely to be persuaded by any volume of Ivy League testimony.\n\nWarren's video also devotes too much time to the claim that Warren lied about her identity. Conservatives have questioned the legitimacy of her Oklahoma family's lore, that Warren's parents had to elope because her father's family objected to her mother's Cherokee heritage. The bulk of the video is dedicated to backing up the story via testimony from multiple family members and a Stanford genetics professor, who delivers the results of Warren's genetic analysis over the phone. \"The president likes to call my mom a liar, what do the facts say?\" asks Warren. While the genetic test doesn't speak to Warren's mother's character, it did confirm that Warren has some Native American ancestry - a bit less than the average white American.\n\nBut it's not especially relevant whether Warren is of Native American descent, or even whether she credibly believed the account of her family history. The only issue, from an ethical perspective, is that Warren held herself out as Native American, allowing Harvard Law School to use her as cover for its impotent diversity efforts.\n\nAccording to a much-cited investigation by the Boston Globe, Warren consistently checked \"white \" on personnel forms throughout her career, including in 1981, 1985, and 1998 while employed at the University of Texas. But in the 1986-1987 edition of the Association of American Law School's directory and eight subsequent editions, Warren listed herself as a minority. She began identifying as Native American on personnel forms three years into her post at the University of Pennsylvania. And while multiple professors have attested to the fact that Warren was considered white during the hiring process at Harvard University, in 1995 she self-identified as Native American, and the school's statistics were updated to reflect as much. Harvard recorded Warren as Native American from 1995 to 2004.\n\nWarren now claims that while her self-identification was insufficiently nuanced, she wasn't being dishonest about her heritage, citing her genetic test and family history as proof. But by focusing on the hereditary aspects of identity, rather than the cultural or experiential ones, Warren undermines the stated objectives of diversity programs.\n\nIn response to a request for comment to this article, her spokesperson offered a statement Warren has used before: \"I wish that I had been more mindful of the distinction between heritage and tribal citizenship. Only the tribes can determine tribal citizenship and I respect their right. That's why I don't list myself here in the Senate as Native American.\"\n\nThe purpose of affirmative action is not to increase the numbers of people who merely self-identify as diverse. (If it were, Rachel Dolezal would be a qualified diversity applicant.) Nor is the point to celebrate minute blood quantum among faculty who otherwise present as white and who don't engage with nonwhite cultural traditions in any meaningful way. Rather, the major goals of diversity in higher education are twofold: Affirmative action is an effort to level the playing field between white men and historically marginalized groups, such as people of color and women, who were denied access to equal education, higher education, competitive employment, housing, or even the ability to acquire credit cards until relatively recently. Racial diversity efforts are also intended to diversify intellectual perspectives with the understanding that race can be a proxy for experiences, and scholarship is enriched by a wide range of perspectives.\n\nAn additional goal of faculty diversity is to establish a support system for students who encounter identity-specific obstacles with which a similarly identifying faculty member may be better qualified to assist. As Lani Guinier, the first nonwhite female Harvard Law professor, has written , there exists a \"hierarchy of perspectives\" in law school. Students who identify with the institution experience less dissonance than other students \"who do not see themselves in the faculty, who vacillate on the emotionally detached, 'objective' perspectives inscribed as 'law,' and who identify with the lives of persons who suffer from existing political arrangements.\"\n\nIt's hard to see how Warren's minuscule amount of Native American DNA, even coupled with her family lore, furthers diversity objectives. She was not raised with Native American traditions and has not demonstrated any particular experience as a Cherokee woman.\n\nAlthough a person's appearance is not dispositive of their ethnicity, how a person is publicly perceived does affect whether they suffer discrimination. And in turn, whether a person experiences discrimination affects whether they deserve to benefit from the equalizing effects of affirmative action programs. Discrimination is hard to quantify, and it operates on a systemic level, as well as an individual one. But if Warren has been perceived as white over the course of her life, it's difficult to credibly argue that she should be the beneficiary of a program intended to level a playing field made uneven by discrimination on the basis of identity.\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania tacitly acknowledged this when it declined to tout Warren's minority status to the press - even while it identified her as nonwhite in the university's 2005 Minority Equity Report by bolding and italicizing her name along with other minority faculty members. \"It counts for way more if you are visibly, recognizably a person of color,\" explained Colin Diver, dean of the law school at the time in an interview with the Globe.\n\nBy allowing herself to be held out as Native American, Warren enabled the university to leverage her identity as a pretext and decline to hire additional Native American faculty members.\n\nThis isn't just a hypothetical claim: In a 1996 article in the Harvard Crimson, Harvard Law School's spokesperson Michael Chmura used Warren to diffuse criticism directed at Harvard Law School for its diversity failures: \"Although the conventional wisdom among students and faculty is that the Law School faculty includes no minority women, Chmura said Professor of Law Elizabeth Warren is Native American.\"\n\nEven though there is no evidence that Warren approved of her identity being used this way, it was naive of her to identify as Native American given the heated political environment of the time. In 1992, when Warren first taught at Harvard Law, the school was in the midst of a massive, student-led push for diversity. The students ultimately sued the law school for discrimination in faculty hiring, and were subject to a public trial by the school's administrative board for participating in a sit-in at the dean's office.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nIn 1990, Harvard Law's first African-American tenured law professor Derrick Bell protested the lack of diversity among the tenured faculty by taking an unpaid leave of absence. After two years, Harvard had still not hired any minority women for tenured or tenure-track positions, and when Bell requested an extension of his leave, he was denied - ending his own tenure status.\n\nHarvard University has struggled to recruit diverse faculty members over the decades since. It hired its first actual tenured Native American professor this year and didn't hire its first nonwhite woman - Lani Guinier - until 1998. In the wake of historic on-campus tumult in response diversity complaints, it's implausible that Warren didn't understand the implications of identifying as a woman of color.\n\nWarren has nothing to defend with respect to her qualifications. Not only is Trump's repeated invocation of Pocahontas an offensive and perverse flattening of Native American history into one grossly misrepresented icon, any attack on Warren's merit from conservatives is hypocritical: Only last week, Republicans championed the Supreme Court confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh, whose legacy status made him markedly more likely to be admitted to Yale, even while he claimed that he got in all on his own. In the 1980s, when Kavanaugh attended college, a quarter of Yale freshman had at least one legacy parent , and matriculating at the college significantly upped the odds of admission to the law school - 27 members of Kavanaugh's class attended Yale College compared to 10 from Harvard and three from Stanford.\n\nBut Warren deserves criticism for failing to acknowledge that by holding herself out as Native American, she empowered Harvard to exploit her identity and claim credit for diversity without achieving any of affirmative action's substantive goals.\n\nIf Warren wants to secure the moral high ground in this debate, she should defend the objectives of affirmative action and exert pressure on Trump to acknowledge what's implied by his taunts about Warren's authenticity: that campus diversity is a good thing, and genuinely diverse students and faculty members bring valuable experiences to the table. Instead, Warren has emphasized that she is qualified, tacitly suggesting that others whose race was a factor in their hiring are not - even though the Supreme Court has upheld affirmative action for qualified individuals only, not unqualified ones.\n\nThe issue has never been what Warren believes about her history, but what Warren believes to be ethically appropriate. She now acknowledges that it was wrong for Harvard Law to hold her out as a diverse member of its faculty. All that's left is for her to take accountability for her role in Harvard's misrepresentation and acknowledge that remedial efforts to make up for Native American oppression shouldn't accrue to her benefit, and that she is an inadequate representative for Native American perspectives or interests on campus. Only then will she be able to transcend this controversy and prevent her biology from becoming her political destiny.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "Meet the Man Driving the Right's Culture War Panic\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nConservative activist Christopher Rufo says the left has won America's culture wars. He aims to reverse it.\n\nThe Republican Party's full embrace of the culture war as a political tactic - from drag queen story hour to critical race theory and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives - has been chiefly guided by activist and polemicist Christopher Rufo , author of the new book \"America's Cultural Revolution: How the Radical Left Conquered Everything.\" But is the effort fundamentally nihilistic? And is it overly obsessed with sex while claiming to uncover pedophiles everywhere in our midst? This week on Deconstructed, Rufo joins Ryan Grim to defend his approach and his philosophy.\n\n[Deconstructed intro theme music.]\n\nRyan Grim: I'm Ryan Grim. Welcome to Deconstructed.\n\nWe are joined today by Christopher Rufo, who is the author of the new book, \"America's Cultural Revolution: How the Radical Left Conquered Everything.\" I know that a ton of our readers - a ton of my listeners, I should say - will be very excited to hear that the left has conquered everything. So, congratulations to us, but Christopher ...\n\nChristopher Rufo: Well done, chaps. Well done.\n\nRG: There we go. Nothing to it. We'll teach you how we did it.\n\nFor people who don't know, Chris is a conservative activist. Bari Weiss, in fact, on the back of this book, calls him \"the most important and effective conservative activist in the country.\" The Atlantic calls him \"one of the most gifted conservative polemicists of his generation.\" We got The New York Times on here calling him \"the country's preeminent critic of critical race theory.\"\n\nBut you also have a bit of an unusual backstory. It's not like you kind of came out of college and got a Koch Fellowship, and then worked for a House Republican, and have been an operative ever since; you kind of had a winding path here. I think a lot of our readers, probably - or listeners, probably - understand, know you as the guy who made critical race theory a household name. The guy who's really gotten drag queen story hour into the news over the last couple years ...\n\nCR: Yup.\n\nRG: But who are you before that? How'd you wind up in this place?\n\nCR: Yeah. Before that I was probably a more typical kind of The Intercept listener-type. I think that I was on the hard left growing up in my teenage years. I come from a long family of Italian communists, so my aunts and uncles in Italy are still card-carrying unreconstructed communists to this day.\n\nSome of my formative political memories are visiting my family and then seeing my aunt - my favorite aunt, actually still my favorite aunt - her complete collection of the works of Lenin. Totally unironically, I mean really, truly, the Lenin, and they gifted me the Che Guevara flags as a kid.\n\nSo that was kind of my formative political thinking.\n\nRG: A lefty friend of mine that read your book said he feels like a right-wing Gramsci. Were you kind of brought up around Gramscian thinking?\n\nCR: Very much so and, actually, very directly, not even just derivatively. My father was born and raised in a small town in Italy called San Donato Val di Comino, and I used to grow up going back into the town in long summers. I spent a year there when I took some time off of college, and I've spent years and years there collectively over my lifetime.\n\nIn the main town square, for a number of years - although the last time I was there just after Covid, it had closed down - was the Antonio Gramsci cultural center. So it's a very left-wing town.\n\nMy grandmother used to tell the story of - the fascists were running after World War II, they were seeking votes and they were giving out blankets, they were giving, essentially, material goods to bribe people.\n\nThen the organizer, the party organizer came after the elections and said, you didn't vote for us, you said you'd vote for us after we gave you all this stuff. And she says, \"What do you mean? I voted for you.\" He said, \"No, we didn't get one single vote in this entire town, so I know for sure you did not vote for us.\" And she was embarrassed, and she was mad, she would tell that story. She was mad at everyone else. She was like, \"at least one person should have voted for them to save me the embarrassment.\"\n\nSo, yeah. I think it's possible, and maybe your friend who read the book sensed it a little bit. I think, in a way, it's part of the way I've been able to kind of flummox some of my critics, and some of my opponents. In a lot of ways, I know their own language better than they do, and so I bring a different sensibility. I think that even readers on the left that would disagree with me or, obviously, not reach the same conclusions, I think could appreciate the text, because it's not the kind of condescending ... It's not the, look at all these awful people, conservative, you know, polemical book. I've read a ton of those books over the years, I don't like them either. I just think that they do a total disservice, they underestimate what's happening.\n\nAnd so, it's a different feel, and I have a different experience than, yeah, most of the college-republican-to-RNC pipeline kind of kids.\n\nRG: No, I think that's true. I think you do treat these kind of left-wing authors and thinkers that you write about with more care than in a typical kind of RNC-pipeline-type-produced book.\n\nBut, before we get to the flummoxing, I do want to ask you: what happened? Like, where did you go wrong? How did you go from the path of light to the one that you're on?\n\nCR: That's right. Well, I'll take that comment ironically, and I'll say a couple of things. One is that I went to Georgetown, that was my top pick. I wanted to go to Georgetown to get involved in politics. That's where I felt like the energy was.\n\nI was a California public school kid, and so, I land in Georgetown, I got involved and got organized. I joined, at the time, the marches against the Iraq war, which I still feel like was the right decision, the right position on my part. But the more I got involved with the organized left, the campus left, institutional left, I just had had such a process of disillusionment, and I felt as if the people who were working on this project were totally inauthentic, in the sense that they were the sons and daughters of America's elites, they were pushing a left-wing ideological or intellectual line but, really, it was always an attempt to bolster their own status and position, and actually offered very little for people whom they were claiming to be helping.\n\nAnd so, it felt very phony, it felt very self-serving. Having entered that period of my life as a kind of political radical, I was disgusted by it. In a sense, the - I don't know how you would term it. You would know better, you live in D.C. right now. But it's the folks who kind of land at Georgetown, they come from their nice fancy boarding school. They're wearing their pink shorts and the popped collars, and they're going to get the jobs eventually. After they go through their fun phase in college, they're going to be investment bankers and senior advisors to their dad's office.\n\nI just said, this is not an actual left that has any claim on authenticity, any claim on actual care for what they say that they are caring for. And so, I just took off. I took off, and I became a documentary filmmaker, I traveled around the world and, at first, tried to get away from politics altogether.\n\nRG: I totally understand that sentiment. There is for sure an element of the left that is inauthentic in that way, that sees leftism as social branding, and then ends up kind of weaponizing it in defense, ironically, of the very privilege that they come from, but they say that they are kind of fighting against. There's no question about that, I've seen plenty of that, and I think that people who have the most intimate experience with the deepest and most grassroots elements of the left sometimes come away from it and recoil. I've always wondered if Kyrsten Sinema, because she was so deeply involved with the left, that's partly why she hates the left so much. Like, she might have much less animosity for the left if she had just come up through the typical kind of democratic pipeline, and might just be a normal center-left. Instead she's -\n\nCR: Why? What is her background? I'm not aware. She was a grassroots-organizer type?\n\nRG: She was black bloc, she was Code Pink.\n\nCR: Was she really?\n\nRG: She was an anarchist protesting the 2004 Democratic National Convention.\n\nCR: No way.\n\nRG: Yeah, yeah. She was a serious radical for several years and was a Green Party member for a while. And then she's just been on the greased skids from left to right ever since then.\n\nBut so, that's one response to it. The other response is, screw this, I'm getting out of politics, I'm going to do documentary filmmaking. The other response is somebody like me who says, I think this element of the left is wrong, and I'm going to argue with them, but I'm going to stay positioned over here on the left until I'm just completely beaten down and driven out.\n\nBut then, how did you go from, OK, I'm in documentary filmmaking, I'm out of politics, to being not just somebody with kind of conservative sensibilities, but an actual on-the-team conservative activist.\n\nCR: Yeah, that's an interesting institutional shift, for sure. It happened gradually and then suddenly.\n\nAnd so, I was making films around the world, I directed documentaries for PBS, I sold a film to Netflix, I did some international television projects, I traveled all over. And, simultaneously, as I was working and doing that, I was reading a lot, just feeding my appetite for reading, and learning, and studying. And I still had the passion for politics. I think when you have a love for politics, it really never leaves you. There's something that grips you and won't let you go.\n\nAnd so, it turned into this kind of invisible and silent period of study. And as I was reading all of these books, I started reading some conservative books, they started making more sense to me. I was always comparing my experience on the ground, whether it was in Europe, or Asia, or Africa, or Latin America, or the United States, I was always comparing my observations on the ground to what I was reading. And the conservative philosophy, and then my ground level observations started to really move very closely together, and it seemed as if they were more accurate reflections of one another.\n\nAnd then I decided that I wanted to shift my filmmaking practice a little bit. I had kind of a rough patch in my mid-to-late twenties, very difficult. You know, the documentary business is brutal. I was kind of getting tired of it, getting a bit burned out. And so, I said, oh, you know, I'm going to make a film on social and political issues. And so, I directed this film called \"America Lost.\"\n\nI highlighted and spent, really, three years of production in three of America's poorest cities. Conducting interviews, talking to experts in the communities, flying all around the country, interviewing some of the top scholars, left, right, and center on these issues, and burrowing into the lives of these families in these extremely distressed cities.\n\nYoungstown, Ohio, Memphis, Tennessee, and Stockton, California. So, a kind of predominantly white working-class, or white formerly working-class industrial city in the north. Memphis, obviously, it's kind of the tip of the Mississippi Delta, kind of Black inner city community. And then Stockton, which is Latino, multiracial, out west.\n\nAnd so I had this, this incredible education talking to scholars, reading dozens and dozens of books, spending years on the ground. And the process of making that film convinced me of the accuracy, the correctness, and the utility of these conservative scholars and thinkers.\n\nAnd then, what happened is, I'm in a pickle, right? So, I'm in a pickle because the documentary world is very far left. I mean, it is a left-wing cultural institution that has one set of priorities, and that's it. It's a small business, so there's a lot of people that are hungry for the grants, and film festival slots, and fellowships, and broadcast deals.\n\nAnd so, as people were whispering that Rufo has kind of gone rogue, politically, I just lost all of my business, my documentary business. PBS ended up airing the film after kind of delaying and fighting with me for a number of months, but it was very clear that that was going to be my last documentary.\n\nAnd so I was, I don't know, 30? Early 30s? You know, married, child. My career is kind of winding down in the documentary world, and so I decided, I'm going to try to see if there's other opportunities to get back into politics; full circle. I applied for a Claremont fellowship, just out of the blue, not even really being extremely familiar with Claremont Institute, and I got a call from the president, Ryan Williams, and he says, \"Hey, we're interested. You're a very unconventional candidate for a fellowship. You don't have any track record in conservative politics, and I'm going to be very frank, you seem like a plant. I need you to look me in the eye and promise me that you're not going to do a James O'Keefe-style send up of Claremont Institute, you know?\" And I laughed. I said, \"Oh man, I didn't even think about that.\"\n\nAnd that actually happened to me a number of times. I got accused of being a plant probably two or three times as I was first getting into it, which is funny, now. And then I was really embraced and welcomed into this world, and made great friends, and had opportunities provided to me. I had some great mentors. George Gilder was an early mentor, and Bruce Chapman, and [they] really supported what I was doing and helped me open up this new field of work that has been just so rewarding.\n\nAnd so, now it's kind of odd. I identify, I tell people, hey, I'm a conservative activist, I'm fine with that, that label doesn't bother me, but it's not exactly the whole truth either, whatever my image might be in some of the press. It's a little more complex than that.\n\nRG: So, in hearing that story, the place where I would think that you went wrong is this.\n\nCR: Tell me.\n\nRG: So, you go to Stockton, you go to Memphis, you go to Youngstown, in these places that are blighted. And you're seeing that they're having a hard time turning themselves around because of the collapse of cultural values in these areas. And you're seeing that the conservative movement is the one that's taking that seriously and is willing to address that, whereas liberals are just kind of looking the other way, and offering some small amount of subsidies for people, and just hoping that they get back on their feet.\n\nBut what you're also seeing is the result of neoliberalism, of deindustrialization, of the breaking of unions, of the offshoring of jobs, and the collapse of the economic base that allowed for the cultural strength that had kept those cities together before. And so, you then kind of paradoxically wind up aligning with the right, which really fueled - And it was a bipartisan effort, but the right is really driving this kind of Milton Friedman-style neoliberalism that is gutting these communities.\n\nAnd so, it would be sort of like arriving at the scene of an Ebola outbreak in West Africa, and seeing the hospitals, and blaming the hospitals for how bad they are, rather than saying, well, what happened before that?\n\nCR: Yeah. I mean, it's an interesting point of view, and there's some places with which I agree, some things with which I disagree. But I took that question very seriously, I actually spent most of my time thinking about that exact question.\n\nAnd so, you're left with this idea where - let's trace the process of decline, and the story that you're telling, I think there's a lot of truth to it, in the sense that the flood grates of free trade were open, these industries were no longer competitive. But, actually, when you scrutinize it, it doesn't hold up as well as you would think, for a couple of reasons.\n\nOne is that, I talked to a lot of these guys who were longtime Youngstown people, political observers - again, left, right, and center, actually mostly left in Youngstown - you know, old timers that worked in the industry. And the story that they told when you really pick it apart is something actually very different.\n\nThe problem in Youngstown was, in the sense that it was gifted this really rare and one-time position after World War II. Europe was devastated, Japan was devastated, China was still a kind of backwards economy. There was no industrial base in the entire world - Africa and Latin America had virtually nothing. The United States was the only industrial country, more or less, in the immediate aftermath of World War II, especially in the non-Soviet sphere.\n\nWe had a virtual monopoly over industrial production and, for Youngstown, steel production. We were producing steel for the whole planet, but that was never going to last forever. The Europeans started building factories, and then the Japanese started building factories, and the Japanese factories, for example, - and they lost a lot of business to these Japanese factories - it wasn't necessarily because of trade liberalization, although that, certainly, you could have had more protectionist measures.\n\nIt was, in large part, because the Japanese were building their steel industry from scratch in the 50s and 60s, really taking off in the 1960s, getting government support, using really advanced modern Japanese engineering and production techniques. And then, by the 70s, these brand new, incredible Japanese steel factories are competing against these steel mills that were built 70, 80 years ago - they weren't running very well, they weren't efficient, they weren't cost effective - and then you have this global competition that is entering after recovery from World War II.\n\nAnd then, domestically, the story that they tell is also a little more complicated. You had extreme mafia activity that was smothering and really harming the steel industry in places like Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Youngstown in the middle. And, at first, they actually started losing business to the bigger cities in the United States. And then it was the mafia, the unions were also an immense drag on their productivity, plus all of this new competition from new factories overseas.\n\nThe story that people tell when they're honing in on the honesty is, yes, the free trade, especially in 1999, 2000, was the final blow. I mean, then the industry is done. But the industry was doomed decades earlier than that, and we were living off of the capital accumulation, we were living off the heyday, but we had significant problems that could not be resolved domestically and locally, really, as soon as the global recovery from World War II.\n\nRG: Although, you also have, at the time, a revolution in tax policy going on, the biggest marginal tax rates being brought down. And even as you have productivity continuing to increase throughout the 80s and 90s. Despite everything you're saying, because I think that's true, America was in this unique place of being the only one that wasn't completely destroyed by World War II. But you do have a situation where the economy's still moving along, but all of the gains, all of a sudden, are now, instead of being spread around, are flowing up to the top. Which I think produces its own cultural rot, no?\n\nCR: In a sense, you could maybe make that argument, but I would say that the standard of living for the median income household is still rising during that period. Yes, you have a more winner-take-all economy, but I don't think that's actually due to tax policy so much as it's due to the nature of post-industrial and especially high-tech industries that are not capital intensive, they're not resource intensive, and they are this kind of technological, creative and venture-backed industries that are winner-take-all, and they have global markets. Sometimes not China, etc., but more or less they have global markets.\n\nAnd so, Tyler Cowen has written about this, and his idea is that we've transitioned to a winner-take-all economy. And yes, would I agree that that is, in some senses, not ideal? Does it create antagonisms and resentments?\n\nBut I don't think that it is the case. The old Margaret Thatcher line is still somewhat true, even though I'm a critic of Thatcherism and Reaganism. But the old Margaret Thatcherism is true. Yes, the income for the top 1 percent has gone up, but the income for the median family has also gone up, if not in an identical proportion. And so, she asked very famously in a question time session, would you rather have everyone be poorer so that there's more equality, or everyone be wealthier but having larger inequality at the top end?\n\nAnd my view is that these are all tradeoffs, there's no perfect system. But I would rather have, given the winner-take-all economy, I'd rather have everyone be better off. The paradox that you see in Youngstown and in Stockton and Memphis is, actually, the poorest people have a remarkable material standard of living. I mean, remarkable. The poorest people in Youngstown have larger houses, more cars, better appliances, and more disposable income than middle class people in Europe, for example, and certainly middle class people in any of the developing world.\n\nAnd so, it isn't simply the case that it is Great Depression-style poverty. It's actually a very bizarre confluence of contradiction, really. It's that this is material abundance relative to historical standards, and relative to even peer countries, but it is a poverty that is immiserating, and devastating, and horrifying, in a sense, beyond the Great Depression.\n\nI talked to my grandfather about the Great Depression, and it was awful. I mean, like, your ribs are sticking out, you're running low on basic necessities. But, in a sense, I would rather be in that condition under the cultural arrangements, and beliefs, and patterns, than being poor in Youngstown today, even if you have an old Cadillac, and a 2,000-square-foot house, and spending money.\n\nI talked to one guy and his mother, and he's back in prison, and another prisoner had sliced open his genitals and put a domino inside of it for some weird prison ritual. It's like, the stuff happening today in the underclass and places like Youngstown is so horrifying that I think that, in some ways, you look at it, and you have to analyze it separate from a material analysis because, materially, you actually have abundance in any kind of historical context.\n\nRG: Relative to the Great Depression. Right, for sure.\n\nCR: No, I mean relative even to two generations prior. Relative to 1950. That's the irony. Youngstown was one of the wealthiest cities in the world in 1950 but, even adjusted for inflation, the per capita or household income among poor Youngstowners is still higher than it was among middle class families in 1950.\n\nAnd yes, of course, everywhere else it's gone up much more, obviously. But you can't simply say that this is a kind of dust bowl tragedy. That is an unselfconscious poverty. It's a poverty where there was still a sense of nobility of spirit. The poverty in Youngstown is this just devastating poverty, in which people have all the material preconditions for human happiness but are racked with addiction, overdoses, prostitution, mental illness, anxiety and depression, family atomization.\n\nIf you really spend time, I think that you can't simply say, well, if we got the old steel mill fired back up, everything would be fine. We're beyond the point of no return on that kind of solution.\n\n[Deconstructed mid-show theme music.]\n\nRG: So, I didn't mean to go this long without talking about the book, so let me get into that.\n\nCR: Good. Yeah, sure.\n\nRG: So, how does Herbert Marcuse fit into this? And give people a kind of quick thumbnail sketch of what the argument you're making in this book is.\n\nI said on the show, and I'll say it again: I think it's a well-written, well-researched, kind of well-crafted book. You know, I obviously disagree with its conclusion. We've talked about, and can talk more about, why I think some of it is nihilistic. While talking about the nihilism on the left, it has some of its own. But a very well done project overall.\n\nBut so, why is Herbert Marcuse kind of relevant here?\n\nCR: The main narrative arc of the book, it tells the story of the so-called \"long march through the institutions.\"\n\nSo, this was the strategy adopted by the radical left theorists and activists that moved from the period of excitement in the late 1960s to a period of disillusionment in the early 1970s, and they concluded that their violent Marxist-Leninist revolution against the state had failed. It had been disrupted by Nixon, by J. Edgar Hoover. It had turned public opinion against them. Even The New York Times op ed page had really started just violently attacking or, rather, strenuously attacking the radical left at the time.\n\nAnd so, they said the way forward for the left is to burrow within the established institutions, to bring our ideology in from the outside, and then slowly start to conquer these institutions from within, and bring our ideas, bring our theories, bring our values and principles into them. And so, I trace the origins; the book begins in 1968, to the conclusion, which is the summer of 2020.\n\nThe story is really how these fringe and radical ideas of the left wing at the time, with Marcuse, Angela Davis, Paulo Freire, and then, a little bit later Derrick Bell. [They] were outsider ideas that then became the conventional wisdom of all of America's cultural institutions.\n\nNot to say that the radical left - as you were joking in the beginning - well, we conquered everything. Great, we won. Of course, that's not true, but the subtitle, \"How the Radical Left Conquered Everything,\" must be read in light of the title, \"America's Cultural Revolution,\" and the cultural revolution is the left's lowering of ambitions in some ways.\n\nWell, we don't want to take over the steel mills in Youngstown, but we do want to take over the HR department at the Steel Corp U.S.A., and then bring our ideas there with the hopes that it could soften the grounds culturally for an eventual total revolution, or economic revolution.\n\nAnd so I really just trace the history of ideas, I tell the story of some of the key personalities, and then the argument is all implicit. And some of my left-wing critics have said, you're not making an argument, you're not making a logical case. And I kind of laughed at that critique, because it's like, yes, this is a narrative nonfiction. The argument is implicit in the story and how I'm telling the story, which I think probably makes it more palatable to an audience. You know, except for analytical egghead types that might be looking for the logical proof in all of these things.\n\nRG: To me, the hole in it comes - and we talked about this a little bit last week, but just to go over it again real quickly - let me read one piece from your book here.\n\nYou write, \"The New Left's language of subversion, which was authentically transgressive at its point of origin has created its own conformist and corrupted universe of political language,\" un-quote. It was hardened into the new, \"...armor of the establishment, defending the left-wing orthodoxy of the new elite, while exempting itself from the radical criticism of its own concepts, language, and power.\"\n\nAnd you talk elsewhere in the book about how corporations opportunistically use DEI and CRT, and public statements of allegiance to whatever cause to get themselves out of having to do anything of substance about those issues, to kind of let off some of that steam.\n\nBut so, rather than a kind of success, rather than the left conquering everything, that to me feels like the durability of capitalism and the capitalist class. That evidence of their ability to take challenges to them, and adapt them in ways that leave the status quo in place, much more than it's evidence of a successful Marxist revolution.\n\nWhy should the left be satisfied with corporations adopting their language if nothing fundamentally has changed about the power structure?\n\nCR: Yeah. I would agree with your analysis, and I think in the penultimate chapter, that's really where the story ends.\n\nAnd, certainly, I'm not suggesting that Fortune 100 companies have DEI, therefore this is communism, and you get some right-wing commentators that are saying these are all communist companies. I mean, that's ridiculous, that is a total overdrawn conclusion. I don't make that at all.\n\nBut the book to me ends, maybe, in this contradiction that I imagine you would agree with. It's that: Because it's America's cultural revolution, the radical left conquered everything in the sense. That it has conquered the cultural language, symbolism, and principles, in that sense, in that cultural sense, so that every corporation is pledging loyalty to BLM. You know, you have DEI in every company in the United States. You have affirmative action policies that openly discriminate against disfavored groups according to the intersectional hierarchy.\n\nYou have all of these cultural practices, and yet, the basic economic function of these corporations is relatively undisturbed, let's say. They're still highly profitable, they're still very innovative, they still control the commanding heights of the economy. Thank God, from my perspective.\n\nSo, what you have, and why I think the story of America's cultural revolution is so interesting, is that you have to revive some classic Marxist terminology. The radical left has conquered the superstructure, so it has conquered the means of ideological and knowledge production. In the universities, in the K-12 schools, in the HR departments, in the federal bureaucracy, etc., etc. But it has not conquered, and really has no ambition of conquering anymore, the economic base.\n\nAnd so, you have a revolution, in part, that has been completed, but cannot ultimately satisfy its Marxist ambitions. You have Marxism without Marx. There's a certain hollowness and emptiness.\n\nAnd so, as I conclude with the critical race theorists, my point is, critical race theorists have absolutely nothing to offer working class people of any racial background. They have absolutely nothing to offer poor inner city Black communities, like the one in Memphis, Tennessee, where I spent some time. And, in fact, their revolution is a revolution that is wholly cynical and self-serving, just like the people that I met in college.\n\nThey play the affirmative action game to gain prestigious academic positions. They play-act as revolutionaries to burnish their credential at dinner parties and lecture circuits and academic conferences. But, ultimately, they are not revolutionaries, they are not courageous figures of the left. And, in fact, when I went after the critical race theorists by name, and identified their discipline, and just launched artillery shells at them, rhetorically, they didn't even defend their own ideas. They denied that they were calling themselves Marxists in the 1990s, they ran away from that. And, in fact, they denied that their theories were even influential at all.\n\nAnd so, as I'm looking at the original theorists here - the Marcuses and Angela Davis, and Paulo Freire, even Derrick Bell, to a lesser extent - I circle all the way back with a begrudging but real respect for them. Because they had an authenticity, they had a desire, they had an idealism, that has really now just become kind of last-man style status seeking. Revolution, but a cynical revolution, that has no real ambitions.\n\nIt's kind of a cheeky title, but the story as it unfolds, I think, should be very disillusioning for the left, but also very concerning for the right. I think, in a sense, no one is happy, right? You have a partial revolution, and neither side is quite satisfied.\n\nRG: So, when it moves out of the academy and into pop culture, it becomes much more dumbed down, and you're seeing, I think, a kind of dumbed-down version of it playing out in Florida right now.\n\nYou know, Ron DeSantis has been kind of the chief popularizer, I would say, and I think you would agree with that, of your theories of cultural counter revolution.\n\nCR: Yes.\n\nRG: And what's big in the news lately is his new curriculum that Florida rolled out around African American history.\n\nCR: Sure.\n\nRG: The thing that the media has really fixated on is, teachers are supposed to instruct kids that slaves learned skills, that some slaves learned some skills that they could potentially use in other aspects of their life.\n\nSetting that aside, I feel like that's better understood in the broader way that the curriculum approaches the history, which is, it felt to me like some dorm room arguments I'd heard from conservatives back in college in the '90s. Like, you hear things like, well, look, you know, they had slavery in Africa, also, before they had - And then, well, look, actually slavery was worse in the Caribbean. Which, true, it was. And well, look, being a serf in Europe, that was really, really bad, too.\n\nAnd like, all of it, coupled with the slaves learned some skills that they could use later, all of it brought together feels like saying, yes, obviously slavery was bad but, relatively speaking, maybe it wasn't as bad as people say.\n\nSo like, is that where the conservative embrace of CRT ends up going? And why?\n\nCR: I don't think so. I mean, you still hear those arguments today, right? You've heard them, I've heard them. And many of them are based in facts, as you say, but I think they're ultimately not -\n\nRG: And that's all in the curriculum. Those things that I heard in the dorm room, all of these things. Like, oh, there was slavery in Africa. It's all true, but it's like, why?\n\nCR: But I think that, to take the point of this line that has caused controversy - And really, I think, you and I would both agree that the left-wing critique is that, oh, DeSantis is saying that slaves benefited from slavery.  It's like, no, that's not what it means.\n\nAnd so, what I think the point is, and this is actually has a long lineage in African American, it's really the kind of - Within American Black philosophy, and political theory, and activism, there is a strand of thinking that says, the solution, - and Thomas Sowell, you can bring it back to Booker T. Washington - but there is a strand of thinking that says, the attitude that should be prioritized is one of resiliency, is one of hope, is one of triumph over adversity. And yes, when you oversimplify it, it can be kind of a ridiculous Horatio Alger story. It can minimize some of the historical inequities, truly, really and truly.\n\nBut I think that that line was basically to say, these people who suffered under unimaginable brutality and evil conditions were resilient, they had capacities, they had talents. And even though they were smothered and held back under the system of slavery, which was evil and wrong, they were able to emerge from those immense difficulties and actually have capacities that they could realize once slavery was over.\n\nI traveled in the deep south as I was making the film, and one of the things that really shocked me and was really quite inspiring was, in the Mississippi Delta, there was these free cities that were all Black, small cities and towns that were established by freed slaves. They had their own kind of thriving industries and economies in, still, some very difficult conditions. They had businesspeople, they had civic leaders, you can see all the old history, and I talked to folks about the history of these places.\n\nAnd, to me, that was a triumph of spirit, and of ingenuity, and of resilience, and in courage. And I think that you can't tell a story that is only that, right? You can't minimize what these people faced, and we should confront it honestly and totally. But, also, you should not minimize these accomplishments, which are not trivial by any measure, and should not be covered over by people today, who see them as an impediment to their own left-wing politics. I mean, I think that that's so - I mean, in the textbooks in places, even in the Deep South, those stories should also be highlighted. I think those stories are quite effective.\n\nMy opposition to, let's say, on these issues, right? Race issues. My opposition to critical race theory, it's been hashed out, anyone can go see my opposition. But for something kind of new: the opposition to, let's say, even something like reparations, or something like affirmative action, stems from my observations in a place like Memphis, where I really saw [that] the more that the government and the state seeks to engineer social outcomes and on these crude measures, actually, the worse things get.\n\nFor me, after that long observation, I just feel very skeptical that these social engineering projects - You know, the government can do pretty good physical engineering, the New Deal taught us that. I mean, some of those bridges are still American landmarks. But social engineering is something quite different, and we've never been able to do it successfully. And so, I'm quite skeptical in that regard.\n\nRG: If you're still helping with the curriculum, if they're still working on it, I'd suggest adding in something on Robert Smalls or, in general, talking about slave uprisings and resistance. To couple it with, OK, good that somebody became a blacksmith. But also talk about the kind of way that there was constant effort to overthrow slavery, you know? From the enslaved people themselves. Which I think is also I would ...\n\nCR: I would totally support that. I think that those stories are also very important.\n\nRG: Picking up on DeSantis real quick, because I know you've got to go soon.  The fact that he is getting so rinsed in this Republican primary, you know, he had to reset his campaign.\n\nIn 2022, Republicans really adopted a lot of this drag queen stuff, a lot of the CRT narrative and, instead, Democrats picked up a seat in the Senate, did better than expected in the House. Like, there's a disconnect somewhere, and I want to get your take on it.\n\nMy take on the disconnect: I think there's a lot in the culture wars that you guys could argue and have 80 percent support and everybody being with you, for the most part, except, like, the most extreme elements of somewhere on campus. But you guys don't stop there.\n\nI think Roe being overturned kind of laid bare the broader kind of cultural agenda at work here. And so, you wind up having, you wind up going to the extreme so quickly, and you have so many people in the mainstream of the Republican Party just quickly calling Democrats pedophiles that I feel like you kind of lose credibility. And you guys start to seem like the ones that are obsessed with sex and bringing it into the culture war.\n\nBut I'm curious for your take. As you look back at 2022, and as you look at Ron DeSantis' campaign, why has there been so much success, say, in state legislatures, and in dominating the cultural conversation, yet it's not translating electorally?\n\nCR: Well, I would dispute that. I don't think that that is a fact.\n\nRG: Which part?\n\nCR: Governor DeSantis won by just a handful of votes in 2018. I mean, really, truly, less than 1 percent. And then he translated that into a 20-point blowout, winning all racial demographics, winning women by a huge margin, and even winning Miami Dade County, the urban county, the largest urban county in the state.\n\nAnd so DeSantis is the example of taking these courageous positions, fighting very intelligently in the media, and then translating that into electoral rewards. I mean, a huge shift in his favor. I think that if you look at the other congressional candidates and the congressional races, I think you're probably right, I think Roe had a drag on it. But I also think that President Trump, you know, the left made this all about Trump, and then Trump obliged, and said, yeah, let's make it about President Trump. And I think that that was, obviously, it was also a drag.\n\nBut the governors that did quite well, even those who banned CRT, who fought on some of these issues, and Governor DeWine, and governors in Georgia and other states, they also won big 15-point victories, or more.\n\nAnd so, the primary question is, I think, actually the same phenomenon. I think that Republicans love DeSantis. If you ask Republicans, they'll say he's the best governor. But Trump, again, is the dominant force in conservative politics. I mean, he really is, whether you would like that to be the truth or not. And I think that the flagging support for DeSantis so far in the primary is really just a strong, and loyal, and passionate base of support for President Trump, much more than it's against DeSantis, which I don't think it is.\n\nAnd so, that's the challenge. But even Trump, I mean, you know, Trump, of course, made CRT a big issue. I worked with him on CRT. And then, if you look at his video statements, the kind of scripted policy statements that he's been doing. I mean, they're very fire and brimstone cultural commentary.\n\nAnd so, I think that if you look at it in this way, the top three candidates right now in the polling are Trump, DeSantis, and Ramaswamy. All of them are totally aligned with the narrative and program that I outline in the book, and they have 90+ percent of the market share. So, I think the best way to look at it is, actually,  the new right and the new culture war right currently now has a 90 percent market share, and the Reaganite or neoliberal right has found itself, I think, hopefully, in a generational position where they're now being, uh, shuffled out.\n\nRG: Last question, then, because I know you've got to go.\n\nI think in the general election what you're going to wind up with - I'm curious for your take on this - is a messenger problem. I mean, setting aside not just Speaker of the House Denny Hastert, who had his own pedophilia issues, you've got Donald Trump who bought Miss Teen U.S.A., and he'd saunter around the locker room and be gross. One of the heroes on the right today is Andrew Tate, whose literal business model is grooming.\n\nCR: Oh, it's horrible.\n\nRG: I mean, if you go online, everybody is constantly defending the guy as this beacon of -\n\nCR: That's horrible. It's such a mistake. I mean, I find him so disgusting. Yeah, so - Yeah. That shouldn't be, and I'll work on it. I'll work on it, Ryan.\n\nRG: Finally, the Catholic Church. Like, every state that probes, whose attorney general probes the Catholic Church history finds just horrifying levels of abuse. And so, when you see so much focus on one side, but not the other, it feels like a messenger issue. Like, how serious is this?\n\nSo, do you agree? Do Republicans have some cleaning up to do here?\n\nCR: Of course. And, obviously, any kind of abuse should be condemned and rectified and prosecuted.\n\nAnd something like an Andrew Tate: I mean, Andrew Tate is not a hero or a model, or should get any support from the right. I think it's a reaction, where, oh, the left hates Andrew Tate, therefore conservatives like Andrew Tate. That kind of thinking is a total disaster, and so, you'll find no support from me for anything like that.\n\nRG: Alright.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled yesterday on the constitutionality of using race as a factor in determining who is admitted to selective universities. Most coverage of the ruling has stated that the court has ended affirmative action, but this is not really true.\n\nInstead, the court has created new rules about how race can be considered in admissions. Under the old rules, race could be considered in service of the goal of creating a racially diverse student body in order to promote better education through exposure to different kinds of people. Under the new rules, race can be considered in the context of how it affected a particular applicant's life, and how those effects reflect on the person's character and unique abilities:\n\nFor the reasons provided above, the Harvard and UNC admissions programs cannot be reconciled with the guarantees of the Equal Protection Clause. Both programs lack sufficiently focused and measurable objectives warranting the use of race, unavoidably employ race in a negative manner, involve racial stereotyping, and lack meaningful end points. We have never permitted admissions programs to work in that way, and we will not do so today.\n\nAt the same time, as all parties agree, nothing in this opinion should be construed as prohibiting universities from considering an applicant's discussion of how race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration, or otherwise. But, despite the dissent's assertion to the contrary, universities may not simply establish through application essays or other means the regime we hold unlawful today.\n\nThe case in question was brought by an organization purporting to represent Asian applicants to selective universities. The plaintiffs argued that Harvard University and the University of North Carolina (UNC) were discriminating against Asian applicants in order to limit how many Asians were in each incoming class. The court decided that the way Harvard and UNC were handling Asian applicants does violate the constitution, but also clarified that race-conscious admissions are still permissible so long as they are done in a certain way.\n\nThe new rules for race-conscious admissions actually seem more in line with the left-wing rationales for affirmative action. Those rationales are focused on the ways in which past and present racial oppression has affected people's lives, necessitating a race-conscious remedy in the form of affirmative action. This is more or less what Roberts is instructing schools to do, i.e. not pursue a particular racial balance for educational benefits, but to consider the effect race has had on an individual's life as part of calculating whether they merit admission.\n\nIndeed, the new rules actually seem like they could make it even easier for schools to discriminate against Asian applicants in the way that the plaintiffs complained about. Admissions officers could simply decide, quietly of course, that the difficult racial experiences of black, Latino, and native applicants are more revealing of an underlying character and ability that merits admissions than the racial experiences of Asian and white applicants, which are perhaps not as difficult.\n\nIn its statement responding to the judgment, Harvard University made it fairly clear that it is still going to engage in race-conscious admissions along the lines prescribed by the court's decision:\n\nToday, the Supreme Court delivered its decision in Students for Fair Admissions v. President and Fellows of Harvard College . The Court held that Harvard College's admissions system does not comply with the principles of the equal protection clause embodied in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. The Court also ruled that colleges and universities may consider in admissions decisions \"an applicant's discussion of how race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration, or otherwise.\" We will certainly comply with the Court's decision.\n\nOne possible downside to this decision is that applicants hoping to get some kind of racial preference will have to include a detailed story about how their race affected their life. Many students already do this in personal essays as part of their application package, but going forward, this will become effectively mandatory as it will be the only way to make oneself eligible for a racial preference. Individuals who fail to include these details in their personal statements, either due to being unaware of the new rules of race-conscious admissions or due to simply not wanting to, risk being passed up by other members of their racial group who do include them in their personal statements.\n\nNonetheless, the overall thrust of the decision is that race-conscious admissions are here to stay.\n\nMatt Bruenig is the founder of People's Policy Project .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

This isn't about \"racial justice\": the military wants to use race in admissions to strengthen American empire.\n\nCadets walk into Michie Stadium during West Point's graduation ceremony on May 27, 2023 in West Point, New York. (Spencer Platt / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe Supreme Court's recent decision restricting race-conscious admissions has a notable carve-out for US military academies like West Point, which will be allowed to continue making admission decisions with the aim of creating a racially diverse student body. Many have pointed out the obvious inconsistency here, arguing that if affirmative action is good for the US military, it is good for civilian colleges as well. In her dissent , Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, \"The majority recognizes the compelling need for diversity in the military and the national security implications at stake . . . but it ends race-conscious college admissions at civilian universities implicating those interests anyway.\" Peter Dreier, writing in the Nation , expressed a sentiment common among liberals on social media: \"If racial diversity is good for the leadership of the nation's military, why isn't it also good for the country's other core institutions, including health care, business, education, law, science, the media, and the arts?\"\n\nBut it is worth asking why the US military supports affirmative action, and what it means for the cause of racial justice. The Department of Defense's (DOD) support for affirmative action is hypocritical and self-serving - and far from promoting racial justice, it helps perpetuate racial inequality and oppression both in the United States and abroad.\n\nThe amicus brief submitted by the US government in Students for Fair Admission v Harvard lays out the military's case for affirmative action. First, the military cares about race in college admission decisions because it needs a diverse officer corps to command a racially diverse force of enlisted service members. Diversity has long been framed by the military as a \"force multiplier,\" meaning that it provides competitive efficiencies through the additional cultural and language skills of racially diverse military workers. Yet this force-multiplying diversity is confined to the lower ranks: according to the 2020 DOD Diversity and Inclusion Report, the enlisted are 18 percent black and 19 percent Hispanic, while only 8 percent of officers are black and 8 percent are Hispanic.\n\nThis is in line with a broader pattern. Although conservatives accuse it of being \"woke,\" the US military is profoundly shaped by racial inequality, with research documenting racial discrimination in promotions and military justice and racially unequal risk of PTSD, as well as a recent lawsuit alleging racial discrimination in access to veteran services . And it is hard to ignore proliferating reports of organized white supremacists in US military ranks.\n\nThe specter of Vietnam War-era \"racial unrest\" haunts the US government's support for affirmative action in colleges. The amicus brief contains a list of examples of uprisings, revolts, and attacks on predominantly white military management by the more diverse lower ranks; the implication is that a more representative officer corps reduces such conflict and makes the military more effective.\n\nBut fifty years after the United States lost the Vietnam War, the officer corps has only slightly diversified, least of all in senior leadership. The amicus brief expresses concern that without affirmative action in university admissions, the officer corps will continue to be too white, which could in turn create the impression that non-white soldiers are \"serving as 'cannon fodder' for white military leaders.\" White officers would also lose the opportunity to be exposed to people of color in college, important to their supervisory skills.\n\nThe second reason that the military supports affirmative action in college admissions is attempting to increase recruitment. This is not surprising given the current recruitment crisis. Could a more diverse officer corps inspire more youth of color to join the military? Perhaps - although according to the DOD's own polls , the top reasons that youth do not consider joining the military are the possibility of physical injury, death, or PTSD or other emotional and psychological issues.\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling lets the military academies keep affirmative action in admissions. But that is not enough for the armed forces, simply because these academies produce only 19 percent of officers. The rest come through civilian colleges. In fact, officers categorized as racial minorities are more likely to have gone through the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) programs in civilian colleges. That is why the US military has been a defender of affirmative action at selective colleges like Harvard.\n\nBeyond the fact that the institution of the military is rife with racial inequality, there is also what the military does in the rest of the world. The ongoing \"war on terror\" is one in which \"terror\" is associated with Muslims, Arabs, and the Middle East, part of a long history of the United States targeting enemies construed as racialized others. Overseeing the largest military in the world, the diverse officer corps promised by affirmative action directs the destruction of infrastructure and communities, supervises the extraction of resources and destruction of the planet, and manages injury, disease, and death - most of which falls on people of color in the Global South.\n\nThe DOD's consistent advocacy for race-conscious admissions is no social justice bona fide; in fact, it is entirely compatible with its being a fierce enemy of racial justice. Rather than celebrating the armed forces' attempt to put a progressive sheen on its war-making, we should seek to end the mayhem they are responsible for abroad, and redirect resources to actually advancing the cause of economic and racial equality by providing for people's urgent material needs .\n\nSofya Aptekar is associate professor of urban studies at the City University of New York School of Labor and Urban Studies and author of Green Card Soldier: Between Model Immigrant and Security Threat .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

It must be defended.\n\nVivian Malone, one of the first African-Americans to attend the university, entering Foster Auditorium to register for classes at the University of Alabama on June 11, 1963.\nWarren K. Leffler / US News & World Report Magazine\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia got deservedly slammed when, in a line of questioning in Fisher v. Texas , he voiced doubts about the intelligence of African Americans, suggesting that blacks would generally be better served by attending less competitive universities. Scalia's Charles Murray - esque reflections on the capabilities of black people are outrageous, but the fact that the US Supreme Court has chosen to hear Fisher v. Texas in the first place is far more alarming.\n\nIn 2008, Abigail Fisher - who hails from Sugarland, an upscale Houston suburb - filed a lawsuit alleging she had been denied admission to University of Texas-Austin because of race conscious admissions policies.\n\nAs many others have noted, Fisher was not denied admission to UT-Austin because of affirmative action.\n\nUT-Austin automatically admits the top 10 percent of the state's high school graduates, irrespective of race, ethnicity, sex, religion, or sexual orientation. Fisher had solid high school grades and SATs but was not among this select group, which accounts for 92 percent of UT-Austin's in-state admissions.\n\nApplicants for the remaining 8 percent of slots are assessed on the basis of two scores - the combination of grades and standardized test scores and a personal achievement index, which includes consideration of an applicant's race, socioeconomic background, unique accomplishments, leadership skills, etc.\n\nRace could certainly be taken into consideration in this second tier category, but it's hard to imagine how Fisher - who went on to graduate from LSU - was a victim of \"reverse discrimination.\" UT-Austin offered provisional admission to 42 white and just 5 black or Latino students with lower grades and test scores than Fisher's, and 168 black and Latino students with grades as good or better than Fisher's were also denied admission. Moreover, Fisher also declined the standard offer to transfer to UT-Austin her sophomore year on completion of a year at a UT branch campus with a 3.2 GPA or better.\n\nBut given the political composition of the court, it is likely that Chief Justice Roberts and the other conservative justices - hoping that Justice Kennedy will swing their way - plan to deliver a crippling blow to affirmative action in college admissions when the high court rules on Fisher v. Texas later in 2016.\n\nLikewise, since Edward Blum's Project on Fair Representation - the conservative nonprofit that has financed Fisher's lawsuit - is committed to fighting so-called race-based policies in voting, education, and employment, we can expect the hits on affirmative action to keep coming in the aftermath of Fisher.\n\nAffirmative action has been the source of controversy for about as long as it has existed, but its positive impact is undeniable. The anti-discrimination and recruitment policies that fall under the umbrella of \"affirmative action\" have opened up opportunities for women and racial minorities in fields that had been largely closed off to them by either formal or informal barriers.\n\nAffirmative action policies have also contributed to making the workplace fairer for everyone since fear of contract forfeiture and litigation has compelled even non-union employers to establish formal guidelines for hiring, promoting, and firing employees. Moreover, white men actually account for the bulk of those filing age discrimination lawsuits.\n\nSimply put, a Supreme Court ruling that affirmative action is unconstitutional would constitute a blow to democracy itself.\n\nStill, those who seek to defend affirmative action - and I am among such people - would be wise to situate it in a broader historical frame than recent controversies and consider the labor origins of anti-discrimination measures.\n\nBlack labor activists played an important role in the enactment of anti-discrimination legislation during the modern civil rights movement. African-American labor and civil rights activist A. Philip Randolph and the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters successfully used the threat of a march on Washington in the 1940s to pressure President Franklin D. Roosevelt to issue Executive Order 8802, barring discriminatory employment practices among defense contractors and federal agencies during World War II.\n\nRandolph, Bayard Rustin, and the Negro American Labor Council, would go on to organize the 1963 March on Washington, which played a role in the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. And while Randolph and Rustin argued that fair employment practices legislation alone was incapable of redressing disparities in employment and income - which, by the 1960s, owed more to deindustrialization than racial discrimination - Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act established the legal framework for affirmative action.\n\nSome will dismiss the important role played by black left-labor activists in both the genesis of the civil rights movement and the enactment of anti-discrimination legislation as a kind of historical artifact - facts about a past rooted in politics that are no longer relevant.\n\nSuch criticisms are not without merit, though they bring us to the real point. The neoliberal political orthodoxies of today - namely the evisceration of the welfare state and the related predilection for market-based and even voluntarist solutions to political economic problems ranging from racial inequality to environmental calamity - are fundamentally at odds with the social-democratic politics that made affirmative action possible.\n\nBetween the 1940s and the 1960s American politics tilted toward social democracy - a leaning that shaped the cultural and legal parameters essential to the enactment of anti-discrimination legislation. Whatever the institutional affiliations of African-American activists of yesteryear, the legal foundation for anti-discrimination legislation proceeded from the view that the federal government had the authority to intervene not just in affairs of the states but also in the practices and policies of private entities (businesses, universities, etc.), provided the existence of an overriding public interest.\n\nWith respect to employment, this principle was established not in defense of racial equality, but the right to collective bargaining.\n\nPrior to the 1935 Wagner Act , \"freedom of contract\" limited the government's authority to regulate the employer-employee relationship. The Great Depression, however, led the drafters of the Wagner Act - Senator Robert Wagner and his assistant Leon Keyserling - to argue that the right to collective bargaining was essential to redressing the problem of under-consumption that had caused the protracted economic downturn.\n\nMany progressives also argued that unions would check managerial caprice by allowing workers to negotiate for contracts that established formal employment guidelines - for things such as hiring, firing, promotions, and raises - which would confer stability and dignity to the workplace via democratic process. From the second New Deal through World War II, the overwhelming majority of Americans were united with the executive, the courts, and the majority of legislators in the view that unions served a \"public good.\"\n\nAs can be said of any institution in America, many unions - particularly in the building trades - were guilty of discrimination. But unions - particularly industrial unions - were also among the civil rights movement's strongest allies .\n\nIn fact, unions and churches accounted for nearly equal shares of the financial contributions to the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. More to the point - in cases such as Tunstall v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen (1944) and James v. Marinship (1944) - the courts chipped away at union discrimination, denying NLRB coverage to unions guilty of racial discrimination.\n\nThis punishment of racist unions rested on the New Deal's more expansive definition of \"state actors\" which transformed entities that were once deemed private - and thus beyond the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment - into quasi-public institutions subject to federal regulation.\n\nWhile the expanded purview of state actors along with a more liberal application of the Constitution's Commerce Clause were initially designed to grant the federal government greater authority to regulate economic affairs, these two big government frameworks would pay dividends for civil rights - Jim Crow unionism, southern Democrats' \" white primary ,\" and restrictive covenants would all be struck down by the courts before 1950 - and they would help lay the foundation for affirmative action.\n\nThe case for affirmative action - like unionization before it - proceeded from the view that anti-discrimination policy was in the public interest. Though the history of federal workplace anti-discrimination initiatives dates back to the New Deal, President Kennedy's 1961 Executive Order 10925 - which authorized the federal government to cancel contracts with vendors who failed to take \"affirmative action\" to redress employment disparities - is generally understood as the start of the modern era of anti-discrimination policy.\n\nThe Kennedy and later the Johnson administrations argued that workplace discrimination was a drag on the national economy, viewing racism as an irrational encumbrance on productivity. The Kennedy administration's case for a fair employment practices bill - what would eventually become Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 - thus centered on the Commerce Clause, placing workplace discrimination in the purview of the federal government.\n\nThose who imagine that market-oriented programs offer the best route to racial equality today should recall that opponents of Title VII, like Republican senator Barry Goldwater, argued that fair employment practices legislation violated \"freedom of contract.\"\n\nBut while anti-discrimination legislation necessarily infringed on an employer's right to hire, fire, promote, or demote whomever they wished, the Wagner Act had already abridged this right - as proponents of anti-discrimination law understood at the time - thus establishing a precedent for affirmative action.\n\nIn fact, the phrase \"affirmative action\" first appeared in a Wagner Act provision that directed judges to impose financial penalties on employers who discriminated against union organizers.\n\nThe eventual implementation of affirmative action in the workplace likewise drew on precedent stemming from the Wagner Act. As study after study has shown, few if any employers use quotas - which are not mandated by Title VII. Instead, employers hoping to avoid costly lawsuits established offices of equal employment to ensure compliance with anti-discrimination law.\n\nThese new equal employment offices were modeled on the labor relations departments union and non-union firms established in the wake of the Wagner Act. Moreover, many of the policies implemented by equal employment offices to ensure fair employment practices - including in-house grievance procedures, formal job descriptions, published guidelines for promotion and termination, salary classifications, and open bidding- were already in use by labor relations departments partly because unions had demanded them.\n\nThe Wagner Act and the labor movement it helped spawn are perhaps the clearest expression of the social-democratic impulses informing the old New Deal Democratic coalition. As such, the links between the right to collective bargaining and anti-discrimination legislation draw attention to the historic importance of social democracy to so-called civil rights issues.\n\nIndeed, it's hard to imagine on what basis black civil rights leaders - who lobbied on behalf of a group that accounted for just 10 percent of the nation's population - would have demanded a fair employment practices act in the 1960s, if the Wagner Act had not already established a precedent, in the name of the public good, for abridging the right to freedom of contract.\n\nSimply put, the civil rights movement's victories required an interventionist state - as was understood by all of the principal players, on both sides, at the time. And while the New Deal had significant limitations, its efforts to enhance the purchasing power of working people - centered on fostering a more stable form of capitalism - established a framework for a rights discourse that would prove indispensable to African-American civil rights.\n\nIt is no coincidence then that the attacks on affirmative action and collective bargaining have intensified over the past few decades, a period that has witnessed the retreat from a more social-democratic state and the rise of neoliberalism. For free-market ideologues, anti-discrimination legislation and unionization both muck up the rational function of the market and disrupt capitalist class power.\n\nTo be sure, corporate America - which was responsible for devising workplace affirmative action strategies to begin with - has been one of affirmative action's most powerful allies for the better part of the last three decades. But the fact that the corporate defense of affirmative action centers on diversity poses its own problems.\n\nThe diversity defense - itself the product of Board of Regents of University of California v. Bakke and the Reagan administration's efforts to gut anti-discrimination programs with the assistance of then Equal Employment Opportunity Commission director Clarence Thomas - has come to reify race and gender alike, insofar as it presumes that each member of an identity group possesses a unique cultural perspective.\n\nIn conflating culture with race , \"diversity\" inadvertently plays into the hands of racists, like Justice Scalia, who view presumed hardwired group differences not as cause for celebration, but as justification for exclusion and even continued exploitation - as was the intent of race from the start .\n\nDiversity likewise conforms to a human capital model of labor relations that displaces the view that government has a compelling public interest to ensure equity, which was the original basis of affirmative action and, of course, the Wagner Act.\n\nSince the human capital defense of affirmative action is wed to a market utopianism that views the social safety net as an encumbrance on business, this and other such narrow defenses of affirmative action centered on the unique cultural attributes of identity groups not only fails to address the material needs of most black people - who have long been overrepresented among workers in manufacturing, the service sector, and the public sector - but it also helps to fuel resentment among working-class whites, contributing to the rise of racial demagogues like Donald Trump .\n\nIf the history of the modern civil rights movement has any lessons for us today, then one is that those who imagine a world in which black and brown people might achieve racial equality in the absence of a social-democratic politics \"want crops without ploughing the ground; they want rain without thunder and lightning; they want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters.\"\n\nThough far from the most radical option on offer, affirmative action was the product of a social-democratic vision and is best defended by a politics that presumes the proper role of government is to foster economic stability and security for its citizens.\n\nTouré F.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nSomething strange happened on Wednesday, when the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Fisher v. University of Texas . For about an hour and twenty minutes, seven justices - Justice Kagan recused herself; Justice Thomas was silent, as expected - and three lawyers debated the finer points of affirmative action without even once mentioning racism.\n\nNor did the words \"white privilege\" cross anyone's lips.\n\nWhatever the outcome of the case - in which a young woman, Abigail Fisher, is complaining that she was denied admission to the University of Texas, Austin because she is white - the damage is already done.\n\nCrystallized in these oral arguments is virtually everything that is wrong with how Americans address racism; specifically, that we don't.\n\nInstead, we promote diversity. While racism was ignored in the arguments, the words \"diverse,\" \"diversity,\" and \"diversifying,\" were uttered forty-nine times. According to the Supreme Court, the purpose of affirmative action in higher education is to achieve diversity in the classroom. This is wrong. The purpose of affirmative action in all contexts is to tip the scales in favor of people of color - especially African Americans - so as to counterbalance the unfair advantage that comes with being born white.\n\nThis advantage is easy to see. According to the government's official figures, 7% of whites are unemployed, compared to 13.4% of blacks. The median net worth of blacks is less than one tenth that of whites. If you're black, there's a far greater chance you'll go to prison than if you're white. And punishment doesn't end at the penitentiary gate: felon disenfranchisement laws ensure that one in eight black men can't vote, reducing the political influence of blacks generally. Blacks are more likely to drop out of school and about half as likely as whites to have earned bachelors degrees. On average, being black means you have five fewer years to live.\n\nThis is what racism looks like in our supposedly post-racial society. A glance at the aggregate numbers should dispel the illusion that racism is a product of individual racists. White privilege and black disadvantage persist even though Bull Connor is not prowling the streets of Birmingham with his fire hose.\n\nBut don't tell this to the judges or the lawyers on either side of the latest affirmative action case. Racism is not on their clouded radars. Instead, as Bert Rein, arguing for the plaintiff, put it, the University of Texas's affirmative action program is a \"quest for diversity.\" His sparring partner Gregory Garre agreed, describing \"the university's interest of assembling a broadly diverse student body\" as \"indisputably compelling.\"\n\nWhen the Court last took up this question in 2003's Grutter v. Bollinger , it concluded that colleges and universities could use race preferences in order to establish a \"critical mass\" of minority students so that they would not feel racially isolated or as though they are \"spokespersons for their race.\" At the same time, the Court barred universities from establishing quotas for minorities, preventing schools determining what a critical mass might actually be.\n\nFrom this firm foundation of contradiction, the judges and esquires proceeded in the direction of nonsense.\n\n\"If you're in a state that is only 1 percent black that doesn't mean that you're not isolated so long as there's 1 percent in the class?\" Justice Scalia asked incredulously. \"I wish you would take that position,\" he told Rein, demonstrating precisely the compassionate sensibility we've come to expect from the lion of the Court's right wing. If Scalia were a Buddhist, he'd have past-life memories of Torquemada.\n\nPerhaps surprising, Justice Sotomayor was united in Scalia's cause. \"You can't seriously suggest that demographics aren't a factor to be looked at,\" she said, grilling Rein.\n\nChief Justice Roberts - entirely reasonably, considering the impossible demands laid out in Grutter - asked Garre, \"When will we know that you've reached a critical mass? . . . Grutter said there has to be a logical end point to your use of race. What is the logical end point?\"\n\nWhat indeed?\n\nBy abandoning the fight against racism and replacing it with a goal of promoting diversity, the courts, with the assistance of affirmative action advocates, have stripped the policy of its purpose and condemned it to failure or incoherence, or both.\n\nDiversity goals don't combat racism. They are a tool for submerging race. Diversity goals exist to make racial identity less pressing - to prevent isolation and being made to feel a spokesperson. The word \"comfortable\" was actually used in these arguments - as in racial difference is uncomfortable, so let's make sure it's not so noticeable. Diversity is a means of making racial difference disappear.\n\nThis is what Americans seem to want: to pretend that racial difference and the advantages and disadvantages that accrue on the basis of it are some conspiracy theory. It's why we are so quick to guard our tongues - to the point of expurgating now-unacceptable words from Huckleberry Finn - while emphatically refusing to do anything about the enormous gap in life outcomes between blacks and whites. One \"nappy-headed hoes\" will invite the wrath of the inflamed masses, but persistent chasms in wealth, educational attainment, health, and legal treatment are nobody's concern.\n\nJust ask Bert Rein, attorney at law. In the course of the oral argument, he called race preference \"an abominable kind of sorting out\" and, exercising an unexpected flair for the literary, described race as \"this odious classification.\" Rein knows that Obama is in the White House and it's a new post-racial day.\n\nChampioning diversity is the good liberal's compromise between, on the one hand, the right's race hysteria, in which anything but blindness toward racial difference is construed as racism, and, on the other hand, actually doing something about racism via social welfare and widespread affirmative action that doesn't apologize for itself. Fostering diversity demonstrates sensitivity toward the multiplicity of human experiences, with all the rainbows and handholding that entails. But rather than striving to eliminate the vast inequality that is a dimension of that multiplicity, the good liberal with diversity on the brain cherishes and validates deprivation. As Garre put it, \"You . . . want people from different perspectives.\"\n\nOne might argue that diversity is just a Trojan horse - a tactical alternative to anti-racism that sneaks substantive change in via the rhetorical backdoor. If it is, then the defenders of white privilege are on to the ploy. At the Supreme Court, the horse has been slain. Mere diversity is all the law will allow.\n\nSimon Waxman is a writer and editor living in the Boston area.

This isn't about \"racial justice\": the military wants to use race in admissions to strengthen American empire.\n\nCadets walk into Michie Stadium during West Point's graduation ceremony on May 27, 2023 in West Point, New York. (Spencer Platt / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe Supreme Court's recent decision restricting race-conscious admissions has a notable carve-out for US military academies like West Point, which will be allowed to continue making admission decisions with the aim of creating a racially diverse student body. Many have pointed out the obvious inconsistency here, arguing that if affirmative action is good for the US military, it is good for civilian colleges as well. In her dissent , Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, \"The majority recognizes the compelling need for diversity in the military and the national security implications at stake . . . but it ends race-conscious college admissions at civilian universities implicating those interests anyway.\" Peter Dreier, writing in the Nation , expressed a sentiment common among liberals on social media: \"If racial diversity is good for the leadership of the nation's military, why isn't it also good for the country's other core institutions, including health care, business, education, law, science, the media, and the arts?\"\n\nBut it is worth asking why the US military supports affirmative action, and what it means for the cause of racial justice. The Department of Defense's (DOD) support for affirmative action is hypocritical and self-serving - and far from promoting racial justice, it helps perpetuate racial inequality and oppression both in the United States and abroad.\n\nThe amicus brief submitted by the US government in Students for Fair Admission v Harvard lays out the military's case for affirmative action. First, the military cares about race in college admission decisions because it needs a diverse officer corps to command a racially diverse force of enlisted service members. Diversity has long been framed by the military as a \"force multiplier,\" meaning that it provides competitive efficiencies through the additional cultural and language skills of racially diverse military workers. Yet this force-multiplying diversity is confined to the lower ranks: according to the 2020 DOD Diversity and Inclusion Report, the enlisted are 18 percent black and 19 percent Hispanic, while only 8 percent of officers are black and 8 percent are Hispanic.\n\nThis is in line with a broader pattern. Although conservatives accuse it of being \"woke,\" the US military is profoundly shaped by racial inequality, with research documenting racial discrimination in promotions and military justice and racially unequal risk of PTSD, as well as a recent lawsuit alleging racial discrimination in access to veteran services . And it is hard to ignore proliferating reports of organized white supremacists in US military ranks.\n\nThe specter of Vietnam War-era \"racial unrest\" haunts the US government's support for affirmative action in colleges. The amicus brief contains a list of examples of uprisings, revolts, and attacks on predominantly white military management by the more diverse lower ranks; the implication is that a more representative officer corps reduces such conflict and makes the military more effective.\n\nBut fifty years after the United States lost the Vietnam War, the officer corps has only slightly diversified, least of all in senior leadership. The amicus brief expresses concern that without affirmative action in university admissions, the officer corps will continue to be too white, which could in turn create the impression that non-white soldiers are \"serving as 'cannon fodder' for white military leaders.\" White officers would also lose the opportunity to be exposed to people of color in college, important to their supervisory skills.\n\nThe second reason that the military supports affirmative action in college admissions is attempting to increase recruitment. This is not surprising given the current recruitment crisis. Could a more diverse officer corps inspire more youth of color to join the military? Perhaps - although according to the DOD's own polls , the top reasons that youth do not consider joining the military are the possibility of physical injury, death, or PTSD or other emotional and psychological issues.\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling lets the military academies keep affirmative action in admissions. But that is not enough for the armed forces, simply because these academies produce only 19 percent of officers. The rest come through civilian colleges. In fact, officers categorized as racial minorities are more likely to have gone through the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) programs in civilian colleges. That is why the US military has been a defender of affirmative action at selective colleges like Harvard.\n\nBeyond the fact that the institution of the military is rife with racial inequality, there is also what the military does in the rest of the world. The ongoing \"war on terror\" is one in which \"terror\" is associated with Muslims, Arabs, and the Middle East, part of a long history of the United States targeting enemies construed as racialized others. Overseeing the largest military in the world, the diverse officer corps promised by affirmative action directs the destruction of infrastructure and communities, supervises the extraction of resources and destruction of the planet, and manages injury, disease, and death - most of which falls on people of color in the Global South.\n\nThe DOD's consistent advocacy for race-conscious admissions is no social justice bona fide; in fact, it is entirely compatible with its being a fierce enemy of racial justice. Rather than celebrating the armed forces' attempt to put a progressive sheen on its war-making, we should seek to end the mayhem they are responsible for abroad, and redirect resources to actually advancing the cause of economic and racial equality by providing for people's urgent material needs .\n\nSofya Aptekar is associate professor of urban studies at the City University of New York School of Labor and Urban Studies and author of Green Card Soldier: Between Model Immigrant and Security Threat .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nEvery year, in January and April, we commemorate the extraordinary career of the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. But there is probably no figure in recent American history whose memory is more distorted, whose message is more bowdlerized, whose powerful words are more drained of content than King.\n\nA few years ago, in preparation for a public lecture on 1968, I reread the most important book on King and his politics to come out in the last decade: Thomas F. Jackson's From Civil Rights to Human Rights: Martin Luther King Jr and the Struggle for Economic Justice . Jackson, a former researcher with the King Papers projec t at Stanford, has read King's every last sermon, speech, book, article, and letter. What Jackson finds is that from the beginning of his ministry, King was far more radical, especially on matters of labor, poverty, and economic justice, than we remember.\n\nIn media accounts, King was quickly labeled the \"Apostle of Non-Violence\" and, by the mid 1960s, portrayed as the antithesis to Malcolm X. While King adhered to nonviolence for his entire career, the single-minded focus of the media on the horse race between Malcolm and Martin led reporters to ignore King's more radical pronouncements. They simply didn't fit into the developing story line.\n\nBlack power advocates also distorted King, focusing on his ministerial style and arrogance (members of SNCC called him \"de Lawd\"). They branded King as hopelessly bourgeois, a detriment rather than a positive force in the black freedom struggle. White liberals, fearful of black unrest, embraced King as a voice of moderation, hoping that he could stem the rising tide of black discontent that exploded in the long hot summers of the mid sixties.\n\nThe representation of King as mainstream left observers unable to make sense out of King's opposition to the Vietnam War, his call for an interracial Poor People's Movement, and his increasingly vocal denunciations of class inequality in America.\n\nKing, they contended, had been radicalized or, perhaps, was more calculating in his leftward move, changing his rhetoric to remain a legitimate leader in the eyes of younger, angrier blacks. But as Jackson shows, King was anything but a milquetoast racial liberal or a radical-come-lately.\n\nThrough a close reading of King's work, Jackson finds deep currents of anti-imperialism running through King's thought, going all the way back to his days as a student. He finds a consistent thread of anticapitalism in King's speeches. And he finds that King was building alliances with the left wing of the labor movement and allying himself with activists who called for structural change in the economy. King, in other words, was a radical well before he offered his prophetic denunciation of the Vietnam War in 1967 or joined the Memphis sanitation workers on strike in 1968.\n\nKing's radicalism is lost to the obfuscating fog of memory. In American culture today, we have several Martin Luther King Jr's: the Commemorative King , the Therapeutic King , the Conservative King , and the Commodified King . Each of these Kings competes for our attention, but each of them represents a vision of King that he himself would not have recognized.\n\nFirst is the commemorative King. Only fifteen years after his death, King won an extraordinary recognition - he became the only individual (unless you count Presidents Washington and Lincoln, whose birthdays have been unceremoniously consolidated into President's Day) with his own national holiday. That a man who was berated as un-American, hounded by the FBI, arrested and jailed numerous times, was recognized by a national holiday is nothing short of amazing.\n\nTo be sure, the King holiday met with significant opposition, particularly from southerners like Jesse Helms, who contended that King was a tool of the Communist Party, and from John McCain, Evan Mecham, and other conservative Arizonans. But the King Holiday legislation was signed into law after overwhelming congressional approval by none other than President Ronald Reagan, who began his political career as an opponent of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and who repeated his act by launching his 1980 election campaign in Philadelphia, MS, a tiny place whose only claim to fame was that three young civil rights activists had been murdered there twenty years earlier.\n\nBut if there was anything at all subversive in King's life, it is lost in the feel-good celebrations of King Day, which has become a day for picking up litter and painting school classrooms. Not that community service is a bad thing, but it's a long, long way from King's vision for social change.\n\nThe therapeutic King: in American iconography, King is the great healer, the man who called America to be true to its \"creed\" of equality and opportunity. King's message, bereft of its hard-hitting political content, is so anodyne that we can all support it, Republican and Democrat alike. The inspirational message of King's life has moved front and center in our memories of King. A popular school curriculum intended to build student self-esteem, for example, calls for children to express their dreams. King's message is to hold hands and join our voices together, ebony and ivory, in perfect harmony.\n\nThe conservative King: devoid of the political content that drove his message, King has also become an icon of racial conservatism. Today's most unlikely King acolytes are critics of civil rights policies such as affirmative action. King is the prophet of meritocratic individualism.\n\nThe most articulate proponent of this version of King (and there are many) is Ward Connerly , the leader of nationwide anti-affirmative action campaign who drew from King's own words to call for a dismantling of race-sensitive admissions. Only one King speech - King's address to the 1963 March on Washington - matters to Connerly-type conservatives. And only one line in that speech matters: \"I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.\"\n\nKing speeches should be judged by their content. And there's a lot in the \"I Have a Dream\" speech that would make McCain and Connerly squirm. King celebrated the \"the marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community.\"\n\nAnd, speaking of the \"fierce urgency of Now,\" he encouraged the 250,000 strong gathered on the Mall to take more aggressive action. \"This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.\"\n\nAt a moment when conservatives (and many liberals) were denouncing the movement for going \"too far, too fast,\" King sent a clear message. Go further, faster. King went on to support aggressive enforcement of civil rights laws, including affirmative action itself. And more than that, he demanded the fundamental reordering of the American economy.\n\nFinally, in perhaps the most American of twists, we have the commodified King - efforts in the last decade, largely spearheaded by the King family itself - to market the words and image of the Reverend King. In classic American fashion, Martin Luther King Jr has become a consumer good.\n\nKing's family has engaged in an aggressive effort to market the image of the Reverend King, including a multi-million dollar deal with Time Warner for the rights to King's speeches, writings, and recordings. The King family sued to prevent companies from using King's image on refrigerator magnets, switchblades, and on \"I have a Dream\" ice cream cones.\n\nBut they quickly turned to their own business in King kitsch. In the mid 1990s, the Reverend King's son Dexter King, who administered the King estate, took a pilgrimage to visit the shrine of another King - \"THE KING,\" Elvis at Graceland in Memphis, TN, to pick up some marketing lessons. Since the mid 1990s, King's estate has authorized, among other things, commemorative pins for the Atlanta Summer Olympics with the likeness of Martin Luther King Jr, porcelain statuettes of King, and, my favorite, checkbooks bearing King's likeness.\n\nWhether commodity or conservative icon, suffice it to say that each of these visions of King is flawed. The commemorative King celebrates heroism and courage, but risks the creation of a one-dimensional character that glosses over King's subversive, challenging, and upsetting messages. The therapeutic King stands in sharp contrast to a political strategy that demanded the overthrow of American apartheid and demanded great sacrifices from blacks and whites alike.\n\nThe conservative King is based on a very selective appropriation of King's words - largely from a single speech - in service of a cause that King found abhorrent. And the commodified King creates comforting images that are wholly drained of their ability to provoke and challenge - and, moreover, stand in sharp juxtaposition to King's penetrating critique of American capitalism and his deep-rooted anti-materialism.\n\nAbove all, King's contribution was to unsettle power, to challenge the status quo - something that a porcelain statuette or an Olympic pin or an anti-affirmative-action law will never do.\n\nThomas J.

The protests began over the allocation of government jobs but developed into a wider challenge to a ruling party that's out of touch and increasingly authoritarian.\n\nActivists demonstrate outside the Bangladesh High Commission in Colombo, Sri Lanka, on July 22, 2024, demanding an end to a government crackdown against protesters opposing a controversial job-allocation quota system. (Ishara S. Kodikara / AFP via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe recent protest movement by the students in Bangladesh is an important political turning point for the country. The impacts are being felt beyond the country's national frontiers, and many have presented it as a struggle to restore the democratic values of Bangladesh.\n\nSo far, almost two hundred protestors have been killed , while thousands more are injured or missing in the face of one of the most brutal waves of repression in the history of independent Bangladesh.\n\nThe recent protests started with students mobilizing in the beginning of July to demand an end to the quota system for government jobs. The origins of this system date back to the period when Bangladesh had to fight for its independence against the rulers and army of what was then called West Pakistan. In 1972, as the country emerged from the Liberation War, job reservations for freedom fighters were put in place to acknowledge their sacrifices.\n\nThis system was amended several times over the next decades, resulting in 30 percent of civil service jobs being reserved for the children and grandchildren of freedom fighters. Another 26 percent are reserved for women, people from underdeveloped districts, indigenous communities, and those with disabilities. This means that only 44 percent of the jobs are left open to general applicants.\n\nCivil service jobs are highly coveted in Bangladesh against the backdrop of an otherwise bleak employment scenario, with close to three million Bangladeshis jobless. As a result, the quota system has generated a groundswell of discontent and disappointment.\n\nHowever, the protestors have not demanded the abolition of quotas for the marginalized and vulnerable sections of society. Considering the systemic injustices prevalent in society, these reservations are part of an affirmative action policy that promotes greater social justice, and the students do not have any qualms about them.\n\nOn the other hand, they do complain that the quota for the descendants of freedom fighters is unjust and used for political patronage. According to media reports , the actual percentage of the general population who are descendants of freedom fighters is much less than 1 percent, yet close to a third of civil service jobs have been reserved for those who are supposed to belong in this category. It is not surprising that the list of freedom fighters continues to swell even today.\n\nPopular unrest against the quota system is not new in Bangladesh. Large-scale protests erupted in 2013 and 2018, demanding a more equitable arrangement. The student protests of 2018 were met with violence, with many instances of assault, beatings, arbitrary detention, and abductions of protesters.\n\nDespite this, the movement forced the government to back down and announce the scrapping of quotas for the descendants of freedom fighters. The willingness of the government to follow through on this pledge was already in doubt then, and the victory was short-lived. On June 5, 2024, the High Court struck down the earlier government order, calling it illegal.\n\nThere have long been questions about the independence of the judiciary in Bangladesh, increasingly so under the rule of Sheikh Hasina, who has served as the country's prime minister since 2009 after a previous stint between 1996 and 2001. Critics and human rights activists have highlighted the prime minister's authoritarian grip on the country's judicial system, reducing it to an instrument to serve her political agenda.\n\nNaturally, the High Court judgement ordering the reinstatement of the quotas provoked reactions from the student community that was now freshly galvanized through the independent Boishommobirodhee Chhatro Andolon (Anti-Discrimination Students' Movement). Students took to the streets in most urban areas, setting up road blockades. Dhaka, the capital city, came to a standstill.\n\nThings changed on July 14 with a provocative speech by the prime minister that portrayed the demonstrators as \"Rajakars\" - a word for people who collaborated with the West Pakistan Army during the independence struggle, killing freedom fighters. This derogatory term amounts to an accusation of treachery and betrayal in a nation still grappling with the legacy of its liberation war. The ruling Awami League has sought to present many of its critics as Rajakars over the years.\n\nHasina's denunciation of the protest movement further intensified the popular anger. Thousands of students broke out of Dhaka University's dormitory gates and thronged the streets with chants that turned Hasina's comments on their head:\n\nWho are you? Who am I? Rajakar, Rajakar.\n\nWho has said it? Who has said it? The autocrat, the autocrat!\n\nThe chant sought to fling Hasina's words back in her face. Thousands of students from universities all over the country mobilized in Dhaka, Chittagong, and other cities. From Jahangirnagar, Rangpur, and Cumilla, the youth staged sit-ins on the main avenues of the capital city, which has a population in excess of twenty-two million people. High school students also joined the movement.\n\nThe government resorted to large-scale repression in order to subdue the uprising. Baton charges, tear gas, and rubber bullets were used indiscriminately. In addition, armed thugs masquerading as members of the Chhatra League, the student wing of the Awami League, started attacking students, including many women.\n\nIn Dhaka, the army took positions in the streets and joined the police in repressing protestors. To prevent the supporters of the movement from communicating with one another, internet connections were suspended and telephone communications disrupted. A curfew was imposed, with orders to shoot those breaking it on sight. Yet the students were not deterred.\n\nIn a bid to pacify the protestors, the Supreme Court of Bangladesh overturned the earlier High Court order on Sunday, July 21. The court ruled that 93 percent of government jobs should be allocated on a merit-based system, with 5 percent still reserved for descendants of freedom fighters and 2 percent allocated to other designated categories.\n\nUnfortunately, the court order, while seeking to defuse the student movement, has victimized the most vulnerable sections of Bangladeshi society by denying them access to affirmative action. This has the potential to pit one section of the oppressed against another. The court has also failed to take account of the unconstitutional violations of human rights that students have endured across the country.\n\nJust a few months into her latest term as prime minister, after her party won January's parliamentary elections, opposition to Sheikh Hasina is growing stronger than ever. Bangladesh faces chronic unemployment, with two-fifths of those aged between fifteen and twenty-four years old unemployed but also not in school, according to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics.\n\nWhile it was the quota system that sparked a rebellion, the underlying causes involve deeper political and economic problems. Hasina's premiership has grown more and more intolerant of dissent, especially in her most recent term. Most opposition parties boycotted this year's election, which was tainted by charges of vote rigging and widespread intimidation.\n\nHasina's consolidation of power has involved restrictions on press freedom, judicial repression of political opponents, and the leveraging of public resources. The students have mobilized to highlight many of these issues and the regime's overall disregard for democratic norms and human rights. Rights groups have warned about the development of virtual one-party rule by Hasina's Awami League.\n\nAs the world's longest-serving female head of government, Hasina has long been a darling to the outside world for having dealt skillfully with her country's radical Islamists as well as a powerful army constantly looking for opportunities to grab power. As the favored choice of foreign and domestic capital alike, she earned accolades for a resurgent Bangladesh economy with consistent GDP growth figures of 6 percent.\n\nHowever, these levels of economic growth relied upon an export-oriented garment industry that employed mostly female workers for a pittance. The collapse of the Rana Plaza factory in 2013 saw 1,100 workers killed and 2,600 injured. The deadly fire in Tazreen Fashions the previous year took the lives of 112 workers and left scores injured.\n\nThe garment sector employs around 4.5 million workers. There have been multiple protests by workers for better wages and work conditions. Last November, police opened fire on a workers' demonstration, killing one woman and injuring several others.\n\nThis is the flip side of Bangladesh's significant role as a supplier of cheap labor power to the global value chain of ready-made garments. Nevertheless, growing private investment and export-oriented economic growth helped lift millions out of destitution and broadened access to electricity and other amenities. In 2021, the country's per capita income briefly surpassed that of India.\n\nSheikh Hasina was also praised internationally for opening Bangladesh's borders to accommodate hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees escaping the 2017 military crackdown in neighboring Myanmar. However, her intolerance towards any form of domestic dissent gave rise to growing resentment.\n\nMeanwhile, the spillover effects of the Russia-Ukraine war had a major impact on Bangladesh's economy, first through the growing cost of food and fuel, and second through reduced demand for ready-made garments, primarily from Europe. Bangladesh's foreign exchange reserves were hit hard, leading the country to the brink of a debt crisis and forcing it to turn to the International Monetary Fund for a $4.7 billion bailout last year. Sheikh Hasina visited China in early July to secure a loan of $5 billion, but she had to cut short her visit in disappointment as Chinese officials were only willing to cough up a meager $100 million.\n\nAs the economic crisis deepened, the Bangladeshi economy was unable to absorb the shock. To make matter worse, the government had earlier borrowed indiscriminately to fund huge infrastructure projects. Loan repayments were now due, leading to severe pressure on the exchequer. As a result, public debt escalated and inflation rose to almost 10 percent by the start of 2024, one of the highest levels in decades.\n\nAmid widespread charges of nepotism and corruption, Bangladesh's banks have faced a severe liquidity crisis. Food inflation continues to be very high - 10.76 percent in May 2024 - impacting millions across the country. All of these factors have made the socioeconomic conditions of the country extremely fragile and created growing frustrations among the general population.\n\nIn sum, Hasina's last fifteen years of rule brought about remarkable changes in the country's economy, but her successes came with some very damaging costs. The Awami League, having first risen to power as the voice of the people, has ended up stifling popular opinion. The party has transformed into Hasina's personal property, claiming a monopoly of the heritage of the Liberation War.\n\nIn this context, the student rebellion serves to promote a fair and proper evaluation of the freedom struggle. This was a struggle in which a wide range of forces participated and made sacrifices, including the Bangladeshi left, which had a strong presence. No one party can claim the exclusive right of ownership over the Liberation War.\n\nAs the grand old party of Bangladesh politics celebrates its seventy-fifth birthday, there are many reasons for it to be proud of its history. There are also many reasons to be concerned about its present-day record. Today popular power has been supplanted by the power of money and muscles, with many positions up for grabs by the wealthy, influential, and corrupt. Top party leaders are increasingly out of touch with reality, leaning more and more upon the state's coercive apparatus to govern.\n\nThe student movement in Bangladesh has been successful in directing our attention towards these deeper anomalies in Bangladeshi politics and society. Even if the government is able to brutally repress the students, there will be no guarantees against uprisings in the future, which might be joined by other sections of society. Once again, the students of Bangladesh are showing the country the road ahead.\n\nSushovan Dhar is a political activist and trade unionist based in Kolkata, India.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

      "text": "Affirmative Action May Be Dead-But the Battle Over Race and Admissions Is Just Getting Started\n\nMother Jones; Getty\n\nThomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, often ranked as the country's top public high school, lies across the Potomac River from Washington in Alexandria, Virginia. For years, the magnet school's student body has been majority Asian American, with paltry numbers of Black and Latino students. While the situation at TJ irked the county school board for a decade, and in 2012 drew a civil rights complaint to the US Department of Education, tweaks to the admissions process failed to increase those underrepresented demographics.\n\nIn June of 2020, as the murder of George Floyd sparked both nationwide protests and a fresh reckoning with racial injustice, the school released its most recent admissions data. The number of admitted Black students was somewhere under 11-a figure \"too small for reporting\" due to privacy concerns. A week later, TJ's principal emailed students and parents: \"Our school is a rich tapestry of heritages,\" she wrote, but one that does \"not reflect the racial composition\" of Fairfax County Public Schools. \"Our 32 black students and 47 Hispanic students fill three classrooms. If our demographics actually represented FCPS, we would enroll 180 black and 460 Hispanic students, filling nearly 22 classrooms,\" she added.\n\nThe school board and superintendent began to contemplate a new admissions policy that would increase the school's diversity, an effort that was pushed along when the state of Virginia soon urged magnet schools to submit such plans.\n\nA backlash quickly formed, as a group of parents called the Coalition for TJ alleged that the school board was purposefully trying to lower the number of Asian American students in an act of anti-Asian discrimination. The group enlisted the Pacific Legal Foundation, a nonprofit libertarian law firm that had recently filed two cases on behalf of Asian American parents in other states who wanted to preserve existing admissions policies at selective public schools.\n\nThis month, the Coalition for TJ and PLF's lawyers will petition the Supreme Court to hear their case. If the justices decide to take it up, they will do so in the wake of a long-sought conservative victory from June, when the court effectively ended affirmative action in college and university admissions. To many on the right, the decision striking down Harvard and the University of North Carolina's policies was just one battle in a larger war against efforts to increase racial diversity across society-one that could, through the TJ case, again reach the Supreme Court within a year.\n\nThis next phase targets admissions policies in K-12 schools, and is an effort to maintain the status quo, even as American public education grows increasingly segregated. Radically, the lawyers driving this test case have invited the Supreme Court to go beyond its rejection of affirmative action and ban admissions policies that do not actually take race into account.\n\n\"If the government is simply choosing a race neutral policy in order to achieve a racial result, we are going to object,\" explains Joshua Thompson, who leads the Pacific Legal Foundation's education litigation. \"You cannot have a racial purpose consistent with the equal protection clause,\" Thompson argues, except \"to remedy past government discrimination.\"\n\nIf the court accepts that argument, it would constitute a sea change-not just in education, but in broader American life. For decades, public officials have considered racial disparities and segregation in arenas as varied as education, pollution , and health policy to be problems government should tackle. Under PLF's theory, even the desire to eliminate racial gaps could be successfully challenged in court.\n\n\"The goal of the Pacific Legal Foundation and others in this extreme colorblindness movement is to take racial justice off the table as an objective for policymaking at all levels of government,\" says Sonja Starr, a law professor at the University of Chicago who has closely followed the foundation's cases. If the Supreme Court adopts this view, she warns, \"it would be a legal earthquake.\"\n\nThe Pacific Legal Foundation isn't shy about the potential of the Thomas Jefferson case to have far-reaching effects. \"The challenge in TJ is: Is your true purpose a racial purpose and are you trying to hide that racial purpose through race neutral means?\" says Thompson. \"That has universal application. That doesn't just apply to universities, but it applies to high schools, it applies to contractors, it applies to employment.\"\n\n\"The TJ opinion will just simply reach a lot more areas,\" he says.\n\nNot only are Thompson and PLF asking the Supreme Court to go much further than it was willing to in June, they are also seeking to have it take a big step away from its own precedents. While the court has rejected \"racial balancing\"-the goal of matching a student body to the demographics of the community-for decades it has held that boosting diversity is a compelling interest for colleges and universities as well as K-12 schools. And far from condemning race-neutral and race-blind policies that seek to minimize racial disparities, the court has encouraged such policies, particularly in K-12 schools.\n\nWhile the Supreme Court's recent affirmative action decision ended college admissions policies that use race as a plus factor, it did not formally upset its holding that diversity is a compelling interest, nor rule that it is an impermissible one, nor condemn race-neutral means to achieving it. It only held that Harvard and UNC failed to use race in a constitutional manner. While the practical implications of the decision will make it harder-if not impossible-for colleges and universities to weigh an applicant's race in admissions, the goal of diversity so far remains good law.\n\nSeveral civil rights experts expressed skepticism that the court would be willing to use the Thomas Jefferson case to undo decades of precedent. \"If what you do is tell TJ they cannot adopt race neutral measures that open up opportunity for more students,\" says University of South Carolina law professor Derek Black, \"then what you're saying is 'We're gonna block anything that somehow or other benefits Black people.'\"\n\n\"That's a bridge too far,\" Black, an education expert, concludes.\n\nBut the current court has shown a willingness to overturn precedent, embrace radical decisions, and rule more like partisan actors than jurists. The TJ case would present yet another test showing how far the conservative majority is willing to go.\n\nJune's Harvard and UNC decision, which kept diversity as a compelling interest, was fashioned by Chief Justice John Roberts. In the wake of attacks on the court for discarding long-held legal doctrine-most notably the right to abortion under Roe v. Wade- Roberts threaded the needle, effectively ending race-conscious admissions programs in higher education without explicitly overruling precedent. \"He gets to have his cake and eat it too,\" says Reginald Oh, a law professor at Cleveland State University. \"He gets to basically abolish affirmative action while saying he did not.\"\n\nIf Roberts had taken racial diversity off the table it would signal a much easier task for the Pacific Legal Foundation, which wants the court to adopt the position that working to increase racial diversity should be unconstitutional. Instead, he called it a \"commendable\" goal.\n\nBut elsewhere in the opinion, Roberts seemed to sympathize with PLF's mission by stressing that the purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause was to create a colorblind society-a conclusion the court's liberal dissenters, who instead argued the clause was meant to create an equal society, resist as harmful and ahistorical. \"The equal protection clause is not intended to be a bulwark for the status quo,\" explains NAACP Legal Defense Fund attorney Michaele Turnage Young, even though in the Harvard case, it served as one.\n\nThe June decision was not the first time the court struck down an admissions policy that took students' race into account, and may not even be the best guide for how today's court might rule in the Thomas Jefferson case. In a fractured 2007 opinion authored by Roberts, the Supreme Court invalidated two public school desegregation programs that weighed racial identity. That opinion seemed hostile to integration plans that used race, but a majority of the justices held that public primary and secondary schools are allowed to consider both the educational benefits of diversity and the negative effects of racial isolation. (Roberts did not join that part of the decision.) In the wake of the ruling, public K-12 schools largely opted to pursue racial diversity through policies that do not take individual students' race into account. The TJ case and other similar ones seek to overturn this framework.\n\nIn December 2020, the county school board put its new Thomas Jefferson admissions regime in place. It jettisoned a $100 application fee and standardized test, which it worried acted as barriers to poorer applicants. In their place, TJ would use a more holistic review, including a problem-solving essay and a self-assessment of social skills like communication and collaboration, alongside their special education status, whether they are economically disadvantaged, and whether they've had to learn English. Most spots are reserved for applicants with GPAs that put them in the top 1.5 percent of 8th graders at each of the district's middle schools. Unfilled spots would go to the strongest remaining applicants, judged on the same factors, with an additional boost for students from middle schools with weaker records of sending graduates to Thomas Jefferson. Importantly, the policy was not just race-neutral, but race-blind: no admissions officer knew the race of any applicant.\n\nIn March 2021, the Pacific Legal Foundation sued amid the selection of the class of 2025, alleging the new policy intentionally discriminated against Asian Americans in violation of the constitution's equal protection clause. Citing statements by school board members, the superintendent, and TJ's principal, the suit argued officials acted with animus toward Asian Americans, and pointed to an expected reduction in Asian American students as evidence that the policy would have a disparate impact on them.\n\nThe class of 2025 , the first admitted under the new policy, did see Asian American enrollment drop from 73 percent to 54 percent. But it was more diverse. The share of Black students grew from 1 to 7 percent; Hispanic enrollment grew from 3 to 11 percent. White enrollment also ticked up from nearly 18 percent to 22 percent.\n\nSome Asian American applicants fared much better: according to court records , the number of low-income Asian American students grew from just one to 51. Indeed, county figures show that the biggest beneficiaries of the new policy were low-income students, with their share shooting up from 0.6 percent to 25 percent.\n\nThe following year , numbers of Black and Hispanic freshman slightly declined, while Asian American enrollment grew toward 60 percent. As Starr notes in a forthcoming law review article , \"if this was an anti-Asian policy, it was a remarkably ineffective one.\" Nonetheless, in February 2022, Claude M. Hilton, a Ronald Reagan-appointed federal district judge, ruled in favor of PLF and the Coalition for TJ.\n\nThe Fairfax County School Board, now represented pro bono by Donald Verrilli, a former solicitor general in the Obama administration, appealed. His first task was to immediately ask the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals to stay Hilton's decision; TJ was deep into selecting its 2026 class with no way revive the standardized test. He succeeded, allowing the policy to remain in place. When PLF asked the Supreme Court to reverse that ruling, the high court declined to hear their case. But in an indication that at least three justices would be sympathetic to PLF's arguments, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Clarence Thomas dissented .\n\nThis May, in a 2-1 decision , the 4th Circuit formally reversed Judge Hilton and ruled for the school board. The policy, it found, did not have a disparate impact on Asian Americans, nor was it a product of intentional discrimination. The court ruled Hilton had erred in multiple ways, including by adopting an analysis that simply compared the percentage of Asian American students before and after the race-neutral policy's implementation. \"That approach would simply turn 'the previous status quo into an immutable quota,' thereby opening a new policy that might impact a public institution's racial demographics-even if by wholly neutral means-to a constitutional attack,\" the court wrote , quoting the school board's brief.\n\nThe TJ case is one of several currently being litigated by the Pacific Legal Foundation, all alleging that changes in admissions policies at elite public schools violate the equal protection clause by discriminating against Asian Americans. The first arose in New York City in 2018, when it sued to block a policy to create more economic and racial diversity in the city's specialized high schools by expanding space reserved for students from low-income middle schools. The foundation lost that case in district court and is awaiting a decision on appeal. In 2020, PLF challenged a new admissions policy for selective middle schools in Montgomery County, Maryland, again alleging it intentionally discriminated against Asian Americans. That case is now itself before the 4th Circuit. The foundation is also suing to admit several students to prestigious Boston schools who were denied entry under a plan the group claims was discriminatory.\n\nLast year, America First Legal, a conservative group founded by former Donald Trump adviser Stephen Miller , filed a similar case in Philadelphia. Litigated with the help of Jonathan Mitchell, the former Texas solicitor general who orchestrated Texas' infamous bounty-hunter abortion ban, the group alleged that a newly created admissions lottery for Philadelphia's elite public high schools that gives a leg up to students from under-represented zip codes is a form of racial balancing. The suit remains in district court.\n\nStarr calls this wave of litigation the \"canary in the coal mine,\" and describes the legal question it raises as \"the likely future of litigation in the educational diversity space after the [affirmative action] cases.\"\n\nThat's because \"colleges are likely to do very much the same thing that TJ and other public magnet schools at the K-12 level have,\" Starr explains, and turn to race neutral policies that still stand to increase racial diversity. The cases will help determine whether that remains a viable-and legal-path.\n\nThe Supreme Court's June decisions breathed new life into the broader push to block schools and businesses from promoting diversity-efforts that go beyond what the decision actually mandated. By the end of that month, America First Legal sent a letter signed by Miller threatening 200 law schools with legal action if they did not \"immediately announce the termination of all forms of race, national origin, and sex preferences in student admissions, faculty hiring, and law review membership or article selection.\" It sent similar warnings to nearly every medical school in the country and has threatened \"woke corporations, law firms, and hospitals.\" The group provides an intake form and toll-free hotline for workers who who think they've been \"victimized by woke politics\"- indications the outfit is looking for a plaintiff to challenge the constitutionality of job-based diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.\n\nEd Blum, whose group Students for Fair Admissions was behind the successful suits against UNC's and Harvard's affirmative action policies, emailed 150 colleges unsolicited directions for complying with the court's new dictates, telling them to not only enact bans on considering race when selecting their student body, but to block admissions staff from reviewing applicants' race-either individually or in aggregate. In July, 13 Republican state attorneys general similarly fired off a letter warning Fortune 100 businesses against weighing race in hiring, promotions, and contracting. But according to David Hinojosa, an attorney at the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights who argued against Blum's group at the Supreme Court, demands for an entirely race-blind admissions or hiring process are not required by the court's opinion. Given what the court actually held, Hinojosa says such tactics demonstrate cynical overreach: \"They'll try and leverage whatever they can to ensure that power remains in the hands of white people in America, especially white males.\"\n\nWhile these missives overstate the breadth of the Supreme Court's affirmative action ruling, they accurately capture the intent of the next phase of their movement, one that targets not just race-conscious policies-but almost any attempt to increase diversity.\n\nThe recent affirmative action ruling doesn't directly bear on the TJ case. \"The Supreme Court's decision in the Harvard-UNC cases does not have direct precedential value for race neutral programs at all,\" says Turnage Young, who has represented civil rights groups in the TJ case. \"That question was not before the court.\" But in a press release , PLF signaled both its coming strategy and its optimism that the magnet school cases are the court's logical next step: \"the fight for race-blind admissions will persist, as universities are expected to pivot to 'proxy discrimination,' using facially race-neutral factors to achieve desired racial outcomes.\"\n\nIndeed, Roberts' June opinion did sound some notes that Thompson and the Pacific Legal Foundation can take heart in-even if they aren't formal legal holdings-including the chief justice's view that the equal protection clause envisions a colorblind society. The debate over the clause's meaning ran through several cases the court heard last term, and the conservatives' perspective is central to PLF's contention that the goal of diversity is unconstitutional. While that view has never been endorsed by the Supreme Court, it is a proposition at least several current justices may be willing to accept.\n\nRoberts' decision also used a phrase that PLF has deployed in its TJ case-\"zero-sum\"-to portray a scenario where a Black applicant who got a leg up in admissions due to affirmative action necessarily disadvantages a white applicant who did not. Lawyers for PLF plan to ask the court to extend that logic to race-neutral policies that foster diversity, arguing such changes are also a \"zero-sum\" form of discrimination: that any policy boosting Black and Latino enrollment intrinsically harms some other racial group. As the Fourth Circuit has already pointed out, the fact that a given policy somehow changes a school's demographics is not in itself enough evidence to win a discrimination claim. But the argument will have at least a few sympathetic ears at the high court.\n\nFinally, Thompson points to the end of Roberts' decision, where the chief justice suggested he wouldn't tolerate policies that seek to work around his affirmative action ban. What \"cannot be done directly cannot be done indirectly,\" he wrote, explaining that his ruling prohibiting race-conscious admissions is \"leveled at the thing, not the name.\"\n\nThat line, says Thompson, casts doubt that the court would agree with \"the idea that you can adopt racial proxies to achieve a racial purpose.\"\n\n\"And in that respect,\" he says, \"Harvard anticipates TJ, even if it doesn't directly speak to it.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Supreme Court Strikes Down Universities' Affirmative Action Programs\n\nJabin Botsford/The Washington Post/Getty\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled today in a 6-3 decision that the use of race in college admissions violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment and thus is unconstitutional, dealing a serious blow to affirmative action measures used by colleges to create diverse student bodies and remedy past discrimination against minorities.\n\n\"Many universities have for too long wrongly concluded that the touchstone of an individual's identity is not challenges bested, skills built, or lessons learned, but the color of their skin,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority. \"This Nation's constitutional history does not tolerate that choice.\"\n\nToday's ruling removes an \"irreplaceable tool\" for improving higher education, says David Hinojosa of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, who represented a coalition of students and recent graduates backing affirmative action in the North Carolina case. \"We know this because every time there's been a ban on affirmative action, in Michigan, in Oklahoma, in California, in Texas,\" he explains, \"there have been tremendous drops in racial diversity at the more selective universities.\"\n\n\"Those state flagships,\" Hinojosa adds, \"create pathways to leadership that will then be broken and need to be repaired.\"\n\nIn their filings, the universities had argued that allowing the use of race in admissions had benefits for the school as well as the larger society, and that a diverse student body helped prepare students for a modern workforce. Roberts, who has fought affirmative action since his early days as a young lawyer in the Reagan administration, dismissed those goals as mushy and undefined ideals that would be impervious to judicial review. \"While these are commendable goals, they are not sufficiently coherent for purposes of strict scrutiny,\" he wrote. \"It is unclear how courts are supposed to measure any of these goals, or if they could, to know when they have been reached so that racial preferences can end.\"\n\nThe decision overturns decades of the court's own precedent, which was most recently reaffirmed just seven years ago when moderate Justice Anthony Kennedy provided the swing vote to preserve affirmative action in college admissions in Fisher v. University of Texas . In that 2016 decision , the court held that the race-conscious admissions process used by the University of Texas at Austin did not violate the equal protection clause. But Kennedy retired in 2018, and President Donald Trump replaced him with Justice Neil Gorsuch and two other appointees who together formed the voting bloc that tossed out Kennedy's reasoning.\n\nTypically the Supreme Court only takes up a case when there is a circuit split, which there was not in the affirmative action cases. As they did with the Dobbs decision overturning abortion rights that the court had just reaffirmed in 2016, the newly activist conservative Trump majority took the Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard and SFFA v. University of North Carolina cases anyway, presumably with the intention of reaching the conclusion it issued today demolishing 40 years' worth of court jurisprudence that has allowed colleges to use race as one factor in making admissions decisions.\n\nThe decisions came in two separate cases brought by SFFA, a conservative group led by Edward Blum , a longtime crusader against affirmative action and voting rights who also was the engine behind the Fisher case. Abigail Fisher, the white plaintiff in that case who the University of Texas rejected because of her mediocre grades, is on the board of Students for Fair Admissions, as is her father.\n\nOne case, against the University of North Carolina , challenged the use of race in admissions in public institutions based on a constitutional claim that race-conscious admissions policies violated the equal protection rights of white and Asian applicants who were passed over in favor of other minority applicants. The case against Harvard College challenged the use of race under Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. In that case, SFFA filed a lawsuit in 2014 arguing that considering race in admissions resulted in discrimination against highly qualified Asian American applicants, who, its lawyer s have claimed , were treated much like Jews shut out of the prestigious institution in the 1920s and '30s. The lawsuit accused Harvard of imposing strict caps on the number of incoming Asian American students while giving preference to Black, Hispanic, and white students who are less qualified.\n\nIn 2019, after a three-week federal bench trial, a federal district judge rejected that argument, and the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the trial court verdict in 2020. In ruling in Harvard's favor, the trial court judge criticized Blum's group for failing to produce a single Asian American witness to testify about how they were discriminated against by Harvard. Indeed, in nearly a decade of litigation in the case and full access to Harvard's admissions files, SFFA has never produced a single Asian American applicant to Harvard who could have or should have been admitted but for the school's allegedly discriminatory admissions process. That's no surprise given that while Asians make up about 7 percent of the American population, they account for nearly 30 percent of Harvard's class of 2027. That lack of identifiably injured parties in the litigation is a major flaw that Harvard's lawyers have argued should have resulted in the case being tossed out long ago because the plaintiff lacks an injury that would give it standing. In its opinion today, the court said SFFA clearly had standing to bring the case as an organization and dismissed those concerns about the lack of victims.\n\nIn a dissent she read from the bench, Justice Sonia Sotomayor denounced the majority decision for contravening the equality envisioned by the 14th Amendment. \"Today, this Court stands in the way and rolls back decades of precedent and momentous progress,\" she wrote. \"In so holding, the Court cements a superficial rule of colorblindness as a constitutional principle in an endemically segregated society where race has always mattered and continues to matter.\"\n\nThe court's newest justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson, wrote a separate and equally furious dissent. \"With let-them-eat-cake obliviousness, today, the majority pulls the ripcord and announces 'colorblindness for all' by legal fiat. But deeming race irrelevant in law does not make it so in life,\" she wrote. \"And having so detached itself from this country's actual past and present experiences, the Court has now been lured into interfering with the crucial work that UNC and other institutions of higher learning are doing to solve America's real-world problems.\"\n\nThe decision comes at a time of white backlash on the American right against advances toward equality made by people of color. Presidential hopeful and GOP Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and his ideological allies pushing such initiatives argue that the Constitution is colorblind. He is now hoping to use this agenda as a springboard to the White House.\n\n\"The anti-DEI efforts are connected with the anti-affirmative action efforts in the sense that they are trying to erase any notion of systemic discrimination against historically marginalized people of color, including Black people,\" says Hinojosa, and our \"horrid history of slavery and discrimination and the remnants thereof.\"\n\nEnrollment of racial minorities at selective universities will now, as lower courts warned, assuredly fall. The judge in the Harvard case found that \"eliminating consideration of race would cause the African American representation at Harvard to decline from approximately 14% to 6%... and Hispanic representation to decline from 14% to 9%,\" and notably held that the caliber of students would not improve. Race-neutral programs, the judge further found, would not make up for these losses. In the University North Carolina case, a judge agreed there were no \"workable or viable race-neutral alternatives, singularly or in conjunction, that would allow [the university] to achieve the educational benefits of diversity.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "The Endless Pursuit of Equality Through College Admissions\n\nDemonstrators protest outside of the Supreme Court in 2023, after the justices struck down affirmative action in college admissions. Jose Luis Magana/AP\n\nAdmissions Granted , a documentary set to premiere on MSNBC on Sunday at 9 pm ET, gets at a central question about equality in the United States. \"Everyone is treated the same, or equality demands that people be treated differently in order to produce the equality,\" Jeannie Suk Gersen, a Harvard law professor, says in the film. \"This has been there since the beginning of the country and was there at the inception of the Fourteenth Amendment. And it's one that is unresolved.\"\n\nThe documentary probes this idea by tracking the progress of a 2014 lawsuit alleging that Harvard's race-conscious admissions program-which was intended to help underrepresented minorities-was illegal. Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA), an anti-affirmative action legal nonprofit, simultaneously sued the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (my alma mater!), arguing that, as a public school, its admissions process breached the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nSFFA focused on the negative effect these affirmative action programs had on Asian American applicants, with the group positing that the two universities were racially discriminatory. As Harvard Magazine explained, SFFA found that Asian Americans consistently received the lowest score of any racial group on their \"personal\" rating, one of the five admissions categories, alongside academic, athletic, and extracurricular achievement, and an \"overall\" rating. Harvard dismissed the data analysis as \"flawed\" and stated that the personal rating helps provide a holistic understanding of who an applicant is and \"considers race in accordance with Supreme Court precedent.\" Both lawsuits went through the court system, eventually landing at the Supreme Court.\n\nThe film follows several subjects from both sides of the Harvard case, with SFFA founder and conservative activist Edward Blum and organizations like the Asian American Coalition for Education facing off against proponents of affirmative action-and Asian American students and their families divided in between.\n\nThis wasn't the first battle over affirmative action. Admissions Granted chronicles the long history of conservative efforts to roll back these programs, including prior court decisions like Regents of the University of California v. Bakke in 1978, which struck down racial quotas, and Grutter v. Bollinger in 2003, which permitted schools to use affirmative action for campus diversity as long as race was only one factor considered among many.\n\nThe crux of these cases was an argument over what discrimination really means in the United States. What should be allowed under federal law and the US Constitution? In its 2023 ruling on the Harvard and UNC cases, the Supreme Court declared the schools' admissions systems to be unlawful. \"Eliminating racial discrimination means eliminating all of it...For 'the guarantee of equal protection cannot mean one thing when applied to one individual and something else when applied to a person of another color,'\" the court stated , quoting from Bakke.\n\nIn her dissent , Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson rejected that argument. \"Our country has never been colorblind,\" she wrote. \"Given the lengthy history of state-sponsored race-based preferences in America, to say that anyone is now victimized if a college considers whether that legacy of discrimination has unequally advantaged its applicants fails to acknowledge the well-documented 'intergenerational transmission of inequality' that still plagues our citizenry.\"\n\nAmidst all of this, where do Asian Americans lie? The film documents claims that they have been used as the face of the decades-long conservative backlash against affirmative action. Beginning in 1961, with President John F. Kennedy's Executive Order 10925 , the US government began taking halting steps toward a vision of equality in an imagined racially binary society. Over the decades, that vision would lead to countless debates, political battles, and legal challenges over what fairness and equality really mean.\n\nOne year after the Supreme Court's Harvard ruling, I spoke with Hao Wu and Miao Wang, the directors of Admissions Granted , to better understand the case, the affirmative action debate that it brought once again to the national stage, and what can still be done to address systemic racism in higher education. Our interview has been edited for clarity.\n\nOne subject in the documentary, Sally Chen, recalled her counselor telling her to not write an Asian immigrant story for her college essay, saying it was overdone and not compelling. So to reject that advice, I was wondering about both of your stories coming and working in the US.\n\nWang: I came to the US when I was around 12, and I didn't speak English when I arrived in the Boston area. When Jeannie [Suk Gersen], who is in the film, talked about her experience, I really related to her because we moved around the same time and same age, sitting in the classroom not knowing what was going on. I started at the end of seventh grade and then went on to eighth grade and high school. Those were my years in Boston, feeling very alienated from everything. In my high school it was pretty much mostly white, and I think I was the only Asian person in the school.\n\nThen I went to college, but I didn't study film. I went to Chicago and studied economics. A lot of that also has to do with feeling the family pressure of studying something creative. But I moved to New York as soon as I graduated and started to slowly work on more creative projects. I attended Parsons [School of Design] for an interactive media program. That's where I started doing more film. My first film [\"Yellow Ox Mountain\"] looked at Chinese artists in New York-that was my thesis project that I turned into a real film and submitted to film festivals.\n\nIt's interesting as an Asian American filmmaker. I think my own relationship to being Asian American has changed since I've now been here for a long time. It took me a while to feel at all comfortable identifying as an Asian American because I felt more like Chinese and an American. And I still feel like I'm that-more than Asian American-but I've gotten more comfortable with that terminology over the years.\n\nWu: I came to the US at the age of 20. I went to college in China and went through the college entrance exam system-as mentioned in the film-where a single score determines where you end up. I came over here studying molecular biology, and then later I switched to business. I got my MBA at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. I actually went to work in the tech industry for many years and made films on the side as a hobby, but 12 years ago, I quit my tech corporate job and started doing filmmaking full-time.\n\nAs Miao mentioned, I definitely felt more Chinese and American, by culture, instead of Asian American. But having lived here for a long time, especially after I had my own kids and watched them grow up in America as Chinese Americans-or Asian Americans-and also having made this film about the American experience, has helped me start to identify as Asian American. But I absolutely understand many Asian Americans have a very different upbringing than my own experience growing up in China.\n\nWhat drew both of you to the Harvard case? What inspired you to make a film about it?\n\nWang: It was at a big film party that was overflowing with food and drinks during a long conversation while both of us were reading about the lawsuit and when the case had just gone through its district court ruling in late 2019. Both of us felt like it was a fraught conversation in the news. There's so much nuance around it like the two sides of Asian Americans that were involved in the case and how affirmative action was part of the discrimination litigation. There were a lot of different things to unpack, and I think we got interested.\n\nWu: Because I came here initially for graduate school, a lot of my friends from China had a similar experience to Yukong [Zhao] and Jeff [Wang], the parents in the film. Around the Harvard lawsuit, starting in 2018, I started hearing a lot more and became more conscious about my friends talking about their perception of how difficult it was for Chinese American or Asian American kids to get into college. That definitely piqued my interest, and then once I started reading about this lawsuit, as Miao mentioned, there was confusion about what this has to do with affirmative action. After having talked at the party, we both felt like we were really interested. First of all, we wanted to find out more, but we were not sure whether there was a film. A lot of times when filmmakers get together, we encourage each other to go along with the project, so that's what we did. We just decided to work on this together, to be able to discuss, and also motivate each other to go on.\n\nBased on what you were saying, Hao, how did your perspective on Asian Americans' place in that whole affirmative action discourse in media and in politics change throughout the filmmaking process?\n\nWu: Throughout the filmmaking process, both Miao and I read a lot of books about Asian American history. For example, early Chinese Americans building the railroad, the San Francisco riot against Chinese Americans, and Japanese internment camps. We read about the different groups coming to America, and that expanded my understanding of what the Asian American identity truly encompasses. Previously, based on what I read in the media, there seemed to be a very monolithic view about what Asian American identity represents, but through the making of this film, I started realizing that there was not only ethnic and cultural diversity within the Asian American community, but also their political views are quite diverse. That's refreshing for me.\n\nWang: One of the things that I found interesting is when many Asian immigrants come to the US, they don't really understand why they are suddenly now under this Asian American umbrella. Where did that come from? And I feel like not knowing that history-which I didn't really know until more recently-of why early immigrants decided to come together and become \"Asian American\" would make it seem like somebody else put that umbrella together to make you more monolithic. But I read that it was actually political alliances that came together to create more power for the group. So instead of just one group, each fighting for their own rights, they were actually coming together for empowerment.\n\nWu: What was really helpful for me to understand why there's so much diversity in Asian Americans' views on affirmative action is the concept of cultural repertoire from Natasha Warikoo, who is in the film. Newly arrived immigrants, on one hand, don't fully understand the history of Asian Americans and their involvement in the civil rights movement, and they also came here with their own cultural repertoire-how what made them successful in their own life experience shaped their views and expectation for their kids, as well as their political views.\n\nYeah, watching this documentary led me to research the history of the term \"Asian American.\" I read how during the '60s it originated from student activists at UC Berkeley as something political and tied to the civil rights movement but has evolved more into a demographic descriptor today.\n\nWang: Exactly, that's what I was talking about. It's so interesting to learn that history.\n\nIn the documentary, Natasha Warikoo discussed the evolving language we were using after the Bakke ruling in addressing systemic racism and discrimination. Instead of using ideas like \"equality,\" \"justice,\" and \"access,\" we were now talking about multiculturalism and diversity. What do you think about that change in language?\n\nWu: That's tied to the legal argument. The original rationale to why American society started and popularized affirmative action was to try to remediate. But during the Bakke case, the first affirmative action lawsuit to the Supreme Court, the Court ruled that to remedy past discrimination is not a legally valid rationale for the existence of affirmative action. Justice [Lewis] Powell said universities have a compelling state interest to increase diversity, so that students can learn from each other. It was a legal compromise for the Supreme Court to be able to justify the continuation of affirmative action policies. At that time, it was viewed as a win for liberals.\n\nWang: It wasn't a win for everybody. Some of the schools felt like they could continue their work, but there were civil rights activists in the beginning that were against it.\n\nWu: It wasn't necessarily fully beneficial to the longevity of affirmative action because in last year's ruling, conservative justices really battered the diversity rationale. During the oral argument, they kept asking, \"How do you measure the benefits of diversity?\"\n\nThe documentary touches on the idea of conservatives like Edward Blum using middle-class Asian Americans under the model minority myth to position communities of color against each other. What do you think is the way forward to ameliorate this?\n\nWang: Because universities now don't have access to using race as a checkbox, they are trying to find alternative ways. Jeannie was talking at one of our panel interviews about how some of them are considering recruitment processes that look at different zip codes because a lot of times you can tell household makeup or even race and income. They're using different factors that are not directly race for recruitment to achieve the same results.\n\nWu: The state of California banned affirmative action with Proposition 209. The University of California system has experimented with ways to give preferences to underrepresented minority groups using socioeconomic measures as well as geographic measures, as Miao mentioned. Also, the Supreme Court allowed college applicants to write about race as one of the factors that shaped their character or achievement to give admissions officers a more complete understanding of their background. That's still allowed-the only thing that they cannot use is race as a checkbox. The ruling will definitely have some impact, but I think other universities are trying to do something similar to what the California system has been doing to get around the ban.\n\nWang: I'm sure it's more work for the schools, and they're going to have to experiment and do more research to find other ways that work.\n\nWu: But the concern now with conservatives like Edward Blum is that they are very critical of race considerations. So they'll challenge whatever the elite colleges want to do.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Did Justice Jackson Sneak a Loophole into the Supreme Court's Affirmative Action Ban?\n\nJacqueline Martin/CNP/ZUMA\n\nThe Supreme Court's conservative majority banned race-conscious admissions policies at colleges and universities on Thursday, ruling that using race as an admissions factor violates the Constitution's equal protection clause. The decision invalidates the University of North Carolina and Harvard's systems for making up their student body, and will, more broadly, make higher education whiter and society less equal.\n\nWhile the decision pushes back the country's ability to remedy the affects of slavery and Jim Crow, in his majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts carved out what could be interpreted as a small loophole in his decision: \" Nothing in this opinion should be construed as prohibiting universities from considering an applicant's discussion of how race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration, or otherwise,\" Roberts wrote at the end of his opinion.\n\nBut Roberts himself insists that this is not a backdoor to affirmative action. \"A benefit to a student who overcame racial discrimination, for example, must be tied to that student's courage and determination... In other words, the student must be treated based on his or her experiences as an individual-not on the basis of race.\"\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the court's ruling, it is unclear if Roberts has weakened his own opinion by allowing consideration of race in some instances or, as Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in her dissent, has simply put \"lipstick on a pig.\" Either way, the line supports the notion that Roberts was forced by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson's questions to grapple with how a truly color-blind admissions policy would be both unworkable and unfair.\n\nJackson raised this point during oral arguments in October, where she gave the following hypothetical:\n\nThe first applicant says: I'm from North Carolina. My family has been in this area for generations, since before the Civil War, and I would like you to know that I will be the fifth generation to graduate from the University of North Carolina. I now have that opportunity to do that, and given my family background, it's important to me that I get to attend this university. I want to honor my family's legacy by going to this school.\n\nThe second applicant says, I'm from North Carolina, my family's been in this area for generations, since before the Civil War, but they were slaves and never had a chance to attend this venerable institution. As an African American, I now have that opportunity, and given my family - family background, it's important to me to attend this university. I want to honor my family legacy by going to this school.\n\nSo, Jackson queried, under a race-blind policy, would the school be forced to ignore the story of the Black applicant but credit the story of the white one? This situation would likely cause \"more of an equal protection problem than it's actually solving,\" she explained at the time.\n\nIn a dissenting opinion today, Jackson expanded on the hypothetical. She named the two applicants John and James. John's family has attended the UNC for seven generations; James would be the first in his family to enroll. Jackson's dissent, in pages of detail, airs the tortured history that brought John and James to this point, from slavery to Jim Crow,  to truly explain the disparities-not just in their individual experiences, but in those of their ancestors.\n\nMost likely, seven generations ago, when John's family was building its knowledge base and wealth potential on the university's campus, James's family was enslaved and laboring in North Carolina's fields. Six generations ago, the North Carolina \"Redeemers\" aimed to nullify the results of the Civil War through terror and violence, marauding in hopes of excluding all who looked like James from equal citizenship. Five generations ago, the North Carolina Red Shirts finished the job. Four (and three) generations ago, Jim Crow was so entrenched in the State of North Carolina that UNC \"enforced its own Jim Crow regulations.\" Two generations ago, North Carolina's Governor still railed against \"'integration for integration's sake'\"-and UNC Black enrollment was minuscule. So, at bare minimum, one generation ago, James's family was six generations behind because of their race, making John's six generations ahead.\n\nIn a separate dissent , Sotomayor warns that Roberts's concession is merely an exercise in trying to look good, and not one that will actually soften his ruling. \" This supposed recognition that universities can, in some situations, consider race in application essays is nothing but an attempt to put lipstick on a pig,\" she writes. \"The Court's opinion circumscribes universities' ability to consider race in any form by meticulously gutting respondents' asserted diversity interests. Yet, because the Court cannot escape the inevitable truth that race matters in students' lives, it announces a false promise to save face and appear attuned to reality. No one is fooled.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "The Supreme Court Is Set to Kill Affirmative Action. Just Not for Rich White Kids.\n\nJon Han\n\nEvan Mandery January+February 2023 Issue\n\nWhen he was 8 years old, Michael Wang decided he wanted to go to Harvard. \"I don't know if it's the Asian stereotype,\" he told me, \"but I saw it as an avenue to social mobility.\" Though he wouldn't have thought of it in these terms when he was 8, Michael meant the sort of upper-echelon mobility familiar to graduates of elite colleges. Specifically, he wanted to be a neurosurgeon. Because he was that sort of kid, he read several peer-reviewed articles about cloning and checked the authors' credentials. When he saw that many of the researchers had gone to Harvard, he knew that was the college for him.\n\nFrom that point forward, Michael's parents made it their life's work to help their only child achieve his goal. Michael's dad-who goes by Jeff-had a sense of what it would take. He'd come to the United States from Shanghai in the 1980s as part of the wave of Chinese students who had emigrated to the West when Deng Xiaoping implemented the Four Modernizations following Mao Zedong's death. Jeff got a PhD in physics from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, worked in banking for a while, and then transitioned to tutoring students in math and science. Today he runs a Mathnasium franchise in Union City, California, where Michael grew up. Many of his students went on to top colleges, and Jeff watched and emulated the parents' tactics. Sociologist Annette Lareau would call it \"concerted cultivation.\" Yale Law professor Amy Chua might say that he became a Tiger Dad.\n\nThis is an adapted excerpt from Poison Ivy: How Elite Colleges Divide Us , published October 25, 2022, by The New Press. Copyright © 2022 by Evan Mandery.\n\nPhoto by Ilona Lieberman\n\nIn fifth grade, Jeff persuaded the school district to let Michael take algebra. Each day, he picked his son up at his elementary school and drove him to the middle school for his advanced math class. In seventh grade, he collected Michael at the middle school and drove him to a local high school to take Algebra II. By his sophomore year, Michael had finished BC Calculus. He ended up taking 15 AP courses. Michael's 4.64 GPA made him salutatorian of his class. He got a perfect score on the ACT and nearly aced the SAT, too, with scores that put him squarely in the 99th percentile. He also played piano, debated at a high level, and founded a math club. In the fall of 2012, Michael sent off his college applications-about 25 in all-with optimism and the satisfaction of knowing he'd done everything within his power to increase his chances of getting into a top college.\n\nTo say he was disappointed by the replies would be a vast understatement. By any ordinary standard, Michael did quite well, and he's soberer about the experience in retrospect, but at the time he felt devastated. Yale said no. Princeton said no. Stanford said no. Harvard put him on the waitlist. Then it said no. Columbia did the same thing. He wasn't consoled by Berkeley's offer of a free ride or by Penn and Georgetown's offers of half scholarships. \"I was definitely disappointed receiving that many rejections,\" Michael told me when I spoke with him for my new book, Poison Ivy: How Elite Colleges Divide Us , from which this essay is adapted. \"I thought to myself, 'What more can I do at this point?' \" He decided to go to Williams, which offered to cover 90 percent of his tuition.\n\nIf Michael Wang's story ended here, it'd be typical of high achievers in the modern era, in which acceptance rates at the Ivies and other elite schools hover around 5 percent. At this point, though, Michael did something decidedly atypical: He wrote the colleges asking why he'd been rejected and suggested that he'd been the victim of discrimination. Ten years later, he still has their replies. Yale's dean of undergraduate admissions wrote that the college believed that its policies \"do not disadvantage Asian American students relative to majority white students in a holistic admissions review, and also that we are in compliance with all relevant legal requirements.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, Yale's letter didn't make Michael feel much better. He obsessed about the matter. During summer vacation, he read US Supreme Court decisions on affirmative action and The Chosen , Berkeley sociologist Jerome Karabel's definitive history of college admissions at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. Karabel recounted how Jews had accounted for more than 20 percent of Harvard freshmen in the 1920s until Harvard's president, A. Lawrence Lowell, warned that the \"Jewish invasion\" would \"ruin the college\" and proposed to cap their numbers at 15 percent. An expository writing teacher at Harvard argued in a New York Times op-ed that Asians had become the new Jews. More than half of Harvard applicants with exceptionally high SAT scores were Asian American, he wrote, yet they made up less than 20 percent of admitted students. And while Asians were the fastest-growing racial group in the United States, their numbers at Harvard hadn't increased in decades.\n\nIn June 2013, Michael filed a complaint with the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights. \"As recipients of federal funding,\" he wrote, \"these private universities cannot discriminate on the basis of race, sex, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, etc. Yet, they all resort to race-conscious admissions practices that violate existing federal laws and infringe upon my rights guaranteed by the Constitution.\" The universities, he said, were guilty of race-norming-meaning they were evaluating test scores and other metrics differently depending on the race or ethnicity of the applicant. Though Michael asked for his admissions decisions to be reconsidered without reference to race, he understood there was almost no chance of this happening. \"My concern was helping out high school friends who were juniors,\" he says. \"These policies affect a lot of people.\"\n\nInvestigators from three different offices of the Department of Education reached out to Michael. A lawyer in the department's Boston office told him that they'd been investigating Harvard since the 1990s, but as Michael puts it, they didn't have a smoking gun. He did what he could to advance the cause. In July 2014, he wrote an op-ed in the Mercury News against SCA-5, a bill that would have reinstated affirmative action in California, where it had been illegal since 1996. SCA-5 went down.\n\nBy this time, Michael had caught the eye of Ed Blum. Blum is the only person I've ever heard of whose Wikipedia title is \"litigant.\" He was the architect of Shelby County v. Holder , the 2013 Supreme Court decision that eviscerated the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and Fisher v. University of Texas , a 2016 decision that, but for Antonin Scalia's untimely death, would have gutted affirmative action. Blum called Michael at Williams, said that he was gathering potential plaintiffs for a lawsuit against Harvard, and asked whether Michael would be willing to serve as their spokesperson.\n\nMichael said yes.\n\nStudents for Fair Admissions v. Harvard is the most significant challenge to affirmative action in a generation. The court heard oral arguments in the Harvard case and a related University of North Carolina case on October 31. Based on skeptical questioning by the conservative justices about the meaning and value of campus diversity, among other matters, it is widely expected that they will rule to end affirmative action as we've known it for the past half-century. \"Harvard does not discriminate,\" Lawrence S. Bacow, the school's president, insisted in a statement after the Supreme Court first announced it would take the case. \"[O]ur practices are consistent with Supreme Court precedent; there is no persuasive, credible evidence warranting a different outcome.\"\n\nBut though it may seem paradoxical, it's important to understand that this construction is in large part Harvard's own doing, the consequence of its stubborn insistence-which all elite schools share-on preserving the status quo in US college admissions, almost every aspect of which is slanted in favor of kids from wealthy, overwhelmingly white, families. If nothing else, SFFA v. Harvard demonstrated this conclusively through discovery-the pretrial production of documents and deposition testimony-which opened the first significant window into Harvard's previously opaque admissions process.\n\nThroughout that process, officers are allowed to give \"tips\"-extra points-to applicants for \"distinguishing excellences.\" These include capacity for leadership, creative ability, and geography. They also include economics, race, and ethnicity. This speaks directly to a 1978 Supreme Court decision, Regents of the University of California v. Bakke , which held that racial quotas are unconstitutional, but that race could be considered as a \"plus\" factor. If the high court now eliminates racial preferences, any college inclined to do so could still diversify along socioeconomic or geographic lines. But as we will see, those paths require upsetting the status quo to surrender some of the advantage afforded to wealthy applicants. And it's hard to be too optimistic about the prospect of elite schools doing so after seeing how Harvard makes its high-end sausage.\n\nHarvard divides applications into geographic dockets based on high school location. Each is initially reviewed by an admissions officer assigned to that docket, who rates the applicant based on academics; extracurriculars; athletics; personal qualities such as integrity, helpfulness, courage, kindness, empathy, self-confidence, maturity, and grit-and school support, which basically means the strength of the applicant's recommendations. This \"first reader\" also gives a summary rating. The vast majority of students also sign up for an interview with one of 15,000 alumni interviewers, who separately scores the applicant on the same categories. The scores range from one to six, with one being the highest. Very few applicants score worse than a four. It's the admissions version of grade inflation.\n\nLike most elite colleges, Harvard also gives explicit preferences to applicants known in the world of higher education as ALDCs, a group that includes recruited athletes as well as the children of faculty, donors, and alumni-the alumni kids are called \"legacies.\" ALDCs, approximately half of them legacies, represent about 30 percent of every Harvard class, and about 43 percent of the college's white students. Being a member of this rarefied group improves one's chances of getting in by an order of magnitude. The admit rate for typical applicants to Harvard's Classes of 2014-19 averaged 5.5 percent, according to data produced in SFFA v. Harvard , but the college accepted nearly 34 percent of legacy applicants, 47 percent of faculty kids, and 86 percent of recruited athletes.\n\nBack in 2004, a team of Princeton researchers determined -based on data from three elite schools that offer admissions preferences to athletes, legacies, and underrepresented minority applicants-that being a legacy effectively gave applicants a boost equivalent to scoring 160 additional points out of 1600 on the SAT, even though legacies tend to do slightly worse in college than nonlegacies. (By comparison, Black applicants received the equivalent of a 230-point boost, Hispanic applicants 180 points, and athletes 200 points. Asian applicants suffered the equivalent of a 50-point loss.)\n\nSFFA's legal claim is simple: The plaintiffs say Harvard's subjective admissions factors are stacked against them. Because so much of the class is set aside for ALDCs, and Asian Americans aren't regarded as a disadvantaged minority, the competition they face is brutal. The plaintiffs presented most of their statistical case through Peter Arcidiacono, an econometrician based at Duke. Arcidiacono testified that if Harvard relied solely on academics, Asian Americans would constitute more than half of its admitted students, as opposed to the current 20 percent. Race might be a plus factor for others, but for Asians it's a big minus.\n\nArcidiacono is an expert witness for the plaintiffs, so if you're skeptical of his framing, consider this evidence from New York City. By state law, the sole criterion for admission to the city's eight specialized high schools is (for now) performance on the Specialized High School Admissions Test, or SHSAT. These eight schools include Brooklyn Tech, where my dad was principal; Bronx High School of Science, where my wife went; and Stuyvesant, which has the highest cutoff. In 2020, Asians filled 524 of the 766 available slots at Stuyvesant-68 percent. It's fair to question, as many have, whether the SHSAT, like the SAT, is simply another instrument correlated with wealth, or whether any single factor should decide someone's fate, but it's powerful evidence that Arcidiacono's claim has merit.\n\nWhat held Asian American applicants back, Arcidiacono found, were their personal ratings. Admissions officers gave ones or twos (on the aforementioned six-point scale) to a smaller share of those applicants than they did to students from any other racial or ethnic group. An investigation of Harvard by the Department of Justice during the 1990s found a similar pattern. Asian applicants were presumed to be oriented solely toward math and science. They were routinely described as bland, flat, or unexciting -to quote one reviewer: \"He's quiet and, of course, wants to be a doctor.\" Of all the factors Arcidiacono identified , nothing was quite so damning as to be labeled \"standard strong.\" In a sample of 10 percent of the applicants to Harvard's class of 2018, 256 students were labeled this way, and 114 of them were Asian American.\n\nNone got in.\n\nSeven months after SFFA filed its lawsuit, a company named Ivy Coach mocked Michael Wang on its blog. Ivy Coach is one of the many private consulting firms that guide parents through the process of getting their kids into elite colleges and boarding schools. After CNBC reported that Ivy Coach charged more than $100,000 for its services, the company boasted on its blog that the news station had \"grossly underreported\" its fees. When the New York Post reported that the company charged one mom $1.5 million, Ivy Coach didn't deny it, but rather wrote that the company makes \"absolutely no apologies\" for what it charges. For the 2020-21 school year, more than 43 percent of incoming Harvard freshmen from families making more than $250,000 a year reported using private admissions counselors like Ivy Coach.\n\nIvy Coach claimed that Michael had made a fundamental error in how he marketed himself. In emphasizing his piano ability and debating skills, he'd presented himself as well-rounded \"when that is the precise opposite of what schools like Yale, Princeton, and Stanford seek.\" If only Michael had been reading the company's blog, he'd have known to make himself \"extraordinary at one thing\" as opposed to \"ordinary at lots of things.\"As Ivy Coach explained in another post, \"Ordinary's boring. Extraordinary's anything but boring. Highly selective colleges don't want boring. They want extraordinary. Understood? We hope so.\"\n\nIn Michael's defense, Harvard's own data contradicts this advice. To make its statistical case, Harvard called on David Card, a Berkeley economics professor. Card argued that strength across multiple dimensions mattered enormously. He found that only 12 percent of admitted students were \"one-dimensional stars,\" meaning that they got a rating of one in a sole area, but scored two or better in fewer than three categories. By contrast, 46 percent of admitted students were \"multi-dimensionally excellent,\" meaning they got a score of at least two in three or more categories. Another 31 percent were \"multi-dimensionally solid.\"\n\nIn the context of the lawsuit, Card's argument was that Asian applicants tended to be one-dimensional academic stars whereas white applicants tended to have better nonacademic ratings and were generally more multidimensionally excellent or solid. So Michael could be forgiven for not understanding that investing another few thousand hours into his piano practice to further cultivate his most distinguishing excellence risked branding himself as a one-dimensional star.\n\nWe may not know what a distinguishing excellence is, but we certainly know what it's not. It's not working at Taco Bell or Burger King. Jobs only came up twice in Card's report-each time to say that Arcidiacono hadn't considered them, but never to say how much weight Harvard attached to them. That's because Harvard doesn't attach any explicit weight to jobs. If the college gives a tip to a socioeconomically disadvantaged student, it is in spite of their disadvantage, not because of it. No one views working a near-full-time job-as almost all my City University of New York students do-as a virtue that should count toward acceptance.\n\nSFFA's case is complicated by a simple truth: It's probably not Harvard's direct aim to disadvantage Asian applicants. Harvard's admissions office is reasonably diverse, and during the trial several of the officers adamantly denied any animus or conscious prejudice. When one Asian-American admissions officer was asked her reaction to the allegations at trial, she said, \"It's not what I know our office to be. It's not who I am. I would never be part of a process that would discriminate against anyone, let alone people that looked like me, like my family, like my friends, like my daughter.\"\n\nUS District Court Judge Allison Burroughs credited the staffer's testimony in ruling for Harvard, and she was probably right to do so, though it's easy to be skeptical given the Ivy League's historical transgressions. James Conant, who served as Harvard's president from 1933 to 1953, was part of an admissions committee that suggested using letters of recommendation and interviews to assess \"aptitude and character\" as a way of addressing the so-called Jewish problem-too many Jewish kids qualifying for coveted Ivy acceptances. The notion of the Yale man-of \"sound physique\" and \"grace of body\"-evolved to combat what was known in New Haven as the \"Hebrew invasion.\" So, too, Princeton's commitment to educating \"leaders,\" not \"bookworms.\"\n\nIn the years since, elite colleges have made undeniable strides in improving the racial diversity of their classes-even if, almost certainly, it's also true that Asians have been disadvantaged by some of the policies that have promoted these broader gains and that diversity gains overall have been limited by universities' steadfast commitment to preserving ALDC tips.\n\nIf SFFA v. Harvard were about socioeconomic status rather than race, there could be no doubt as to Harvard's intent. Every experience valued by elite colleges is directly correlated with wealth. The experiences that allow young people to \"distinguish\" themselves are not uniformly available-not by a long shot. About 90 percent of students from families in the top US income quartile participate in school-based extracurriculars, whereas only 65 percent of students from the lowest quartile do. Nearly one-third of those low-income students participate in neither sports nor club activities. (The overall nonparticipation rate is 10 percent.)\n\nUsing survey data from the National Center for Education Statistics, a team including Robert Putnam-whose book Our Kids: The American Dream in Crisis lays out a damning indictment of the nation's exploding opportunity gap-found that affluent high schools offer about twice as many team sports as schools in high-poverty neighborhoods do. Those schools are also far less likely to require students to pay to play, as many poorer schools do-even in California, where the practice has been ruled unconstitutional. (Administrators evade the legal requirement by calling the fees \"donations.\")\n\nWhen the sociologists Elizabeth Stearns and Elizabeth Glennie used high school yearbooks to explore extracurricular opportunities in North Carolina, they found a similar pattern. Affluent schools offered more activities and had higher participation rates. This continuing disparity creates a vicious cycle because the experiences that allow students to distinguish themselves in the college application process also help keep kids in school. Poorer kids, already at higher risk of dropping out, have less opportunity to have the kind of experience that makes a young person love school and feel loved by it.\n\nAs damning as all of this is, the picture is even bleaker when we probe deeper into the breadth and quality of extracurricular experiences. Putnam's team found that a high school senior from a rich family is about twice as likely as one from a poorer family to have served as a sports team captain. They also found significant gaps in access to private music, dance, and art lessons.\n\nParticipating in a high-quality Model United Nations program seems like the sort of experience that could change a young person's life, and maybe even help them get into college. Of the Top 25 ranked Model UN programs, 10 are housed in private schools. Of the remaining 15, only one is hosted by a school whose student body is more than 10 percent Black. It's no coincidence that Harvard and other elite colleges offer a proliferation of niche sports such as squash, fencing, and crew, that many disadvantaged kids have barely heard of, let alone participated in. A staggering 70 percent of recruited athletes at Harvard are white-a mere 3 percent of those white athletes are from economically disadvantaged families.\n\nIn 2017, Elizabeth Heaton, a college consultant who worked as an admissions officer at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote a piece for the Huffington Post titled, \"What Kind of Hook Do I Need to Get Accepted to an Ivy League College?\" It's all about those distinguishing excellences, she argued. Being an Eagle Scout isn't a distinguishing excellence, Heaton explained, because 50,000 kids achieve that rank every year. Valedictorians are a dime a dozen. So, too, are class presidents. Creating a nonprofit that solicits $1,000 and serves 500 meals isn't a distinguishing excellence either. \"But it can become one,\" she wrote, \"if you are raising $100,000 and serving 500,000 meals.\" Her other examples included a debate champion, a \"future global leader fluent in eight languages,\" a USA Biology Olympiad winner, and a student who runs regional volunteer efforts for a US Senate campaign.\n\nIt's hard to imagine a child of even ordinary means having any of these experiences. All are available only to families with wealth and connections. Who else has the access to get-and can afford to take-an unpaid internship in a high-profile political campaign? What child of ordinary means can win a science olympiad? For a fee, Heaton's organization, Bright Horizons College Coach, will help you build a science profile that should suffice as a distinguishing excellence. Its Research Mentorship Program will match you \"with a researcher from a top institution, such as Harvard, Princeton, Oxford, and MIT.\" The goal is to develop a college-level research project that's \"a meaningful addition\" to the college application. It also includes 10 mentoring sessions and help getting the work published or presented at a conference. Be forewarned: This program is only available to purchasers of the Premier and Elite plans.\n\nBecause college admissions officers may not be familiar with reverse-transcriptase inhibitors or machine-learning algorithms, distinguishing research needs to be translated into accessible language. Ideally, this language should include a narrative of personal growth that syncs with the sort of diversity that Harvard and its brethren value. Not to worry. Ivy Coach, Bright Horizons, and all the private college counselors will be more than happy to \"edit\" your college essays.\n\nMaddeningly, but unsurprisingly, a team of researchers at Stanford found that the quality of an applicant's essays has an even stronger correlation to reported household income than to their SAT score. Surely professional editing is exacerbating this disparity. Yet no elite college has a policy against this sort of assistance, even though it'd be easy to imagine, as Princeton Review founder John Katzman has proposed, requiring that students write their essays while sitting for one of the standardized exams.\n\nStill, that's not the worst of it. Elite colleges exacerbate the hoarding of opportunity by attaching value to distinguishing excellences. The message to parents is that they need to expose their children to elite extracurricular experiences to get them into elite colleges. This shapes the communities in which they live. Yet, paradoxically, almost everyone in the academy embraces the research (and often their own teaching experience) showing that the best predictors of wellbeing and achievement are characteristics like resilience, not academic or extracurricular brilliance.\n\nExtracurriculars aren't a reflection of a person's inner wealth or value but of their opportunities. Working at Taco Bell or Burger King while going to high school isn't something to be looked down upon. Rather, it's a marker of resilience and a predictor of success-if only those students who need to work can overcome the prejudice against their experience and get themselves through those gilded gates. But there's the rub. Working takes hours away from the time-intensive extracurriculars that elite colleges value.\n\nAt my stepson's public high school commencement in a relatively affluent suburb, the school's guidance director told parents that their children's graduation was proof that \"anyone can succeed.\" She explained, \"It's just a matter of hard work.\" Richard Rothstein, who wrote about the sordid history of racial redlining in his 2017 bestseller, The Color of Law , calls the belief that children born into low-income families can escape that status through hard work and education \"a fantasy that we share.\" It's a fantasy in part because elite colleges don't value hard work-or at least not hard work as it's understood by and available to ordinary people. Instead, these schools value distinguishing excellences available only to the wealthy, and act as if weighing these experiences is the only conceivable mechanism by which to select capable students.\n\nIt isn't.\n\nAfter graduating from Brandeis, Deborah Bial worked briefly as a paralegal, then took a job at CityKids, a foundation that uses art to help at-risk children find their voices. While there, she met a young man nicknamed Stein-short for Einstein-who'd given up a scholarship at a major university. When Bial asked why he'd dropped out, Stein said, \"I could have done it if I had had my posse with me.\"\n\nStein's comment inspired Bial to start the Posse Foundation. It sends scholarship students in groups of 10-posses-to participating colleges so that they can support one another. The approach has been extraordinarily successful. Posse currently recruits students from 20 cities and has 63 partner colleges. Since its creation in 1989, Posse has selected more than 10,000 scholars who have received a cumulative $1.8 billion in scholarships. In 2007, Bial was awarded the prestigious MacArthur Foundation fellowship.\n\nPosse is amazing, but Bial didn't get a $500,000 so-called genius grant merely for sending kids to college in groups. She won it for how she picked the kids. Even in the late 1980s, Bial understood that the SAT systematically disadvantaged poor students, especially those who are Black or brown. She understood, too, long before the renowned psychologist Angela Duckworth recognized the power of determination, that people with the highest grades weren't the ones who went on to succeed. If Bial wanted to cultivate a new generation of disadvantaged students who would go on to become leaders in their colleges and communities, she would need a different way to select people.\n\nSo she developed a test that measures initiative and persistence through group activities. The Bial-Dale College Adaptability Index is sometimes called the \"Lego Test\" because of a 10-minute segment that asks groups of students to reproduce a robot made of Lego blocks. The students are allowed to examine the structure individually but are prohibited from taking notes. Success requires cooperation and teamwork. In another part of the three-hour exam, rather than mirroring the traditional college interview, students are asked to lead a group discussion on a random topic. Observers note not who has the biggest vocabulary, but rather who collaborates well and who shows resilience.\n\nHow well does it work? Even though Posse is choosing among the most underserved students, those at the greatest risk of dropping out, more than 90 percent graduate. It's difficult to imagine more definitive proof of something we all know in our hearts: The college interview is a scam. Unstructured interviews are notoriously bad at predicting future performance. What they do, rather, is reproduce social inequalities. People like people like them. So, the college interview becomes an exploration of shared experiences, even though many of those experiences are unavailable to poor applicants of color and an alternative system exists that's better at predicting success. The sociologist Lauren Rivera has shown the same mechanisms at work in hiring at top law firms, investment banks, and management consulting companies.\n\nEven admissions practices that seem touchy-feely can skew the odds in the wrong direction. For instance, in the wake of widespread criticism that privileged families game the standardized-testing process, many colleges-including many of the Ivies-have made themselves test optional. But applicants can still submit SAT and ACT scores when it benefits them. That's very different from schools that have made themselves \"test-blind,\" like the University of California, which no longer considers test scores at all.\n\n\"Superscoring\" is even more offensive. That's the common practice of counting only a student's highest score from individual sections of the exam. The more times you take the exam, the greater your likelihood of having a superscore that exceeds your actual average. You can probably guess who takes these tests over and over. Economist Joshua Goodman, then at Harvard's Kennedy School, and his collaborators looked at 10 million SAT takers from 2006 through 2014. Low-income students, they found, were 21 percent less likely to retake the exam-even though retaking it was worth about 90 points on the super-score and increased a low-income student's chance of enrolling at a four-year college by nearly 30 . The effect was so strong, the authors concluded , that it explained about a quarter of the enrollment gap between low- and high-income students.\n\nMost tragically, the status quo represents a lost opportunity. Imagine if we told communities that the skills elite colleges valued were cooperation, hard work, and listening. To be sure, the rich will learn to manipulate any system to sustain their class position. But think about what it would do for the perception of working-class people to signal that holding a real job signified something of honor and predicted success, instead of treating it as a disadvantage. Consider, too, what communities would look like if instead of creating incentives to hoard extracurricular opportunities and hire $100,000 consultants, colleges instead encouraged young people to be the best team players they could be.\n\nIt's almost inevitable that the Supreme Court will dispense with affirmative action in the near future. That day will be tragic in a host of regards. Although reasonable minds can differ on whom should be given preference in college admissions, it's hard to argue against the proposition that Harvard and other elite colleges-many of which were built with slave labor and with the benefit of racist housing practices-owe a debt to at least some of their applicants of color. But this obligation will almost certainly go unmet.\n\nAnd it will largely be Harvard's fault. No admissions system will ever be without controversy, but it's important to remember how much opportunity Harvard could have created by ending its most offensive practices, such as tips for ALDCs. It could have admitted more Asian American applicants with high test scores and more socioeconomically disadvantaged students. Instead, the college acted as if the leg up it has historically afforded to affluent students is sacred, and in doing so it effectively pitted disadvantaged groups against one another. When the court ends affirmative action for low-income students of color, it will be the result of Harvard's indignant commitment to affirmative action for wealthy white kids.\n\nChart statistics compiled by Mother Jones senior editor Michael Mechanic from Ivy Plus websites (acceptance rates, testing policies); Harvard Crimson (class of 2019 survey); Raj Chetty et al .

      "text": "How the Affirmative Action Ban Affects Environmental Justice Policies\n\nAfter the high court's conservative majority  ruled it unconstitutional to consider race in college admissions, some experts say programs like Justice40 could face legal challenges. The Climate Reality Project/Unsplash\n\nThis story was originally published by Inside Climate News and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nA landmark decision by the Supreme Court to end the use of race-based affirmative action in college admissions could impede federal efforts to reduce the nation's persistent economic, environmental, and health disparities, one of President Joe Biden's top political priorities.\n\nBiden promised when he first took office to advance environmental justice through a \"whole-of government\" approach. Democrats also dedicated some $60 billion for environmental justice projects in their flagship climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nBut some legal scholars are now warning that the administration could find it more difficult to carry out those efforts after the high court's decision last week to end affirmative action. Specifically, the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that the admission policies of Harvard College and the University of North Carolina were unconstitutional because they considered the race of the applicants. Known more commonly as affirmative action, the practice of giving an advantage to potential students from some races has aimed to reverse decades of racial discrimination in higher education, proponents argue.\n\nIt's among several precedent-breaking decisions by the high court's conservative supermajority in recent years that not only throw a wrench in President Biden's agenda, but are likely to have widespread ramifications for generations to come.\n\n\"This does not mean that race-conscious environmental justice efforts are doomed-but the court clearly signaled that the strict-scrutiny test has very sharp teeth,\" Emily Hammond, a professor and vice provost for faculty affairs at George Washington University Law School, told E&E News . \"Federal, state, and local governments will need to tightly craft their environmental justice policies to meet this standard.\"\n\nIn other words, federal agencies could have less leeway when it comes to implementing Biden's executive orders, including those aimed at advancing environmental justice, said Sam Sankar, senior vice president for programs at Earthjustice, one of the nation's oldest environmental law organizations.\n\nIn May, the Supreme Court ruled to drastically limit the EPA's authority to regulate waterways and wetlands under the Clean Water Act. The high court also ruled last year to curb the federal agency's ability to regulate power plant emissions under the Clean Air Act.\n\n\"Every day the Supreme Court is upending precedents in ways that are causing a chilling effect on those agencies, and they are worried that maybe the regulations that they already have on the books are in question because of some radically new approach by the court,\" Sankar told me. \"Agencies are worried that they're going to spend years developing regulations that these right-wing justices are just going to toss out as soon as they show up in the Supreme Court.\"\n\nAndrew Mergen, the Department of Justice's former chief environmental appellate lawyer and the director of Harvard Law School's Emmett Environmental Law and Policy Clinic, said in an interview that last week's affirmative action decision \"has the potential to complicate\" Biden's implementation of the Justice40 initiative in part by encouraging more lawsuits from Republican-led states that have been enthusiastically challenging much of the president's agenda.\n\nJustice40 directs federal agencies to deliver 40 percent of the \"overall benefits\" of their environmental and energy investments to disadvantaged communities. And environmental justice advocates say that provision is paramount to Biden's goal of improving the air and water quality for communities of color that disproportionately live near industrial development. More than $29 billion across 19 federal agencies have already been filtered through that program, according to the White House, though states will play a pivotal role in how that money gets doled out.\n\nThe Biden administration has already opted to walk back some of its promises to address the nation's inequities, largely to avoid legal challenges from red states. Last year, the administration explicitly left race out of the metrics of a key screening tool meant to help federal agencies identify which neighborhoods to flag for funding priority under the Justice40 program-much to the chagrin of the environmental justice community.\n\nThis spring, federal transportation officials retracted guidance that directed states to consider climate change and equity when spending federal infrastructure money. And last month, the EPA decided to close three high-profile civil rights complaints and terminated the federal investigation into whether the state of Louisiana failed to protect predominantly Black communities from decades of toxic air pollution in a stretch of industrial neighborhoods that locals call \"cancer alley.\"\n\n\"This will undoubtedly embolden people on the right to bring these challenges,\" Mergen told me. \"EJ communities are rightfully concerned about this decision having a chilling effect and creating too much caution in the administration.\"\n\nBut Mergen also said people shouldn't read too much into the affirmative action case and noted that the Supreme Court ruled in late June to reject a challenge to Biden's immigration law from two Republican states. \"I think it's a setback, but I think there are a couple of things that we should keep in mind,\" he said. \"One is that this administration has a commitment to (environmental justice) like none other in history. And two, I think that there are some signs that the Supreme Court may be getting a little tired of this ideologically driven litigation.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Michelle Obama: Yes, We Have Affirmative Action for the Wealthy\n\nMichelle Obama at the DNC on Tuesday. Nate Gowdy\n\nIt's fair to say that Michelle Obama stole the show at the Democratic Convention on Tuesday. (Husband Barack was on point in noting how hard an act she was to follow.) And to a journalist like me who covers wealth and inequality, one line in particular stood out. Listen:\n\nThe affirmative action of generational wealth . That's a smart reframing of a longtime conservative hobby horse.\n\nRepublican politicians and right-wing media have regularly attacked programs designed to counter the generational impacts of government-sanctioned discrimination in housing , education , and veterans benefits . Now they're targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion programs-see JD Vance's recently introduced \" Dismantle DEI Act \"- and trying to brand Kamala Harris a \" DEI hire .\" That's a laughable assertion. ( New York Times columnist Lydia Polgreen argues that the moniker applies more aptly to Vance.)\n\nBut the critics of DEI and affirmative action want to have their cake and eat it too. For example, if you, like our Supreme Court , think the use of race as a factor in college admissions should be illegal, that's your prerogative. But I hope you are similarly inclined to outlaw the practice of elite colleges giving an admissions boost to children of alumni and to students ( like Jared Kushner ) whose parents are major donors. Because isn't that, too, a kind of affirmative action?\n\nIn just a handful of words, Michelle Obama managed to convey a simple truth, says Dedrick Asante-Muhammad, president of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies , a Washington think tank that focuses on the racial wealth-and-opportunity gap: \"It is not those asking to break up concentrated wealth and opportunity that are asking for an unfair advantage, but rather those who are hoarding concentrated wealth.\"\n\n\"Most of us,\" as Obama noted, \"will never benefit\" from generational wealth. And that's true of everyone, but even truer when you are Black or Hispanic. In the Federal Reserve Board's 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF)*, about 47 percent of white respondents said they'd either received an inheritance or expected to receive one. Their median inheritance expected was $195,500 (in 2019 dollars).\n\nOnly 16 percent of Black respondents had received or expected an inheritance-and their median expectation was about half the white figure. Less than 12 percent of Hispanic respondents had received or expected an inheritance.\n\nThe disparities are similar when you look at federally subsidized retirement savings , which, according to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), will cost US taxpayers nearly $2.5 trillion from 2023-2027. Most of that cash goes to the wealthiest 10 percent of Americans, who tend to be, yep, pretty white.\n\nIn 2021, the JCT identified 8,000 Americans with Individual Retirement Account (IRA) balances in excess of $5 million who were still getting tax breaks for their annual contributions-which is \" shocking but not surprising ,\" noted Senate Finance Committee chair Ron Wyden. Peter Thiel, ProPublica reported, even managed, using questionable tactics, to amass a Roth IRA worth $5 billion.\n\nAffirmative action for the rich .\n\nAccording to the latest (2022) SCF , only 35 percent of Black families and less than 28 percent of Hispanic households even had a retirement account, compared with 62 percent of white families. The accounts of those white families were worth over $380,000 on average, more than triple the Black and Hispanic savings-and again, these numbers don't account for the fact that a large majority of Black and Hispanic households have no private retirement accounts at all.\n\nThen there's land ownership-see \" 40 Acres and a Lie ,\" our acclaimed multimedia package exploring how the few Black families who received land reparations after the Civil War then had their acres cruelly rescinded a year and a half later. And consider these passages on the Homestead Acts, from a chapter of my 2021 book , Jackpot , titled \"Thriving While Black.\"\n\nThe two acts, passed during and after the Civil War, granted 160-acre parcels of public land-a foundation for generational wealth-to families willing to stake out the plots and make improvements. But the timing and circumstances made it extraordinarily difficult for Black Americans to participate:\n\nIt was a once-in-a-lifetime bonanza for white fortune-seekers. \"The acquisition of property was the key to moving upward from a low to a higher stratum,\" wrote author Everett Dick. \"The property holder could vote and hold office, but the man with no property was practically on the same political level as the indentured servant or slave.\" [...]\n\nBetween the two acts, about 270 million acres of farmland-14 percent of the total landmass of the continental United States-was granted to 1.6 million white families, but only 4,000 to 5,000 Black families. [ University of Michigan professor Trina] Shanks calculates that more than 48 million living Americans are direct descendants of those Homestead Act beneficiaries. Which means there's a greater than one-in-four chance your forebears benefited directly from the biggest public-to-private wealth transfer in American history-if you're white, that is.\n\nAffirmative action for the rich.\n\nObama hit the nail on the head. Asante-Muhammad says he was struck by her simple acknowledgement \"that affirmative action for the privileged happens,\" though \"I wish there could have been a follow up to re-emphasize why programmatic affirmative action to advance more equal opportunity is necessary.\"\n\nBut \"it felt good,\" he adds, \"to hear a political speech that connects so personally with my political ideals, and to the challenges of the racial wealth divide and the action and ideals needed to bridge it.\"\n\n*I used 2019 numbers here because the 2022 inheritance data was only available in raw form.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "SCOTUS OKs Affirmative Action-if It Helps Black Americans Get in \"the Bunker, Not the Boardroom\"\n\nJ. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nOn Thursday morning, the decades-long conservative crusade to upend affirmative action proved successful. In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court ruled against the use of race-conscious admissions, finding such programs at the University of North Carolina and Harvard University to be in violation of 14th Amendment's equal protection clause .\n\nIn the majority opinion, Chief Justice Roberts railed against UNC and Harvard for conducting programs that \"unavoidably employ race in a negative manner\" and \"involve racial stereotyping.\" But he carved out a notable exception: military schools. In the case of military academies, Roberts seemed convinced by an amicus brief submitted by prominent military officials in August 2022 that viewed race-based admissions as furthering \"compelling interests at our Nation's military academies.\" Roberts granted their request in a footnote, writing, \"This opinion does not address the issue, in light of the potentially distinct interests that military academies may present.\"\n\nAssociate Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson had some thoughts on this rationalization. Joined in a dissent by Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, she writes:\n\nThe Court has come to rest on the bottom-line conclusion that racial diversity in higher education is only worth potentially preserving insofar as it might be needed to prepare Black Americans and other underrepresented minorities for success in the bunker, not the boardroom (a particularly awkward place to land, in light of the history the majority opts to ignore).\n\nWe have now entered an era in which race is only a legally permissible college admissions factor within the context of military recruitment. Black people can be considered Black when schools are preparing them for war-just not to study, say, chemistry.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "\"Let-Them-Eat-Cake Obliviousness\": Liberal Justices Blast Supreme Court Ruling Striking Down Affirmative Action\n\nJ. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nThe Supreme Court on Thursday rejected the use of race in college admissions at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina, dealing a potentially lethal blow to affirmative action programs in colleges throughout the country.\n\nThe decision, which civil rights groups say effectively bans affirmative action, a policy widely viewed as an \" irreplaceable tool \" to improve higher education, will have enormous consequences all but certain to reverse progress in the United States. Look no further than the dissenting opinions of Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, who blasted the majority's decision for showcasing a \"let-them-eat-cake obliviousness\" that would ultimately deliver a \"tragedy for us all.\"\n\nWe've combed through the most searing lines below:\n\n\"With let-them-eat-cake obliviousness, today, the majority pulls the ripcord and announces 'colorblindness for all' by legal fiat. But deeming race irrelevant in law does not make it so in life.\" -Jackson\n\n\"The Court subverts the constitutional guarantee of equal protection by further entrenching racial inequality in education, the very foundation of our democratic government and pluralistic society.\" -Sotomayor\n\n\"Ignoring race will not equalize a society that is racially unequal. What was true in the 1860s, and again in 1954, is true today: Equality requires acknowledgment of inequality.\" -Sotomayor\n\n\"No one benefits from ignorance. Although formal racelinked legal barriers are gone, race still matters to the lived experiences of all Americans in innumerable ways, and today's ruling makes things worse, not better.\" -Jackson\n\n\"This contention blinks both history and reality in ways too numerous to count. But the response is simple: Our country has never been colorblind. Given the lengthy history of state-sponsored race-based preferences in America, to say that anyone is now victimized if a college considers whether that legacy of discrimination has unequally advantaged its applicants fails to acknowledge the well-documented 'intergenerational transmission of inequality' that still plagues our citizenry.\" -Jackson\n\n\"In so holding, the Court cements a superficial rule of colorblindness as a constitutional principle in an endemically segregated society where race has always mattered and continues to matter.\" -Sotomayor\n\n\"The Court has come to rest on the bottom-line conclusion that racial diversity in higher education is only worth potentially preserving insofar as it might be needed to prepare Black Americans and other underrepresented minorities for success in the bunker, not the boardroom (a particularly awkward place to land, in light of the history the majority opts to ignore).\" -Jackson\n\n\"The only way out of this morass-for all of us-is to stare at racial disparity unblinkingly, and then do what evidence and experts tell us is required to level the playing field and march forward together, collectively striving to achieve true equality for all Americans.\" -Jackson\n\n\"Entrenched racial inequality remains a reality today. That is true for society writ large and, more specifically, for Harvard and the University of North Carolina (UNC), two institutions with a long history of racial exclusion.\" -Sotomayor\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "SCOTUS Ducks High School Diversity in Admissions Case\n\nJustice of the Supreme Court Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito in the Great Hall at the Supreme Court, Monday, Dec. 18, 2023. Pool Via Cnp/CNP via ZUMA\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday declined to take up a bombshell case challenging an admissions policy at a magnet high school in Virginia that was designed to increase racial and economic diversity at the school. However, Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas issued a strong dissent, signaling their willingness to embrace a radical view of racial blindness in school admissions. With more cases challenging admissions policies aimed at growing diversity making their way to the Supreme Court, the justices could still limit efforts to increase diversity in K-12 education in the future.\n\nThomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, one of the most prestigious public high schools in the country, adopted a new system for admissions in late 2020, shifting from a reliance on standardized tests to a more holistic review of applicants with reserved spots at all the middle schools that feed into Thomas Jefferson. The new policy was challenged by a group of parents called the Coalition for TJ, who claimed that the new policy was a form of anti-Asian discrimination aimed at lowering the number of Asian-American students who made up a majority at the school.\n\nThe new policy, like the old one, did not take race into account. It was not only race-neutral but race-blind, which is to say admissions officers do not know the race of the applicants. The group of parents was represented by the Pacific Legal Foundation, a libertarian non-profit law firm already representing Asian-American parents in two similar cases concerning public school admissions.\n\nLast summer, the Supreme Court effectively banned affirmative action in university admissions, rolling back decades of precedent. The Thomas Jefferson case would have taken the court's hostility to policies promoting racial equality to a new, more radical level. \"The goal of the Pacific Legal Foundation and others in this extreme colorblindness movement is to take racial justice off the table as an objective for policymaking at all levels of government,\" says Sonja Starr, a law professor at the University of Chicago who has closely followed the foundation's cases, told Mother Jones last year. If the Supreme Court adopts this view, she warned, \"it would be a legal earthquake.\"\n\nAs I reported last August:\n\nThis next phase targets admissions policies in K-12 schools, and is an effort to maintain the status quo, even as American public education grows increasingly segregated. Radically, the lawyers driving this test case have invited the Supreme Court to go beyond its rejection of affirmative action and ban admissions policies that do not actually take race into account.\n\n\"If the government is simply choosing a race neutral policy in order to achieve a racial result, we are going to object,\" explains Joshua Thompson, who leads the Pacific Legal Foundation's education litigation. \"You cannot have a racial purpose consistent with the equal protection clause,\" Thompson argues, except \"to remedy past government discrimination.\"\n\nIf the court accepts that argument, it would constitute a sea change-not just in education, but in broader American life. For decades, public officials have considered racial disparities and segregation in arenas as varied as education, pollution , and health policy to be problems government should tackle. Under PLF's theory, even the desire to eliminate racial gaps could be successfully challenged in court.\n\nAlito makes no secret of why he would have wanted to take this case. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled in favor of the new admissions policy, he wrote , \"is flagrantly wrong and should not be allowed to stand.\" Justice Thomas signed onto this dissent.\n\nIt's possible other justices are sympathetic to Alito and Thomas' view but didn't want to take up a second case on race and admissions so soon after their major decision against affirmative action last year. If that's the situation, similar cases in Maryland and New York working their way through the courts would allow justices to radically restrict efforts to integrate K-12 schools and restrict the government's effort to promote diversity and equality. When the Supreme Court allowed Thomas Jefferson's new policy to take effect at the start of the litigation, Justice Neil Gorsuch showed a willingness, alongside Alito and Thomas, to halt the new policy. Chief Justice John Roberts has authored opinions hostile to the idea of integrating K-12 schools-all evidence that there may be enough justices eventually to take up this issue.\n\nThe dissent appears to support the argument that the new policy takes away spots from deserving Asian-American students and gives them to less-deserving non-Asian students-though there is no data to support that conclusion. In fact, in the first class admitted under the new admissions policy, the average GPA of the incoming class was higher than in recent years under the old plan . In one paragraph that is likely to draw attention, Alito employs a hypothetical about Black basketball players to illustrate his view that the policy is denying admission to those who deserve it most.\n\nSuppose that white parents in a school district where 85 percent of the students are white and 15 percent are [B]lack complain because 10 of the 12 players (83 percent) on the public high school basketball team are [B]lack. Suppose that the principal emails the coach and says: \"You have too many [B]lack players. You need to replace some of them with white players.\" And suppose the coach emails back: \"Ok. That will hurt the team, but if you insist, I'll do it.\" The coach then takes five of his [B]lack players aside and kicks them off the team for some contrived-but facially neutral-reason. For instance, as cover, he might institute a policy that reserves a set number of spots on the roster for each of the middle schools who feed to the high school.\n\nAlito's point here is that the school board instituted a policy that may appear to be neutral on its face but still contained the insidious purpose of targeting a specific racial group, and therefore amounted to unconstitutional discrimination. The court's decision not to take up this case allows Thomas Jefferson High School's policy to stand, and signals to other schools and colleges around the country that race-neutral alternatives to affirmative action are permissible-at least for now.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Some of my classmates got in for their wealth.\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nBy Joy-Ann Reid\n\nI got into Harvard only because of affirmative action .\n\nI went to a school no one had ever heard of in Denver, Colorado, in a small suburb. I didn't go to a prestigious high school like Exeter or Andover. I didn't have college test prep. I just happened to be really nerdy and smart and have really good grades and good SAT scores.\n\nBut someone came to Denver to look for me. A Harvard recruiter flew in, met me at a restaurant, and did a pre-interview to pull me into Harvard. I was pulled in - affirmatively.\n\nThis was not the recruiter saying, \"We're going to take an unqualified person and put them in Harvard.\" Rather, they were saying, \"We're going to take a very qualified person who we would never know existed and put them in Harvard.\"\n\nThat's how I got there. That's how Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson got there. It's how Justice Clarence Thomas got into Yale Law School .\n\nBut the minute I arrived at Harvard from my majority-Black little town of Montbello in Denver - the first week or two that I was in class - my presence was questioned by white people.\n\nI was in a big conference class where some white students stood up and said, 'Those students, the Black students, they're only here because of affirmative action.\" It became a huge argument that we all ended up having.\n\nI had never had my academic credentials questioned. I had never had anyone question whether I was intelligent - until I got to Harvard. And it was a defining point of my experience there. It was one of the many reasons I was miserable during my freshman year. I felt completely out of place. People kept telling me, \"You shouldn't be here.\"\n\nAnd yet, some of the people I went to school with were far less smart than me or the other Black folks there. They got in because their daddy and their grandaddy went there. I went to school with someone whose name was on one of the buildings, people who are third- and fourth-generation legacies, whose parents pumped money into Harvard to get them in.\n\nBut that affirmative action is OK with this Supreme Court majority . They said that the people who benefited from slavery - their descendants who are so far ahead of Black folk in terms of opportunity that we'll never catch up to them (I don't care how many Oprahs we get) - those people's affirmative action is A-OK.\n\nThat's because those people can pay for fancy trips for them. But you people who want to get in just because of your brains but you're not from a legacy - too bad, you can't come in.\n\nThis is an excerpt from Thursday's episode of \"All In with Chris Hayes.\" It has been slightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nJoy-Ann Reid is host of \"The ReidOut\" at 7 p.m. ET on MSNBC. \"The ReidOut\" features one-on-one conversations with politicians and newsmakers while addressing provocative political issues both inside and outside of the beltway.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

As it did in the Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade , the Supreme Court reversed itself. In 2003, the now-retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for a majority of the court, concluded that the universities could consider race in its admissions decisions. That court explicitly recognized the government's goal of creating a diverse student body. Those days are gone.\n\nIn the Supreme Court's new world order, achieving a racially diverse student body is no longer a compelling government interest.\n\nThe court's willingness to flout its own precedent is based on a narrow view of what equality means in our society. The court has essentially concluded that trying to use race to remedy racial inequities is itself racial discrimination.\n\nIn one case, brought against the University of North Carolina , the court concluded that considering race in the public university admissions process violates the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause . That constitutional provision bars states from denying \"the equal protection of the laws.\"\n\nWhat \"equal protection of the laws\" means in reality is that under one view, achieving equality will sometimes require the government to take affirmative steps. Meaning, the government can and should take actions to achieve equal opportunities and racial equality. This could include remedying racial discrimination by implementing university admissions programs that take race into account. If we adopt this perspective, affirmative action programs are plainly constitutional.\n\nBut from a different perspective, the Equal Protection clause instead requires that judges strike down any laws that take race into account. Under this view, race-conscious laws amount to invidious discrimination, which is always a problem. This would obviously mean that programs that take race into account to remedy past discrimination fly in the face of the Equal Protection Clause. This is the perspective adopted by the majority of the Supreme Court, and this is why they concluded that public university admissions policies that take race into account actually undermine equality, and violate the Equal Protection clause.\n\nIn the other affirmative action case, brought against Harvard College , the court ruled that considering race in the private college admissions process violates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act . That federal law prohibits private entities, like colleges, that receive federal government funds from discriminating on the basis of race. Similar to its reasoning in the UNC case, in the Harvard case, the court concluded that race-conscious admissions policies constitute racial discrimination.\n\nDuring oral arguments in the University of North Carolina case, Justice Thomas stated , \"I've heard the word 'diversity' quite a few times, and I don't have a clue what it means.\" If that's true, perhaps it would be best to respect the court's prior decisions and allow private and public institutions to attempt to remedy past harms and achieve racial diversity.\n\nBut for this court, even decisions by Republican-appointed justices like O'Connor stand in the way of their desire to remake our society in their vision. In 2003, the court recognized that \" use of admissions decisions [could] further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body .\" In the Supreme Court's new world order, achieving a racially diverse student body is no longer a compelling government interest. In fact, using race-conscious criteria in admissions decisions to achieve racial diversity now violates both the United States Constitution and federal statutory law.\n\nThis court will continue to steamroll through its past decisions where they stand as inconvenient roadblocks to its policy goals. It didn't start with abortion and it won't end with affirmative action.\n\nRead the full text of the Supreme Court's opinion curtailing affirmative action below:\n\nJessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School, is the host of the \" Passing Judgment \" podcast.

      "text": "The Supreme Court killing affirmative action would have devastating consequences\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nThe future of affirmative action is once again at stake after the U.S. Supreme Court this week agreed to hear cases brought by Students for Fair Admissions against Harvard University and the University of North Carolina. The suit alleges that Harvard discriminates against Asian American students and that UNC discriminates against white and Asian American applicants. These criticisms of college admissions policies are not new, but the deeply conservative Supreme Court agreeing to hear those criticisms could signal the beginning of the end for affirmative action.\n\nEliminating affirmative action policies would have devastating consequences on students from marginalized communities.\n\nEliminating affirmative action policies in higher education would have devastating consequences on students from marginalized communities. These policies, which conservatives have tried to eliminate since their inception, are designed to help redress centuries of educational and economic inequality in the United States.\n\nDuring a June 4, 1965, speech at Howard University, President Lyndon B. Johnson, whose administration introduced such policies, provided his rationale for them. He explained: \"You do not take a person who, for years, has been hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race and then say, 'You are free to compete with all the others,' and still justly believe that you have been completely fair.\"\n\nJohnson's speech underscored the need for affirmative action policies, especially in the realm of education where Black and brown students had faced (and continue to face) an array of challenges. In a recent email to me, Crystal Sanders , an associate professor of history at Pennsylvania State University and the author of \" A Chance for Change: Head Start and Mississippi's Black Freedom Struggle ,\" wrote, \"Race-conscious affirmative action policies in higher education have ensured that our colleges and universities are diverse and afford every student the opportunity to learn alongside people from various walks of life.\" To that point she added: \"These policies, which consider race as one factor among many in admissions decisions, are a necessary response to our nation's long history of race-based educational inequality.\"\n\nA brief overview of the history of education in this country underscores the vital role affirmative action has played in addressing those historic inequities, a process that is by no means complete. The education of enslaved people in the South was prohibited, and after emancipation, white people opposed to new educational opportunities for the emancipated burned down hundreds of Black schools . Those schools that survived served as proof that separate was never equal. During the 1890s, for example, at Black schools in Bolivar County, Mississippi , there were 43 students per teacher compared to 17 students per teacher in white schools. Black teachers were paid a little more than half of what white teachers were paid.\n\nAccording to Sanders, who is completing a book on Black Southerners' efforts to enroll in graduate and professional education programs during the Jim Crow era, \"Many Southern states denied Black citizens access to post-baccalaureate study at their flagship institutions until the 1950s or later.\" But it wasn't just the South. \"Many elite schools in the North, Sanders said, \"had policies admitting no more than a handful of Black students annually.\"\n\nWhite resistance to integration continued even after the Supreme Court, in its landmark 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision, ordered the desegregation of public schools. These battles extended to K-12 schools in the North. In 1957, the same year that the Little Rock Nine in Arkansas integrated Central High School in the face of white violence and intimidation, activist Mae Mallory joined with eight other mothers in Harlem to boycott three junior high schools and sue the New York City Board of Education. In December 1958, Judge Justine Polier ruled in their favor - a victory that challenged the de facto practice of segregation in the North.\n\nWhite resistance to integration continued even after the Supreme Court ordered the desegregation of public schools.\n\nThese hard-won battles laid the groundwork for the introduction of affirmative action policies in higher education, which aimed to address educational disparity. As Eddie Cole , an associate professor of higher education and history at UCLA, and the author of \" The Campus Color Line: College Presidents and the Struggle for Black Freedom \" explains, \"Affirmative action originated as a series of programs and initiatives - not just race-conscious admissions - aimed at systemwide change across all of higher education.\" These programs, Cole adds, \"called for investment in more colleges and universities to address racial disparities in the broader society.\"\n\nThis investment began to pay off almost immediately. Affirmative action drastically increased the number of Black students enrolled in higher education: from an estimated 227,000 in 1960 - before the use of such programs - to more than 1,000,000 by 1982. These gains also coincided with the development of departments and programs that focused on the experiences and history of marginalized groups in response to the demands of student activists.\n\nSince its passage in the 1960s, affirmative action has been under attack. If the Supreme Court's decision to hear the cases against Harvard and UNC signals an end to the practice, there will be negative implications for Black students and other marginalized groups. \"Ending affirmative action policies in higher education,\" Sanders warns, \"would be detrimental to ensuring that our colleges and universities are racially diverse and comprised of the best and brightest students that our country and world have to offer.\"\n\nToday the majority of Black K-12 students attend schools that are predominantly populated by other students of color. Black students are also more likely to attend schools where many community members are classified as low-income or poor. This has important implications because, according to a 2019 analysis by EdBuild, a New Jersey-based research group that advocates for school funding, districts with mostly students of color received $54 billion in local tax funding in 2016 while districts with mostly white students got $77 billion.\n\nRecent studies also indicate a decrease in Black students' enrollment in higher education. In 2020, The Education Trust found that at 60 percent of the country's top 101 public colleges and universities, Black enrollment has declined. Researchers are not sure how to explain that decline. In examining the enrollment numbers for Black college students from the 2014-2015 school year to 2018-2019, the Center for American Progress found a decline in enrollment of about 200,000 students.\n\nAs Johnson passionately argued in his Howard speech, \"It is not enough just to open the gates of opportunity. All our citizens must have the ability to walk through those gates.\"\n\nAffirmative action policies have been vital to the ongoing process of leveling the playing field for marginalized students. Dismantling them would hinder the progress of students of color and in so doing deepen inequality in the United States.\n\nKeisha N. Blain is an award-winning historian and writer.

The lawsuits target policies at the University of North Carolina and Harvard University, and they were filed by Students for Fair Admissions, an organization led by a white man named Edward Blum. Blum's organization has filed several cases with white and Asian American plaintiffs aiming to ban race-conscious admissions, which some schools use to foster a healthy and diverse campus culture.\n\nWithout knowing history, some may take as truth the idea that Asian American students - or Asian Americans generally - strongly oppose these policies. That would be foolish.\n\nOn last night's episode of \"The ReidOut,\" OiYan Poon - an associate professor at Colorado State University who studies the racial politics of education - noted that Asian, Black and Latino communities have traditionally supported affirmative action. Specifically, she referenced Mari Matsuda, one of the early developers of critical race theory and the first tenured Asian American female law professor in the United States. You should know her.\n\nMatsuda famously delivered a speech to the Asian Law Caucus in 1990, titled \" We Will Not Be Used ,\" in support of affirmative action policies.\n\n\"I want to speak of my fear that Asian-Americans are in danger of becoming the racial bourgeoisie, and of my resolve to resist that path,\" she said in her powerful remarks.\n\nHere's a passage I've been sitting with for a bit:\n\nAsian success was success with a dark, painful price. To use that success to discount the hardship facing poor and working people in this country today is a sacrilege to the memory of our ancestors. It is an insult to today's Asian-American immigrants, who work the double-triple shift, who know no leisure, who crowd two and three families to a home, who put children and old-folks alike to work at struggling family businesses or at home doing piece-work until midnight. Yes, we take pride in our success, but we should also remember the cost. The success that is our pride is not to be given over as a weapon to use against other struggling communities. I hope we will not be used to blame the poor for their poverty. Nor should we be used to deny employment or educational opportunities to others.\n\nToday, there's a multipronged, conservative attack on learning institutions. On one hand, conservatives are trying to erase the history of America's racist past - and that past includes stories of Black, Latino and Asian American solidarity and the oppressive policies that have historically encouraged it. On the other hand, conservatives are trying to force colleges and universities to support their rigid racial hierarchy, which prioritizes whites and uses Asian American achievement to beat back claims of racist discrimination.\n\nIt's important to know that Asian Americans have been hip to this game for years, and a great many of them have spoken against being made into pawns.\n\nRead Matsuda's full speech .\n\nRelated posts:\n\nTexas governor throws teachers to the wolves with new 'parental bill of rights'\n\nAaron Rodgers lost way more than a chance at the Super Bowl this season\n\nTrump White House had Hannity, Fox News in the palm of its hands.

For the remainder of undergraduate admissions, race is considered as one of many factors.\n\nBert Rein, a lawyer for Fisher, told the justices at an oral argument last October that the university had not shown \"any necessity for doing what they were doing\" in its admissions policy.\n\n\"Race should have been a last resort,\" he said. \"It was a first resort.\"\n\nChief Justice John Roberts pressed Gregory Garre, a lawyer for the university, over how much diversity was enough.\n\n\"The compelling interest you identify is attaining a critical mass of minority students at the University of Texas, but you won't tell me what the critical mass is,\" the chief justice said.\n\nLater, he asked: \"What is the logical end point? When will I know that you've reached a critical mass?\"\n\nGarre could not provide a direct answer but said later in the argument that the university sought to create \"an environment where cross-racial understanding is promoted.\" Previous court rulings prohibit outright quotas.\n\nThe Obama administration supported the Texas system. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli told the justices that the administration wanted \"graduates who are going to be effective citizens and effective leaders in an increasingly diverse society, and effective competitors in diverse global markets.\"\n\nHe was asked by Alito whether it was acceptable for the university to give a preference to black and Hispanic applicants from privileged backgrounds. Verrilli said that the university wanted to make individual decisions that \"further the educational mission.\"\n\n\"For example, they will look for individuals who will play against racial stereotypes just by what they bring: The African-American fencer, the Hispanic who has - who has mastered classical Greek,\" he said.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan, who worked on the issue while she was solicitor general under President Barack Obama, recused herself from the case.\n\nThis article originally appeared on NBCNews.com here .\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, she indicated that if she's seated on the Supreme Court that she intends to recuse herself from the case filed by Students for Fair Admissions.\n\nIf recent developments are any indication, Jackson's recusal makes it more likely than it already was that the conservative court will bring an end to affirmative action on college campuses or, at the very least, significantly limit its use and, thus, widen the educational and economic inequality that affirmative action policies were designed to help redress.\n\n\" Affirmative Action, Mismatch, and Economic Mobility after California's Proposition 209 ,\" a study by labor economist Zachary Bleemer published last month in The Quarterly Journal of Economics , uses data from 1994 to 2002 to shed new light on the impact of California's Proposition 209, a ban on race-based affirmative action policies that went into effect in 1998. Bleemer, a postdoctoral fellow at Opportunity Insights at Harvard University and an incoming assistant professor of economics at Yale University, told me his study \"shows that ending affirmative action had sharp negative educational and labor market ramifications for young Black and Hispanic Californians from across the distribution of academic preparation.\" Based on his computations, Bleemer observed that \"overall, Prop 209 resulted in a net outflow of lower-income students from highly selective public universities.\"\n\nFollowing the implementation of Proposition 209 in 1998, the state witnessed a 14 percent drop in underrepresented students' enrollment in California's university system. In addition, Bleemer's study also reveals that it caused a \"cascade of students to enroll at lower-quality public institutions.\" But not only that; Bleemer's study found Proposition 209 reduced the number of underrepresented minority students on college campuses in California. It also found that it had a negative impact on the earning potential of graduates of color. In short, Proposition 209 deepened economic inequality.\n\n\"I was interested in what happened when California radically reshuffled who was provided access to its selective public universities,\" Bleemer told me. The study, he explained, made it possible for him to \"track impacted students in the data - both the 'winners' and the 'losers' of the policy change - to see how their lives were changed because they were pushed or pulled into different universities.\"\n\nIn the short term, the data revealed that Black and Hispanic students did not thrive in less-selective institutions. For example, they were less likely to complete their undergraduate degrees. They also earned fewer STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) degrees and were less likely to pursue graduate study.\n\nIn the long-term, Black and Hispanic college students in California experienced less social mobility and limited earning potential; in other words: significant financial harm. Referring to underrepresented minorities, Bleemer said his study \"suggests that affirmative action both promotes socioeconomic mobility among URM youths and improves higher education's allocative efficiency.\"\n\nUniversities also faced economic repercussions. Though several schools increased their outreach to communities of color in an attempt to offset the elimination of affirmative action policies, the data show that outreach did not effectively counteract the drop in enrollment, which means those universities lost money.\n\nBleemer's findings have broad implications for the nation, suggesting as they do that banning affirmative action would negatively impact students of color and deepen the racial wealth gap. While Bleemer admits that his new study \"has little to say about the fairness of affirmative action policies,\" he emphasizes the study's \"bevy of evidence that banning affirmative action reduces both the equity and efficiency of college admissions protocols.\"\n\nIt's important that we acknowledge the significance affirmation action policies have had.\n\nBleemer's study demonstrates how affirmative action policies can help to level the playing field, expanding financial opportunities for people of color - without somehow limiting opportunities for others. \"California has at least 3 percent fewer high-earning young Black and Hispanic workers today than it would have had if it hadn't banned affirmative action,\" Bleemer said, \"and its public universities have become less efficient as a result of their rejecting so many students whose benefits from enrollment would exceed those obtained by the students who currently enroll at those schools.\"\n\nAs affirmative action and Jackson endure scrutiny, it's important that we acknowledge the significance that affirmative action policies have had and how society suffers when we miss the mark on meeting the larger goals of diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nKeisha N.

The vote was predictable, 6-3, with all the justices appointed by Republican presidents standing together to revoke the policy. The majority opinion was written by Chief Justice John Roberts himself, who ruled that affirmative action violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The 14th Amendment was, of course, written explicitly to revoke the racism practiced by whites against Blacks through their slaver's Constitution, but Roberts doesn't care about all that. His opinion attempts to capture the 14th Amendment and redeploy it to justify a white version of \"color blindness\" that just so happens to lock in a status quo that benefits whites. Subscribe to Elie Mystal's podcast, \"Contempt of Court\" Welcome to \"Contempt of Court\"! Elie Mystal Like last year's revocation of reproductive rights in Dobbs v. Jackson , the decision today, in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard University and Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina , achieves a long-standing conservative policy goal through the fiat of six unelected Supreme Court justices. Conservatives have been gunning for affirmative action since the policy was reintroduced in the 1960s (it had previously been used during Reconstruction, and conservatives killed it then too). Today is a victory for the Heritage Foundation, the Federalist Society, and the entire conservative legal establishment that has correctly identified the courts as the way to reverse policies they don't like. But the death of affirmative action was not achieved merely through the machinations of Republican lawyers. While conservatives on the Supreme Court delivered the fatal blow, the policy has long been made vulnerable by the soft bigotry of parents, whose commitment to integration and equality turns cold the moment their little cherubs fail to get into their first choice of college or university. If you want to see a white liberal drop the pretense that they care about systemic racism and injustice, just tell them that their privately tutored kid didn't get into whatever \"elite\" school they were hoping for. If you want to make an immigrant family adopt a Klansman's view of the intelligence, culture, and work ethic of Black folks, tell them that their kid's standardized test scores are not enough to guarantee entry into ivy-draped halls of power. Some of the most horribly racist claptrap folks have felt comfortable saying to my face has been said in the context of people telling me why they don't like affirmative action, or why my credentials are somehow \"unearned\" because they were \"given\" to me by affirmative action. That last bit is in some ways the most devastating: Black people are attacked and shamed simply because the policy exists, regardless of whether it benefited them or not. I've had white folks whom I could standardize-test into a goddamn coma tell me that I got into school only because of affirmative action. I once talked to a white guy-whose parents' name was on one of the buildings on campus-who asked me how it felt to know I got \"extra help\" to get in. The sheer nerve of white folks is sometimes jaw-dropping.

Then, those same people use their own racial hang-ups as an argument to get rid of affirmative action, blaming the policy for their own racist inability to regard Black colleagues as equals. There are white people who will argue with a straight face that affirmative action makes them harbor the racist idea that Black people are undeserving of their accomplishments. Related Article \"A Tragedy for Us All\": Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson's Dissent Ketanji Brown Jackson And some Black people fall for it. It will escape no one's notice that Clarence Thomas, who happens to be Black, joined the majority opinion banning affirmative action. Thomas wrote a concurring opinion to make an \"originalist\" defense of a \"color blind\" Constitution, an argument that is oxymoronic on its face given that the original Constitution was most definitely not color blind toward people who looked like Thomas. People have often expressed surprise that Thomas is so stridently against the policy, but I am here to tell you that of all of Thomas's treacherous attempts to set Black folks back to second-class status, this one is the easiest to trace. Thomas considers himself a victim of affirmative action. In his autobiography, My Grandfather's Son , Thomas says his degree from Yale Law School (Thomas graduated in 1974) was never taken seriously because of affirmative action. He recounts, painfully, how white employers didn't believe that he could be as smart as his grades indicated, because they believed that he was only there as an affirmative action admit. Current Issue View our current issue Frankly, I know the feeling. I think that any successful Black person in this country, especially one who went to a traditionally elite university, knows the feeling. I'm a well-respected legal columnist and best-selling author, and I can't go a week without some simpleton who paid eight bucks for Twitter suggesting that I didn't \"earn\" my place at Harvard Law School, an institution I graduated from 20 freaking years ago. It's maddening -both in the sense that it makes me violently angry and that it interrupts the normal functioning of my brain. If you haven't walked a mile in my shoes, or Thomas's shoes, or the shoes of any other Black person who had the temerity to be excellent while Black, you really don't know what it's like to have white people who have the intellectual firepower of a wet cigarette question your credentials. The difference between me, along with most Black folks, and Clarence Thomas is that Thomas has decided to take his hurt feelings out on one of the most effective social justice policies in American history, while most Black people just learn to step over the low-account white folks clawing at our ankles. Most Black people strive to overcome racial injustice; Thomas was broken by it. Instead of blaming the white folks doing the oppressing, Thomas has decided to ally with them and blame the policy meant to break their exclusive access to power. He's almost a tragic figure: a man who has adopted the white narrative about Black people so completely that he's curdled into a mere spokesperson for that white narrative. Again, I almost get it. I almost see where he's coming from. I remember coming home from elementary school one day and declaring to my Black and proud parents that I \"couldn't be\" Black. I had heard kids at my predominately white Catholic elementary school saying that Black people were not \"clean,\" and I explained to my parents that this made me not Black because I took a bath every day, and I didn't want to be associated with people who didn't wash. Obviously, my parents were horrified. Obviously, they pulled me out of that school the next year and put me into a predominately Black public school. Obviously, I learned that not everything white people say is true. But Thomas is the guy who never learned: He never figured out how to disregard what white people say about us. Learning how to ignore white folks and their stupid racial theories while living your full life is pretty much the final test towards emancipation, and it's one that Thomas seems to have flunked for his entire professional life. Of course, I say that Thomas is \"almost\" a tragic figure. I almost feel sorry for him. But what drains my empathy for him is the fact that I've had to read his absolutely trash legal opinions. T he astute reader will note that I haven't thus far mentioned the majority's arguments against affirmative action, and that is because their legal arguments are embarrassing. The actual cases decided today involve lawsuits brought by Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA), a group of AAPI students organized by white conservative legal gadfly Ed Blum. Blum has made it his life's work to destroy affirmative action, and in this case, he found plaintiffs eager to argue that affirmative action policies discriminate against AAPI students who don't get into elite schools despite competitive grades and standardized test scores. On the facts, Blum and SFFA are simply wrong. The district court (the finder of fact in our federal system) found that the universities do not intentionally discriminate against AAPI students-and, more specifically, that there is no evidence that affirmative action is hurting them. (I have written that I think Harvard does discriminate against AAPI applicants, but that discrimination has nothing to do with affirmative action.) What this means is the entire argument against affirmative action is based on the feelings of some students (and their parents) that they would have gotten into these schools if the schools admitted fewer Black people, but that too is a thin argument. Getting rid of affirmative action will neither require schools to admit more AAPI students nor force them to weigh so-called \"merit-based\" factors more heavily. But California saw Black and Latino enrollment plummet right after it banned affirmative action in 1998. AAPI enrollment went up a little bit, and whites seized the remaining opportunities. Of course, boosting white opportunities at the expense of Black and Latino students is what conservatives like Ed Blum want. They've just managed to convince a minority of AAPI parents that making the world easier for Varsity Blues wealthy white parents will also trickle down to their kids. The problem with this pro-white policy goal is that it's nowhere near a constitutional argument. To turn all of this helicopter-parent hysteria into a constitutional issue, the conservative majority on the Supreme Court argued that the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause prevents the use of race-conscious admissions because it discriminates against AAPI students, who are a protected class under the clause. That is why bringing the case with AAPI student stand-ins is crucial to their argument. There's no equal protection argument for being mediocre and white. There is one for being discriminated against because you're of Asian descent. Even though the court is making up the cause of that discrimination, invoking the specter of illegal racial discrimination on behalf of the AAPI community is how the white organizers of this attack are able to turn their policy preference into a constitutional argument. Affirmative Action Make No Mistake, the Supreme Court Will Kill Affirmative Action Elie Mystal For Chinese American Conservatives, Race Is a Weapon Claire Jean Kim Harvard's Thrilling-and Pyrrhic-Affirmative Action Victory Elie Mystal Roberts writes that one of the reasons affirmative action fails is because universities do not adequately distinguish between different kinds of AAPI students-for instance, between South Asians and East Asians. Having this white guy tell us that affirmative action is unconstitutional because the AAPI category is too broad is like Homer Simpson saying he doesn't go to gyms because they overwhelm him with exercise options. But this argument-that restorative race-conscious admissions are \"the real racist\"-is also a bastardization of the 14th Amendment. As Sonia Sotomayor wrote in her dissent, all Roberts is doing is using the 14th Amendment to cement inequality, the very thing it was designed to combat. She writes: \"The Court subverts the constitutional guarantee of equal protection by further entrenching racial inequality in education, the very foundation of our democratic government and pluralistic society.\" Policies like affirmative action, as I mentioned above, were first enacted in this country during Reconstruction. Any good-faith \"originalist\" argument would have to acknowledge that the authors of the 14th Amendment contemplated the use of affirmative action, and we know that because affirmative action was used in their own lifetimes, after the ratification of the amendment. B ut the conservatives did not adopt originalism for its good-faith arguments. They're not ending affirmative action to help Asian American students get into Harvard or UNC. The conservative majority is ending affirmative action because college admissions are maybe the only place in American life where being white isn't an automatic benefit to the possessor of precious white skin. That has always been affirmative action's true sin. Whiteness in this country is celebrated, protected, and centered. It's given the default position-to such an extent that even my own Black-ass self, in my Black-ass columns, will often use the term \"non-white,\" as if melanin deficiency is somehow the global standard everyone else deviates from. To have anything, anything at all, where white people aren't perceived as the primary beneficiaries of a policy or program is anathema to this country. It's so bad that scores of white people will vote against policies that benefit primarily them (health care, food stamps, drug rehabilitation programs) if they even think that too many people of color are getting in on the action. To wit, historically, the primary beneficiaries of affirmative action have been white women. Women held only 35 percent of bachelor degrees before affirmative action policies were reintroduced; now, women's enrollment in college outpaces men, and has for some time. Now, elite colleges and universities are giving men a boost in admissions considerations, because their grades and scores are not keeping pace with women's. Yet you'll note that the Supreme Court did not ban gender consciousness in college admissions. Nor did it ban legacy consciousness, wealth consciousness, geographic consciousness, or athletic consciousness. Race, and only race, is the thing the conservatives don't want colleges and universities to look at. Because race is the card white people use that never gets declined. It is their most powerful characteristic, the one through which all else is possible. Affirmative action was one of the only policies that pierced that privileged veil and made white people question whether their lives, or their kids' lives, would be better if they had been born Black. The answer was always \"no.\" (Chris Rock's old joke that nobody white would want to switch places with him has always been devastatingly true, even if some white folks pretend that it's not.) But the mere possibility that their whiteness wasn't helping them out every single second of every goddamn day drove a certain kind of white person insane. Affirmative action made them feel like perhaps the world did not revolve around their hopes and dreams and comforts, so it had to be killed. Even previous Supreme Court decisions upholding affirmative action expressed an open yearning for the day when affirmative action would no longer be \"necessary.\" The previous justices even made up fanciful future dates when the policy could be safely done away with. More From Elie Mystal In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk April 24, 2025 Did the Supreme Court Just Grow a Spine? April 22, 2025 \"Elie v. U.S.\" April 14, 2025 In his opinion, Roberts echoed these fanciful dates as a reason to end the policy. He writes, \"[Affirmative action] admissions programs also lack a 'logical end point.'\" The idea that a policy meant to combat racism must end before the racism ends has always been Roberts's special logical flaw. It's the one he used to gut the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v. Holder . Roberts wants to hang a \"Mission Accomplished\" banner and declare victory over racism, and then immediately stop all efforts to combat racism. None of that really matters now, though. The \"why\" of it is less important than the reality. Affirmative action is gone. Prestige-obsessed white parents have gotten what they wanted. Damaged Blacks who are willing to climb up a ladder and then pull it up behind them have gotten what they wanted. Students who think their intellectual \"merit\" can be captured on a multiple choice test, like well-trained dolphins who know exactly which hoops to jump through, have gotten what they wanted. Congratulations on all their success: They've put a lot of effort into giving Black students another reason to apply to Howard instead of Harvard. But I do wonder who all these people who successfully killed affirmative action will blame the next time a rejection letter comes in the mail. When they can't argue that some poor Black kid is \"taking their spot,\" where will their misdirected frustrations land? I suppose they'll still blame Black people. As long as there is one Black person at a college or university, there will be at least one white kid knocked off the wait list who will believe the Black kid had some unfair \"advantage\" that boosted their application. I guess I can take some small solace in knowing that even without affirmative action, there will still be a lot of white rejects out there who will die mad. Note: This piece has been updated to clarify that California's Black and Latino enrollment plummeted in the immediate aftermath of its 1998 ban on affirmative action.\n\nElie Mystal\n\nLike last year's revocation of reproductive rights in Dobbs v.

Conservatives have been gunning for affirmative action since the policy was reintroduced in the 1960s (it had previously been used during Reconstruction, and conservatives killed it then too). Today is a victory for the Heritage Foundation, the Federalist Society, and the entire conservative legal establishment that has correctly identified the courts as the way to reverse policies they don't like. But the death of affirmative action was not achieved merely through the machinations of Republican lawyers. While conservatives on the Supreme Court delivered the fatal blow, the policy has long been made vulnerable by the soft bigotry of parents, whose commitment to integration and equality turns cold the moment their little cherubs fail to get into their first choice of college or university. If you want to see a white liberal drop the pretense that they care about systemic racism and injustice, just tell them that their privately tutored kid didn't get into whatever \"elite\" school they were hoping for. If you want to make an immigrant family adopt a Klansman's view of the intelligence, culture, and work ethic of Black folks, tell them that their kid's standardized test scores are not enough to guarantee entry into ivy-draped halls of power. Some of the most horribly racist claptrap folks have felt comfortable saying to my face has been said in the context of people telling me why they don't like affirmative action, or why my credentials are somehow \"unearned\" because they were \"given\" to me by affirmative action. That last bit is in some ways the most devastating: Black people are attacked and shamed simply because the policy exists, regardless of whether it benefited them or not. I've had white folks whom I could standardize-test into a goddamn coma tell me that I got into school only because of affirmative action. I once talked to a white guy-whose parents' name was on one of the buildings on campus-who asked me how it felt to know I got \"extra help\" to get in. The sheer nerve of white folks is sometimes jaw-dropping.

Then, those same people use their own racial hang-ups as an argument to get rid of affirmative action, blaming the policy for their own racist inability to regard Black colleagues as equals. There are white people who will argue with a straight face that affirmative action makes them harbor the racist idea that Black people are undeserving of their accomplishments. Related Article \"A Tragedy for Us All\": Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson's Dissent Ketanji Brown Jackson And some Black people fall for it. It will escape no one's notice that Clarence Thomas, who happens to be Black, joined the majority opinion banning affirmative action. Thomas wrote a concurring opinion to make an \"originalist\" defense of a \"color blind\" Constitution, an argument that is oxymoronic on its face given that the original Constitution was most definitely not color blind toward people who looked like Thomas. People have often expressed surprise that Thomas is so stridently against the policy, but I am here to tell you that of all of Thomas's treacherous attempts to set Black folks back to second-class status, this one is the easiest to trace. Thomas considers himself a victim of affirmative action. In his autobiography, My Grandfather's Son , Thomas says his degree from Yale Law School (Thomas graduated in 1974) was never taken seriously because of affirmative action. He recounts, painfully, how white employers didn't believe that he could be as smart as his grades indicated, because they believed that he was only there as an affirmative action admit. Current Issue View our current issue Frankly, I know the feeling. I think that any successful Black person in this country, especially one who went to a traditionally elite university, knows the feeling. I'm a well-respected legal columnist and best-selling author, and I can't go a week without some simpleton who paid eight bucks for Twitter suggesting that I didn't \"earn\" my place at Harvard Law School, an institution I graduated from 20 freaking years ago. It's maddening -both in the sense that it makes me violently angry and that it interrupts the normal functioning of my brain. If you haven't walked a mile in my shoes, or Thomas's shoes, or the shoes of any other Black person who had the temerity to be excellent while Black, you really don't know what it's like to have white people who have the intellectual firepower of a wet cigarette question your credentials. The difference between me, along with most Black folks, and Clarence Thomas is that Thomas has decided to take his hurt feelings out on one of the most effective social justice policies in American history, while most Black people just learn to step over the low-account white folks clawing at our ankles. Most Black people strive to overcome racial injustice; Thomas was broken by it. Instead of blaming the white folks doing the oppressing, Thomas has decided to ally with them and blame the policy meant to break their exclusive access to power. He's almost a tragic figure: a man who has adopted the white narrative about Black people so completely that he's curdled into a mere spokesperson for that white narrative. Again, I almost get it. I almost see where he's coming from. I remember coming home from elementary school one day and declaring to my Black and proud parents that I \"couldn't be\" Black. I had heard kids at my predominately white Catholic elementary school saying that Black people were not \"clean,\" and I explained to my parents that this made me not Black because I took a bath every day, and I didn't want to be associated with people who didn't wash. Obviously, my parents were horrified. Obviously, they pulled me out of that school the next year and put me into a predominately Black public school. Obviously, I learned that not everything white people say is true. But Thomas is the guy who never learned: He never figured out how to disregard what white people say about us. Learning how to ignore white folks and their stupid racial theories while living your full life is pretty much the final test towards emancipation, and it's one that Thomas seems to have flunked for his entire professional life. Of course, I say that Thomas is \"almost\" a tragic figure. I almost feel sorry for him. But what drains my empathy for him is the fact that I've had to read his absolutely trash legal opinions. T he astute reader will note that I haven't thus far mentioned the majority's arguments against affirmative action, and that is because their legal arguments are embarrassing. The actual cases decided today involve lawsuits brought by Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA), a group of AAPI students organized by white conservative legal gadfly Ed Blum. Blum has made it his life's work to destroy affirmative action, and in this case, he found plaintiffs eager to argue that affirmative action policies discriminate against AAPI students who don't get into elite schools despite competitive grades and standardized test scores. On the facts, Blum and SFFA are simply wrong. The district court (the finder of fact in our federal system) found that the universities do not intentionally discriminate against AAPI students-and, more specifically, that there is no evidence that affirmative action is hurting them. (I have written that I think Harvard does discriminate against AAPI applicants, but that discrimination has nothing to do with affirmative action.) What this means is the entire argument against affirmative action is based on the feelings of some students (and their parents) that they would have gotten into these schools if the schools admitted fewer Black people, but that too is a thin argument. Getting rid of affirmative action will neither require schools to admit more AAPI students nor force them to weigh so-called \"merit-based\" factors more heavily. But California saw Black and Latino enrollment plummet right after it banned affirmative action in 1998. AAPI enrollment went up a little bit, and whites seized the remaining opportunities. Of course, boosting white opportunities at the expense of Black and Latino students is what conservatives like Ed Blum want. They've just managed to convince a minority of AAPI parents that making the world easier for Varsity Blues wealthy white parents will also trickle down to their kids. The problem with this pro-white policy goal is that it's nowhere near a constitutional argument. To turn all of this helicopter-parent hysteria into a constitutional issue, the conservative majority on the Supreme Court argued that the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause prevents the use of race-conscious admissions because it discriminates against AAPI students, who are a protected class under the clause. That is why bringing the case with AAPI student stand-ins is crucial to their argument. There's no equal protection argument for being mediocre and white. There is one for being discriminated against because you're of Asian descent. Even though the court is making up the cause of that discrimination, invoking the specter of illegal racial discrimination on behalf of the AAPI community is how the white organizers of this attack are able to turn their policy preference into a constitutional argument. Affirmative Action Make No Mistake, the Supreme Court Will Kill Affirmative Action Elie Mystal For Chinese American Conservatives, Race Is a Weapon Claire Jean Kim Harvard's Thrilling-and Pyrrhic-Affirmative Action Victory Elie Mystal Roberts writes that one of the reasons affirmative action fails is because universities do not adequately distinguish between different kinds of AAPI students-for instance, between South Asians and East Asians. Having this white guy tell us that affirmative action is unconstitutional because the AAPI category is too broad is like Homer Simpson saying he doesn't go to gyms because they overwhelm him with exercise options. But this argument-that restorative race-conscious admissions are \"the real racist\"-is also a bastardization of the 14th Amendment. As Sonia Sotomayor wrote in her dissent, all Roberts is doing is using the 14th Amendment to cement inequality, the very thing it was designed to combat. She writes: \"The Court subverts the constitutional guarantee of equal protection by further entrenching racial inequality in education, the very foundation of our democratic government and pluralistic society.\" Policies like affirmative action, as I mentioned above, were first enacted in this country during Reconstruction. Any good-faith \"originalist\" argument would have to acknowledge that the authors of the 14th Amendment contemplated the use of affirmative action, and we know that because affirmative action was used in their own lifetimes, after the ratification of the amendment. B ut the conservatives did not adopt originalism for its good-faith arguments. They're not ending affirmative action to help Asian American students get into Harvard or UNC. The conservative majority is ending affirmative action because college admissions are maybe the only place in American life where being white isn't an automatic benefit to the possessor of precious white skin. That has always been affirmative action's true sin. Whiteness in this country is celebrated, protected, and centered. It's given the default position-to such an extent that even my own Black-ass self, in my Black-ass columns, will often use the term \"non-white,\" as if melanin deficiency is somehow the global standard everyone else deviates from. To have anything, anything at all, where white people aren't perceived as the primary beneficiaries of a policy or program is anathema to this country. It's so bad that scores of white people will vote against policies that benefit primarily them (health care, food stamps, drug rehabilitation programs) if they even think that too many people of color are getting in on the action. To wit, historically, the primary beneficiaries of affirmative action have been white women. Women held only 35 percent of bachelor degrees before affirmative action policies were reintroduced; now, women's enrollment in college outpaces men, and has for some time. Now, elite colleges and universities are giving men a boost in admissions considerations, because their grades and scores are not keeping pace with women's. Yet you'll note that the Supreme Court did not ban gender consciousness in college admissions. Nor did it ban legacy consciousness, wealth consciousness, geographic consciousness, or athletic consciousness. Race, and only race, is the thing the conservatives don't want colleges and universities to look at. Because race is the card white people use that never gets declined. It is their most powerful characteristic, the one through which all else is possible. Affirmative action was one of the only policies that pierced that privileged veil and made white people question whether their lives, or their kids' lives, would be better if they had been born Black. The answer was always \"no.\" (Chris Rock's old joke that nobody white would want to switch places with him has always been devastatingly true, even if some white folks pretend that it's not.) But the mere possibility that their whiteness wasn't helping them out every single second of every goddamn day drove a certain kind of white person insane. Affirmative action made them feel like perhaps the world did not revolve around their hopes and dreams and comforts, so it had to be killed. Even previous Supreme Court decisions upholding affirmative action expressed an open yearning for the day when affirmative action would no longer be \"necessary.\" The previous justices even made up fanciful future dates when the policy could be safely done away with. More From Elie Mystal In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk April 24, 2025 Did the Supreme Court Just Grow a Spine? April 22, 2025 \"Elie v. U.S.\" April 14, 2025 In his opinion, Roberts echoed these fanciful dates as a reason to end the policy. He writes, \"[Affirmative action] admissions programs also lack a 'logical end point.'\" The idea that a policy meant to combat racism must end before the racism ends has always been Roberts's special logical flaw. It's the one he used to gut the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v. Holder . Roberts wants to hang a \"Mission Accomplished\" banner and declare victory over racism, and then immediately stop all efforts to combat racism. None of that really matters now, though. The \"why\" of it is less important than the reality. Affirmative action is gone. Prestige-obsessed white parents have gotten what they wanted. Damaged Blacks who are willing to climb up a ladder and then pull it up behind them have gotten what they wanted. Students who think their intellectual \"merit\" can be captured on a multiple choice test, like well-trained dolphins who know exactly which hoops to jump through, have gotten what they wanted. Congratulations on all their success: They've put a lot of effort into giving Black students another reason to apply to Howard instead of Harvard. But I do wonder who all these people who successfully killed affirmative action will blame the next time a rejection letter comes in the mail. When they can't argue that some poor Black kid is \"taking their spot,\" where will their misdirected frustrations land? I suppose they'll still blame Black people. As long as there is one Black person at a college or university, there will be at least one white kid knocked off the wait list who will believe the Black kid had some unfair \"advantage\" that boosted their application. I guess I can take some small solace in knowing that even without affirmative action, there will still be a lot of white rejects out there who will die mad.

The difference between me, along with most Black folks, and Clarence Thomas is that Thomas has decided to take his hurt feelings out on one of the most effective social justice policies in American history, while most Black people just learn to step over the low-account white folks clawing at our ankles. Most Black people strive to overcome racial injustice; Thomas was broken by it. Instead of blaming the white folks doing the oppressing, Thomas has decided to ally with them and blame the policy meant to break their exclusive access to power. He's almost a tragic figure: a man who has adopted the white narrative about Black people so completely that he's curdled into a mere spokesperson for that white narrative. Again, I almost get it. I almost see where he's coming from. I remember coming home from elementary school one day and declaring to my Black and proud parents that I \"couldn't be\" Black. I had heard kids at my predominately white Catholic elementary school saying that Black people were not \"clean,\" and I explained to my parents that this made me not Black because I took a bath every day, and I didn't want to be associated with people who didn't wash. Obviously, my parents were horrified. Obviously, they pulled me out of that school the next year and put me into a predominately Black public school. Obviously, I learned that not everything white people say is true. But Thomas is the guy who never learned: He never figured out how to disregard what white people say about us. Learning how to ignore white folks and their stupid racial theories while living your full life is pretty much the final test towards emancipation, and it's one that Thomas seems to have flunked for his entire professional life. Of course, I say that Thomas is \"almost\" a tragic figure. I almost feel sorry for him. But what drains my empathy for him is the fact that I've had to read his absolutely trash legal opinions. T he astute reader will note that I haven't thus far mentioned the majority's arguments against affirmative action, and that is because their legal arguments are embarrassing. The actual cases decided today involve lawsuits brought by Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA), a group of AAPI students organized by white conservative legal gadfly Ed Blum. Blum has made it his life's work to destroy affirmative action, and in this case, he found plaintiffs eager to argue that affirmative action policies discriminate against AAPI students who don't get into elite schools despite competitive grades and standardized test scores. On the facts, Blum and SFFA are simply wrong. The district court (the finder of fact in our federal system) found that the universities do not intentionally discriminate against AAPI students-and, more specifically, that there is no evidence that affirmative action is hurting them. (I have written that I think Harvard does discriminate against AAPI applicants, but that discrimination has nothing to do with affirmative action.) What this means is the entire argument against affirmative action is based on the feelings of some students (and their parents) that they would have gotten into these schools if the schools admitted fewer Black people, but that too is a thin argument. Getting rid of affirmative action will neither require schools to admit more AAPI students nor force them to weigh so-called \"merit-based\" factors more heavily. But California saw Black and Latino enrollment plummet right after it banned affirmative action in 1998. AAPI enrollment went up a little bit, and whites seized the remaining opportunities. Of course, boosting white opportunities at the expense of Black and Latino students is what conservatives like Ed Blum want. They've just managed to convince a minority of AAPI parents that making the world easier for Varsity Blues wealthy white parents will also trickle down to their kids. The problem with this pro-white policy goal is that it's nowhere near a constitutional argument. To turn all of this helicopter-parent hysteria into a constitutional issue, the conservative majority on the Supreme Court argued that the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause prevents the use of race-conscious admissions because it discriminates against AAPI students, who are a protected class under the clause. That is why bringing the case with AAPI student stand-ins is crucial to their argument. There's no equal protection argument for being mediocre and white. There is one for being discriminated against because you're of Asian descent. Even though the court is making up the cause of that discrimination, invoking the specter of illegal racial discrimination on behalf of the AAPI community is how the white organizers of this attack are able to turn their policy preference into a constitutional argument. Affirmative Action Make No Mistake, the Supreme Court Will Kill Affirmative Action Elie Mystal For Chinese American Conservatives, Race Is a Weapon Claire Jean Kim Harvard's Thrilling-and Pyrrhic-Affirmative Action Victory Elie Mystal Roberts writes that one of the reasons affirmative action fails is because universities do not adequately distinguish between different kinds of AAPI students-for instance, between South Asians and East Asians. Having this white guy tell us that affirmative action is unconstitutional because the AAPI category is too broad is like Homer Simpson saying he doesn't go to gyms because they overwhelm him with exercise options. But this argument-that restorative race-conscious admissions are \"the real racist\"-is also a bastardization of the 14th Amendment. As Sonia Sotomayor wrote in her dissent, all Roberts is doing is using the 14th Amendment to cement inequality, the very thing it was designed to combat. She writes: \"The Court subverts the constitutional guarantee of equal protection by further entrenching racial inequality in education, the very foundation of our democratic government and pluralistic society.\" Policies like affirmative action, as I mentioned above, were first enacted in this country during Reconstruction. Any good-faith \"originalist\" argument would have to acknowledge that the authors of the 14th Amendment contemplated the use of affirmative action, and we know that because affirmative action was used in their own lifetimes, after the ratification of the amendment. B ut the conservatives did not adopt originalism for its good-faith arguments. They're not ending affirmative action to help Asian American students get into Harvard or UNC. The conservative majority is ending affirmative action because college admissions are maybe the only place in American life where being white isn't an automatic benefit to the possessor of precious white skin. That has always been affirmative action's true sin. Whiteness in this country is celebrated, protected, and centered. It's given the default position-to such an extent that even my own Black-ass self, in my Black-ass columns, will often use the term \"non-white,\" as if melanin deficiency is somehow the global standard everyone else deviates from. To have anything, anything at all, where white people aren't perceived as the primary beneficiaries of a policy or program is anathema to this country. It's so bad that scores of white people will vote against policies that benefit primarily them (health care, food stamps, drug rehabilitation programs) if they even think that too many people of color are getting in on the action. To wit, historically, the primary beneficiaries of affirmative action have been white women. Women held only 35 percent of bachelor degrees before affirmative action policies were reintroduced; now, women's enrollment in college outpaces men, and has for some time. Now, elite colleges and universities are giving men a boost in admissions considerations, because their grades and scores are not keeping pace with women's. Yet you'll note that the Supreme Court did not ban gender consciousness in college admissions. Nor did it ban legacy consciousness, wealth consciousness, geographic consciousness, or athletic consciousness. Race, and only race, is the thing the conservatives don't want colleges and universities to look at. Because race is the card white people use that never gets declined. It is their most powerful characteristic, the one through which all else is possible. Affirmative action was one of the only policies that pierced that privileged veil and made white people question whether their lives, or their kids' lives, would be better if they had been born Black. The answer was always \"no.\" (Chris Rock's old joke that nobody white would want to switch places with him has always been devastatingly true, even if some white folks pretend that it's not.) But the mere possibility that their whiteness wasn't helping them out every single second of every goddamn day drove a certain kind of white person insane. Affirmative action made them feel like perhaps the world did not revolve around their hopes and dreams and comforts, so it had to be killed. Even previous Supreme Court decisions upholding affirmative action expressed an open yearning for the day when affirmative action would no longer be \"necessary.\" The previous justices even made up fanciful future dates when the policy could be safely done away with.

Roberts wants to hang a \"Mission Accomplished\" banner and declare victory over racism, and then immediately stop all efforts to combat racism. None of that really matters now, though.

But I do wonder who all these people who successfully killed affirmative action will blame the next time a rejection letter comes in the mail. When they can't argue that some poor Black kid is \"taking their spot,\" where will their misdirected frustrations land? I suppose they'll still blame Black people. As long as there is one Black person at a college or university, there will be at least one white kid knocked off the wait list who will believe the Black kid had some unfair \"advantage\" that boosted their application. I guess I can take some small solace in knowing that even without affirmative action, there will still be a lot of white rejects out there who will die mad.

Then, those same people use their own racial hang-ups as an argument to get rid of affirmative action, blaming the policy for their own racist inability to regard Black colleagues as equals. There are white people who will argue with a straight face that affirmative action makes them harbor the racist idea that Black people are undeserving of their accomplishments. Related Article \"A Tragedy for Us All\": Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson's Dissent Ketanji Brown Jackson And some Black people fall for it. It will escape no one's notice that Clarence Thomas, who happens to be Black, joined the majority opinion banning affirmative action. Thomas wrote a concurring opinion to make an \"originalist\" defense of a \"color blind\" Constitution, an argument that is oxymoronic on its face given that the original Constitution was most definitely not color blind toward people who looked like Thomas. People have often expressed surprise that Thomas is so stridently against the policy, but I am here to tell you that of all of Thomas's treacherous attempts to set Black folks back to second-class status, this one is the easiest to trace. Thomas considers himself a victim of affirmative action. In his autobiography, My Grandfather's Son , Thomas says his degree from Yale Law School (Thomas graduated in 1974) was never taken seriously because of affirmative action. He recounts, painfully, how white employers didn't believe that he could be as smart as his grades indicated, because they believed that he was only there as an affirmative action admit.

Students who think their intellectual \"merit\" can be captured on a multiple choice test, like well-trained dolphins who know exactly which hoops to jump through, have gotten what they wanted. Congratulations on all their success: They've put a lot of effort into giving Black students another reason to apply to Howard instead of Harvard. But I do wonder who all these people who successfully killed affirmative action will blame the next time a rejection letter comes in the mail. When they can't argue that some poor Black kid is \"taking their spot,\" where will their misdirected frustrations land? I suppose they'll still blame Black people. As long as there is one Black person at a college or university, there will be at least one white kid knocked off the wait list who will believe the Black kid had some unfair \"advantage\" that boosted their application. I guess I can take some small solace in knowing that even without affirmative action, there will still be a lot of white rejects out there who will die mad. Note: This piece has been updated to clarify that California's Black and Latino enrollment plummeted in the immediate aftermath of its 1998 ban on affirmative action.\n\nPeople have often expressed surprise that Thomas is so stridently against the policy, but I am here to tell you that of all of Thomas's treacherous attempts to set Black folks back to second-class status, this one is the easiest to trace. Thomas considers himself a victim of affirmative action. In his autobiography, My Grandfather's Son , Thomas says his degree from Yale Law School (Thomas graduated in 1974) was never taken seriously because of affirmative action. He recounts, painfully, how white employers didn't believe that he could be as smart as his grades indicated, because they believed that he was only there as an affirmative action admit. Current Issue View our current issue Frankly, I know the feeling. I think that any successful Black person in this country, especially one who went to a traditionally elite university, knows the feeling. I'm a well-respected legal columnist and best-selling author, and I can't go a week without some simpleton who paid eight bucks for Twitter suggesting that I didn't \"earn\" my place at Harvard Law School, an institution I graduated from 20 freaking years ago. It's maddening -both in the sense that it makes me violently angry and that it interrupts the normal functioning of my brain. If you haven't walked a mile in my shoes, or Thomas's shoes, or the shoes of any other Black person who had the temerity to be excellent while Black, you really don't know what it's like to have white people who have the intellectual firepower of a wet cigarette question your credentials. The difference between me, along with most Black folks, and Clarence Thomas is that Thomas has decided to take his hurt feelings out on one of the most effective social justice policies in American history, while most Black people just learn to step over the low-account white folks clawing at our ankles. Most Black people strive to overcome racial injustice; Thomas was broken by it. Instead of blaming the white folks doing the oppressing, Thomas has decided to ally with them and blame the policy meant to break their exclusive access to power. He's almost a tragic figure: a man who has adopted the white narrative about Black people so completely that he's curdled into a mere spokesperson for that white narrative. Again, I almost get it. I almost see where he's coming from. I remember coming home from elementary school one day and declaring to my Black and proud parents that I \"couldn't be\" Black. I had heard kids at my predominately white Catholic elementary school saying that Black people were not \"clean,\" and I explained to my parents that this made me not Black because I took a bath every day, and I didn't want to be associated with people who didn't wash. Obviously, my parents were horrified. Obviously, they pulled me out of that school the next year and put me into a predominately Black public school. Obviously, I learned that not everything white people say is true. But Thomas is the guy who never learned: He never figured out how to disregard what white people say about us. Learning how to ignore white folks and their stupid racial theories while living your full life is pretty much the final test towards emancipation, and it's one that Thomas seems to have flunked for his entire professional life. Of course, I say that Thomas is \"almost\" a tragic figure. I almost feel sorry for him. But what drains my empathy for him is the fact that I've had to read his absolutely trash legal opinions. T he astute reader will note that I haven't thus far mentioned the majority's arguments against affirmative action, and that is because their legal arguments are embarrassing. The actual cases decided today involve lawsuits brought by Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA), a group of AAPI students organized by white conservative legal gadfly Ed Blum. Blum has made it his life's work to destroy affirmative action, and in this case, he found plaintiffs eager to argue that affirmative action policies discriminate against AAPI students who don't get into elite schools despite competitive grades and standardized test scores. On the facts, Blum and SFFA are simply wrong. The district court (the finder of fact in our federal system) found that the universities do not intentionally discriminate against AAPI students-and, more specifically, that there is no evidence that affirmative action is hurting them. (I have written that I think Harvard does discriminate against AAPI applicants, but that discrimination has nothing to do with affirmative action.) What this means is the entire argument against affirmative action is based on the feelings of some students (and their parents) that they would have gotten into these schools if the schools admitted fewer Black people, but that too is a thin argument. Getting rid of affirmative action will neither require schools to admit more AAPI students nor force them to weigh so-called \"merit-based\" factors more heavily. But California saw Black and Latino enrollment plummet right after it banned affirmative action in 1998. AAPI enrollment went up a little bit, and whites seized the remaining opportunities. Of course, boosting white opportunities at the expense of Black and Latino students is what conservatives like Ed Blum want. They've just managed to convince a minority of AAPI parents that making the world easier for Varsity Blues wealthy white parents will also trickle down to their kids. The problem with this pro-white policy goal is that it's nowhere near a constitutional argument. To turn all of this helicopter-parent hysteria into a constitutional issue, the conservative majority on the Supreme Court argued that the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause prevents the use of race-conscious admissions because it discriminates against AAPI students, who are a protected class under the clause. That is why bringing the case with AAPI student stand-ins is crucial to their argument. There's no equal protection argument for being mediocre and white. There is one for being discriminated against because you're of Asian descent. Even though the court is making up the cause of that discrimination, invoking the specter of illegal racial discrimination on behalf of the AAPI community is how the white organizers of this attack are able to turn their policy preference into a constitutional argument. Affirmative Action Make No Mistake, the Supreme Court Will Kill Affirmative Action Elie Mystal For Chinese American Conservatives, Race Is a Weapon Claire Jean Kim Harvard's Thrilling-and Pyrrhic-Affirmative Action Victory Elie Mystal Roberts writes that one of the reasons affirmative action fails is because universities do not adequately distinguish between different kinds of AAPI students-for instance, between South Asians and East Asians. Having this white guy tell us that affirmative action is unconstitutional because the AAPI category is too broad is like Homer Simpson saying he doesn't go to gyms because they overwhelm him with exercise options. But this argument-that restorative race-conscious admissions are \"the real racist\"-is also a bastardization of the 14th Amendment. As Sonia Sotomayor wrote in her dissent, all Roberts is doing is using the 14th Amendment to cement inequality, the very thing it was designed to combat. She writes: \"The Court subverts the constitutional guarantee of equal protection by further entrenching racial inequality in education, the very foundation of our democratic government and pluralistic society.\" Policies like affirmative action, as I mentioned above, were first enacted in this country during Reconstruction. Any good-faith \"originalist\" argument would have to acknowledge that the authors of the 14th Amendment contemplated the use of affirmative action, and we know that because affirmative action was used in their own lifetimes, after the ratification of the amendment. B ut the conservatives did not adopt originalism for its good-faith arguments. They're not ending affirmative action to help Asian American students get into Harvard or UNC. The conservative majority is ending affirmative action because college admissions are maybe the only place in American life where being white isn't an automatic benefit to the possessor of precious white skin. That has always been affirmative action's true sin. Whiteness in this country is celebrated, protected, and centered. It's given the default position-to such an extent that even my own Black-ass self, in my Black-ass columns, will often use the term \"non-white,\" as if melanin deficiency is somehow the global standard everyone else deviates from. To have anything, anything at all, where white people aren't perceived as the primary beneficiaries of a policy or program is anathema to this country. It's so bad that scores of white people will vote against policies that benefit primarily them (health care, food stamps, drug rehabilitation programs) if they even think that too many people of color are getting in on the action. To wit, historically, the primary beneficiaries of affirmative action have been white women. Women held only 35 percent of bachelor degrees before affirmative action policies were reintroduced; now, women's enrollment in college outpaces men, and has for some time. Now, elite colleges and universities are giving men a boost in admissions considerations, because their grades and scores are not keeping pace with women's. Yet you'll note that the Supreme Court did not ban gender consciousness in college admissions. Nor did it ban legacy consciousness, wealth consciousness, geographic consciousness, or athletic consciousness. Race, and only race, is the thing the conservatives don't want colleges and universities to look at. Because race is the card white people use that never gets declined. It is their most powerful characteristic, the one through which all else is possible. Affirmative action was one of the only policies that pierced that privileged veil and made white people question whether their lives, or their kids' lives, would be better if they had been born Black. The answer was always \"no.\" (Chris Rock's old joke that nobody white would want to switch places with him has always been devastatingly true, even if some white folks pretend that it's not.) But the mere possibility that their whiteness wasn't helping them out every single second of every goddamn day drove a certain kind of white person insane. Affirmative action made them feel like perhaps the world did not revolve around their hopes and dreams and comforts, so it had to be killed. Even previous Supreme Court decisions upholding affirmative action expressed an open yearning for the day when affirmative action would no longer be \"necessary.\" The previous justices even made up fanciful future dates when the policy could be safely done away with.

He writes, \"[Affirmative action] admissions programs also lack a 'logical end point.'\" The idea that a policy meant to combat racism must end before the racism ends has always been Roberts's special logical flaw. It's the one he used to gut the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v. Holder . Roberts wants to hang a \"Mission Accomplished\" banner and declare victory over racism, and then immediately stop all efforts to combat racism. None of that really matters now, though.

I had heard kids at my predominately white Catholic elementary school saying that Black people were not \"clean,\" and I explained to my parents that this made me not Black because I took a bath every day, and I didn't want to be associated with people who didn't wash. Obviously, my parents were horrified. Obviously, they pulled me out of that school the next year and put me into a predominately Black public school. Obviously, I learned that not everything white people say is true. But Thomas is the guy who never learned: He never figured out how to disregard what white people say about us. Learning how to ignore white folks and their stupid racial theories while living your full life is pretty much the final test towards emancipation, and it's one that Thomas seems to have flunked for his entire professional life. Of course, I say that Thomas is \"almost\" a tragic figure. I almost feel sorry for him. But what drains my empathy for him is the fact that I've had to read his absolutely trash legal opinions. T he astute reader will note that I haven't thus far mentioned the majority's arguments against affirmative action, and that is because their legal arguments are embarrassing. The actual cases decided today involve lawsuits brought by Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA), a group of AAPI students organized by white conservative legal gadfly Ed Blum. Blum has made it his life's work to destroy affirmative action, and in this case, he found plaintiffs eager to argue that affirmative action policies discriminate against AAPI students who don't get into elite schools despite competitive grades and standardized test scores. On the facts, Blum and SFFA are simply wrong. The district court (the finder of fact in our federal system) found that the universities do not intentionally discriminate against AAPI students-and, more specifically, that there is no evidence that affirmative action is hurting them. (I have written that I think Harvard does discriminate against AAPI applicants, but that discrimination has nothing to do with affirmative action.) What this means is the entire argument against affirmative action is based on the feelings of some students (and their parents) that they would have gotten into these schools if the schools admitted fewer Black people, but that too is a thin argument. Getting rid of affirmative action will neither require schools to admit more AAPI students nor force them to weigh so-called \"merit-based\" factors more heavily. But California saw Black and Latino enrollment plummet right after it banned affirmative action in 1998. AAPI enrollment went up a little bit, and whites seized the remaining opportunities. Of course, boosting white opportunities at the expense of Black and Latino students is what conservatives like Ed Blum want. They've just managed to convince a minority of AAPI parents that making the world easier for Varsity Blues wealthy white parents will also trickle down to their kids. The problem with this pro-white policy goal is that it's nowhere near a constitutional argument. To turn all of this helicopter-parent hysteria into a constitutional issue, the conservative majority on the Supreme Court argued that the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause prevents the use of race-conscious admissions because it discriminates against AAPI students, who are a protected class under the clause. That is why bringing the case with AAPI student stand-ins is crucial to their argument. There's no equal protection argument for being mediocre and white. There is one for being discriminated against because you're of Asian descent. Even though the court is making up the cause of that discrimination, invoking the specter of illegal racial discrimination on behalf of the AAPI community is how the white organizers of this attack are able to turn their policy preference into a constitutional argument. Affirmative Action Make No Mistake, the Supreme Court Will Kill Affirmative Action Elie Mystal For Chinese American Conservatives, Race Is a Weapon Claire Jean Kim Harvard's Thrilling-and Pyrrhic-Affirmative Action Victory Elie Mystal Roberts writes that one of the reasons affirmative action fails is because universities do not adequately distinguish between different kinds of AAPI students-for instance, between South Asians and East Asians. Having this white guy tell us that affirmative action is unconstitutional because the AAPI category is too broad is like Homer Simpson saying he doesn't go to gyms because they overwhelm him with exercise options. But this argument-that restorative race-conscious admissions are \"the real racist\"-is also a bastardization of the 14th Amendment. As Sonia Sotomayor wrote in her dissent, all Roberts is doing is using the 14th Amendment to cement inequality, the very thing it was designed to combat. She writes: \"The Court subverts the constitutional guarantee of equal protection by further entrenching racial inequality in education, the very foundation of our democratic government and pluralistic society.\" Policies like affirmative action, as I mentioned above, were first enacted in this country during Reconstruction. Any good-faith \"originalist\" argument would have to acknowledge that the authors of the 14th Amendment contemplated the use of affirmative action, and we know that because affirmative action was used in their own lifetimes, after the ratification of the amendment. B ut the conservatives did not adopt originalism for its good-faith arguments. They're not ending affirmative action to help Asian American students get into Harvard or UNC. The conservative majority is ending affirmative action because college admissions are maybe the only place in American life where being white isn't an automatic benefit to the possessor of precious white skin. That has always been affirmative action's true sin. Whiteness in this country is celebrated, protected, and centered. It's given the default position-to such an extent that even my own Black-ass self, in my Black-ass columns, will often use the term \"non-white,\" as if melanin deficiency is somehow the global standard everyone else deviates from. To have anything, anything at all, where white people aren't perceived as the primary beneficiaries of a policy or program is anathema to this country. It's so bad that scores of white people will vote against policies that benefit primarily them (health care, food stamps, drug rehabilitation programs) if they even think that too many people of color are getting in on the action. To wit, historically, the primary beneficiaries of affirmative action have been white women. Women held only 35 percent of bachelor degrees before affirmative action policies were reintroduced; now, women's enrollment in college outpaces men, and has for some time. Now, elite colleges and universities are giving men a boost in admissions considerations, because their grades and scores are not keeping pace with women's. Yet you'll note that the Supreme Court did not ban gender consciousness in college admissions. Nor did it ban legacy consciousness, wealth consciousness, geographic consciousness, or athletic consciousness. Race, and only race, is the thing the conservatives don't want colleges and universities to look at. Because race is the card white people use that never gets declined. It is their most powerful characteristic, the one through which all else is possible. Affirmative action was one of the only policies that pierced that privileged veil and made white people question whether their lives, or their kids' lives, would be better if they had been born Black. The answer was always \"no.\" (Chris Rock's old joke that nobody white would want to switch places with him has always been devastatingly true, even if some white folks pretend that it's not.) But the mere possibility that their whiteness wasn't helping them out every single second of every goddamn day drove a certain kind of white person insane. Affirmative action made them feel like perhaps the world did not revolve around their hopes and dreams and comforts, so it had to be killed. Even previous Supreme Court decisions upholding affirmative action expressed an open yearning for the day when affirmative action would no longer be \"necessary.\" The previous justices even made up fanciful future dates when the policy could be safely done away with.

It's the one he used to gut the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v. Holder . Roberts wants to hang a \"Mission Accomplished\" banner and declare victory over racism, and then immediately stop all efforts to combat racism. None of that really matters now, though. The \"why\" of it is less important than the reality. Affirmative action is gone. Prestige-obsessed white parents have gotten what they wanted. Damaged Blacks who are willing to climb up a ladder and then pull it up behind them have gotten what they wanted. Students who think their intellectual \"merit\" can be captured on a multiple choice test, like well-trained dolphins who know exactly which hoops to jump through, have gotten what they wanted. Congratulations on all their success: They've put a lot of effort into giving Black students another reason to apply to Howard instead of Harvard. But I do wonder who all these people who successfully killed affirmative action will blame the next time a rejection letter comes in the mail. When they can't argue that some poor Black kid is \"taking their spot,\" where will their misdirected frustrations land? I suppose they'll still blame Black people. As long as there is one Black person at a college or university, there will be at least one white kid knocked off the wait list who will believe the Black kid had some unfair \"advantage\" that boosted their application.

As long as there is one Black person at a college or university, there will be at least one white kid knocked off the wait list who will believe the Black kid had some unfair \"advantage\" that boosted their application. I guess I can take some small solace in knowing that even without affirmative action, there will still be a lot of white rejects out there who will die mad. Note: This piece has been updated to clarify that California's Black and Latino enrollment plummeted in the immediate aftermath of its 1998 ban on affirmative action.\n\nOn the facts, Blum and SFFA are simply wrong. The district court (the finder of fact in our federal system) found that the universities do not intentionally discriminate against AAPI students-and, more specifically, that there is no evidence that affirmative action is hurting them. (I have written that I think Harvard does discriminate against AAPI applicants, but that discrimination has nothing to do with affirmative action.) What this means is the entire argument against affirmative action is based on the feelings of some students (and their parents) that they would have gotten into these schools if the schools admitted fewer Black people, but that too is a thin argument. Getting rid of affirmative action will neither require schools to admit more AAPI students nor force them to weigh so-called \"merit-based\" factors more heavily. But California saw Black and Latino enrollment plummet right after it banned affirmative action in 1998. AAPI enrollment went up a little bit, and whites seized the remaining opportunities. Of course, boosting white opportunities at the expense of Black and Latino students is what conservatives like Ed Blum want. They've just managed to convince a minority of AAPI parents that making the world easier for Varsity Blues wealthy white parents will also trickle down to their kids. The problem with this pro-white policy goal is that it's nowhere near a constitutional argument. To turn all of this helicopter-parent hysteria into a constitutional issue, the conservative majority on the Supreme Court argued that the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause prevents the use of race-conscious admissions because it discriminates against AAPI students, who are a protected class under the clause. That is why bringing the case with AAPI student stand-ins is crucial to their argument. There's no equal protection argument for being mediocre and white. There is one for being discriminated against because you're of Asian descent. Even though the court is making up the cause of that discrimination, invoking the specter of illegal racial discrimination on behalf of the AAPI community is how the white organizers of this attack are able to turn their policy preference into a constitutional argument. Affirmative Action Make No Mistake, the Supreme Court Will Kill Affirmative Action Elie Mystal For Chinese American Conservatives, Race Is a Weapon Claire Jean Kim Harvard's Thrilling-and Pyrrhic-Affirmative Action Victory Elie Mystal Roberts writes that one of the reasons affirmative action fails is because universities do not adequately distinguish between different kinds of AAPI students-for instance, between South Asians and East Asians. Having this white guy tell us that affirmative action is unconstitutional because the AAPI category is too broad is like Homer Simpson saying he doesn't go to gyms because they overwhelm him with exercise options. But this argument-that restorative race-conscious admissions are \"the real racist\"-is also a bastardization of the 14th Amendment. As Sonia Sotomayor wrote in her dissent, all Roberts is doing is using the 14th Amendment to cement inequality, the very thing it was designed to combat. She writes: \"The Court subverts the constitutional guarantee of equal protection by further entrenching racial inequality in education, the very foundation of our democratic government and pluralistic society.\" Policies like affirmative action, as I mentioned above, were first enacted in this country during Reconstruction. Any good-faith \"originalist\" argument would have to acknowledge that the authors of the 14th Amendment contemplated the use of affirmative action, and we know that because affirmative action was used in their own lifetimes, after the ratification of the amendment. B ut the conservatives did not adopt originalism for its good-faith arguments. They're not ending affirmative action to help Asian American students get into Harvard or UNC. The conservative majority is ending affirmative action because college admissions are maybe the only place in American life where being white isn't an automatic benefit to the possessor of precious white skin. That has always been affirmative action's true sin. Whiteness in this country is celebrated, protected, and centered. It's given the default position-to such an extent that even my own Black-ass self, in my Black-ass columns, will often use the term \"non-white,\" as if melanin deficiency is somehow the global standard everyone else deviates from. To have anything, anything at all, where white people aren't perceived as the primary beneficiaries of a policy or program is anathema to this country. It's so bad that scores of white people will vote against policies that benefit primarily them (health care, food stamps, drug rehabilitation programs) if they even think that too many people of color are getting in on the action. To wit, historically, the primary beneficiaries of affirmative action have been white women. Women held only 35 percent of bachelor degrees before affirmative action policies were reintroduced; now, women's enrollment in college outpaces men, and has for some time. Now, elite colleges and universities are giving men a boost in admissions considerations, because their grades and scores are not keeping pace with women's. Yet you'll note that the Supreme Court did not ban gender consciousness in college admissions. Nor did it ban legacy consciousness, wealth consciousness, geographic consciousness, or athletic consciousness. Race, and only race, is the thing the conservatives don't want colleges and universities to look at. Because race is the card white people use that never gets declined. It is their most powerful characteristic, the one through which all else is possible. Affirmative action was one of the only policies that pierced that privileged veil and made white people question whether their lives, or their kids' lives, would be better if they had been born Black. The answer was always \"no.\" (Chris Rock's old joke that nobody white would want to switch places with him has always been devastatingly true, even if some white folks pretend that it's not.) But the mere possibility that their whiteness wasn't helping them out every single second of every goddamn day drove a certain kind of white person insane. Affirmative action made them feel like perhaps the world did not revolve around their hopes and dreams and comforts, so it had to be killed. Even previous Supreme Court decisions upholding affirmative action expressed an open yearning for the day when affirmative action would no longer be \"necessary.\" The previous justices even made up fanciful future dates when the policy could be safely done away with.

It's given the default position-to such an extent that even my own Black-ass self, in my Black-ass columns, will often use the term \"non-white,\" as if melanin deficiency is somehow the global standard everyone else deviates from. To have anything, anything at all, where white people aren't perceived as the primary beneficiaries of a policy or program is anathema to this country. It's so bad that scores of white people will vote against policies that benefit primarily them (health care, food stamps, drug rehabilitation programs) if they even think that too many people of color are getting in on the action. To wit, historically, the primary beneficiaries of affirmative action have been white women. Women held only 35 percent of bachelor degrees before affirmative action policies were reintroduced; now, women's enrollment in college outpaces men, and has for some time. Now, elite colleges and universities are giving men a boost in admissions considerations, because their grades and scores are not keeping pace with women's. Yet you'll note that the Supreme Court did not ban gender consciousness in college admissions. Nor did it ban legacy consciousness, wealth consciousness, geographic consciousness, or athletic consciousness. Race, and only race, is the thing the conservatives don't want colleges and universities to look at. Because race is the card white people use that never gets declined. It is their most powerful characteristic, the one through which all else is possible. Affirmative action was one of the only policies that pierced that privileged veil and made white people question whether their lives, or their kids' lives, would be better if they had been born Black. The answer was always \"no.\" (Chris Rock's old joke that nobody white would want to switch places with him has always been devastatingly true, even if some white folks pretend that it's not.) But the mere possibility that their whiteness wasn't helping them out every single second of every goddamn day drove a certain kind of white person insane. Affirmative action made them feel like perhaps the world did not revolve around their hopes and dreams and comforts, so it had to be killed. Even previous Supreme Court decisions upholding affirmative action expressed an open yearning for the day when affirmative action would no longer be \"necessary.\" The previous justices even made up fanciful future dates when the policy could be safely done away with. More From Elie Mystal In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk April 24, 2025 Did the Supreme Court Just Grow a Spine? April 22, 2025 \"Elie v. U.S.\" April 14, 2025 In his opinion, Roberts echoed these fanciful dates as a reason to end the policy. He writes, \"[Affirmative action] admissions programs also lack a 'logical end point.'\" The idea that a policy meant to combat racism must end before the racism ends has always been Roberts's special logical flaw. It's the one he used to gut the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v. Holder . Roberts wants to hang a \"Mission Accomplished\" banner and declare victory over racism, and then immediately stop all efforts to combat racism. None of that really matters now, though. The \"why\" of it is less important than the reality. Affirmative action is gone. Prestige-obsessed white parents have gotten what they wanted. Damaged Blacks who are willing to climb up a ladder and then pull it up behind them have gotten what they wanted. Students who think their intellectual \"merit\" can be captured on a multiple choice test, like well-trained dolphins who know exactly which hoops to jump through, have gotten what they wanted. Congratulations on all their success: They've put a lot of effort into giving Black students another reason to apply to Howard instead of Harvard. But I do wonder who all these people who successfully killed affirmative action will blame the next time a rejection letter comes in the mail. When they can't argue that some poor Black kid is \"taking their spot,\" where will their misdirected frustrations land? I suppose they'll still blame Black people. As long as there is one Black person at a college or university, there will be at least one white kid knocked off the wait list who will believe the Black kid had some unfair \"advantage\" that boosted their application. I guess I can take some small solace in knowing that even without affirmative action, there will still be a lot of white rejects out there who will die mad.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

But as a limited measure in the fight against discrimination, it has never been either.\n\nWhat does the US Supreme Court's ruling against affirmative action in college admissions have in common with proposals for eliminating the \"racial wealth gap\"? Neither will have any impact whatsoever on the lives and material circumstances of the vast majority of Black Americans. It's little wonder, then, that the group that cares most passionately about both is the upper middle class. Why do they care so much? Because neither is even supposed to have any impact on the lives and material circumstances of the vast majority of Black Americans. Wealth and income differentiation have increased greatly among Black Americans since 1967, when the percentage earning the equivalent of $150,000 a year or more was negligible. By 2018, 7 percent of Black Americans earned more than $150,000. Similarly, more than three-quarters of so-called Black wealth is held by the richest 10 percent of Black people. Over the course of a half-century of widening national inequality, the goal of affirmative action has not been to combat that inequality but to diversify its beneficiaries.

President and Fellows of Harvard College and Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. University of North Carolina and have not followed the cases closely. I've long supported affirmative action, even as I've long understood that its interventions might produce only narrow forms of egalitarianism. At its core, affirmative action is a technique in the implementation of antidiscrimination law, based on an understanding that overt prejudice is too limited a standard for identifying redressable discrimination. It was a recognition of that limitation that underlay early notions of institutional racism. Affirmative action was not, historically, a product of Black activists operating in their own interests. The term first appeared in a provision of the 1935 National Labor Relations Act that directed employers to redress discrimination against union organizers . President John F. Kennedy echoed the terminology in Executive Order 10925, issued in 1961, which required government contractors to \"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\" President Lyndon B. Johnson used the same language in Executive Order 11246, on Equal Employment Opportunity enforcement, issued in 1965, and had articulated the notion more extensively three months earlier in his Howard University commencement address. The sociologist Frank Dobbin has examined affirmative action's roots in the private sector, as well, tracing its growth as a pragmatic policy in corporate human resources departments, rather than as the spread of radical egalitarian social theories. It is the right that is responsible for much of the attempt to elevate affirmative action to the level of high moral principle, like so many of its bogus misdirection campaigns. Ideologues have denounced affirmative action with a lofty rhetoric of \"colorblind ideals\" or \"merit,\" shifting attention away from the prosaic fact that it is a technique of antidiscrimination enforcement. Anti-egalitarians have a long history of concocting formalist \"principles,\" whether by advocacy or denunciation, to perfume their ugly and ultimately anti-popular political agendas. This was at play during the good cop/bad cop choreography that Southern elected officials crafted in their campaign of \"Massive Resistance\" to the Brown v. Board of Education decision that outlawed school segregation. The good cops contended that they were not so much opposed to desegregation as they were concerned with defending the hallowed principle of \"states' rights.\" I still recall North Carolina Senator Sam Ervin passionately playing the good-cop role, styling himself as a constitutional \"strict constructionist,\" which later became the basis for his rise to folk-hero status as a \"country lawyer\" protector of the Constitution during the Watergate hearings-not to mention his 1977 American Express commercial. In the years since its implementation, affirmative action has been a useful instrument in the enforcement of antidiscrimination law. In the 1970s, it significantly informed efforts to open access for nonwhites and women in occupations and job categories-notably in police departments, fire departments, and air traffic control, in part because all are in the public sector-from which those groups had previously been largely excluded. Perhaps its most important victory came in the Supreme Court's 1971 Griggs v. Duke Power ruling, which mandated that only tests related to actual job performance can be used to screen job applicants. (Those who have plowed through Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray's odious racist tract The Bell Curve will recall that Griggs was its main practical target.) As Dobbin shows in his book Inventing Equal Opportunity , the greatest evidence of affirmative action's success is its routine incorporation into human resources management practices. That success also underscores its key limitation. As an instrument of antidiscrimination enforcement, affirmative action is not equipped to address broader economic inequality, which has steadily intensified throughout American society since the 1970s across race, gender, and sexual orientation . The court's 1978 ruling in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke shifted affirmative action's justification from combating inequality to the pursuit of \"diversity.\" This provided a workaround to address the complaint that affirmative action constituted \"reverse discrimination,\" but an unintended effect was to obscure its inadequacy as a remedy to rising poverty and the increasing concentration of wealth. Equal opportunity in a diverse society is an unobjectionable ideal. However, within a regime of ever greater economic polarization, in the absence of a vigorous commitment to egalitarian economic redistribution, the pursuit of equal opportunity has come to center on facilitating access to the upper reaches of wealth, status, and power for individuals held to embody previously underrepresented groups. Technically, this is as defensible a standard of equality as any other. In practice, however, it depends on a mystified, essentialist understanding of the relation between individual and nominal group: That Kamala Harris is vice president does little for any Black woman not named Kamala Harris. Diversifying the upper class can be an ideal only for a \"left\" that is totally embedded within neoliberalism.

Harvard , the case banning race consciousness in college admissions, is facially unenforceable. That's an underreported aspect of Chief Justice John Roberts's gobbledygook ruling, mainly because most of the white people doing the reporting have adopted the gospel of \"race-neutral\" and \"color blindness\" without giving those concepts a whole lot of critical thought. But humans cannot retroactively make themselves unaware of race. People cannot un -conscious themselves, and ordering them to not think about race just ensures that they will. (In her dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson called it a \"classic pink-elephant paradox.\") The court expects college admissions officers to know about the race of their applicants, and not care, but there's really not going to be any way to tell if colleges are disregarding the precise bit of information the court wants them to. 1 As a result, the real upshot of the affirmative action ruling is this: Colleges and universities must now punish Black applicants by decreasing the enrollment of Black students, by any means necessary. That's because the only way universities can show compliance with Roberts's new rules is to show that they've decreased the number of Black kids they let into school. Anything less than that will likely trigger litigation from the white supremacists who have already promised to hunt down schools that admit too many Black people, as determined by their own white-makes-right accounting system. 2 This intended revival of segregationist educational opportunities flows directly from the sheer hubris of Roberts's attempt to legislate how admissions officers think, along with his open threats to universities that do not comply with his version of thought-policing. In his decision, Roberts expects that colleges and universities will be responsible for self-enforcing his ruling, but he also warns them that additional litigation will be coming their way if they try a work-around to achieve racial diversity in their classes. Again, the white media has made a big deal about the part of Roberts's ruling where he says that colleges can still consider how race has affected an applicant (for instance, as described in a college essay), but they've ignored the last lines of his ruling where he specifically threatens schools that use those very essays to achieve racial diversity. 3 Roberts writes: 4 But, despite the dissent's assertion to the contrary, universities may not simply establish through application essays or other means the regime we hold unlawful today.... \"[W]hat cannot be done directly cannot be done indirectly. The Constitution deals with substance, not shadows,\" and the prohibition against racial discrimination is \"levelled at the thing, not the name.\"...

First of all, I don't recall anyone appointing him as the chief judge for how Black people are supposed to overcome racial discrimination. Second, I'd argue that college admissions officers should pay special attention to applicants who didn't fully overcome the hurdles white people put in their way, but might do so in the future. And third, Roberts's paean to model minorities is still a white man's wishes disguised as a legal remedy: How in the hell will Roberts know if some essay reader saw \"courage and determination\" in an applicant? How can Roberts possibly know what constitutes a unique contribution to a university, and how can Roberts place himself in a position to second-guess what the admissions officers on the ground think are worthwhile contributions? 7 Current Issue View our current issue Most important of all, how can Roberts, or anybody else, know if universities are following his rules? Roberts doesn't tell us outright, but he sure drops a powerful hint. In his decision, he effectively accuses Harvard of using a backdoor quota system to maintain a consistent rate of Black students. He writes: \"For the admitted classes [at Harvard] of 2009 to 2018, black students represented a tight band of 10.0%-11.7% of the admitted pool.\" He adds in a footnote: \"Harvard must use precise racial preferences year in and year out to maintain the unyielding demographic composition of its class.\" 8 Even if you think Roberts is right (and I'll point out that Roberts offered no evidence that Harvard \"must\" be using precise racial preferences to achieve this kind of diversity, nor did the trial court, whose presentation of facts was what Roberts was supposed to be bound by, instead of his own conglomeration of fact-free inferences), how will a school like Harvard prove, to Roberts's satisfaction, that it is not using racial preferences in the future? 9 The answer: Only a decrease in Black enrollment is likely to satisfy Roberts. If Harvard maintains its class diversity, Roberts will accuse it of using racial preferences. If Harvard increases Black enrollment, Roberts will accuse it of using newly unconstitutional race-consciousness to promote Black applicants- beyond historical levels , he'll likely say. Only a decrease in Black enrollment will satisfy Roberts's unworkable standard of ignoring race. It doesn't actually matter how Harvard goes about putting together its class: If this doesn't produce Roberts's desired outcome of decreasing Black enrollment, Roberts will accuse it of thinking about race. 10 Of course, Roberts doesn't say by how much universities will have to decrease their Black enrollment to satisfy his new legal requirements. If he had, white media might actually have reported on this aspect of his ruling. Instead, Roberts can almost certainly rely on the efforts of outsourced goons to keep an eye on universities and sue them if too many Black kids get in. One goon squad leader in particular, Trump political adviser Stephen Miller, has already volunteered to do this work, and has basically said the quiet part aloud. 11 Miller is currently the head of some accursed nonprofit called \"America First Legal,\" and shortly after the ruling he released a video in which he explained that his organization sent threatening letters to 200 law schools. In the video, Miller said: \"If they tried to violate, circumvent or bypass, subvert or otherwise program around that ruling, we are going to take them to court. We are going to hold them to account.\" In the letter to Harvard Law School Dean John Manning, Miller warned him of \"the consequences that you and your institution will face if you fail to comply with or attempt to circumvent the Court's ruling.\" 12 Related Articles \"A Tragedy for Us All\": Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson's Dissent Ketanji Brown Jackson The Supreme Court Has Killed Affirmative Action. Mediocre Whites Can Rest Easier. Elie Mystal and The Nation I guess it was nice for Miller to send a letter, since historically these \"warnings\" about the \"consequences\" of being too nice to Black people come in the form of burning crosses, but the upshot is the same. Miller is telling schools straight out that any attempt to maintain diversity will be met with costly litigation. And the only way Miller or anybody else can know if a school is not attempting to \"bypass, subvert, or otherwise program around\" the court's ruling is if those schools manufacture a performative decrease in Black enrollment. 13 It is worth noting that nothing in Roberts's ruling or Miller's posturing requires universities to increase enrollment of AAPI students, the students these white-wing forces used to accomplish their agenda. Roberts was unconcerned that enrollment for AAPI students at Harvard also remained in a tight band (around 18 to 20 percent) for a decade, and his ruling does not require universities to increase that number. Miller is not threatening to sue schools if they don't admit more AAPI students. As usual, the concerns of AAPI students are left wholly unaddressed by this ruling, a fact that some Asian Americans who have celebrated the decision seem to deliberately ignore. The point, for these people, is that Black enrollment goes down, not that AAPI enrollment goes up. 14 I don't know how many Black people Miller or Roberts think should be enrolled in a college or university, but however many Black kids are enrolled right now is too much for them. The situation right now is the standard that all future litigation will be set against, and if schools don't significantly decrease Black enrollment to the satisfaction of white supremacists, Stephen Miller will be coming, and John Roberts will have his back. Universities were not using a quota system before, but now they pretty much have to, with a Black enrollment number lower than it was before as the new hard cap. 15 Going forward, it will be beneficial for some Black students-any whose test scores are less than exemplary-to pass as white or \"other\" on their college or graduate school applications. That's because colleges and universities are now disincentivized from extending an offer to anybody they have to report as \"Black,\" for fear of being sued for admitting too many. 16 The affirmative action ban is not race-neutral; it's anti-Black. And that is precisely how people like Roberts and Miller intend to apply their new rules. 17\n\nAs a result, the real upshot of the affirmative action ruling is this: Colleges and universities must now punish Black applicants by decreasing the enrollment of Black students, by any means necessary. That's because the only way universities can show compliance with Roberts's new rules is to show that they've decreased the number of Black kids they let into school. Anything less than that will likely trigger litigation from the white supremacists who have already promised to hunt down schools that admit too many Black people, as determined by their own white-makes-right accounting system. 2 This intended revival of segregationist educational opportunities flows directly from the sheer hubris of Roberts's attempt to legislate how admissions officers think, along with his open threats to universities that do not comply with his version of thought-policing. In his decision, Roberts expects that colleges and universities will be responsible for self-enforcing his ruling, but he also warns them that additional litigation will be coming their way if they try a work-around to achieve racial diversity in their classes. Again, the white media has made a big deal about the part of Roberts's ruling where he says that colleges can still consider how race has affected an applicant (for instance, as described in a college essay), but they've ignored the last lines of his ruling where he specifically threatens schools that use those very essays to achieve racial diversity. 3 Roberts writes: 4 But, despite the dissent's assertion to the contrary, universities may not simply establish through application essays or other means the regime we hold unlawful today.... \"[W]hat cannot be done directly cannot be done indirectly. The Constitution deals with substance, not shadows,\" and the prohibition against racial discrimination is \"levelled at the thing, not the name.\"...

Or a benefit to a student whose heritage or culture motivated him or her to assume a leadership role or attain a particular goal must be tied to that student's unique ability to contribute to the university. 5\n\nI's sho hopes Massa Roberts thinks I is a good Negro wit the determination to keeps learnin' my letters at the fancy school . 6 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Roberts's closing flourish here is trash on many levels. First of all, I don't recall anyone appointing him as the chief judge for how Black people are supposed to overcome racial discrimination. Second, I'd argue that college admissions officers should pay special attention to applicants who didn't fully overcome the hurdles white people put in their way, but might do so in the future. And third, Roberts's paean to model minorities is still a white man's wishes disguised as a legal remedy: How in the hell will Roberts know if some essay reader saw \"courage and determination\" in an applicant? How can Roberts possibly know what constitutes a unique contribution to a university, and how can Roberts place himself in a position to second-guess what the admissions officers on the ground think are worthwhile contributions? 7 Current Issue View our current issue Most important of all, how can Roberts, or anybody else, know if universities are following his rules? Roberts doesn't tell us outright, but he sure drops a powerful hint. In his decision, he effectively accuses Harvard of using a backdoor quota system to maintain a consistent rate of Black students. He writes: \"For the admitted classes [at Harvard] of 2009 to 2018, black students represented a tight band of 10.0%-11.7% of the admitted pool.\" He adds in a footnote: \"Harvard must use precise racial preferences year in and year out to maintain the unyielding demographic composition of its class.\" 8 Even if you think Roberts is right (and I'll point out that Roberts offered no evidence that Harvard \"must\" be using precise racial preferences to achieve this kind of diversity, nor did the trial court, whose presentation of facts was what Roberts was supposed to be bound by, instead of his own conglomeration of fact-free inferences), how will a school like Harvard prove, to Roberts's satisfaction, that it is not using racial preferences in the future? 9 The answer: Only a decrease in Black enrollment is likely to satisfy Roberts. If Harvard maintains its class diversity, Roberts will accuse it of using racial preferences. If Harvard increases Black enrollment, Roberts will accuse it of using newly unconstitutional race-consciousness to promote Black applicants- beyond historical levels , he'll likely say. Only a decrease in Black enrollment will satisfy Roberts's unworkable standard of ignoring race. It doesn't actually matter how Harvard goes about putting together its class: If this doesn't produce Roberts's desired outcome of decreasing Black enrollment, Roberts will accuse it of thinking about race. 10 Of course, Roberts doesn't say by how much universities will have to decrease their Black enrollment to satisfy his new legal requirements. If he had, white media might actually have reported on this aspect of his ruling. Instead, Roberts can almost certainly rely on the efforts of outsourced goons to keep an eye on universities and sue them if too many Black kids get in. One goon squad leader in particular, Trump political adviser Stephen Miller, has already volunteered to do this work, and has basically said the quiet part aloud. 11 Miller is currently the head of some accursed nonprofit called \"America First Legal,\" and shortly after the ruling he released a video in which he explained that his organization sent threatening letters to 200 law schools. In the video, Miller said: \"If they tried to violate, circumvent or bypass, subvert or otherwise program around that ruling, we are going to take them to court. We are going to hold them to account.\" In the letter to Harvard Law School Dean John Manning, Miller warned him of \"the consequences that you and your institution will face if you fail to comply with or attempt to circumvent the Court's ruling.\" 12 Related Articles \"A Tragedy for Us All\": Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson's Dissent Ketanji Brown Jackson The Supreme Court Has Killed Affirmative Action. Mediocre Whites Can Rest Easier. Elie Mystal and The Nation I guess it was nice for Miller to send a letter, since historically these \"warnings\" about the \"consequences\" of being too nice to Black people come in the form of burning crosses, but the upshot is the same. Miller is telling schools straight out that any attempt to maintain diversity will be met with costly litigation. And the only way Miller or anybody else can know if a school is not attempting to \"bypass, subvert, or otherwise program around\" the court's ruling is if those schools manufacture a performative decrease in Black enrollment. 13 It is worth noting that nothing in Roberts's ruling or Miller's posturing requires universities to increase enrollment of AAPI students, the students these white-wing forces used to accomplish their agenda. Roberts was unconcerned that enrollment for AAPI students at Harvard also remained in a tight band (around 18 to 20 percent) for a decade, and his ruling does not require universities to increase that number. Miller is not threatening to sue schools if they don't admit more AAPI students. As usual, the concerns of AAPI students are left wholly unaddressed by this ruling, a fact that some Asian Americans who have celebrated the decision seem to deliberately ignore. The point, for these people, is that Black enrollment goes down, not that AAPI enrollment goes up. 14 I don't know how many Black people Miller or Roberts think should be enrolled in a college or university, but however many Black kids are enrolled right now is too much for them. The situation right now is the standard that all future litigation will be set against, and if schools don't significantly decrease Black enrollment to the satisfaction of white supremacists, Stephen Miller will be coming, and John Roberts will have his back. Universities were not using a quota system before, but now they pretty much have to, with a Black enrollment number lower than it was before as the new hard cap. 15 Going forward, it will be beneficial for some Black students-any whose test scores are less than exemplary-to pass as white or \"other\" on their college or graduate school applications. That's because colleges and universities are now disincentivized from extending an offer to anybody they have to report as \"Black,\" for fear of being sued for admitting too many. 16 The affirmative action ban is not race-neutral; it's anti-Black. And that is precisely how people like Roberts and Miller intend to apply their new rules. 17\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nJeet Heer\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nJeet Heer\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nRoberts's closing flourish here is trash on many levels.

And the only way Miller or anybody else can know if a school is not attempting to \"bypass, subvert, or otherwise program around\" the court's ruling is if those schools manufacture a performative decrease in Black enrollment. 13 It is worth noting that nothing in Roberts's ruling or Miller's posturing requires universities to increase enrollment of AAPI students, the students these white-wing forces used to accomplish their agenda. Roberts was unconcerned that enrollment for AAPI students at Harvard also remained in a tight band (around 18 to 20 percent) for a decade, and his ruling does not require universities to increase that number. Miller is not threatening to sue schools if they don't admit more AAPI students. As usual, the concerns of AAPI students are left wholly unaddressed by this ruling, a fact that some Asian Americans who have celebrated the decision seem to deliberately ignore. The point, for these people, is that Black enrollment goes down, not that AAPI enrollment goes up. 14 I don't know how many Black people Miller or Roberts think should be enrolled in a college or university, but however many Black kids are enrolled right now is too much for them. The situation right now is the standard that all future litigation will be set against, and if schools don't significantly decrease Black enrollment to the satisfaction of white supremacists, Stephen Miller will be coming, and John Roberts will have his back. Universities were not using a quota system before, but now they pretty much have to, with a Black enrollment number lower than it was before as the new hard cap. 15 Going forward, it will be beneficial for some Black students-any whose test scores are less than exemplary-to pass as white or \"other\" on their college or graduate school applications. That's because colleges and universities are now disincentivized from extending an offer to anybody they have to report as \"Black,\" for fear of being sued for admitting too many. 16 The affirmative action ban is not race-neutral; it's anti-Black. And that is precisely how people like Roberts and Miller intend to apply their new rules. 17\n\nIt is worth noting that nothing in Roberts's ruling or Miller's posturing requires universities to increase enrollment of AAPI students, the students these white-wing forces used to accomplish their agenda.

Rape and attempted rape, sexual harassment, being hit on by teachers and coaches and fellow students and older men, eating disorders, pregnancy scares and pregnancy itself, the poisonous social media and smartphone environment with its looks obsessions, bullying, and mean-girl/mean-boy pile-ons. No wonder 57 percent of the girls polled by the CDC said they felt \"persistently sad or hopeless,\" versus 29 percent of the boys . Thirty percent reported seriously considering suicide, and 13 percent attempted it. One in 10 said they had been raped-I still can't take that in. Some of the despair may be related to the Covid lockdowns, but the trends have been rising for a decade .\n\nDespite these threats to their mental and physical health, girls are still more likely to go to college than boys . Imagine what strength and determination that takes. But instead of congratulating them for having successfully run the gauntlet of female teenagerhood and giving them their just rewards, we worry that they are getting too far ahead of their male classmates. Girls get higher grades, are involved in more extracurricular activities, get higher scores on the ACT, do almost as well as boys on the SAT, and are more likely to apply in the first place. That's terrible! What to do? A flurry of recent news stories, including in-depth reporting from Susan Dominus at The New York Times , has documented that colleges put a thumb on the scale for boys. If they didn't, the percentage of college students who are female-58 percent-might be even higher.\n\nThis story crops up periodically as if it were something new, but colleges have been favoring boys for years. In 2006, Kenyon College's former dean of admissions, Jennifer Delahunty Britz, wrote a New York Times editorial apologizing \"To All the Girls I've Rejected\" in favor of less-qualified boys. \"The reality is that because young men are rarer, they're more valued applicants,\" she said. Britz worried about ensuring students an appealing social life: \"Once you become decidedly female in enrollment, fewer males and, as it turns out, fewer females find your campus attractive.\" Punishing some girls to improve the dating pool for others is completely unfair. And is that how it worked when women were the rarer applicants? When Yale and Princeton and other all-male colleges went coed, did they lower their standards to ensure there'd be enough girls to go around? No, they did not.\n\nWhat's going on with boys and school? Do girls just mature faster, and should parents hold boys back a year from entering first grade? Are girls better able to sit in their seats in the classroom? Are too many schoolteachers female? Is it toxic masculinity? There isn't really enough data to settle these questions. It helps to keep in mind, though, that most colleges are not very selective , so an applicant who is accepted at Wesleyan because he has a penis could still get a good education elsewhere if Wesleyan stopped favoring boys, as several of the school's admissions officers and its president, Michael Roth, admitted to Dominus that it does. Also relevant is the fact that boys may be less economically motivated. There are still good-paying jobs out there for men without a college degree-electrician, plumber, builder. For women, it's low-paid work like waitressing and hairdressing and childcare . Good jobs for women-teaching, nursing and other healthcare work, most office jobs-require college. Should women be punished for that?\n\nSome of the ways colleges are trying to attract male applicants are rather pathetic. Consider New College , the small liberal arts public college in Florida that in recent years has been about 66 percent female, with gender studies majors galore. Now it's ground zero in Ron DeSantis's \" war on woke .\" Courses on sex and gender are out , and to attract more men, the school is beefing up not male friendly majors like political science or philosophy or physics, but sports. Grades, as well as SAT and ACT scores, are lower for the new freshman class, reports the Sarasota Herald-Tribune : \"Much of the drop in average scores can be attributed to incoming student-athletes who, despite scoring worse on average, have earned a disproportionate number of the school's $10,000-per-year merit-based scholarships .\" Merit-based scholarships for jocks! Conservatives are fine with affirmative action, as long as the beneficiaries are (white) men.\n\nAffirmative action, you may remember, was intended to remedy the mammoth injustices of racism, which barred most Black people from prosperity, good schooling, and higher education for almost all of our history and still disadvantages them today . But what are the injustices remedied by favoring men in college acceptances today? Last time I looked, men still ran the country and most of its institutions , made more money , had more leisure time than women, and benefited from countless privileges large and small. Nobody is forcing high school boys to spend hours every day playing Fortnite -even Jordan Peterson will tell them that. And by the way, if a lack of male teachers is the problem, it's one that only men can solve-by becoming teachers. Don't blame women for doing a necessary, socially valuable job that men reject.\n\nIn her Times op-ed, Britz asked: \"What are the consequences of young men discovering that even if they do less, they have more options?\" This question doesn't seem to trouble those concerned with today's young men. Does a middling male student at a selective college today see himself as taking the place of a betterqualified woman? Is he secretly tormented by fears that he doesn't really belong there? Highly doubtful. As the feminist slogan goes, \"May you have the confidence of a mediocre white man.\"\n\nWhy should girls have to strive while boys coast? And if fairness doesn't start in the college admissions office, where does it start?\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

(Tom Williams / CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)\n\nThe US Supreme Court's decision on Thursday to overturn almost 50 years of precedent and strike down the ability of colleges and universities to employ race-conscious admissions policies was not unanticipated. Right-wingers with influence in Congress and with the courts have long advocated for overturning what educators know to be a valid and necessary form of affirmative action. However, the inequities that required the development of affirmative action programs decades ago have yet to be eliminated, as Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson noted in a scathing dissent from the court's 6-3 ruling in the case of Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina , where she wrote: \"With let-them-eat-cake obliviousness, today, the majority pulls the ripcord and announces 'colorblindness for all' by legal fiat. But deeming race irrelevant in law does not make it so in life.\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor echoed that view in her dissent from the court's 6-2 ruling in the case of Students for Fair Admissions v. President and Fellows of Harvard College , where she explained that the decision \"subverts the constitutional guarantee of equal protection by further entrenching racial inequality in education, the very foundation of our democratic government and pluralistic society.\" Ignoring race, Sotomayor argued, \"will not equalize a society that is racially unequal. What was true in the 1860s, and again in 1954, is true today: Equality requires acknowledgment of inequality.\" President Biden acknowledged that truth Thursday, stating, \"We cannot let this decision be the last word,\" and reminding people that, \"while the court can render a decision, it cannot change what America stands for.\" Now, progressives have to figure out how to develop a political consensus for reversing the court's destructive assault on race-based admissions policies-judicially and legislatively. To win this fight, it's vital to put things in perspective-not with vague or apologetic assertions but with arguments that are as dynamic as those made by Justices Jackson and Sotomayor. More From John Nichols The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" Yesterday 6:41 pm The Pope Who Decried the Savage Inequalities of Billionaire-Class Capitalism April 21, 2025 A Pope Who Prays for Palestine April 20, 2025 US Representative Jamaal Bowman, a New York Democrat who also happens to be one of the most experienced educators on Capitol Hill, knows exactly how to do that-as he illustrated with a comprehensive response to Thursday's decision. Bowman, a former public school teacher and principal who has a doctorate in educational leadership, argued that race-conscious admissions policies \"are critical to ensuring that our Black and brown students, who have already experienced redlining and systemic underinvestment in their schools and communities, have an equitable shot at higher education to pursue their dreams.\" The congressman, Capitol Hill's most serious and effective communicator on education issues, put the broader discussion of affirmative action in perspective when he said: We all benefit from diversity in our schools. It is the key to learning from and understanding each other. Our education system is already plagued with inequities, from racially biased standardized testing to legacy and donor-based admissions that favor generational wealth. Affirmative action is essential to racial and economic justice in education. We must commit to fighting back against this devastating decision and to promoting equitable access to higher education for our Black and brown students. This means canceling student debt, ensuring everyone has access to free public college, and passing my Fair College Admissions for Students Act, which would end the legacy and donor-based admissions practices that favor the white and wealthy. Our democracy depends on equity in education from preschool to college to vocational school and beyond so that every young person in our country has access to the tools they need to unlock their brilliance and reach their full potential. The Fair College Admissions for Students Act , which Bowman proposed with US Senator Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) in the 117th Congress, and which they plan to reintroduce in this Congress, focuses on a frequently neglected form of affirmative action that primarily benefits wealthy white people-and that the court has permitted to stand. Specifically, it would end colleges' and universities' practice of giving legacy admissions preferences to the children of alumni and donors. As Bowman and Merkley note , \"Legacy admissions can take up between 10 and 25 percent of available slots at top universities. Some estimates indicate that applying as a legacy student can double to quadruple one's chances of getting into a highly selective university. In using legacy and donor status in admissions decisions, institutions give preference to students whose families attended or donated to the university, reducing the opportunities for the descendants of enslaved African Americans who built and maintained many of these institutions and other underrepresented students.\" Backed by the American Civil Liberties Union , which says , \"The Fair College Admissions for Students Act would help address our country's long history of race discrimination and inequities in education,\" and by the group Education Reform Now , which says, \"The legacy preference undermines diversity, fails to reward true achievement, and is profoundly un-American,\" the act attracted support from Congressional Progressive Caucus chair Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and US Representative Jan Schakowsky , an Illinois Democrat who is a senior member of the House Democratic Caucus with close ties to congressional leadership and the White House. Bowman was highlighting the legislation after the high-court ruling came down Thursday, declaring, \"All students deserve an equitable opportunity to gain admission to institutions of higher education, but students whose parents didn't attend or donate to a university are often overlooked in the admissions process due to the historically classist and racist legacy and donor admissions practices at many schools across the country. \" As usual, his timing could not have been better, because this fight is going to need clear messages like that of the veteran educator and congressman: \"To build a future in which the unlimited potential of our communities are untapped, historical policy harm is addressed, and opportunities for economic, educational, and social advancement are within reach, we have to ensure our policies reflect equity and inclusion-including at our institutions of higher education. The legacy admissions practice which disproportionately benefits rich, white, and connected students, and has antisemitic and anti-immigrant roots, creates another systemic barrier to accessing higher education for low-income students, students of color, and first-generation students. Senator Merkley and I say exclusionary practices must end and Congress must prohibit these unfair and inequitable practices. Our legislation helps students of all backgrounds receive equitable and fair consideration during the admissions process and helps us manifest a future in which every student regardless of who they are or where they come from has a fair shot.\" N\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor echoed that view in her dissent from the court's 6-2 ruling in the case of Students for Fair Admissions v.

Bowman, a former public school teacher and principal who has a doctorate in educational leadership, argued that race-conscious admissions policies \"are critical to ensuring that our Black and brown students, who have already experienced redlining and systemic underinvestment in their schools and communities, have an equitable shot at higher education to pursue their dreams.\" The congressman, Capitol Hill's most serious and effective communicator on education issues, put the broader discussion of affirmative action in perspective when he said: We all benefit from diversity in our schools.

Affirmative action is essential to racial and economic justice in education.

The Fair College Admissions for Students Act , which Bowman proposed with US Senator Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) in the 117th Congress, and which they plan to reintroduce in this Congress, focuses on a frequently neglected form of affirmative action that primarily benefits wealthy white people-and that the court has permitted to stand. Specifically, it would end colleges' and universities' practice of giving legacy admissions preferences to the children of alumni and donors. As Bowman and Merkley note , \"Legacy admissions can take up between 10 and 25 percent of available slots at top universities. Some estimates indicate that applying as a legacy student can double to quadruple one's chances of getting into a highly selective university.

Nearly 30 years into his second career as a self-described \"legal entrepreneur,\" Blum has fulfilled another of his most cherished goals: having the Supreme Court's conservative majority overturn nearly 50 years of legal precedent to end affirmative action in college admissions-which the justices did in June with Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard and Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina .\n\nThe ruling is Blum's most consequential win at the court since 2013's Shelby County v. Holder , which sanctioned voter suppression by effectively nullifying the Voting Rights Act. It also serves as proof of Blum's commitment to weaponizing the courts to roll back hard-fought civil rights gains. His first attempt to have the Supreme Court dismantle affirmative action was Fisher v. University of Texas , decided in 2016, in which Blum's plaintiff was a white woman named Abigail Fisher. That attempt failed. Perhaps recognizing that such an obviously undeserving plaintiff made for a poor litigant-not only did Fisher lack the grades and test scores for admission to UT Austin, but nearly 170 Black and Hispanic students with as good or better metrics were also rejected-Blum changed legal strategy. This time around, Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA), a legal nonprofit founded by Blum for the express purpose of outlawing affirmative action in college admissions, sued Harvard and the University of North Carolina, claiming that their race-conscious admissions favored unqualified Black and Hispanic students, while \"intentionally discriminating\" against deserving Asian American applicants.\n\nIn a 2015 speech that's still on YouTube , Blum, who is white, said, \"I needed Asian plaintiffs.\" That disclosure drove suspicions that Blum has used Asian Americans to advance his white-supremacist agenda. Wang Qianxun, who just completed her sophomore year at Harvard, where she is copresident of the school's Asian American Association, cites the video as evidence that Blum's anti-affirmative-action lawsuit \"isn't a cause that originated within Asian American communities.\"\n\nBlum's skeptics also include Margaret Chin, who as a Harvard undergraduate in 1983 cowrote \"Admissions Impossible\"-a paper cited by Blum in his Harvard complaint-demanding that colleges increase Asian American student admissions. Chin told me that Blum's use of her paper \"surprised\" her because of \"its very specifically pro-race-conscious\" conclusion, which, she says, Blum grossly misrepresented. \"I went to Harvard because of a minority recruiter. It's because they saw my race-because they went to [New York City's] Chinatown-that I happened to meet the person who convinced me to think about going to Harvard,\" Chin says. \"I owe everything to affirmative action.\"\n\nChin, who testified on Harvard's behalf at trial, also sees Blum's recruitment of Asian students as a cynical tactic that belies his claims of dedication to remedying anti-Asian bias. \"If you look at the actual court documents, the relief is to eliminate affirmative action,\" Chin says. \"The relief isn't to eliminate discrimination against Asian Americans. It's the exact same relief they asked for in the Abigail Fisher case.\"\n\nCritics maintain that Blum's lawsuit relied on and perpetuated the \"model minority\" myth , which stereotypes Asian Americans as intelligent, high-achieving, and economically successful-but also docile, obedient, and politically silent. The term first appeared in a 1966 New York Times Magazine article, itself an unsubtle rebuttal to the era's Black civil rights movement. By suggesting that Asian Americans have overcome racial discrimination through uncomplaining diligence, groups like SFFA can frame racial justice policies as entitlements that take from hardworking Asians and give to underachieving Blacks and Latinos-an equation that conveniently omits white folks altogether.\n\n\"SFFA is trying to create this essentialized picture of Asian Americans as a monolithic group universally disadvantaged by affirmative action policies. But we know this simply isn't true,\" Kylan Tatum, copresident of the Harvard-Radcliffe Asian American Association and a rising junior at the university, told me. Tatum, who describes themself as both Black and Asian, points out that \"the majority of Asian Americans support affirmative action.\"\n\nIn fact, a Pew Research poll released in June 2023 found that Asian Americans approve of affirmative action at a higher rate than the general US adult population. A 2020 survey by APIAVote and other Asian American and Pacific Islander organizations found that 70 percent of Asian Americans support \"affirmative action programs designed to help Black people, women, and other minorities\" in higher education. In 2022, the same poll found Asian American support at 69 percent, with 80 percent of Indian Americans, 82 percent of Korean Americans, 67 percent of Vietnamese Americans, and 67 percent of Filipino Americans in favor.\n\nChinese Americans were least likely to support affirmative action, at levels wavering between 56 and 59 percent in the annual APIAVote polls and at 45 percent in the Pew study. OiYan Poon, former director of Colorado State University's Race and Intersectional Studies for Educational Equity (RISE), cowrote a 2018 study that examines why Chinese Americans are outliers among Asian Americans. The study found that many Chinese immigrants were connecting online through the Chinese-language app WeChat, where misinformation about affirmative action proliferates. \"Many of the folks that are leading the anti-affirmative-action movements here in the US came here as graduate students, after going to elite colleges in mainland China,\" Poon told Mother Jones in 2018. \"They have a belief that high-stakes testing is the only and fair way to get into the best colleges.... Many of them, because of their class status, end up in relatively white and upper-middle-class communities. And that allows for the kind of development and perpetuation of stereotypes of other people.\"\n\nAlex Chen is the founder of the Silicon Valley Chinese Association Foundation, which filed an amicus brief in support of SFFA. In a 2018 interview in The New Yorker , Chen said that affirmative action taught people to think they \"don't need to work hard,\" because they \"still can get into a top school.\" Kenny Xu, the 26-year-old son of Chinese immigrants, who is on the SFFA board, is a self-appointed spokesperson for Asian Americans who oppose affirmative action. \"Affirmative action was created because people saw so few Black Americans elevated, in the sense that they wanted to. And so, they started to want to create a program to be able to uplift them,\" Xu said in 2021. \"That eventually morphed into 'We just want to lower the bar, so that more African Americans with lower skills can get into the same job that a white American would have otherwise gotten with higher skills.'\"\n\nXu is also the president of Color Us United, which says it is working for a \"race-blind America.\" He frequently appears as a talking head on right-wing media, though he appeared on CNN the day of SFFA's win to applaud the end of race-conscious admissions. And he often tweets that it's \"not racism\" that causes racial inequities but Black \"culture,\" which he contrasts with \"the culture of hard work and family discipline that contributes to Asian success in America.\" \"I'll come out and say it: yeah, we're model minorities,\" Xu wrote on social media earlier this year. \"Heck yeah, people should be like us in education and hard work.\"\n\nFor Aarti Kohli, the executive director of the Advancing Justice-Asian Law Caucus, Xu's comments represent a gross misrepresentation of the demographics of Asian Americans. \"There is this perception that Asian Americans are all doctors, engineers, lawyers,\" Kohli says. \"But the model-minority myth hides the needs of many members of our communities. If you look at college completion rates for Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and Southeast Asian communities, they're very low. And it's really unfortunate that those members of our communities are not seen.\"\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nJeet Heer\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nIn the mid-1960s, anti-Asian immigration quotas were raised just enough to allow in highly skilled immigrants. But between the first wave of arrivals and more recent Asian immigration, the Asian American and Pacific Islander community has developed the greatest economic and education gaps of any racial or ethnic group in the United States. Indian families top the AAPI income list with a median of $119,000 a year, while Burmese families report median annual wages of just $44,400. As of 2019, according to Pew, approximately 10 percent of Asian Americans live below the poverty line, a figure that increases to 13 percent for Cambodians, 17 percent for Hmong, and 25 percent for Mongolians and Burmese. Among Asian Americans age 25 and older, 75 percent of Indian Americans possess bachelor degrees, though the same is true of just 17 percent of Laotians and 15 percent of Bhutanese. And unemployment rates are higher among Pacific Islanders than any other ethnic or racial group in the US.\n\nFor many AAPI students, affirmative action is critical to leveling the playing field in college admissions, and studies agree that affirmative action benefits Asian Americans. It's a fact that Blum tries to hide by denying the existence of affirmative action's many AAPI beneficiaries. In a lawsuit against Yale, SFFA's complaint took pains to note that \"references to Asian applicants will exclude racially-favored Asian applicants who identify, at least in part, as from a favored Asian-American subgroup, such as applicants who identify as Cambodian, Hmong, Laotian, or Vietnamese.\" The implication was that Cambodian, Hmong, Laotian, and Vietnamese applicants benefited from affirmative action but that other Asian groups didn't.\n\n\"This is the point that makes me seethe,\" says Marie Bigham, the founder and executive director of ACCEPT (Admissions Community Cultivating Equity & Peace Today). \"I am a multiracial Vietnamese woman. [Blum] has taken it upon himself to redefine 'Asian' in this country and to inform me I am no longer Asian, but that I am, as he describes it, 'preferred Asian.' That speaks to his awareness that the Asian experience is not a monolith. The rest of us-the 'preferred Asians,' as he describes us-experience exclusion in a pretty impactful and very serious way.\"\n\n\"It's sort of a paradox that [Blum] is leveraging the model-minority myth and putting forth this idea that Asian Americans don't benefit from race-conscious policies,\" says Sally Chen, a 2019 Harvard graduate who now works for Chinese for Affirmative Action and testified on Harvard's behalf against SFFA. \"That logic negates a lot of the realities of what Asian Americans face in society and on the road to higher education and beyond.\"\n\nDuring the litigation over Fisher , more than 160 AAPI groups filed amicus briefs in support of affirmative action; in this year's affirmative action case, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund submitted amicus briefs on behalf of 25 Harvard Asian American and Pacific Islander, Latinx, Black, and Native American student and alumni groups. A number of AAPI students and graduates of Harvard testified for the university in the trial's stages. Blum and SFFA, meanwhile, \"failed to present a single Asian American student at trial,\" NBC News reported.\n\nNow that affirmative action in college admissions has been ruled discriminatory-except at military academies-Blum claims that race-neutral alternatives will replace affirmative action and address racial inequalities. But his preferred remedies seem unlikely to find favor with the cohort he runs with. UCLA Law professor Richard Sander, who wrote an amicus brief for Blum in Fisher , has suggested that programs that use socioeconomic standing-which Blum has cited as a useful replacement for race-might be \" surreptitiously reintroducing race ,\" as The New York Times described it. Writing for the American Bar Association, civil rights lawyer Genevieve Torres notes that \"new lawsuits have also been brought to challenge diversity programs that consider factors correlated with race (so-called 'race-neutral' programs), which Justice [Anthony] Kennedy expressly encouraged in Fisher .\" In Virginia, a lawsuit over admissions to Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, an elite public school, claimed that scrapping entrance exams as a way to make the school more diverse is covertly anti-Asian, though the policy is race-neutral on its face. (In May, the Fourth Circuit ruled that the admissions policy did not discriminate against Asian Americans.) The plaintiff, Coalition for TJ, was represented by Pacific Legal Foundation, which filed an amicus brief on behalf of SFFA in both the Harvard and University of North Carolina cases. Coalition for TJ cofounder Asra Q. Nomani is also the former vice president of Parents Defending Education, which filed an amicus brief in support of SFFA in the Harvard case. Edward Blum is one of PDE's directors.\n\nAffirmative action never opened the floodgates to unqualified hordes, as its opponents contend. It merely attempted to give those who have been historically excluded-provided they had the preparedness, talent, and qualifications-a way to open doors that white supremacy was keeping under lock and key. Racism, combined with the opacity of college admissions, generates wild conjecture and misinformed presumptions. In reality, holistic admissions, like those at Harvard and UNC, take race into account as just one element among a constellation of considerations. \"At a school as selective as Harvard, they have so many applicants with perfect GPAs and test scores, they could fill their class three, four, five times over [on those qualifications],\" says Michaele N. Turnage Young, senior counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. Bigham echoes this claim, saying, \"The idea that, in that kind of applicant pool, someone got in just based on race is so laughable.\"\n\nWere Blum truly concerned about the policies that steal college slots from deserving Asian American applicants, he would not have spent his time demonizing Black and Hispanic students-who, a 2017 New York Times investigation found, \"are more underrepresented at the nation's top colleges and universities than they were 35 years ago.\" Instead, he would have targeted legacy applicants and other students who already have connections at the school. A report from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that 43 percent of white students accepted by Harvard between 2009 and 2014 were \"ALDCs\" : athletes, legacies, the kids of big donors, or the children of faculty and staff. The same study found that three-quarters of \"white ALDC admits would have been rejected if they had been treated as typical white applicants.\" More than 30 percent of Harvard's class of 2025 are legacies, and some 70 percent of legacy applicants to Harvard are white. (Less than 16 percent of Black, Latino, and Asian American kids who get into Harvard are ALDCs.)\n\nBlum knows that legacies and other ALDCs displace a far greater share of Asian applicants than Black and brown students do. SFFA's own expert witness concluded that affirmative action \"for African American and Hispanic applicants could not explain the disproportionately negative effect Harvard's admission system has on Asian Americans.\"\n\nYet anti-affirmative-action campaigners would have you believe that the people who should be happiest about the end of race-conscious admissions are Black folks, because now they have a real shot at white approval. Justice Clarence Thomas reiterated in his concurrence (quoting his own words in an earlier opinion) that \"racial preferences in college admissions 'stamp [Blacks and Hispanics] with a badge of inferiority.'\" The end of racial remedies will thus bring about a real colorblind meritocracy. But critics of affirmative action seem to view the mere presence of Black folks at elite schools as inherently undeserved. For example, in April 2022, Xu tweeted that because of \"race preferences, Black Americans with STEM talent tend to go to UC-Berkeley over UC-Riverside\"-the former being more selective in its admissions than the latter-\"even with lower qualifications.\" But the UC system got rid of affirmative action in 1996 -before Xu was born.\n\nWith affirmative action gone, will the alliance between conservative Asian Americans and their right-wing white co-conspirators begin to fray? When Xu acknowledged the reality of legacy admissions on CNN after the June verdict, Ann Coulter went after him. \"These aren't your allies, White people,\" Coulter wrote. The elimination of race-conscious admissions is predicted to increase Asian American enrollment numbers by just 3 percent. White enrollment is projected to go up 8 percent, according to the Berkeley economics professor and Harvard witness David Card.\n\nFor Blum, the fight is never over. In an interview with The New York Times days after his victory at the Supreme Court, he suggested that affirmative action in workplaces may be his next target. That would have negative impacts on Asian Americans workers, who already are dramatically underrepresented in leadership positions, representing just 1 percent of corporate board seats, 3 percent of law partners and CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, and 2 percent of college presidents-numbers out of step with their overall representation in those fields. Multiple studies have found that while Asian Americans are significantly overrepresented in the tech workforce, they are significantly underrepresented in senior leadership positions by comparison.\n\nIn 2020, Margaret Chin, now a professor of sociology at the City University of New York's Hunter College and CUNY Graduate Center, published Stuck: Why Asian Americans Don't Reach the Top of the Corporate Ladder . She told me that anti-Asian bias and the absence of race-conscious policies in the corporate sector explain the endurance of the \"bamboo ceiling.\"\n\n\"Most of these companies don't have affirmative action programs,\" Chin said. \"That's why there's so few minorities at the top of these corporations. It's because these affirmative action programs have existed in colleges that we see colleges with such diverse populations.\"\n\nMany of the interviewees for this article fought tirelessly against SFFA's attacks on affirmative action, but none were naive about how the Supreme Court would rule. \"We always want to [work toward] a bigger picture for opportunity for more people,\" Sally Chen told me. \"We are trying to think about ways to kind of just shift the paradigm, too, beyond what affirmative action can do. Its impacts were crucial but were never meant to be a cure-all solution.\"\n\n\"Our role as an Asian civil rights organization is to serve the most marginalized,\" Kohli said. \"How do we make it economically possible for low-income and racial minorities to access education-and to actually stay at these educational institutions? So this is an important conversation. But it has to be placed within the context of the bigger challenges that we have.\"\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

That's essentially what they said in their recent ruling, by a 6 to 3 margin, to prohibit the consideration of race as a factor in college admissions, overturning five decades of affirmative action policies that have resulted in a significant increase in Black students in the nation's most selective colleges, graduate programs, and professional schools. The six Republican justices claimed that the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause requires colleges and universities to be \"race neutral\" in recruiting and admitting students. But the justices made an exception for the nation's military academies, which include the highly selective Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., the Naval Academy at Annapolis, Md., the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Conn., and the Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, N.Y.

Elie Mystal and The Nation In his opinion for the majority, hidden in a footnote, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that \"race-based admissions programs further compelling interests at our nation's military academies.\" According to Roberts, the military schools have \"distinct interests\" separate from those at other elite colleges and universities, although he failed to identify any such interests. In her sharp dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, wrote: \"The court has come to rest on the bottom-line conclusion that racial diversity in higher education is only worth potentially preserving insofar as it might be needed to prepare Black Americans and other underrepresented minorities for success in the bunker, not the boardroom.\" In a tweet , Representative Jason Crow from Colorado, who did tours in Iraq and Afghanistan as an Army Ranger and was awarded the Bronze Star, wrote, \"This decision is deeply upsetting but outright grotesque for exempting military academies. The court is saying diversity shouldn't matter, EXCEPT when deciding who can fight and die for our country-reinforcing the notion that these communities can sacrifice for America but not be full participants in every other way.\" \"Justice Jackson is right,\" he added. \"'Deeming race irrelevant in law does not make it so in life.'\" Current Issue View our current issue By carving out an exemption for military academies, the Republicans' ruling exposed their outrageous hypocrisy and political leanings.

The ruling will certainly lead to a decline in the number of African Americans attending medical and nursing schools, whose graduates disproportionately serve in areas with significant Black populations. The same is true for Black law school graduates, who are more likely than their white counterparts to serve Black clients, dealing with unfair evictions, police abuse, job discrimination, pay inequities, and other injustices. The court decision will also hamper Blacks' ability to attend selective colleges that produce many of the country's professors and scientists. In condemning the ruling, President Joe Biden pointed out that what's good for the military academies is good for the larger society: Colleges are stronger when they're racially diverse, our nation is stronger. Just look at the United States military, the finest fighting force in the history of the world. It's been a model of diversity, and it's not only made our nation better, stronger, but safer. Conservatives have long attacked affirmative action in college admissions for allegedly undermining merit as a standard for getting into the most selective institutions. No more than 200 selective institutions (out of 2,830 four-year colleges and universities) have used affirmative action to diversify their student populations. Contrary to conservative claims, they have not admitted \"unqualified\" Black or Latino students ahead of \"qualified\" white or Asian students on the basis of race. The Republican justices didn't bother to ask why affirmative action undercuts merit at Amherst, Princeton, William and Mary, Yale, Holy Cross, Georgetown, Duke, and other selective schools, but not at the academies that focus on training the nation's future military leaders. Even many prominent former military leaders rejected the conservative justices' argument. In an amicus brief , 35 ex-military brass, including Gen. Wesley Clark and four former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called on the Supreme Court to preserve affirmative action at all colleges and universities as well as at the military academies. \"History has shown that placing a diverse Armed Forces under the command of homogenous leadership is a recipe for internal resentment, discord, and violence,\" they explained. \"By contrast, units that are diverse across all levels are more cohesive, collaborative, and effective.\" More From Peter Dreier Brooklyn Dodger 1, Draft Dodger 0 March 24, 2025 The Rev.

April 19, 2024 They added: \"Life and death missions conducted by these units require diverse skills, including foreign language competency and knowledge of other cultures, along with the ability to collaborate and culturally empathize with vastly different individuals.\" \"Diversity in higher education leads directly to diversity in the officer ranks,\" they noted. So overturning affirmative action at selective colleges would \"impede our military's ability to acquire essential entry level leadership attributes and training essential to cohesion.\" That's because, as General Clark explained to CNN, \"about 70 percent of our officer corps comes through ROTC, through ordinary colleges. Some from Harvard, some from Princeton, and some from all over America.\" The US military is more reflective of the nation's ethnic and racial diversity than other institutions. Blacks make up 13.6 percent of the nation's population and 17 percent of its military force. But military and civilian leaders have long been concerned that Blacks are underrepresented among the military's leadership ranks, from junior officers to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. For example, only two of the 41 four-star generals and admirals (4.8 percent) are Black. Affirmative action has helped reduce but not erase that gap. According to The Wall Street Journal , Blacks currently comprise 12 percent of students at West Point, 9 percent at Annapolis, and 14 percent at the Air Force Academy. And if the six Republican justices are truly concerned about the nation's military readiness, they overlooked the reality that the Department of Defense and its branches outsource a great deal of their scientific and social research as well as strategic analysis to partners in universities, think tanks, and private businesses, whose employees come from the ranks of our nonmilitary colleges. The six Supreme Court Republicans failed to even ask a basic question: If racial diversity is good for the leadership of the nation's military, why isn't it also good for the country's other core institutions, including health care, business, education, law, science, the media, and the arts?\n\nThat's essentially what they said in their recent ruling, by a 6 to 3 margin, to prohibit the consideration of race as a factor in college admissions, overturning five decades of affirmative action policies that have resulted in a significant increase in Black students in the nation's most selective colleges, graduate programs, and professional schools.

Even many prominent former military leaders rejected the conservative justices' argument. In an amicus brief , 35 ex-military brass, including Gen. Wesley Clark and four former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called on the Supreme Court to preserve affirmative action at all colleges and universities as well as at the military academies. \"History has shown that placing a diverse Armed Forces under the command of homogenous leadership is a recipe for internal resentment, discord, and violence,\" they explained. \"By contrast, units that are diverse across all levels are more cohesive, collaborative, and effective.\" More From Peter Dreier Brooklyn Dodger 1, Draft Dodger 0 March 24, 2025 The Rev.

So overturning affirmative action at selective colleges would \"impede our military's ability to acquire essential entry level leadership attributes and training essential to cohesion.\" That's because, as General Clark explained to CNN, \"about 70 percent of our officer corps comes through ROTC, through ordinary colleges. Some from Harvard, some from Princeton, and some from all over America.\" The US military is more reflective of the nation's ethnic and racial diversity than other institutions. Blacks make up 13.6 percent of the nation's population and 17 percent of its military force. But military and civilian leaders have long been concerned that Blacks are underrepresented among the military's leadership ranks, from junior officers to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. For example, only two of the 41 four-star generals and admirals (4.8 percent) are Black. Affirmative action has helped reduce but not erase that gap. According to The Wall Street Journal , Blacks currently comprise 12 percent of students at West Point, 9 percent at Annapolis, and 14 percent at the Air Force Academy. And if the six Republican justices are truly concerned about the nation's military readiness, they overlooked the reality that the Department of Defense and its branches outsource a great deal of their scientific and social research as well as strategic analysis to partners in universities, think tanks, and private businesses, whose employees come from the ranks of our nonmilitary colleges. The six Supreme Court Republicans failed to even ask a basic question: If racial diversity is good for the leadership of the nation's military, why isn't it also good for the country's other core institutions, including health care, business, education, law, science, the media, and the arts?\n\nSpencer Ackerman\n\nElie Mystal and The Nation\n\nIn his opinion for the majority, hidden in a footnote, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that \"race-based admissions programs further compelling interests at our nation's military academies.\" According to Roberts, the military schools have \"distinct interests\" separate from those at other elite colleges and universities, although he failed to identify any such interests. In her sharp dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, wrote: \"The court has come to rest on the bottom-line conclusion that racial diversity in higher education is only worth potentially preserving insofar as it might be needed to prepare Black Americans and other underrepresented minorities for success in the bunker, not the boardroom.\" In a tweet , Representative Jason Crow from Colorado, who did tours in Iraq and Afghanistan as an Army Ranger and was awarded the Bronze Star, wrote, \"This decision is deeply upsetting but outright grotesque for exempting military academies. The court is saying diversity shouldn't matter, EXCEPT when deciding who can fight and die for our country-reinforcing the notion that these communities can sacrifice for America but not be full participants in every other way.\" \"Justice Jackson is right,\" he added. \"'Deeming race irrelevant in law does not make it so in life.'\" Current Issue View our current issue By carving out an exemption for military academies, the Republicans' ruling exposed their outrageous hypocrisy and political leanings. Either the Constitution prohibits the use of race in college admissions or it doesn't.

The ruling will certainly lead to a decline in the number of African Americans attending medical and nursing schools, whose graduates disproportionately serve in areas with significant Black populations. The same is true for Black law school graduates, who are more likely than their white counterparts to serve Black clients, dealing with unfair evictions, police abuse, job discrimination, pay inequities, and other injustices. The court decision will also hamper Blacks' ability to attend selective colleges that produce many of the country's professors and scientists. In condemning the ruling, President Joe Biden pointed out that what's good for the military academies is good for the larger society: Colleges are stronger when they're racially diverse, our nation is stronger. Just look at the United States military, the finest fighting force in the history of the world. It's been a model of diversity, and it's not only made our nation better, stronger, but safer. Conservatives have long attacked affirmative action in college admissions for allegedly undermining merit as a standard for getting into the most selective institutions. No more than 200 selective institutions (out of 2,830 four-year colleges and universities) have used affirmative action to diversify their student populations.

For example, only two of the 41 four-star generals and admirals (4.8 percent) are Black. Affirmative action has helped reduce but not erase that gap. According to The Wall Street Journal , Blacks currently comprise 12 percent of students at West Point, 9 percent at Annapolis, and 14 percent at the Air Force Academy. And if the six Republican justices are truly concerned about the nation's military readiness, they overlooked the reality that the Department of Defense and its branches outsource a great deal of their scientific and social research as well as strategic analysis to partners in universities, think tanks, and private businesses, whose employees come from the ranks of our nonmilitary colleges. The six Supreme Court Republicans failed to even ask a basic question: If racial diversity is good for the leadership of the nation's military, why isn't it also good for the country's other core institutions, including health care, business, education, law, science, the media, and the arts?\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nJeet Heer\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nJeet Heer\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nAccording to the conservative justices' logic, it's OK for military academies to identity prospective students by their race to prepare them for war and the national defense, but it's unacceptable to use race to identify the nation's future cancer researchers, business leaders, and university professors. The ruling will certainly lead to a decline in the number of African Americans attending medical and nursing schools, whose graduates disproportionately serve in areas with significant Black populations. The same is true for Black law school graduates, who are more likely than their white counterparts to serve Black clients, dealing with unfair evictions, police abuse, job discrimination, pay inequities, and other injustices. The court decision will also hamper Blacks' ability to attend selective colleges that produce many of the country's professors and scientists. In condemning the ruling, President Joe Biden pointed out that what's good for the military academies is good for the larger society: Colleges are stronger when they're racially diverse, our nation is stronger. Just look at the United States military, the finest fighting force in the history of the world. It's been a model of diversity, and it's not only made our nation better, stronger, but safer. Conservatives have long attacked affirmative action in college admissions for allegedly undermining merit as a standard for getting into the most selective institutions. No more than 200 selective institutions (out of 2,830 four-year colleges and universities) have used affirmative action to diversify their student populations. Contrary to conservative claims, they have not admitted \"unqualified\" Black or Latino students ahead of \"qualified\" white or Asian students on the basis of race. The Republican justices didn't bother to ask why affirmative action undercuts merit at Amherst, Princeton, William and Mary, Yale, Holy Cross, Georgetown, Duke, and other selective schools, but not at the academies that focus on training the nation's future military leaders. Even many prominent former military leaders rejected the conservative justices' argument. In an amicus brief , 35 ex-military brass, including Gen. Wesley Clark and four former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called on the Supreme Court to preserve affirmative action at all colleges and universities as well as at the military academies. \"History has shown that placing a diverse Armed Forces under the command of homogenous leadership is a recipe for internal resentment, discord, and violence,\" they explained. \"By contrast, units that are diverse across all levels are more cohesive, collaborative, and effective.\" More From Peter Dreier Brooklyn Dodger 1, Draft Dodger 0 March 24, 2025 The Rev.

Harvard in June 2023, which ended affirmative action, the dream of educational equity might seem further away. Black student enrollment at Brown University, for example, dropped by 40 percent for the class of 2028. At MIT, the newest class is just 5 percent Black, down from an average of 13 percent .\n\n\"While I am painfully aware of the social and economic ravages which have befallen my race and all who suffer discrimination,\" said Justice Clarence Thomas , \"all men are created equal, are equal citizens, and must be treated equally before the law.\" But across the United States, students are still fighting for equal treatment in admissions practices. In November, organizers at more than 18 universities met at Brown for a first-ever conference staged by Class Action to discuss how to \"democratize elite education\" and end legacy admissions.\n\nWhile affirmative action has been reversed, elite colleges still employ \"affirmative action for the rich,\" according to Class Action, referring to the Ivy League's overwhelming preference for legacy admissions-or children of alumni who are \"more likely than other applicants to be white and wealthy.\" These institutions accept more applicants from the country's top 1 percent than from the bottom 50 percent , giving a major advantage to the already rich and powerful. \"The country's most heralded institutions like Brown and Stanford and Princeton and Yale are holding on to blatantly nepotistic practices,\" said Ryan Cieslikowski, a Stanford alum who founded Class Action in 2023. \"Approximately 78% [of legacy admissions] come from the top 10% of household incomes,\" reads Class Action's website. \"And according to a 2019 study, at Harvard 7 out of 10 were white.\"\n\nFor three days, student leaders from Stanford, Harvard, Georgetown, Cornell, Columbia, Princeton, Yale, and more met to \"exchange organizing strategy and tactics used in different institutions\" and build connections for collaboration. \"To see all these students from across the country passionate about creating change and ending legacy admissions, combating career funneling, and just ensuring that we have these equitable spaces,\" said Shawn Jimenez, a sophomore at Bowdoin and conference attendee, \"it's really cool.\"\n\nIn 2018, Brown University students founded the Students for Educational Equity initiative and sponsored a referendum to end legacy admissions. The vote was supported by 81 percent of the student body, but resulted in little response from the administration. Organizers began looking outside of their own campuses for support. \"Once we saw that this movement could go from one coast to another, we knew that we had something here,\" said Madison Harvey, a junior and copresident of Brown SEE.\n\nOver the last few months, student-led legislation against legacy admissions has gained significant ground. \"We recently introduced a bill in the Rhode Island State House, H 8202, to end legacy admissions preferences throughout the state of Rhode Island-although Brown University is one of the only universities that practice it,\" said copresident Nick Lee.\n\nIn California, Class Action fought for a similar bill earlier this year. \"A national organization that opposes legacy admissions and corporate career funneling, Class Action has established a presence at Stanford,\" wrote the Stanford Daily in May. \"In April, students testified in support of AB 1780 at the State Capitol in Sacramento.\" Six months later, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed AB 1780, making it the fifth state to ban legacy admissions .\n\nThe change will go into effect in the 2025-26 admissions cycle and impact private institutions like Stanford University and the University of Southern California-not just public universities. \"In California, everyone should be able to get ahead through merit, skill, and hard work,\" said Newsom. \"The California Dream shouldn't be accessible to just a lucky few, which is why we're opening the door to higher education wide enough for everyone, fairly.\"\n\nBut for organizers with Class Action, ending legacy admissions isn't enough. Students at Johns Hopkins University-where legacy preference is no longer used-explained how the admissions process needs to be followed by intentional programs for first-generation students. \"We don't have the support systems for these students,\" says Yvette Shu, a sophomore.\n\n\"I was one of those lucky kids who sneaked through the door of an elite school,\" said Cieslikowski. \"Universities aren't doing enough to promote socioeconomic diversity, to promote public welfare, and [students] are ready to mobilize and organize against it.\"\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

Havard case, declaring that race-conscious admissions were unconstitutional. For millions of high school seniors like ourselves ready to apply for college this fall, this means that there won't be a box to indicate race on the application.\n\nHowever, the focus on the college admissions process has left some details of the SFFA v. Harvard decision undiscussed, specifically the exception made for military academies. The exception appears in a  vague footnote by Chief Justice John Roberts in the majority opinion that outlines how military academies have \" potentially distinct interests .\" Before the decision, current and former military officials signed the amicus curiae requesting the court to take into account the importance of race-conscious admissions at military colleges and service academies for reasons of \"national security.\"\n\n\"[The] footnote in the opinion indicated that the ruling did not apply to military academies, at least for now, because they might have different, untested legal justifications for using race than Harvard did,\" said Omar Syed, an attorney who has 15 years of experience at the collegiate level and is currently the general counsel and vice president at Rice University. \"If a military academy is sued for using race as a factor, it will likely justify this tactic as a national security imperative, as the Department of Justice's lawyer argued before the Supreme Court.\"\n\nHowever, if the exemption for race-conscious admissions can be made for military academies, it raises the question of whether the SCOTUS ruling had anything to do with constitutionality at all. \"For years SCOTUS has ruled that the educational benefits of diversity qualify as legally compelling interests, even if they are not numerically measurable,\" said Syed. \"This ruling retreats from that historical rule, and appears to place great weight on how immeasurable, and thus intangible, Harvard's asserted interests are.\" Justice Sotomayor highlighted this contradiction in her dissent : \"The court's carveout only highlights the arbitrariness of its decision and further proves that the Fourteenth Amendment does not categorically prohibit the use of race in college admissions.\"\n\nThe unprecedented lengths the US can go to create loopholes when it comes to defense, while simultaneously rolling back progress in education broadly, is concerning. \"The way the budget is distributed says a lot about the priorities,\" said Morales, pointing to the comparative lack of attention to welfare programs, health care, food, and now education. In the 2022 federal discretionary budget , $751 billion went to defense, while only $132 billion went to education, social services, employment, and training. Military academies' exemption from the ban on race-conscious admissions is just another example of minorities getting the short end of the stick.\n\n\"It is very challenging not to assume that the court ignores the benefits of affirmative action only in higher education, where the status quo and long-standing inequality are at risk, but not in settings where marginalized communities have long been exploited and taken advantage of. Only there, where people are needed to put their lives at risk for the safety of their country, is diversity needed,\" said Leonardo Sarmiento, a student at the University of Chicago.\n\nIn El Paso, Tex.-home to Fort Bliss, the largest mainland military base-recruiting disproportionately targets Hispanic high school students and other minorities. According to a 2017 study from Pew Research , 43 percent of the active-duty forces in the military were people of color-36 percent of whom were Hispanic. Almost half of enlisted soldiers cited economic and job-related concerns as their reason for joining the military.\n\nAdmission into any of the five military service academies-such as West Point-means a higher tier of benefits. For any student-but especially low-income students, who are disproportionately BIPOC-the chance of a debt-free education can be life-changing. \"Military recruiters will find a way to use this decision to convince young people that they are offering them the best path to a college education, whether it's through military academy appointment-which is actually quite rare-or through financial aid that the military is promising to pay for college,\" said Rick Jahnkow cofounder of the Project on Youth and Non-Military Opportunities.\n\nDavid Morales, a PhD student at Stanford University for Education who has been organizing against recruitment since high school, explains how these practices play out. \"The military would send recruiters who were also people of color, Black, or Latinx (in POC-predominant schools), so students themselves see these soldiers and feel 'represented.'\" He saw these tactics firsthand as a Latino student. \"My classmates would be placed in JROTC without our consent, and I remember two former AVID (college readiness elective) classrooms were used. The wall was knocked down in between them, to build the shooting range.\"\n\nThere is a direct pipeline from these JROTC programs to military academies, Morales explained, and schools and JROTC programs are often allowed to nominate students to these prestigious, selective schools. Two of these academies, West Point and the US Air Force Academy, claim \" strong diversity and inclusion \" principles.\n\nBut counter-recruiters -those opposed to military recruitment in schools-say these principles arise from  recruiting efforts targeting groups like low-income students of color. \"Their motive in trying to diversify is not social justice. For this particular carve-out, it's logical to assume that they're more concerned about meeting recruitment quotas, and that is the national interest that they're arguing,\" said Jahnkow.\n\nIn 2022, the military fell short of its enlistment recruiting goal by 25 percent , and applications to all five military service academies dropped-including West Point , with a 10 percent decrease. Because these academies accept so few students, this drop in applications has not yet led to service academies' having trouble maintaining their class sizes. However, with fewer applicants, these institutions could have trouble maintaining selectivity and exclusivity.\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nJeet Heer\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nWhile West Point has not released an official press release on the decision, the Department of Defense told the The New York Times , \"We rely on a pipeline of highly qualified American patriots from all walks of life and all backgrounds, which is crucial for our national security.\" In the wake of the decision, Students for Fair Admissions has made military academies its next target. The group is already seeking plaintiffs who believe they were rejected from West Point based on their race.\n\nNow more than ever, counter-recruiters affirm the need for their work. \"That is a challenge that we're going to have to pay even more attention to now, when the military continues to have trouble recruiting, and they continue to modify their standards just to bring those people in who feel they have limited options,\" said Jahnkow. \"Counter-recruitment groups have to really put emphasis on doing research around college financial aid, job training programs, other kinds of careers that can be fulfilling, and contribute to the welfare of the community.\"\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

      "text": "Affirmative Action Rejection of Affirmative Action Draws Strong Reactions From Right and Left\n\nConservatives hailed the Supreme Court's 6-3 ruling, which could drastically alter college admissions policies across the country, while Democrats rued the change.\n\nThe Supreme Court effectively overruled a landmark affirmative action precedent.\n\nThe ruling creates more uncertainty for high school students applying to college.\n\nIn Congress, Democrats denounced and Republicans celebrated the ruling on affirmative action.\n\nZach Montague\n\nAs Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. finished reading the majority opinion in the Supreme Court chamber on Thursday, a hushed crowd prepared for the possibility of a rare oral dissent from the liberal wing.\n\nIt did not come immediately.\n\nFirst came a more unusual moment as Justice Clarence Thomas chimed in with an oral concurrence, welcoming the court's reasoning.\n\nHe began by explaining his decision to speak up in support of the ruling, saying \"race-based discrimination against Asian American students compels me.\"\n\nJustice Thomas then touched on previous rulings by the court, like Plessy v. Ferguson, which he said further entrenched racial inequalities in American society that worsened well into the 20th century as discriminatory policies against Chinese and Japanese immigrants took hold in Western states.\n\nIn a solemn tone, he spoke for longer than Chief Justice Roberts.\n\nBut Justice Thomas's colleagues appeared to tense up as he turned to describing the modern era, in which he said college admissions have become a \"zero-sum game\" in which Asian students suffer because of an outdated overcorrection by courts during the civil rights era.\n\n\"This is not 1958 or 1968,\" he said. \"Today's youth do not shoulder moral debts of their ancestors.\"\n\nSeated to the far left of the bench, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who wrote a dissent , appeared to stiffen.\n\nAs Justice Thomas finished, the chamber fell silent. Chief Justice Roberts waited a beat before peering anxiously at Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who was seated two seats from him, next to Justice Thomas.\n\nJust as solemnly, Justice Sotomayor followed with a vastly different view of the role of the court and the legacy of affirmative action.\n\nShe denounced the decision as \"profoundly wrong,\" while arguing that the court had, in effect, condoned systemic racism in the United States. She went on, addressing Justice Thomas directly, as he appeared to shift uncomfortably at times.\n\n\"Ignoring racial inequality will not make it disappear,\" Justice Sotomayor said.\n\nShe gave her own recounting of American history, noting that race has long been used in the segregating of prisons and the drawing of congressional districts, but now cannot inform college admissions decisions.\n\n\"Today's decision imposes a superficial rule of race-blindness on the nation,\" she said.\n\nShe ended by invoking Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., promising that, despite the decision, \"the arc of the moral universe will bend toward racial justice.\"\n\nAs those words lingered, Chief Justice Roberts adjourned the court until Friday, and all inside were silently ushered out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTroy Closson\n\nThe Supreme Court's move to strike down race-conscious college admissions follows reasoning in earlier decisions used to limit how K-12 public schools can use race in efforts to integrate schools.\n\nIn particular, arguments in two 2007 rulings against public school districts in Kentucky and Washington foreshadowed Thursday's decision.\n\nIn the Jefferson County Public Schools in Louisville, schools had targets to ensure that Black children made up 15 to 50 percent of their student populations. In Seattle, some schools with more applicants than seats used race as a tiebreaker in admissions decisions .\n\nThe court invalidated these voluntary desegregation plans, as Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote that the district's efforts had been \"directed only to racial balance, pure and simple.\" That goal, he said, ran afoul of constitutional rights to equal protection.\n\n\"The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race,\" he wrote in his plurality opinion in the Seattle case, adding that \"racial balancing is not transformed from 'patently unconstitutional' to a compelling state interest simply by relabeling it 'racial diversity.'\"\n\nAt the oral arguments in the fall, several justices echoed those ideas, and raised questions that mirrored debates at the K-12 level over the benefits of integration itself. Research has shown that racially and economically diverse public schools can benefit all children. Still, Justice Clarence Thomas challenged lawyers for Harvard and the University of North Carolina on the idea that diversity conveys academic benefits.\n\nThe decisions on Wednesday may prompt challenges to how some K-12 school districts pursue desegregation . Still, with the legacy of the 2007 cases in mind, many districts trying to diversify K-12 schools often use the proportion of children who receive free or reduced-price lunch at schools, a measure of poverty, as a way to achieve economic integration - as opposed to using race or ethnicity.\n\nIn Minneapolis, city officials redrew school zone boundaries in 2020 to consider socioeconomic diversity across neighborhoods. And in New York City's school system, the nation's largest, several racially and economically diverse districts have set benchmarks for the number of lower-income students each school enrolls, rather than use race, to create more diverse schools.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled that the race-conscious admissions programs at Harvard and the University of North Carolina were unlawful, curtailing affirmative action at colleges and universities around the nation.\n\nMichael D. Shear\n\nDuring the MSNBC interview, President Biden also rejected the idea of expanding the Supreme Court in an effort to make it more liberal, saying, \"If we start the process of trying to expand the court, we're going to politicize it maybe forever in a way that is not healthy, that you can't get back.\"\n\nMichael D. Shear\n\nA few hours after President Biden answered a reporter's question about whether the Supreme Court had gone \"rogue\" by saying \"This not a normal court,\" he explained the comment. In an interview with Nicolle Wallace on MSNBC's \"Deadline White House\" show, he said he was referring to the court's willingness to overturn precedents set by previous justices.\n\nMichael D. Shear\n\n\"It's done more to unravel basic rights and basic decisions than any court in recent history,\" Biden said. \"Take a look at how it's ruled on a number of issues that had been precedent for 50, 60 years sometimes. And that's what I meant by not normal.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmy Harmon\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision to strike down race-conscious admissions in cases against Harvard and the University of North Carolina had elicited an array of partisan reactions: dismay from some liberals who said that would represent a step backward for the country; hope from others that class-conscious admissions could make up for the loss, while easing racial tensions; and relief from conservatives, who believe that race-conscious admissions is unconstitutional.\n\nBut for many of the Black, Hispanic and Native Americans whose lives were shaped by affirmative action, this moment has prompted a more personal reckoning with its complicated legacy. In more than two dozen interviews with The New York Times, those who went to elite schools, where their race may or may not have given them an edge, expressed a swirl of emotions.\n\nA few concluded that the downsides of race-conscious admissions outweighed the benefits. Some spoke of carrying an extra layer of impostor syndrome. Many more grieved the closing of a path that led to rewarding careers and the building of wealth.\n\nTheir experience may inform the present, as Americans continue to debate how to define - and align - the principles of fairness and merit, as well as address enduring racial disparities without deepening racial divisions. At least in the immediate future, Black and Hispanic enrollment is expected to plunge .\n\nAbbie VanSickle and Daniel Victor\n\nThe decision by the Supreme Court's conservative supermajority on Thursday to strike down the race-conscious admissions programs at Harvard and the University of North Carolina has renewed focus on the court's shift to the right in recent years.\n\nLike abortion - the subject of a similarly divided ruling last year that overturned the constitutional right to abortion - affirmative action underscores the deep gulf between the conservative and liberal justices.\n\nThe strongly worded opinions and dissents released on Thursday were hardly the first time that members of the court had made their views known. Here's a sampling:\n\nThe chief justice, who wrote the majority opinion in the ruling on Thursday, has long opposed race-conscious admissions.\n\nIn his view, the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause was meant to help bring about a colorblind society, not to support racial preferences.\n\nIn the 2007 case Parents Involved v. Seattle , where the court struck down a Seattle plan focused on desegregating schools, he famously wrote: \"The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\"\n\nJustice Thomas is perhaps the court's most ardent critic of affirmative action. In speeches, his memoir and his dissents in previous cases, he has consistently taken the position that race-conscious admissions violate the 14th Amendment - and that they harm, rather than help, students from poor backgrounds.\n\nIn 2003, when the court heard cases involving two white students who challenged the policy after being denied admission to the University of Michigan, the majority concluded that the university could consider an applicant's race in a \"narrowly tailored\" way. But Justice Thomas, in a dissent , wrote that universities seek such diversity in admissions only \"to obtain their aesthetic student body.\"\n\nIn 2013, Justice Thomas again voiced his view that the court should reject affirmative action, writing a dissent when the court reaffirmed the policy in the case of Fisher v. University of Texas . He wrote that the equal protection clause barred the use of race in college admissions.\n\nJustice Thomas has written that his views on affirmative action stem from personal experience. When he attended Yale Law School, he said that other students viewed him as a token affirmative action student, and he has said he thought potential employers also viewed him with skepticism.\n\nLike Justice Thomas, Justice Sotomayor came from humble beginnings. But she has taken the opposite view of race-conscious admissions.\n\nIn her memoir, \"My Beloved World,\" Justice Sotomayor strongly defended affirmative action and credited the policy with giving her the opportunity to attend Princeton University and Yale Law School.\n\nIn an early 1990s panel with two other female judges, Justice Sotomayor credited the policy with opening up a pathway for her.\n\n\"I am a product of affirmative action,\" she said.\n\nJustice Alito has made no secret of his disdain for race-conscious admissions. In 2016, in an unusual move , he read his dissent in Fisher v. University of Texas from the bench.\n\n\"This is affirmative action gone berserk,\" Justice Alito said.\n\nHe wrote: \"What is at stake is whether university administrators may justify systematic racial discrimination simply by asserting that such discrimination is necessary to achieve 'the educational benefits of diversity,' without explaining - much less proving - why the discrimination is needed or how the discriminatory plan is well crafted to serve its objectives.\"\n\nDuring October's oral argument, Justice Alito reiterated his criticism of the policy, calling college admissions \"a zero-sum game.\"\n\n\"Suppose you have a race,\" he said. If one of the two runners gets to start five yards closer to the finish line, he said, \"the one who doesn't get that plus factor is disadvantaged, right?\"\n\nJustice Kagan recused herself from two previous cases tackling affirmative action because she had worked on them as U.S. Solicitor General. After one of the cases, which upheld a race-conscious admissions program at the University of Texas by a 4 to 3 vote, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in an interview that she was confident Justice Kagan would have voted with the majority.\n\n\"If Justice Kagan had been there, it would have been 5 to 3,\" Justice Ginsburg said.\n\nThere have been indications of her views before Thursday. While working as an adviser to President Bill Clinton, she endorsed a legal strategy that was aimed at avoiding a sweeping Supreme Court ruling against affirmative action.\n\nJustice Jackson joined the court only last June, but during arguments last year in another case - on the Voting Rights Act - she provided a sense of where she might stand.\n\nAfter a lawyer suggested there was tension between the statute's goal of protecting minority voting rights and the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause, Justice Jackson indicated she did not believe they were in conflict - a preview of an argument she also made in the cases concerning affirmative action.\n\nAfter analyzing the history and traditions of the Constitution, Justice Jackson said, it became clear to her that \"the framers themselves adopted the equal protection clause, the 14th Amendment, the 15th Amendment, in a race-conscious way.\"\n\nShe continued, \"I don't think that the historical record establishes that the founders believed that race neutrality or race blindness was required.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdam Liptak\n\nIn June 2003, the Supreme Court decided a pair of cases challenging admissions programs at the University of Michigan. One of them struck down, by a 6 to 3 vote, a numerical point system used by the undergraduate college. The other upheld a more nuanced admissions program used by the law school, which accounted for race as one factor among many to achieve educational diversity.\n\nThe vote in that second case, Grutter v. Bollinger , was 5 to 4.\n\n\"In order to cultivate a set of leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry, it is necessary that the path to leadership be visibly open to talented and qualified individuals of every race and ethnicity,\" Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the majority.\n\nIn its challenges to the race-conscious admissions programs at Harvard and the University of North Carolina, a group called Students for Fair Admissions asked the Supreme Court to overrule Grutter, saying it was at odds with both the Constitution's equal protection clause and a law banning educational institutions that accept federal money from discriminating based on race.\n\nJustice O'Connor's majority opinion in Grutter embraced the diversity rationale set out in Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr.'s 1978 opinion in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke , one that no other member of the court joined in full.\n\n\"Effective participation by members of all racial and ethnic groups in the civil life of our nation is essential if the dream of one nation, indivisible, is to be realized,\" Justice O'Connor wrote, adding that law schools had a special role to play.\n\n\"Access to legal education (and thus the legal profession) must be inclusive of talented and qualified individuals of every race and ethnicity,\" she wrote, \"so that all members of our heterogeneous society may participate in the educational institutions that provide the training and education necessary to succeed in America.\"\n\nToward the end of her opinion, Justice O'Connor noted that 25 years had passed since Bakke, adding, \"We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary.\"\n\nIn dissent, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote that he found that passage puzzling. \"The opinion,\" he wrote, \"contains its own self-destruct mechanism.\"\n\nIn a concurring opinion on Thursday, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that the majority opinion \"rightly makes clear that Grutter is, for all intents and purposes, overruled.\"\n\nTroy Closson\n\nEven as the Supreme Court has struck down race-conscious admissions in higher education, many other nations will continue to use affirmative action in schools.\n\nAbout a quarter of countries around the world have policies for affirmative action at colleges and universities, and many have emerged within the last generation, research in the mid-2010s found .\n\nThose places include China, where students who are not members of the country's dominant ethnic group can be admitted to schools with lower test scores, and France, where some selective institutions intentionally seek out students from schools in disadvantaged areas. In Brazil, a 2012 law set aside about 50 percent of seats at many federal universities for those who went to public high schools and groups who have experienced discrimination, including Black and Indigenous students.\n\nBut, as in the United States, the future of the Brazil law has grown uncertain in recent years as the country's political leadership has changed.\n\nIn one of the more contentious approaches , public colleges in India must adhere to quotas for disadvantaged groups. Communities who do not benefit from the quotas have argued that they spur resentment and exacerbate divisions .\n\nBut India's system is written into its constitution. It requires universities to set aside 22.5 percent of seats for lower castes, including Dalits, who have experienced less economic mobility than others. Today, nearly 50 percent of spots in India's public higher education institutions are reserved for members of those groups. The quotas also apply to government jobs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJenna Russell Jacey Fortin Beverly Ford and Emily Cataneo\n\nBeverly Ford reported from Cambridge, Mass., and Emily Cataneo from Chapel Hill, N.C.\n\nThe teenagers seeking shade as their tour groups crisscrossed leafy Harvard Yard on Thursday knew that they would be among the first students to feel the effect of the Supreme Court's ruling on race-based admissions when they applied to colleges.\n\nWhat they didn't know was exactly how it would affect their chances. But many high school students, visiting Harvard University and beyond, said they were concerned to see long-established admissions practices giving way to something new and unfamiliar.\n\n\"It makes me more stressed about the whole concept of college,\" said Danyael Morales, 16, a rising senior of Dominican and Puerto Rican heritage at Boston Latin Academy, a public school in Boston. \"And with the whole agenda of not seeing race, I feel like colleges are not going to see me.\"\n\nThe court voted 6 to 3 to reject affirmative action programs at Harvard and the University of North Carolina. The move is expected to lower the number of Black and Latino students at elite college campuses.\n\nIn Chapel Hill, N.C., most U.N.C. students are gone for the summer, but the student union swarmed with high school hopefuls trying on Carolina sweatshirts while their parents clutched admissions folders.\n\nWilliam Walker, who is Black, was visiting from Minneapolis to settle his son, an incoming freshman, at orientation. He discussed the decision with his family after the news broke. His daughter, a high school student, said it made her nervous about what college would be like for her, though Mr. Walker was not concerned, given her high grades and Advanced Placement classes.\n\nHe said his family would do their best to adapt. \"You just adjust the fight. If Mike Tyson sends jabs to the gut, you rock and send uppercuts.\"\n\nYosef Herrera, 16, a Hispanic high school student in Mercedes, Texas, said he supported the Supreme Court decision because he thought that affirmative action focused too much on race, often at the expense of other factors like ethnicity or family income. The policy can hurt people by inflaming racial divisions, he said.\n\nWhen his time comes to apply to the Ivy League schools that he hopes to attend, Mr. Herrera, who is a co-chair of the High School Republican National Federation, said: \"I think they'll be fair. They'll look at my application, and they'll see what I've done as a person.\"\n\nWriting the majority opinion for the court, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said that universities could continue to consider the effect of race on the life experiences of applicants who wrote about it in their essays, as long as it did not become a substitute for affirmative action.\n\nThat adds another layer of difficulty to the already high-stress decision of what to write in college essays, said Dan Rubin, director of school counseling at Newton South High School in Newton, Mass. Mr. Rubin said he expected that many students would feel conflicted.\n\n\"It's forcing kids of color to make a choice about which story to tell - a story about race, or about all the other things that make them a quality applicant,\" he said. \"Do they want to sacrifice the opportunity to talk about interning in a biotech lab?\"\n\nThe essay was a concern for Mr. Morales, the Boston Latin Academy student. He was born in the Dominican Republic, learned English as a second language and hopes to attend Columbia University to study business. \"I've already spent months learning how to write a college essay,\" he said, \"and I think this will alter my entire application process.\"\n\nMinhal Nazeer, 17, a high school student in Louisville, Ky., who plans to apply to colleges including Harvard and the University of North Carolina, said she would take advantage of the college essay to discuss her South Asian identity.\n\n\"I will be talking about my race in my applications to schools,\" said Ms. Nazeer, whose parents immigrated from Pakistan. \"And I hope they recognize that as an integral part of my identity.\"\n\nMatthew Wilson, a rising senior at Princeton University, said the court's decision could lead to a better system, and more diversity. As it is, he said, the vast majority of students on his campus share the same socioeconomic background and ideological leanings - evidence that affirmative action has failed to create a true mix of backgrounds and ideas.\n\n\"Colleges ought to take the opportunity to view diversity in a different way, and look for more diverse upbringings and viewpoints,\" said Mr. Wilson, whose father is white and whose mother immigrated to the United States from China.\n\nKhymani James, 19, a rising junior at Columbia University who was raised in public housing in Boston by an immigrant mother from Jamaica, said he had braced for the court's decision for weeks, trying to imagine what college would look like without affirmative action.\n\nHow, he wondered, would his recent history class on the Atlantic slave trade - where Black and white students swapped diverse perspectives - have felt different in a room where more people were white because of the end of affirmative action?\n\n\"It's another attempt to try and erase race and erase racism,\" he said, \"like it doesn't exist.\"\n\nColbi Edmonds contributed reporting.\n\nMichael Powell\n\nIn 2020, with Donald Trump on the ballot, Democratic leaders in California launched a campaign to reinstate race-conscious affirmative action in California.\n\nThe governor and U.S. Senators and state legislators and a who's who of business, pro sport and labor elites banded together, outspent opponents 19 to 1 and declared that restoring affirmative action in college admissions and hiring was a matter of racial and social justice.\n\nYet in a state dominated politically by Democrats and liberals, this referendum, Proposition 16, lost badly, with more than 57 percent of voters opposing it.\n\nA recent Times analysis of that vote exposed a gulf between the party establishment and its voters. The analysis found that the opposition included a majority of Asian American and white voters and half of all Hispanics. Only Black voters offered majority support for the referendum.\n\nThe California results suggest the issue - and the Supreme Court decision - might have far less political salience than some Democratic activists predict.\n\n\"Democrats for decades have supported racial preferences and voters don't like it,\" noted Ruy Teixeira, a political scientist who has studied the issue for decades. \"If you ask people, do they believe race should be a factor in hiring or college admissions, they most often say no.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael D. Shear\n\nMany Democrats want President Biden to expand the Supreme Court to make it more liberal. He rejected that again today, saying, \"If we start the process of trying to expand the court, we're going to politicize it - maybe forever - in a way that is not healthy, that you can't get back.\"\n\nKayla Guo\n\nCongressional Democrats condemned Thursday's Supreme Court decision dismantling race-conscious college admissions as a step backward for racial justice, while Republicans largely celebrated the ruling, saying it would make the process more fair.\n\nDemocrats predicted that the decision would diminish progress on racial justice, and many committed to continue pressing for equal opportunity.\n\n\"The very same extremists\" on the court who overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade precedent that enshrined abortion rights nationwide \"just obliterated consideration of racial diversity in college admissions,\" Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, wrote on Twitter . \"They clearly want to turn back the clock. We will NEVER let that happen.\"\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, pledged a \"commitment to fighting for equal educational opportunities for all\" and said in a statement that the \"misguided decision reminds us how far we still have to go to ensure that all Americans are treated equally.\"\n\nRepublicans expressed jubilation over the decision, which Speaker Kevin McCarthy said would enable students to \"compete based on equal standards and individual merit.\n\n\"This will make the college admissions process fairer and uphold equality under the law,\" he added in a statement.\n\nRepresentative Young Kim, Republican of California, wrote on Twitter that \"race-based education policies divide our nation, undermine global competitiveness, and prevent students from reaching their full potential.\" Ms. Kim, one of the first Korean Americans in Congress, has been outspoken about the case, in which Harvard had been accused of systematically discriminating against Asian American students.\n\nIn a news release, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, highlighted the amicus brief he and other lawmakers including Ms. Kim filed to the court in support of striking down affirmative action.\n\n\"Today the Supreme Court has ended our country's long and failed experiment with racial quotas and government-sanctioned racial discrimination, and, in the process, restored some measure of objectivity and fairness to the college admissions process,\" Mr. Cruz said. \"This is a great day for all Americans.\"\n\nBut Democrats echoed Justice Sonia Sotomayor's blistering dissent, in which she wrote that the court was \"further entrenching racial inequality in education, the very foundation of our democratic government and pluralistic society.\"\n\nRepresentative Shontel Brown, Democrat of Ohio, called the decision a \"disaster.\" \"Pretending racism hasn't shaped America for 500 years just deepens inequities,\" she wrote on Twitter .\n\nAdam Liptak\n\nJustice Jackson seemed taken aback by what she called Justice Thomas's \"prolonged attack\" on her dissent, saying that his opinion \"also demonstrates an obsession with race consciousness that far outstrips my or U.N.C.'s holistic understanding that race can be a factor that affects applicants' unique life experiences.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdam Liptak\n\nJustice Thomas concluded his concurring opinion with notes of realism and optimism: \"While I am painfully aware of the social and economic ravages which have befallen my race and all who suffer discrimination, I hold out enduring hope that this country will live up to its principles so clearly enunciated in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States: that all men are created equal, are equal citizens and must be treated equally before the law.\"\n\nAdam Liptak\n\nJustice Thomas's concurring opinion included an extended attack on the dissent issued by the newest justice and other Black member of the court, Justice Jackson. \"As she sees things,\" Justice Thomas wrote, \"we are all inexorably trapped in a fundamentally racist society, with the original sin of slavery and the historical subjugation of Black Americans still determining our lives today.\"\n\nAdam Liptak\n\nI was struck by the two sides' competing understandings of Brown v. Board of Education, the towering 1954 decision that barred racial segregation in public schools. The lesson of Brown, Chief Justice Roberts wrote, was that \"the time for making distinctions based on race had passed.\"\n\nJustice Sotomayor said that was revisionist history. \"Brown,\" she wrote, \"was a race-conscious decision that emphasized the importance of education in our society.\"\n\nNeil Vigdor\n\nFormer President Barack Obama, who broke the color barrier in the nation's highest office with his election in 2008, denounced the Supreme Court's decision on Thursday to eliminate race-based affirmative action in college admissions.\n\nWriting on the website Medium , Mr. Obama said that the policy had afforded generations of marginalized Americans opportunities that they otherwise would not have received, despite its imperfections.\n\n\"Affirmative action was never a complete answer in the drive towards a more just society,\" he wrote. \"But for generations of students who had been systematically excluded from most of America's key institutions - it gave us the chance to show we more than deserved a seat at the table.\"\n\nMr. Obama, one of many prominent Democrats who lamented the ruling, graduated from Harvard Law School. The university's undergraduate college was a defendant in the Supreme Court case, one in which a group of plaintiffs had argued that Harvard had discriminated against white and Asian applicants by giving preference to Black, Hispanic and Native American ones .\n\nIn his post, Mr. Obama said that the court's ruling was a call to action and directed people to support several organizations that serve marginalized students.\n\nMichelle Obama, the former first lady, echoed him in a statement that accompanied his, writing that affirmative action had been a critical tool for addressing fundamental inequities in education.\n\n\"So often, we just accept that money, power, and privilege are perfectly justifiable forms of affirmative action, while kids growing up like I did are expected to compete when the ground is anything but level,\" she wrote. \"So today, my heart breaks for any young person out there who's wondering what their future holds - and what kinds of chances will be open to them.\"\n\nRepresentative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the House Democratic leader and first Black person to lead either party in Congress , wrote on Twitter that the court's conservative supermajority was chipping away at long-protected tenets, first by overturning Roe. v. Wade last year, and now by striking down affirmative action.\n\n\"Right-wing ideologues on the Supreme Court gutted reproductive freedom last year,\" he wrote. \"The very same extremists just obliterated consideration of racial diversity in college admissions. They clearly want to turn back the clock.\"\n\nSenator Raphael Warnock, Democrat of Georgia, who is also Black, called the court's ruling \"short-sighted\" in a post on Twitter and said that it had ignored continuing inequality.\n\n\"America is great not in spite of its diversity, but because of it,\" he wrote. \"We need public policy that advances our greatness.\"\n\nRepresentative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat with Puerto Rican heritage, admonished the court's conservative wing on Twitter .\n\n\"If SCOTUS was serious about their ludicrous 'colorblindness' claims, they would have abolished legacy admissions,\" she wrote, calling the preferential treatment given to children of alumni \"affirmative action for the privileged.\"\n\nShe noted that 70 percent of Harvard's legacy applicants are white. \"SCOTUS didn't touch that - which would have impacted them and their patrons,\" she wrote.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat whose Native American ancestry claims drew criticism from tribal groups in the past , also panned the ruling.\n\n\"An extremist Supreme Court has once again reversed decades of settled law, rolled back the march toward racial justice, and narrowed educational opportunity for all,\" she wrote on Twitter.\n\nAnd Gov. Gavin Newsom of California chided the justices who voted with the majority.\n\n\"Right-wing activists - including those donning robes - are trying to take us back to the era of book bans and segregated campuses,\" he said in a statement .\n\nAdvertisement"

Urofsky\n\nFor two and a half centuries America enslaved its black population, whose labor was a critical source of the country's capitalist modernization and prosperity. Upon the abolition of legal, interpersonal slavery, the exploitation and degradation of blacks continued in the neoslavery system of Jim Crow, a domestic terrorist regime fully sanctioned by the state and courts of the nation, and including Nazi-like instruments of ritualized human slaughter. Black harms and losses accrued to all whites, both to those directly exploiting them, and indirectly to all enjoying the enhanced prosperity their social exclusion and depressed earnings made possible. When white affirmative action was first developed on a large scale in the New Deal welfare and social programs, and later in the huge state subsidization of suburban housing - a major source of present white wealth - blacks, as the Columbia political scientist Ira Katznelson has shown , were systematically excluded, to the benefit of the millions of whites whose entitlements would have been less, or whose housing slots would have been given to blacks in any fairly administered system. In this unrelenting history of deprivation, not even the comforting cultural productions of black artists were spared: From Thomas \"Daddy\" Rice in the early 19th century right down to Elvis Presley, everything of value and beauty that blacks created was promptly appropriated, repackaged and sold to white audiences for the exclusive economic benefit and prestige of white performers, who often added to the injury of cultural confiscation the insult of blackface mockery.\n\nIt is this inherited pattern of racial injustice, and its persisting inequities, that the American state and corporate system began to tackle, in a sustained manner, in the middle of the last century. The ambitious aim of Melvin I. Urofsky's \"The Affirmative Action Puzzle: A Living History From Reconstruction to Today\" is a comprehensive account of the nonwhite version of affirmative action. This is a complex and challenging historical task, given that \"no other issue divides Americans more.\" But Urofsky, by and large, has executed it well. Following the United States Commission on Civil Rights, he defines affirmative action as a program that provides remedy for the historical and continuing discrimination suffered by certain groups; that seeks to bring about equal opportunity; and that specifies which groups are to be protected. Urofsky explores nearly all aspects of the program - its legal, educational, economic, electoral and gender dimensions, from its untitled beginnings during Reconstruction to the present. The one major missing part of the puzzle in his otherwise thorough account is the military, which is unfortunate since, as the military sociologist Charles Moskos pointed out, \"nowhere else in American society has racial integration gone as far or has black achievement been so pronounced.\" This deserved a long chapter.\n\nUrofsky claims not to make the case for or against affirmative action but admits to being \"conflicted\" on the matter. He distinguishes between what he calls soft and hard affirmative action, the first aimed at removing barriers only, the second attempting positive action that results in the observable betterment of the excluded group. He repeatedly says that he favors soft affirmative action. But, to his credit, the \"facts on the ground\" that he assiduously marshals indicate that merely providing equal opportunity does not work, for reasons eloquently spelled out by President Lyndon Johnson in his celebrated 1965 commencement address at Howard University: \"It is not enough just to open the gates of opportunity. All our citizens must have the ability to walk through those gates.\"\n\nUrofsky reveals that many presidents, administrators and activists, while proclaiming soft affirmative action, have struggled to make it work. Some, like John F. Kennedy, and especially Johnson, as well as Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, have publicly voiced their support for colorblind, anti-quota, equal opportunity only, and individualistic rather than group-based approaches, while quietly allowing their administrators to craft pragmatic programs that did just the opposite, to the benefit of the disadvantaged. Some, like Ronald Reagan and the elder George Bush, have openly attempted to abolish the program but failed. Richard Nixon (who else?) made it the centerpiece of arguably the most Machiavellian strategy in modern American political history: His Philadelphia Plan , with its blatant minority business set-asides and insistence on craft unions' acceptance of blacks, was the most extreme hard version of the program ever undertaken, resulting in major improvements for blacks at all levels of the economy, to the applause of nearly every black leader. But it was also, deliberately, a key element in his notorious Southern strategy , successfully shattering the traditional bond between white working-class union members and the Democratic Party, and paving the way for the Reagan Democrats and the modern Republican ascendancy.\n\nThe nation's jurists have been just as divided in their approaches, and Urofsky deploys his legal expertise to great effect in analyzing the numerous cases that have been argued over the policy. The irony of this struggle is that the courts have reached a compromise, saving the program by completely redefining its rationale from the original aim of remedying centuries of black disadvantage to that of promoting diversity, which, one might argue, could be achieved in the complete absence of blacks. Urofsky's analysis of the DeFunis , Bakke and Weber cases of the 1970s is a gem. It not only clarifies for the layman the cases' legal niceties but also concludes, instructively, that the less celebrated Weber case of 1979, in which it was decided that Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act \"did not foreclose private race-conscious affirmative action plans,\" may have been the most consequential. It gave the private sector far more flexibility than government and academia in designing affirmative action programs.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "That Affirmative Action Ruling Was Good. Its Rationale, Terrible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nIn this legalistic world, sometimes how you win is as important as winning itself.\n\nBy Melissa Murray\n\nMs. Murray is a professor of law at New York University.\n\nOn Tuesday, a federal judge, Allison D. Burroughs, upheld Harvard's use of race-conscious admissions in a legal challenge from Students for Fair Admissions , which claims the school was unfairly denying Asian-American students in favor of less qualified candidates in violation of the Civil Rights Act. As soon as the lawsuit made news, it set off a host of broader debates about elite institutions, inequality, intra-racial and interracial divisions and the value of meritocracy itself.\n\nWhile the ruling will surely be appealed, the judge came to the correct conclusion, faithfully applying the Supreme Court's well-established standards on including race in admissions decisions. Though not final, the ruling is a victory for both the rule of law and evermore endangered affirmative action policies.\n\nSo why do I feel uneasy? Because how you win is as important as winning itself.\n\nThe court's decision focused on diversity as the sole grounds on which the use of race in admissions may be justified. As Judge Burroughs noted in her ruling, diversity-centered admissions policies can \"enhance the education of students of all races and backgrounds, to prepare them to assume leadership roles in the increasingly pluralistic society into which they will graduate,\" \"broaden the perspectives of teachers\" and \"expand the reach of the curriculum and the range of scholarly interests.\"\n\nHer words echo the standard refrains that have been deployed to defend affirmative action since Justice Lewis Powell's opinion in University of California v. Bakke (1978). Justice Powell famously extolled the virtues of the \" Harvard Plan ,\" which recognized that a \"farm boy from Idaho can bring something to Harvard College that a Bostonian cannot offer.\" The problem, of course, is that thinking about diversity in terms of what beneficiaries might contribute makes the benefits of affirmative action contingent and conditional - worthy only because its beneficiaries serve the broader needs of institutions and those who are assumed to belong.\n\nThe jurisprudence on which the Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard opinion was based also insists that race-conscious admissions come with an expiration date: Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the deciding vote in 2003's Grutter v. Bollinger ruling upholding affirmative action, wrote that \" 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary .\" Just 16 years later, such a forecast seems naïve - especially in light of recent academic and journalistic work that has detailed the persistent way that racial wealth gaps and implicit and explicit discrimination limit opportunity. Still, Judge Burroughs elided these realities, writing that \"the benefits that flow from that diversity will foster the tolerance, acceptance and understanding that will ultimately make race conscious admissions obsolete.\"\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

But an analysis of a California referendum points to a divide between the party and voters.\n\nBy Michael Powell and Ilana Marcus\n\nThe 2020 campaign to restore race-conscious affirmative action in California was close to gospel within the Democratic Party. It drew support from the governor, senators, state legislative leaders and a who's who of business, nonprofit and labor elites, Black, Latino, white and Asian.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors, San Francisco Giants and 49ers and Oakland Athletics urged voters to support the referendum, Proposition 16, and remove \"systemic barriers.\" A commercial noted that Kamala Harris, then a U.S. senator, had endorsed the campaign, and the ad also suggested that to oppose it was to side with white supremacy. Supporters raised many millions of dollars for the referendum and outspent opponents by 19 to 1.\n\n\"Vote for racial justice!\" urged the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California.\n\nNone of these efforts persuaded Jimmie Romero, a 63-year-old barber who grew up in the working-class Latino neighborhood of Wilmington in Los Angeles. Homelessness, illegal dumping, spiraling rents: He sat in his shop and listed so many problems.\n\nAffirmative action was not one of those.\n\n\"I was upset that they tried to push that,\" Mr. Romero recalled in a recent interview. \"It was not what matters.\"\n\nMr. Romero was one of millions of California voters, including about half who are Hispanic and a majority who are Asian American, who voted against Proposition 16, which would have restored race-conscious admissions at public universities, and in government hiring and contracting.\n\nThe breadth of that rejection shook supporters. California is a liberal bastion and one of the most diverse states in the country.

It said the court's decision \"does not require institutions to ignore race when identifying prospective students for outreach and recruitment,\" as long as all students, whether targeted or not, \"enjoy the same opportunity to apply and compete for admission\" into the recruitment programs.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Howard University would be a stretch.\n\nSo when his guidance counselor summoned him because \"someone from Brown is coming,\" Mr. Hale recalls, the Ivy League school did not register.\n\n\"Brown?\" Mr. Hale remembered thinking. \"Brown who? Charlie Brown?\"\n\nMr. Hale, who ended up accepting a full academic scholarship to Wesleyan University in Connecticut, could not have known then that he would be part of the first large cohort of high-school graduates to be shaped by race-conscious admissions. Or that the practice would become a lightning rod for decades-long debates about racial justice, meritocracy and educational inequities.\n\nBrown University was not the only college that fall to recruit for the first time from schools with high concentrations of Black students.\n\nIn the spring of 1969, one year after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Yale enrolled a record 96 Black students, according to the historian Henry Louis Gates Jr. , who was one of them.\n\nThe expectation that the U.S. Supreme Court will soon end or limit race-conscious admissions in cases against Harvard and the University of North Carolina has elicited an array of partisan reactions: dismay from some liberals who say that would represent a step backward for the country; hope from others that class-conscious admissions could make up for the loss, while easing racial tensions; and relief from conservatives, who believe that race-conscious admissions is unconstitutional.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "How Will the Supreme Court Rule on Affirmative Action?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nNotebook\n\nBy Emily Bazelon and Adam Liptak\n\nThe United States Supreme Court will hear arguments on Dec. 9 in Fisher v. University of Texas, a case challenging affirmative action in university admissions. Emily Bazelon, a staff writer for the magazine, and Adam Liptak, The Times's Supreme Court correspondent, have been exchanging emails about the possible outcomes of the case and what they might mean at a moment of debate over race in American higher education.\n\nAdam,\n\nIt's been a season of attention to racial inequality on American college campuses . Across the country, sometimes eloquently and sometimes not (these are 18-to-22-year-olds), minority students and their supporters have channeled the spirit of Black Lives Matter and demanded more. More black and Hispanic and Asian and Native American faculty members. More resources. A greater sense of belonging.\n\nThe Supreme Court may be poised to make them settle for less, in the most basic form: fewer seats in the future entering college and university classes.\n\nThe justices will hear arguments on Wednesday in Fisher v. University of Texas, a case that challenges the consideration that the University of Texas, Austin, gives to race in admission. This is the second time the court has heard the claims of Abigail Fisher, a white woman who didn't get into U.T. Austin seven years ago. The university says Fisher wouldn't have gotten in even if race had played no role in the decision, because her other qualifications were lacking. Nonetheless, the justices let her case proceed, and now they've brought it back for a second round. That is not a good sign for supporters of affirmative action.\n\nU.T. Austin admits 75 percent of the freshman class based on what's called the Top 10 Percent Plan, which gives seats to students from Texas who graduate in the top 10 percent of their high schools. (California and Florida, which have banned race-conscious admissions, use top-percent plans for their public universities, too.) The courts call this approach to admissions \"race neutral,\" even though it depends on residential and school segregation to achieve a racially diverse student body. In Texas, more than half of Hispanic students and 40 percent of black students attend a school where minority enrollment is 90 percent or higher, according to the latest opinion of the appeals court in this case, and at those schools, they will be in the top 10 percent of their classes.\n\nU.T. Austin awards the remaining 25 percent of spots based on what it calls \"holistic\" admissions. The officials making the calls look at academic achievements, like grades and test scores, and also personal factors, like essays, leadership qualities, extracurricular activities, work experience, community service, socioeconomic status, family composition and, yes, race. Including race on the list doesn't appear to put a heavy thumb on the scale for black and Hispanic students. They are actually underrepresented in the holistic part of the admissions process: White students are disproportionately more likely to get in through this door. Over all, U.T. Austin's entering class in 2008, the year Abigail Fisher was denied admission, was less than 6 percent black and about 20 percent Hispanic. These numbers are also disproportionately white, compared with the state's population, which in 2010 was about 12 percent black and about 38 percent Hispanic.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "Justice Dept. Will Investigate California Universities Over Race in Admissions\n\nCampus Crackdown\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nCalifornia banned affirmative action decades ago. The Trump administration says it plans to investigate whether schools there are still considering race.\n\nBy Stephanie Saul\n\nThe Department of Justice said on Thursday that it would investigate whether several California universities were complying with the Supreme Court's 2023 decision banning the consideration of race in admissions.\n\nThe checks, which the Justice Department described as \"compliance review investigations,\" would target Stanford University and three schools in the University of California system - Berkeley, Los Angeles, and Irvine - according to an announcement released by Attorney General Pam Bondi.\n\n\"President Trump and I are dedicated to ending illegal discrimination and restoring merit-based opportunity across the country,\" Ms. Bondi said in a statement.\n\nIt was not clear whether similar compliance reviews would be conducted at other colleges or universities across the nation.\n\nThe lawsuits that were the basis for the Supreme Court decision, in the case known as Students for Fair Admissions, were filed against Harvard University and the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.\n\nPlaintiffs in that case used statistical evidence, including standardized test scores, to support the contention that some racial groups, including Black and Hispanic students, had been given preferences in admissions. The plaintiffs argued the practice violated the 14th Amendment.\n\nUnlike schools in most states, however, California public colleges and universities have been prohibited from using affirmative action in college admissions since Proposition 209 was adopted in 1996.\n\nEnrollment of Black and Hispanic students and other minority groups dropped precipitously in the more selective public schools in California after the proposition was enacted. Since then it has rebounded at least somewhat. For example, Black enrollment at U.C.L.A. fell to 3.43 percent in 1998 from 7 percent before Proposition 209 was adopted. By 2019, it had increased to 5.98 percent. (California's population is 6.5 percent Black.)\n\nAs a private school, Stanford did not fall under the Proposition 209 requirements.\n\nStanford said in a statement that it had taken steps to comply with the Supreme Court decision and that it was \"committed to fulfilling our obligations under the law.\" The statement added that the school had not received any details about the investigation from the Justice Department.\n\nThe University of California system was not immediately available to comment on the Justice Department announcement.\n\nThe review follows a lawsuit filed in February accusing the University of California system of violating protections against racial discrimination in admissions. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit, Students Against Racial Discrimination, which was organized by a persistent critic of affirmative action, asked for a court order requiring that the system select students \"in a colorblind manner,\" to \"eliminate the corrupt and unlawful race and sex preferences that subordinate academic merit to so-called diversity considerations.\"\n\nSeparately on Thursday, the Department of Health and Human Services said it was launching an investigation into accusations that a \"major medical school\" in California had used discriminatory admissions practices. It did not specify which school.\n\nStephanie Saul reports on colleges and universities, with a recent focus on the dramatic changes in college admissions and the debate around diversity, equity and inclusion in higher education.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Affirmative Action and the Supreme Court's Troubled Treatment of Asian Americans\n\nOn Monday, I was at the Supreme Court for five hours of oral arguments on affirmative action . In constitutional debates about the issue, both sides like to lay claim to Justice John Marshall Harlan's celebrated dissent in Plessy v. Ferguson-the 1896 case that notoriously held that requiring separate train cars for Black and white passengers did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, and that was eventually overruled in Brown v. Board of Education. Harlan wrote, \"In view of the Constitution, in the eye of the law, there is in this country no superior, dominant, ruling class of citizens. There is no caste here. Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.\" Predictably, the plaintiff in the two current affirmative-action cases, Students for Fair Admissions , takes the \"color-blind\" language to mean that the equal-protection clause forbids all racial classifications for any purpose, including race-based affirmative action. The defendants, Harvard and the University of North Carolina, along with the U.S. government as amicus, instead take the anti-caste idea to prohibit subjugation based on notions of racial inferiority-which surely allows race-conscious measures to insure diversity.\n\nBut read just a bit further in Harlan's famous dissent, and you're hit with a meaning that's not so debatable, in lines that are not so frequently quoted: \"There is a race so different from our own that we do not permit those belonging to it to become citizens of the United States. Persons belonging to it are, with few exceptions, absolutely excluded from our country. I allude to the Chinese race.\" Harlan's aim was clearly to recognize Black citizens' equal membership in the polity. Along the way, he also treated as a given that, because of racial difference, Chinese people were prevented from entering the country, and excluded from participation in its political life and from the civil rights of white and Black citizens. Harlan's assumption was consistent with decades of American governance. In the years after the Civil War, both Republicans and Democrats portrayed the Chinese arriving on the Pacific Coast as an invading horde, a heathen, unassimilable people. Congress barred Asian women suspected of prostitution in 1875 and passed the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882. In the Senate, lawmakers supporting the exclusion of Chinese called them a \"degraded and inferior race,\" and said that their \"machine-like\" ways made it difficult for U.S. laborers to compete. (The law was repealed in 1943, just in time for the Court to hold that the internment of Japanese Americans did not violate the Constitution.)\n\nThe Harvard and U.N.C. cases, in which the Court is expected to undermine or eliminate race-based affirmative action, are among the few Supreme Court cases in history that explicitly involve Asian Americans. The cases address Asian Americans' uncertain place in American society, and the Court is considering them in a period of increased anti-Asian violence. I am an Asian American supporter of affirmative action who attended élite universities, and the first Asian American woman to be tenured at Harvard Law School. For all these reasons, I wanted to be in the courtroom for the oral arguments. What I observed by being there in person was a striking contrast between the overrepresentation of Asians at selective universities and the paucity of Asians present at such an important moment in the highest court in the land. Apart from Ryan Park, arguing as North Carolina's solicitor general, and William Lee, who had been the trial lawyer in the Harvard case, there were almost no Asians in attendance among the scores of members of the Supreme Court bar and the public. I was also one of a tiny number of Asians, and perhaps the only East Asian person, among the many dozens of reporters in the press seats.\n\nSeveral Justices on the Court, which also obviously lacks Asians, emphasized that universities are the \"pipeline\" to diverse leadership, and that the representation of minorities in leadership positions cannot improve if they are not admitted in sufficient numbers to selective universities. To support the point, Elizabeth Prelogar, the U.S. Solicitor General, pointed out that only two out of the twenty-seven lawyers arguing in the Court in late October to early November are women. \"I think it would be reasonable for a woman to look at that and wonder, Is that a path that's open to me, to be a Supreme Court advocate?\" This \"common-sense example,\" which she hoped \"would resonate with this Court,\" though important, was somewhat inapt, because women today account for, as she said, \"fifty per cent or more of law-school graduates\"-including of the most élite schools. The problem in the case of women is real, but it is plainly not a university-pipeline issue. (Justice Elena Kagan had, minutes earlier, mentioned \"statistical evidence that suggests that colleges now, when they apply gender-neutral criteria, get many more women than men.\") Prelogar's point did, however, inadvertently underline the fact that, for Asians, as for women, robust representation among university students has been slow to translate to leadership positions in our country, particularly in the worlds of government, rarified legal advocacy, the media, the judiciary, and the Court itself.\n\nThis exchange did seem to reflect the awkward mismatch contained in these cases. S.F.F.A. is asking the Court to declare race-conscious affirmative action unlawful-and that Harvard and U.N.C. in fact discriminated against Asian Americans. But, as evidence in the Harvard case in particular suggested, the practice of race-conscious admissions is not what has limited the number of Asian American students; it is instead the parts of the process in which Harvard claims not to think about race at all.\n\nThe strongest aspect of the discrimination claim against Harvard involves something called the personal rating. As early as 1969, the Crimson reported that the personal rating, assigned by admissions officers based on interviews, high-school officials' reports, and essays, \"has become by far the most important factor in Harvard's admissions process,\" because the increased academic strength of the applicant pool was making it harder to select students based on grades and test scores. It reported that, for the class of 1968, \"there is just about no correlation between admission to Harvard and such factors as SAT scores, rank-in-class, and predicted rank list,\" but \"the correlation between admissions and the personal factor is better than 90 per cent.\" The article quoted the dean of admissions saying, \"We are justified and obligated to trust a hunch.\"\n\nWhen the Harvard case first went to trial, in 2018, S.F.F.A. alleged that Harvard uses the personal rating, in which admissions officers score applicants on qualities such as \"integrity, helpfulness, courage, kindness,\" even \"effervescence,\" to discriminate against Asian American applicants. Admissions records showed that, despite alumni interviewers, who met with applicants, having given Asian students scores that were as high or higher than those of white students, admissions officers, who normally did not meet with applicants, gave Asians the lowest personal ratings of any racial group. The trial, which I attended, focussed on these disconcerting questions: Did Asian students, who had higher academic and extracurricular ratings than white applicants, actually have worse personalities than all others? Or was the personal rating concealing an impermissible racial quota?\n\nThe discussion was obviously charged, evoking the old idea of Asians as \"a race so different from our own,\" as Harlan put it, whose \"machine-like\" qualities make it hard to compete, as senators feared. It also excavated Harvard's use of \"diversity,\" including geographical diversity, a century ago, as a mechanism to limit the admissions of Jews, who were also perceived as lacking character. But, in the end, the district court rejected the most sinister readings of the personal rating. It found that Harvard's admissions process \"may reflect some implicit biases\" that, \"while regrettable, cannot be eliminated in a process that must rely on judgments about individuals,\" and that \"a few identified imperfections\" in the system did not amount to intentional discrimination against Asians.\n\nAt Monday's arguments, Justice Samuel Alito grilled Harvard about Asians' low personal ratings. \"It has to be one of two things. It has to be that they really do lack integrity, courage, kindness, and empathy to the same degree as students of other races, or there has to be something wrong with this personal score,\" he said. \"Why are they given a lower score than any other group?\" The question was one that Harvard's lawyer must have been preparing to answer for at least four years. And yet the seasoned Supreme Court advocate Seth Waxman, a former U.S. Solicitor General, seemed cornered and stuck. During several uncomfortable minutes, he at first tried to deflect the question; then, somewhere in the midst of multiple attempts by Alito to get him to answer, an assist from the Chief Justice, and Waxman's telling assurance, \"I'm not trying to filibuster you,\" he managed to say that the personal ratings reflect \"what teachers said, what guidance counselors said, what these students wrote\" in essays. (Those inputs would have to be quite poor to offset the alumni interviewers' high scores.) In other words, Asian applicants deserved the low personal ratings-or, perhaps, if there was any discrimination, it was by high-school officials, not Harvard.\n\nIt is conceivable that the Court could hold that the district court erred in finding that Harvard did not discriminate against Asians in assigning personal ratings, but such a ruling would not necessarily overrule cases allowing affirmative action; rather, it would mean that Harvard defied the Court's precedents. It's more likely that the Court will use this case to end or severely limit affirmative action, without disturbing the district court's factual conclusion that Asians didn't suffer intentional discrimination here. Such a decision would not make personal ratings go away, given that Harvard says they are supposed to be assigned without considering race. If the Court prohibits the use of race, so that race-neutral methods become the only permissible means to achieve diversity, schools will likely play with formulas to produce a diverse class in which Asian admissions don't get unacceptably out of proportion. They may reduce reliance on race-neutral factors in which Asians have done well, such as standardized tests, and increase reliance on race-neutral factors in which Asians have not done as well. The personal rating and similar mushy factors could become far more determinative, because they are places where admissions officers will continue to have great discretion to bump applicants up or down based on subjective assessments so long as they are not consciously using race. Prohibiting the explicit reliance on race may even push universities to fall back on the cover of implicit bias, which is not unlawful discrimination. This could leave Asian applicants worse off than they are now. If anything, the personal-ratings morass may suggest that what's needed to check unconscious biases are more transparently and forthrightly race-conscious efforts, not less.\n\nIn the U.N.C. case, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson worried that if \"a university can take into account and value all of the other background and personal characteristics of other applicants, but they can't value race,\" that policy could actively disadvantage minorities who wish to convey the importance of race in their lives. But S.F.F.A. suggested that eliminating affirmative action does not mean disallowing applicants from writing about their racial backgrounds, or blinding admissions officers from knowing the race of an applicant. S.F.F.A.'s lawyer against U.N.C., Patrick Strawbridge, said that, though admissions officers could not credit an applicant's race, they could credit an applicant's cultural experience as an African immigrant. Kagan observed, \"The race is part of the culture and the culture is part of the race, isn't it? I mean, that's slicing the baloney awfully thin.\" Cameron Norris, S.F.F.A.'s lawyer against Harvard, said, \"Culture, tradition, heritage are all not off-limits for students to talk about and for universities to consider.\" He continued, \"They can't read that and say, 'Oh, this person is Hispanic or Black or Asian, and, therefore, I'm going to credit that.' They need to credit something unique and individual in what they actually wrote, not race itself.\"\n\nIt seems that what S.F.F.A. is insisting on is a formal conceptual distinction-between crediting \"race itself\" and crediting individuals' stories about their racial backgrounds-that makes little practical difference. If the Court issues a ruling that tracks with this idea, then, after affirmative action is gone, schools will not give any applicant a plus for \"race itself,\" but they will still consider race in the context of an applicant's story. One has to wonder if Harvard and U.N.C. have spent a lot of money and time to fight the implementation of a rule that wealthy universities, at least, could, with some inconvenience, work around. Does it matter whether a plus is deemed to be awarded for \"race itself\" or for applicants' resilience, thoughtfulness, or insight regarding their experience of their race? Justice Clarence Thomas is known for dismissing the goal of educational diversity as \"racial aesthetics.\" But the thin baloney slicing that may result here makes me think that the elimination of affirmative action could itself be a form of racial aesthetics, in which the Court declares that considering race is impermissible, knowing full well that the practice will necessarily continue, implicitly, in holistic reviews of stories that applicants tell.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor made the point most plainly, saying that relying on race-neutral alternatives, including socioeconomic status, are really \"all subterfuges to reaching some sort of diversity in race.\" She echoed Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's dissent in Gratz v. Bollinger, the 2003 case in which the Court held that a school could not automatically award extra points to underrepresented racial minorities. Ginsburg anticipated that what universities cannot do \"in full candor,\" they \"may resort to camouflage\" to accomplish: \"For example, schools may encourage applicants to write of their cultural traditions in the essays they submit, or to indicate whether English is their second language. Seeking to improve their chances for admission, applicants may highlight the minority group associations to which they belong, or the Hispanic surnames of their mothers or grandparents. In turn, teachers' recommendations may emphasize who a student is as much as what he or she has accomplished.\" The same would be even more true when affirmative action is officially gone, and schools may not straightforwardly give applicants the option of checking a box for race. As Justice David Souter, for whom I clerked, said in his own dissent in Gratz, \"Equal protection cannot become an exercise in which the winners are the ones who hide the ball.\" Meanwhile, the Asian Americans whose alleged treatment formed the factual bases of these cases could fairly be saddened to see both sides in the Supreme Court push aside the heart of their complaint in favor of further ball-hiding exercises. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Why the Champions of Affirmative Action Had to Leave Asian Americans Behind\n\nNearly a decade has passed since Students for Fair Admissions, or S.F.F.A., first filed a lawsuit against Harvard University over its race-based admissions policies. During that time, not much has changed about the particulars of the case, nor how they have been processed by both the courts and the public. The announcement of the Supreme Court's ultimate ruling in the case-a 6-3 decision that effectively ends affirmative action in college admissions and most likely beyond-did not contain any surprises. Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the majority, argued that \"many universities have for too long wrongly concluded that the touchstone of an individual's identity is not challenges bested, skills built, or lessons learned, but the color of their skin.\" Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, in dissent, wrote about \"gulf-sized race-based gaps\" and argued that racial preferences in admissions were necessary to address \"the well-documented 'intergenerational transmission of inequality' that still plagues our citizenry.\"\n\nAsian Americans, the group whom the suit was supposedly about, have been oddly absent from the conversations that have followed the ruling. The repetitiveness of the affirmative-action debate has come about, in large part, because both the courts and the media have mostly ignored the Asian American plaintiffs and chosen, instead, to relitigate the same arguments about merit, white supremacy, and privilege. During the five years I spent covering this case, the commentators defending affirmative action almost never disproved the central claim that discrimination was taking place against Asian Americans, even as they dismissed the plaintiffs as pawns who had been duped by a conservative legal activist . They almost always redirected the conversation to something else-often legacy admissions.\n\nThe deflections were understandable. The evidence the plaintiffs had amassed that Harvard, in particular, discriminated against Asian applicants through a bizarre and unacceptable \"personal rating\" system is overwhelming. These facts, and, more important, the conservative composition of the Supreme Court, placed the defenders of affirmative action in a bit of a discursive and legal corner. If you acknowledged that Harvard was, in fact, engaging in behavior that by any reasonable standard would be considered discriminatory and rooted in harmful stereotypes, it was nearly impossible to then turn around and say that the university should have the right to conduct its admissions in whatever manner it pleased. Why would anyone trust Harvard to do anything?\n\nAn air of inevitability also hung over the Court's decision, which mostly made the specific claims of the plaintiffs irrelevant. The end of affirmative action really started in 1978, with Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.,'s opinion in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke-the first Supreme Court case on the matter-which tried to split the difference between a divided Court by arguing that the race of a candidate could be considered, but not as part of a reparative, quota-based program that tried to reduce the harms of slavery and injustice. Rather, race could only be considered by an admissions office that wanted, for the benefit of itself and its students, to produce a \"diverse\" student body.\n\nAffirmative action, in my view, was doomed from that moment forward because it had been stripped of its moral force. It is one thing to argue that slavery, lynchings, Jim Crow laws, mass incarceration, and centuries of theft demand an educational system that factors in the effects of those atrocities. If that principle were to express itself in, say, a Black student who was descended from slaves and had grown up in poverty in an American inner city receiving a bump on his application when compared with a rich private-school kid from the suburbs, so be it. But that is not, in fact, how affirmative action usually plays out at élite schools. Most reporting on the subject-including my own, as well as a story in the Harvard Crimson -shows that descendants of slaves are relatively underrepresented among Black students at Harvard, compared with students from upwardly mobile Black immigrant families. It is easy and perhaps virtuous to defend the reparative version of affirmative action; it is harder to defend the system as it has actually been used.\n\nPowell's decision gave schools like Harvard-where, according to a study published in 2017, only four and a half per cent of the student body came from the bottom twenty per cent of the nation's income earners and fifteen per cent of students came from families who make more than six hundred and thirty thousand dollars a year-the leeway to corrupt the original spirit of affirmative action and turn it into a counting game for rich kids. Harvard did not have to pursue such a comical vision of social justice. It could have vastly expanded its class sizes, relaxed its admissions standards, and cut off its pipelines from exclusive private schools. It could have opened its doors to hundreds of community-college transfers. If Harvard were truly committed to increasing access to an élite education, it could have invested a fraction of its fifty-three-billion-dollar endowment in free college-preparatory academies across America and guided hundreds of poor Black and Latino students through the university's gates.\n\nHarvard, of course, did none of this and chose instead to chase an absurd and empty vision of diversity that allowed it to stay as exclusive as possible. Institutional arrogance and the refusal to actually produce a defensible affirmative-action system made the university an easy mark for conservative legal activists.\n\nBut there were other legal factors that made the decision inevitable. Prior law dictated that race could only be used as a \"positive\" when it came to college admissions and not as a \"negative,\" which was in line with the equal-protection clause. What \"negative\" meant was quite simple: your race could not harm your chances, nor could stereotypes be used to make negative assumptions about you. In Grutter v. Bollinger , the 2003 affirmative-action case concerning the University of Michigan's law school, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor famously expressed the hope that the practice would no longer be necessary in \" twenty-five years ,\" which effectively placed a timer on how long race-based admissions would be around. Affirmative action was toppled five years ahead of schedule, simply because an admissions office clearly relied upon stereotypes-in this case, casting many Asian applicants as hardworking grinds with little personality. (Harvard has consistently denied that this is the case.)\n\nIt is almost certain that élite schools such as Harvard will more or less carry on with their diversity missions, albeit with even less transparency than before. On Thursday, the Times published a story about how selective colleges will achieve racial diversity through other means , including teacher recommendations and personal essays. Jeannie Suk Gersen has also argued in these pages that such so-called proxy programs will likely allow these schools to maintain the number of Black and Latino students on their campuses. Such practices, along with the elimination of standardized testing, will probably have the effect of capping the number of Asian students admitted-which means that despite winning a multiyear lawsuit in the highest court in the land, S.F.F.A. and its supporters may actually find themselves in an even more opaque and arbitrary admissions climate than before.\n\nSo where did Asians actually fit into this picture, as imagined by the defenders of affirmative action? The word \"Asian\" appears only three times in Justice Jackson's twenty-nine-page dissent-once as a footnote, once as part of a list of median household incomes compared across racial groups, and then again as part of the following statement: \"a higher percentage of the most academically excellent in-state Black candidates . . . were denied admission than similarly qualified White and Asian American applicants.\" The dissent, which details the lengthy history of discrimination against Black people, never mentions the history of racism against Asians in America, whether the lynching of Chinese immigrants in the nineteenth century, the Chinese Exclusion Act, or Japanese internment. If a society should make decisions with a clear eye toward history-a sentiment I agree with-shouldn't it also follow that a group who was expelled from the U.S. would at least have the right to not be lumped in with the people who kicked them out? Shouldn't their contemporary claims of discrimination warrant some serious consideration?\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor's dissent discusses Asian Americans a bit more, and acknowledges they also suffer from racism, but her defense of affirmative action goes further in showing how Asians are shortchanged in the undignified competition to join America's multicultural élite. \"There is no question that the Asian American community continues to struggle against potent and dehumanizing stereotypes in our society,\" Sotomayor writes. \"It is precisely because racial discrimination persists in our society, however, that the use of race in college admissions to achieve racially diverse classes is critical to improving cross-racial understanding and breaking down racial stereotypes.\"\n\nIn Sotomayor's telling, Asian Americans who are concerned about being racially stereotyped should attend \"diverse\" universities, where they can help dispel people's misconceptions by simply existing and getting along with their peers. She then goes on to argue that race-conscious admissions allow Asian American applicants \"who would be less likely to be admitted without a comprehensive understanding of their background\" to \"explain the value of their unique background heritage, and perspective\" and allow colleges to \"consider the vast differences within [that] community.\" It's hard not to read this as a premise for Asian American teen-agers to essentially dance for acceptance, or to try to distinguish themselves from other Asian Americans by explaining to the good people at the Harvard admissions office why, say, a Vietnamese applicant is more valuable to the Ivy League cultural texture than just another Chinese one.\n\nThese opinions betray the corruption of affirmative action's original righteous, reparative promise, and the way in which a program that was designed for a racially binary America never got meaningfully updated for today's multiracial democracy. After five years of covering this story, I have found very little to admire about how élite colleges played their decadent racial-preference game. While I do believe that most colleges will be able to maintain some kind of racial diversity on their campuses, I have no faith that the processes they use to do so will be any better than the broken system they're trying to replace. The conversation will not change. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "The Supreme Court Appears Ready, Finally, to Defeat Affirmative Action\n\nOpponents of affirmative action in university admissions couldn't possibly have had better news than the Supreme Court's announcement, on Monday, that it will hear two cases organized by Edward Blum, the anti-affirmative-action crusader. The first, a lawsuit against Harvard alleging that it discriminates against Asian American applicants, was unsuccessful in federal district court in Boston, and unsuccessful again in the First Circuit Court of Appeals. It's hard to imagine that the Supreme Court took the case because it wanted to affirm the lower courts' rulings. The second case, a suit against the University of North Carolina, was similarly unsuccessful in federal district court. The Supreme Court took the highly unusual measure of short-circuiting the next step, an appeal to the Fourth Circuit-instead bringing it directly to Washington and pairing it with the Harvard case.\n\nThe message is clear: the Supreme Court wants to consider decisively departing from a long string of decisions that have permitted the use of race as a plus factor in admissions. These have been close decisions, made on narrow grounds, usually with a moderate conservative Justice holding the balance of power. Now there are no moderate conservatives on the Supreme Court. Assuming that President Biden will have succeeded in getting a successor to Justice Stephen Breyer seated before the Court hears the case, we can expect a strongly worded 6-3 decision insisting on \"color blindness\" in admissions, full stop. That would surely invite further legal challenges to diversity programs in every other area of American life: hiring, contracting, grant-making, and on and on. And if the Biden Administration can't get a new Justice in place before the November midterm elections, it could be an even more lopsided decision.\n\nUniversities began using affirmative action voluntarily, and broadly, in the late nineteen-sixties, for a simple reason: to make themselves more racially integrated. The major pieces of civil-rights legislation had been passed, and it instantly became clear that race was not just a Southern issue that would disappear with the end of the formal Jim Crow system. Most of the leading universities were overwhelmingly white. Integration would introduce their students and faculty-very few of whom had ever been with Black Americans as peers and social equals-to the beginnings of a multiracial society, and provide many more Black students with the opportunity to enter all the worlds to which universities provided entrée. Substantially as a result, the country today has a far more multiracial leadership class, and an immeasurably enriched political, cultural, and intellectual life-and a long way still to go.\n\nThe idea that, at some point in the past, the country had a broad racial consensus that it abandoned with the advent of affirmative action is a mirage. Every step of racial progress has been intensely controversial: emancipation, the passage of the post-Civil War constitutional amendments, the Supreme Court's landmark decisions, the civil-rights legislation of the sixties. And every one remained controversial, the object of intense nullification campaigns, after it became law. The Fourteenth Amendment was enacted and ratified, in 1868, despite Presidential opposition, and remained effectively in force for only a few years; the removal of federal troops from the South in 1877, marking the end of Reconstruction, fatally weakened it. It's conventional wisdom that the ringing, unanimous Brown v. Board of Education decision, in 1954, was made possible by  the death of Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson and his replacement by the more liberal and politically adept Earl Warren, and after the decision came down it provoked a furious reaction. At the March on Washington, in 1963, which we remember for Martin Luther King, Jr.,'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech, the young John Lewis had to be talked out of giving a speech comparing the civil-rights movement to Sherman's march through Georgia. This is not safe or settled history.\n\nIt's ironic that two of these landmarks, the Fourteenth Amendment and the 1964 Civil Rights Act-which were understood as they were enacted, by their proponents and their opponents alike, as being aimed at African American progress-have been, for half a century, and are now again the basis for legal challenges to affirmative action. In admissions, an added good effect of affirmative action is that it awakened universities' awareness of other defects in their system, and so helped lead to the increased presence of women, Latinos, children of immigrants, and children of unprosperous families. But that effect leads to a temptation to misunderstand the main point of affirmative action, which is to be race-conscious. Race wasn't introduced into admissions as a new factor corrupting an original intent to select on class, or on pure academic performance in high school, or to determine somehow who truly deserves the precious admissions slots. It was introduced to integrate, and it has.\n\nLast month, Harvard accepted the first cohort of the class of 2026-a group that is twenty-six per cent Asian American and fourteen per cent Black.  A document submitted by the plaintiffs in the lawsuit now before the Supreme Court, based on internal statistics that Harvard had to release after being sued, includes a simulation of the effect of the kind of \"color-blind\" admissions that the Court seems likely to mandate. It says, after analyzing several years' worth of recent data (test scores, academic ratings, personal ratings, extracurricular ratings, and more):\n\nRemoving preferences for African-American and Hispanic applicants or\ntreating all applicants in a manner similar to whites has dramatic\neffects on the share of admits who are African American or Hispanic,\nespecially for the former. The share of admits who are African\nAmerican falls by over 11 percentage points, a 72% decrease in share.\nFor Hispanics, the share of admits drops 6.9 percentage points, a 46%\ndecrease.\n\nEvery lawsuit opposing affirmative action in admissions has used as evidence scores on the standardized tests that universities require applicants to take. Because of persistent average racial gaps on test scores, which reflect deep and long-standing educational inequities, meaningfully increasing a university's Black student presence requires accepting some Black students with lower test scores than rejected white students. Some of them can then claim to be the victims of racial discrimination. In a very narrow sense, they are: one can't tell whether a specific applicant would have been admitted absent affirmative action, but admitting more students from any category, at such a highly selective institution, inevitably means admitting fewer from other categories. Both Harvard and the University of North Carolina have temporarily suspended their test requirements and, if the Supreme Court does what everyone expects it to do, those suspensions are likely to become permanent. That would not mean, though, that, after an adverse decision, the universities could simply drop standardized tests and there would be no effect on how many Black students they admit. The lawsuits show universities, swamped with tens of thousands of applicants, quantifying just about every aspect of their applicant pools. No doubt a determined litigant would be able to use numbers that aren't test scores to make a case that race is still being used as a plus factor in admissions.\n\nThrough all the decades of controversy about affirmative action, its opponents have often argued that we should fix the entire American educational system so that affirmative action would be unnecessary. That argument assumes that racial integration as an explicit aim is somehow inherently offensive, and it also proposes an almost unimaginably vast project. It would still be a large undertaking, but less so, for universities to reconsider their tendency to quantify every aspect of admissions in ways that, after the Supreme Court decision, will wind up being in conflict with keeping integration at even just its current, hard-won level. Now isn't too soon to begin doing that work.\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Education After Affirmative Action\n\nWhen Supreme Court Justices want to justify overruling long-standing precedent, the paradigm often cited is Brown v. Board of Education, from 1954, which, in declaring segregation unconstitutional, overruled Plessy v. Ferguson and its \"separate but equal\" doctrine, from a half century earlier. During the last term, Justice Samuel Alito offended many people when he compared the Court's overruling of Roe v. Wade to Brown's overruling of Plessy. (He continued to offend people last week, when a new book by John A. Farrell revealed that, during Alito's confirmation hearings, he had privately told Senator Ted Kennedy, in reference to Roe, \"I am a believer in precedents.\")\n\nThis term, the Court will lean more pointedly into Brown's legacy in a pair of cases about the use of race in college admissions. Eight years ago, Students for Fair Admissions, a group founded by the conservative activist Edward Blum, filed lawsuits claiming that the policies of Harvard and the University of North Carolina are racially discriminatory. The universities successfully defended themselves in the lower courts, but the Supreme Court, which hears oral arguments in both cases on October 31st, will likely overrule more than four decades of precedents, and declare that it is unlawful to use race as a factor in admissions.\n\nS.F.F.A. alleged in the 2014 suits that race-conscious affirmative action violates the equal-protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and also Title VI, the statute prohibiting any \"program or activity\" that receives federal funds (this category includes virtually all colleges and universities) from discriminating \"on the ground of race, color, or national origin.\" At the time, this claim was a clear loser under Supreme Court precedents that interpreted both the Constitution and the statute to mean that schools can consider race as one factor in a holistic review of an applicant. Indeed, it was dismissed before trial. But S.F.F.A. also claimed that Harvard and U.N.C. had deviated from those precedents to achieve \"racial balancing,\" which the Court prohibited, and that Harvard had discriminated against Asian Americans in particular. That set of claims against Harvard made it to trial in federal district court in Boston, in 2018, and some of the evidence was troubling, suggesting at least implicit bias against Asian applicants relative to white ones. (The school denied that it discriminated; the percentage of Asians in the entering class has now risen to 27.9 per cent.) But S.F.F.A.'s purported effort to protect Asians is widely seen as a vehicle for Blum's broader agenda, which is to rid society of all so-called racial preferences; he has already shepherded six cases to the Court, including Shelby County v. Holder, which sharply curtailed the Voting Rights Act.\n\nEach university prevailed at trial by proving that it had complied with the Court's precedents. But the Court is hearing the cases to consider whether those precedents-including Regents of the University of California v. Bakke and Grutter v. Bollinger-should themselves be overruled. If it finds that they should, the ruling will also raise doubts about the permissibility of affirmative-action practices in employment, and cast a further shadow on race-conscious efforts to protect voting rights.\n\nFor decades, conservative Justices have read Brown as standing not for an anti-subordination idea but, rather, for a color-blindness principle that disapproves of determinations that consider race. That reading claims to find support in Justice John Marshall Harlan's famous dissent in Plessy, in which he stated, \"Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.\" Chief Justice John Roberts has repeatedly made clear his distaste for actions that take race into account. In a 2006 case about creating majority-minority voting districts in Texas, he wrote, \"It is a sordid business, this divvying us up by race.\" A year later, in explaining why the Court disallowed Seattle from undertaking a race-conscious measure to ameliorate de-facto segregation in public schools, he wrote the highly quotable line \"The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\" It was a polar rejoinder to Justice Harry Blackmun in his concurrence in Bakke: \"In order to get beyond racism, we must first take account of race. There is no other way.\"\n\nWhat has been contested since Brown is what, exactly, \"discrimination on the basis of race\" means. For conservative Justices, it appears to mean taking account of race in any way, even to remedy the effects of prior discrimination. When Harvard went to trial, in 2018, it said that the consequences of not considering applicants' race would be dire: fewer than half the Black students and fewer than two-thirds of the Hispanic students admitted to the class of 2019 would be accepted. But, if affirmative action is ruled unlawful, Harvard and other schools will surely not abandon their commitment to diversity, which they understand as indispensable to the educational mission-in part because the Court itself has said so for decades, holding, in Bakke and in Grutter, that promoting diversity is a \"compelling interest.\" Those schools will then need to turn to a variety of methods that are race-neutral but may still help to achieve racially diverse results.\n\nOne of the most widely discussed of those methods involves standardized tests. The pandemic gave Harvard and other top universities an urgent reason to make the submission of SAT and ACT scores optional, but more could follow the University of California system, which last year ended the consideration of all standardized-test scores in a settlement with students who alleged that the tests disadvantaged, among other groups, racial minorities (excepting Asians). Another possibility is to promote students from low-income families or neighborhoods, or from poorly funded schools, which have a high concentration of underrepresented minorities. But the coming years will undoubtedly bring an onslaught of litigation about whether strategies designed to produce a diverse class without using applicants' race are themselves unlawful.\n\nThe Court's view, in its affirmative-action precedents, has been that educational diversity is a foundation for a multiracial democracy. Rejecting those precedents would be a key piece of a \"color-blind\" vision, in which race-conscious efforts to insure citizens' equal rights are seen as discriminatory. At the heart of the issue is which definitions of discrimination and equality best fit our democracy. The character of that democracy hangs in the balance. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "The End of Affirmative Action\n\nAny proper obituary for affirmative action (1961-2023) in higher education would be obliged to note that it had been in decline for years before it met its ultimate demise this week. The policy had weathered successive legal challenges dating back to the nineteen-seventies. It was often difficult to tell whether the effect of these suits was to inspire more nuanced and legally sustainable approaches for insuring diversity or to better define the target opponents were aiming at. As with other untimely passings, the scale of what has been lost is difficult to assess in the moment. But not entirely impossible.\n\nThe term \"affirmative action\" was introduced in an executive order issued by President John F. Kennedy on March 6, 1961, articulating a policy of proactively impeding discrimination in hiring. In the ensuing years, there have been many iterations of this practice: numerical targets, or \"quotas,\" in the early days; increasingly sophisticated formulas pegged to goals of diversity more recently. But the common thread was a sober, if imperfect, attempt to grapple with the abiding inequality in American society and to navigate closer to equitable representation in our institutions and opportunities. It yielded significant results as an engine that drove integration in the wake of the civil-rights movement and helped expand the Black middle class.\n\nYet, almost from the outset, critics of the policy could be seen impatiently tapping their watches, questioning how long (white) society was meant to endure the patent unfairness of these racial considerations. (The gender considerations of affirmative action, which were introduced by the Johnson Administration, have been targeted in different ways.) Even its supporters were commonly ambivalent. In the 2003 Grutter v. Bollinger case, which challenged admissions practices at the University of Michigan Law School, the Supreme Court narrowly defended the policy . Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote, \"We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today.\"\n\nYet \"How long?\" was always the wrong question. It presupposed that there was a standard speed at which groups whose disadvantages were the product of centuries of social engineering were meant to recover and achieve. The salient metric was progress, not time. It matters that, half a century after the end of the civil-rights movement, the median net worth of white households was still ten times the median net worth of Black households-a disparity driven by decades of restricted access to education, employment, and housing. These disadvantages were not simply the product of economic class-middle-class Black students in the United States are still more likely to attend schools with fewer resources than their middle-class white peers. Crucially, in the wake of the 1978 Regents of the University of California v. Bakke case, one of the first significant challenges to affirmative action, these factors were discarded as a rationale for the policy in place of a more nebulous (and, presumably, more palatable) pursuit of social and institutional \"diversity.\" It's worth noting that the two suits that Students for Fair Admissions brought, against Harvard and the University of North Carolina, which alleged, among other things, discrimination against Asian American applicants, and which gave the Court's conservatives the opportunity to dismantle affirmative action, were heard in the midst of a concerted multi-state assault on the edifice of diversity that has sprung up in the decades since Bakke.\n\nThe Supreme Court telegraphed its 6-3 vote last October, when the arguments were heard. A Times headline blurted , \"Supreme Court Seems Ready to Throw Out Race-Based College Admissions.\" Notably, Justice Clarence Thomas, whose contempt for affirmative action dates back decades, to his years at Yale Law School and the inscrutable idea that the policy was responsible for the dearth of job offers he received after graduation, specifically questioned the utility of diversity as a goal during oral arguments. \"I've heard the word 'diversity' quite a few times, and I don't have a clue what it means,\" Thomas said. \"It seems to mean everything for everyone.\" This is a specious argument. The many diversity programs in higher education have as their goal fostering heterogeneous communities across lines of nationality, background, interests, talents, and experiences. Of the hundred and sixteen people who have served on the Supreme Court, only two-Justices Thurgood Marshall and Clarence Thomas-knew what it felt like to attend a segregated school as a Black person. This perspective inarguably benefits a body dedicated to adjudicating cases that affect the entire society. The reasoning is not difficult to grasp, even if it is, apparently, difficult to uphold.\n\nThe ultimate impact of this decision will become clearer over time, but it is safe to predict that the result will be fewer students from traditionally underrepresented minorities on college campuses, particularly at the most competitive institutions. In 1998, after the University of California system stripped away race, gender, and ethnicity as a factor in admissions, the number of Black and Latino students enrolled at its most selective schools, Berkeley and U.C.L.A., dropped by some forty per cent. This was not just a product of there being fewer minority students admitted; fewer highly qualified Black and Latino students even applied, perhaps thinking that they wouldn't get in. It's not improbable for a national version of this phenomenon to crop up in coming years. It is also possible that the proportion of Black and Latino students at less well-resourced colleges, which generally have lower graduation rates, will increase. It would not be surprising for this ruling to generate a tide of applications at historically Black colleges and universities, albeit for reasons that signify less over-all opportunity.\n\nThe implications of this decision are not confined to future generations of students. As with abortion rights , this case deals with a policy that the majority of the public supports-in a recent poll, sixty-three per cent of Americans said that the Supreme Court should allow colleges to consider race and ethnicity in admissions-but that the majority of conservatives wished to see ended. The Dobbs decision , last year, furthered suspicions that this Court, with its 6-3 super-majority of conservatives, operates simply to translate Republican priorities into the law of the land. By last fall, faith in the Court had fallen to a new low-just forty-seven per cent of Americans placed \"a great deal\" or \"a fair amount\" of trust in the federal judiciary, reflecting a twenty-point drop from the results of a similar poll just two years earlier. This ruling will potentially exacerbate that distrust, and with good reason. Two decades have passed since Justice O'Connor set a timer for affirmative action's viability, but the train seems to have arrived in the station early. The ruling marks a new departure, and we're heading in the opposite direction from progress. ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "An Unexpected Victory for Affirmative Action\n\nAffirmative action lives. That's the emphatic message of the Supreme Court's decision today in Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, which found that an affirmative-action plan that considers race, among other factors, in college admissions is constitutional.\n\nThe four-to-three ruling is both surprising and important. (Justice Elena Kagan recused herself from the case.) Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the opinion, even though he has been consistently skeptical of affirmative action during his long tenure on the Court. In the Court's last major encounter with affirmative action, Grutter v. Bollinger, in 2003, which dealt with the admissions policy of the University of Michigan Law School, Kennedy dissented from Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's cautious embrace of diversity as a legitimate factor for universities to consider. O'Connor was so conflicted about her own decision that she included, in effect, an expiration date of twenty-five years for any racial considerations.\n\nKennedy's decision today went further than O'Connor's, and he recognized that the benefits of diversity have no expiration date. As Kennedy wrote, \"enrolling a diverse student body promotes cross-racial understanding, helps to break down racial stereotypes, and enables students to better understand persons of different races.\" That will be true indefinitely. In a scathing dissenting opinion, Justice Samuel Alito made a convincing case that Kennedy had gone back on his previous views. The appropriate answer to this criticism is: So what? The Justices have often quoted a famous observation by Justice Felix Frankfurter: \"Wisdom too often never comes, and so one ought not to reject it merely because it comes late.\"\n\nIn this case, Kennedy's wisdom came right on time. The practical significance of the Court's decision is difficult to overstate. The Fisher case has been pending for eight years and was argued twice before the Court. Through all this time, the future of affirmative action has been an open and unresolved question. Kennedy has now put the issue to rest for the foreseeable future. This is a great gift to university-admissions officers, who can act with some confidence that they may consider race as one among many factors, but, more importantly, it's a gift to their institutions. American universities, and the country, will be better off for today's decision.\n\nKennedy values his place as the swing Justice on the Court, and it's possible to see in his opinion a recognition of which way the Court is heading. The Justices are divided in much the same way the country is: four Democratic appointees, and four Republican ones. President Obama has nominated Merrick Garland to fill the vacancy left by Antonin Scalia's death, but the Republicans in the Senate have refused even to hold hearings for him, let alone a vote. This defiance of congressional and constitutional norms is outrageous, and it's also revealing. Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, and his fellow-Republicans see a Presidential election slipping away from their party, and they have made the reasonable calculation that some Democrat-Obama or Hillary Clinton-will fill Scalia's seat. So the Republicans are postponing a five-to-four Democratic majority on the Supreme Court for as long as they can. But that doesn't make that majority any less inevitable.\n\nKennedy must see this, too. The four Democratic appointees have consistently embraced the notion that all institutions are strengthened, not weakened, by diverse membership (as have, for the most part, the American people). That view will surely be in ascendance in any Democrat-dominated Supreme Court. Kennedy could fight that coming wave or try to stay ahead of it. He did the latter, which both honors him and ennobles the country.\n\nOf course, Kennedy and the rest of the Justices are human, and their views sometimes veer in unpredictable and unfortunate directions. Sadly, Kennedy also joined his fellow Republican Justices in blocking the President's immigration plan, which would have allowed some five million undocumented immigrants who are the parents of citizens or permanent residents to apply for work permits in the United States. But the direction of the Court is clear, and on affirmative action, at least, Kennedy chose to lead the way rather than fight a losing battle from behind.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "Thurgood Marshall and the Need for Affirmative Action\n\nThe Supreme Court has gradually narrowed the acceptable grounds for affirmative action since 1978, when it found, in the Bakke case , that racial quotas could not be used in university admissions. That pattern makes the case known as Fisher II , which was argued today, feel momentous: it gives the conservative majority a second chance to decide that the University of Texas at Austin used race in an unconstitutional way when it chose the freshman class in 2008 and rejected the white applicant Abigail Fisher, and to rule that it's unconstitutional for public universities and colleges to take race into account in admissions.\n\nJustice Lewis F. Powell, Jr., wrote the controlling Bakke opinion, in which he held that racial and ethnic classifications were inherently suspect. As his biographer John C. Jeffries, Jr. has explained, Powell wanted to preserve \"for the future the ideal of a color-blind society.\" But, Jeffries continued, Powell believed that giving preference in admissions to well-qualified members of racial and ethnic minorities was \"vital to an integrated society,\" and that outlawing the practice would be, in Powell's words, \"a disaster for the country.\"\n\nSo Powell voted with the four justices who believed that a plan to set aside sixteen seats in a hundred-person class for minority students would be a form of reverse discrimination. But he also voted with the other four justices, who thought that the set-aside program, at the medical school of the University of California, Davis, was a necessary and constitutional response to the nation's history of racial discrimination.\n\nPowell's approach led to the conclusion that there was no difference between positive discrimination designed to include a group and negative discrimination designed to exclude one, and to a preoccupation with how the remedy of affirmative action could be justified, as opposed to why it was needed. The Court required that an affirmative-action program in education prove that it served a compelling interest (educational diversity met that standard) and, in addition, that it was carefully tailored to serve that purpose.\n\nThe dissent by Justice Thurgood Marshall in the Bakke case, all but forgotten in current debates about affirmative action, addressed the need rather than the justification. It is worth reading today, as many communities, universities, and other institutions across the country engage in difficult yet remarkable conversations about race and justice, in which there is a wide consensus that racism continues to degrade the criminal-justice system, corrupt policies on housing and finance, and distort many other elementary parts of American life.\n\nMarshall began , \"I agree with the judgment of the Court only insofar as it permits a university to consider the race of an applicant in making admissions decisions. I do not agree that petitioner's admissions program violates the Constitution. For it must be remembered that, during most of the past 200 years, the Constitution as interpreted by this Court did not prohibit the most ingenious and pervasive forms of discrimination against the Negro. Now, when a state acts to remedy the effects of that legacy of discrimination, I cannot believe that this same Constitution stands as a barrier.\"\n\nFrom the early seventeenth century, he went on, when \"the Negro was dragged to this country in chains to be sold into slavery,\" through the end of the eighteenth century, in America's fundamental law, \"the Framers made it plain that 'we the people,' for whose protection the Constitution was designed, did not include those whose skins were the wrong color.\" The Supreme Court confirmed this view before the Civil War and long after, in the North as well as the South.\n\nEven, Marshall continued, when the Court struck down some Jim Crow laws, which denied blacks \"the opportunity to become doctors, lawyers, engineers, and the like,\" the decisions \"did not automatically end segregation, nor did they move Negroes from a position of legal inferiority to equality. The legacy of years of slavery and of years of second-class citizenship in the wake of emancipation could not be so easily eliminated.\"\n\nAs a result, Marshall wrote, a decade after the civil-rights movement, \"The position of the Negro today in America is the tragic but inevitable consequence of centuries of unequal treatment. Measured by any benchmark of comfort or achievement, meaningful equality remains a distant dream for the Negro.\"\n\nHe presented some basic facts of inequality (\"The median income of the Negro family is only 60% that of the median income of a white family, and the percentage of Negroes who live in families with incomes below the poverty line is nearly four times greater than that of whites\") and concluded, \"In light of the sorry history of discrimination and its devastating impact on the lives of Negroes, bringing the Negro into the mainstream of American life should be a state interest of the highest order. To fail to do so is to ensure that America will forever remain a divided society.\" (As it does today: in 2011, the median income of black families was fifty-eight per cent of the median income of white families, and there were three times as many blacks as whites living below the poverty line.)\n\nThe Roberts Court has dramatically rejected Marshall's view in one case after another. In 2007, in two cases considered together, the Court struck down voluntary plans that were successfully helping to maintain integration in public schools in Louisville, Kentucky, and Seattle, Washington. In 2013, in a case about voting discrimination in Shelby County, Alabama, the Court found that the Justice Department's pre-clearance of changes in voting procedures in districts with histories of persistent discrimination was unconstitutional. In 2014, the Court upheld an amendment to Michigan's constitution that prohibits state universities from considering race in admissions.\n\nIn two of the three cases, Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr., authored an opinion that made plain his strong aversion to the government's use of race as a basis for decision. (\"It is a sordid business, this divvying us up by race,\" he wrote in another opinion.) He had asserted these beliefs in his twenties, as a lawyer in the Reagan White House, and continued to assert them in his thirties, as the principal deputy solicitor general in the first Bush Administration. They define the heart of one of Roberts's major projects as Chief Justice: to make the law color-blind so that the country will become color-blind. As Jeffrey Toobin wrote , in 2009, \"Roberts is clearly moved by the subject of race\" and believes that \"the government should ignore historical or even continuing inequities and never recognize or reward individuals on the basis of race.\"\n\nIn the school-integration case, Roberts said that there was no difference between the racial segregation struck down in Brown v. Board of Education, in 1954, and the racial integration in Louisville and Seattle. The last line of his opinion for the Court famously went , \"The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\" In the voting-rights case, the Court put aside Congress's voluminous findings that pre-clearance of voting requirements remained necessary and that, between 1982 and 2006, the government had relied on it more than seven hundred times to keep discriminatory requirements from going into effect. Roberts wrote , \"Our country has changed, and while any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions.\"\n\nJustice Anthony Kennedy wrote the controlling opinion in the Michigan case. There was no need for Roberts to write a separate one: his brief concurrence showed how personal the issue has become for him. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote provocatively in dissent, \"The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to speak openly and candidly on the subject of race, and to apply the Constitution with eyes open to the unfortunate effects of centuries of racial discrimination.\" Leaving \"race out of the picture entirely,\" Sotomayor said, \"is a sentiment out of touch with reality, one not required by our Constitution, and one that has properly been rejected as not sufficient to resolve cases of this nature.\"\n\nRoberts responded testily, \"But it is not 'out of touch with reality' to conclude that racial preferences may themselves have the debilitating effect of reinforcing precisely that doubt, and-if so-that the preferences do more harm than good. To disagree with the dissent's views on the costs and benefits of racial preferences is not to 'wish away, rather than confront' racial inequality. People can disagree in good faith on this issue, but it similarly does more harm than good to question the openness and candor of those on either side of the debate.\"\n\nIn the heat of dispute about a divisive case on affirmative action, it is understandable that Roberts bristled at being called out of touch with reality. But it is out of touch to believe that his syllogism about race and discrimination is realistic today-that the way to become a color-blind society is to stop being color-conscious. As the Harvard historian and president Drew Gilpin Faust wrote recently, in The New York Review of Books , \"Many Americans in 2015 seem to be taking an unprecedented look at the nation's past, at the legacy of slavery and race that has made us anything but a colorblind society.\"\n\nFaust was writing about the great historian John Hope Franklin, who died in 2009, at the age of ninety-four, and whose work on the myth of the color-blind society Thurgood Marshall relied on in his Bakke dissent. (The Justice wrote, \"As Professor John Hope Franklin has observed, Americans proudly accepted the challenge and responsibility of their new political freedom by establishing the machinery and safeguards that insured the continued enslavement of blacks.\") Franklin's work, as Faust noted, is more relevant today than ever. To advance the color-blind myth, she paraphrased Franklin as saying, \"was not simply a delusion; it was a far more pernicious act of bad faith.\" Faust went on, \"We are neither colorblind nor post-racial. Franklin would have been deeply saddened, but I doubt he would have been surprised, by the events in Ferguson, Staten Island, Charleston, Cleveland, Baltimore. He would have been equally saddened and, one guesses, angered by the recent evisceration of the Voting Rights Act and by the threat to student body diversity in higher education implied by the Supreme Court's decision to reconsider Fisher v. University of Texas .\"\n\nIt is deeply disconcerting when the Chief Justice of the United States believes that the government can and should wish away historical or continuing inequities by asserting that it's time our society started acting as if it's color-blind: that reflects a willful blindness to a tenacious and supremely important challenge in American life, as tragedy after outrage manifestly about race have recently made clear. Roberts's view reinforces the sense that the Court is isolated, ignorant about history that matters, and morally weak. On this issue, the weakness traces back to the opinion of Lewis Powell and his reluctance for the Court to exert any moral authority on the need for affirmative action.\n\nMarshall's dissent in the Bakke case addressed the consequences.\n\n\"I fear that we have come full circle,\" he concluded. \"After the Civil War our Government started several 'affirmative action' programs.\" Referring to landmark rulings in which the Supreme Court cut off Congress's efforts to promote racial equality and then upheld the rule of separate but equal treatment for blacks, he went on, \"This Court in the Civil Rights Cases and Plessy v. Ferguson destroyed the movement toward complete equality. For almost a century no action was taken, and this non-action was with the tacit approval of the courts. Then we had Brown v. Board of Education and the Civil Rights Acts of Congress, followed by numerous affirmative-action programs. Now, we have this Court again stepping in, this time to stop affirmative-action programs of the type used by the University of California.\"\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "At Trial, Harvard's Asian Problem and a Preference for White Students from \"Sparse Country\"\n\nNearly a century ago, Harvard College moved away from admitting students based solely on measures of academic performance. In the nineteen-twenties, the concept of diversity in admissions arose in response to the fear of being overrun by Jewish students, who were considered strong on academic metrics but lacking in qualities of character and personality. As the proportion of Jews threatened to exceed a quarter of each class, Harvard's president, Abbott Lawrence Lowell, proposed limiting Jews to fifteen per cent of the student body. Other Harvard officials balked at such overt discrimination, believing it to be inconsistent with Harvard's liberal tradition, and, instead, formulated a new, inclusive \"policy of equal opportunity\" that would lead to the same outcome as Lowell's proposal. It introduced the consideration of qualitative factors such as personality and background, including \"geographical diversity,\" as part of the admissions process. Representing the diversity of the country meant recruiting and admitting more Midwestern and Southern students, who counterbalanced the droves of Jewish applicants from the Northeast. By the class of 1930, as a result of the new plan, Jewish students made up only ten per cent of Harvard's undergraduates.\n\nThat Harvard plan developed into a holistic admissions process, which has, for decades, expanded the notion of diversity beyond geography. The aspiration to assemble a class that is diverse in myriad ways, and the practice of considering many factors alongside academic accomplishment, among them personal qualities and racial background, became influential at many institutions that saw themselves as responsible for socially engineering the American élite. The Supreme Court, in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, in 1978, hailed the Harvard admissions program as an exemplar of legally permissible affirmative action, in which race is one factor among many taken into consideration in college admissions. According to Harvard's amicus brief, quoted extensively in Bakke, \"the race of an applicant may tip the balance in his favor just as geographic origin or a life spent on a farm may tip the balance in other candidates' cases. A farm boy from Idaho can bring something to Harvard College that a Bostonian cannot offer. Similarly, a black student can usually bring something that a white person cannot offer.\"\n\nLast week, a lawsuit challenging Harvard's admissions process as discriminatory toward Asian-Americans, organized by the affirmative-action opponent Edward Blum, went to trial in the Boston federal courthouse. Among the revelations of the trial's first week was that, to this day, Harvard makes a special effort to recruit students from twenty states that it calls Sparse Country. In his testimony, William Fitzsimmons, the dean of admissions, who has worked in the admissions office since before Bakke, reminisced about his Harvard roommate in the nineteen-sixties, who was \"a great ambassador\" for South Dakota. He also testified about the letters Harvard sends to high-school students in Sparse Country who have P.S.A.T. scores of at least 1310, encouraging them to apply. The only Sparse Country students with such scores who do not get the letter are Asians; to receive it, an Asian male must score at least 1380. An attorney for the plaintiff asked why a white boy in, say, immigrant-rich Las Vegas with a score of 1310 would get the letter, while his Asian classmate with a 1370 would not. Fitzsimmons responded with generalities about the need to recruit from a broad array of states to achieve diversity.\n\nWhen asked whether Harvard \"put a thumb on the scale for white students\" from Sparse Country, Fitzsimmons contrasted students who \"have only lived in the Sparse Country state for a year or two\" with those who \"have lived there for their entire lives under very different settings.\" Perhaps he meant that whites are more likely to be \"farm boys\" or \"great ambassadors,\" like his South Dakotan roommate. Or perhaps he meant that Asians are more likely than whites to apply to Harvard, less likely to be accepted, and more likely to enroll if accepted, so Harvard saves itself postage costs by reducing its recruiting of Asians. But the exchange highlighted a key question of the trial: whether the Harvard admissions process treats white racial identity as an asset, relative to Asian identity (or treats Asian identity as a drawback, relative to white identity). By pointing to the higher numerical cutoff for Asians as a group at the recruitment stage, before any holistic review of individual applicants could have occurred, the plaintiff apparently was suggesting that race is not used as one factor among many but, rather, as the determinative factor, in Harvard's alleged effort to shape its class to be more white and less Asian. The twentieth-century history of reaching out to regions where Jews were sparse cast something of a pall over the revelation of explicit differential treatment of Asian and white students in Sparse Country. The plaintiff's lawyer asked Fitzsimmons if he was aware of this history and he responded that he was not there for it but \"I've certainly heard the charges.\"\n\nThe plaintiff's attorneys repeatedly emphasized the lack of written instructions to admissions officers on how to use race permissibly and not impermissibly in evaluating an applicant, in order to argue that Harvard allows implicit racial bias and stereotypes to infect the process. The plaintiff zeroed in on the \"personal\" rating-which assesses qualities such as likability, maturity, integrity, courage, kindness, even \"effervescence,\" based on admissions officers' review of alumni interviews, student essays, and high-school recommendations-as an area where Harvard may let conscious or unconscious bias against Asians tilt decisions. Fitzsimmons's testimony confirmed that admissions officers gave Asian applicants higher ratings than white applicants in the academic and extracurricular categories, but that Asians' admissions rates were pulled down because of their lower personal ratings, despite having alumni-interview scores comparable to or higher than those of whites. While Fitzsimmons rejected the notion that Asian-Americans have worse personal qualities than whites, he speculated that their lower personal ratings reflected the fact that high-school teachers and guidance counsellors' support in recommendations is stronger for whites than for Asians. In other words, if there was indeed bias against Asians, it originated outside of Harvard. If that is so, though, it is curious that the holistic review process, which is designed to take account of various disadvantages in a student's minority background, would not attempt to correct for it.\n\nWhen Fitzsimmons was asked whether he thinks \"it's impossible to abuse a holistic review process like Harvard's,\" he replied, \"I do.\" As the trial continues this week, the question that is taking shape is whether Harvard has abused the legally permissible holistic review process to allow implicit discrimination against Asians to express itself. To succeed under the standard of Bakke and subsequent Supreme Court cases, Harvard must satisfy \"strict scrutiny\" by showing that its treatment of Asians was narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling interest (here, student-body diversity). Ironically, the first time the Supreme Court applied a \"strict scrutiny\" standard to race discrimination (and to Asians) was in Korematsu v. United States, in 1944, to hold that ordering internment camps for Japanese-Americans during the Second World War was permissible. Harvard can win at trial if the judge, Allison Burroughs, determines that any discriminatory effect on Asians was unintentional on Harvard's part or that the disparities shown are not \"gross\" enough to infer Harvard's discriminatory intent. While a \"smoking gun\" in a civil-rights case is not needed, proof of intentional discrimination is always a steep uphill climb. Much of the evidence at trial may not create a good look for Harvard, but it also may not be enough to meet the operative legal definitions of  discrimination.\n\nIt is rather hard to imagine Harvard losing a case of such importance to its brand as social equalizer, especially in a courthouse in a town so palpably dominated by its footprint and its alumni. But even discrimination claims that fail in court can be resolved, in time, on social terms. The most likely trajectory, with or without court cases, is that the perception of Asians' personal qualities of character and leadership-perhaps even \"effervescence\"-will, in a matter of decades, improve, in élite institutions and in American society. Apart from the issue of the legality of race-based affirmative action-which the judge already decided in Harvard's favor before trial, and which will surely be revived on appeal in the coming year-one outcome of this month's trial has been to heighten awareness of implicit racial biases. And, win or lose, Harvard's Asian problem, recalling the experience of Jews, will be a piece of the social history of an American minority group on its way to eventual, if not always enthusiastic, acceptance.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "The Changing Meaning of Affirmative Action\n\nThe terrible paradox of the civil-rights movement is that outlawing racial discrimination made it harder to remediate its effects. Once we amended the Constitution and passed laws to protect people of color from being treated differently in ways that were harmful to them, the government had trouble enacting programs that treat people of color differently in ways that might be beneficial. We took race out of the equation only to realize that, if we truly wanted not just equality of opportunity for all Americans but equality of result, we needed to put it back in. Our name for this paradox is affirmative action.\n\nThe term was introduced to the Kennedy Administration almost sixty years ago, and its arrival was somewhat haphazard. According to Nicholas Lemann's history of meritocracy, \" The Big Test ,\" the man who suggested it was an African-American lawyer named Hobart Taylor, Jr. He was a Texan, and when John F. Kennedy was sworn in, in 1961, he dropped in on the inaugural ball for Texans in order to shake hands with the new Vice-President, Lyndon B. Johnson.\n\nThey chatted, and Johnson asked him to come by his office. When Taylor showed up, Johnson handed him a draft of what would become Executive Order 10925, setting up the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity, which Johnson was to chair. Taylor read the draft and said he thought it could use a little work; Johnson asked him to do a rewrite. And that is when Taylor inserted the words \"affirmative action.\" He liked the phrase, he later said, because of the alliteration (or the assonance).\n\nTaylor needed a flexible phrase because Kennedy's committee was a bureaucratic entity with a vague mandate meant to signal the Administration's commitment to fairness in employment. Its purview, like the purview of committees dating back to the Administration of Franklin Roosevelt, was the awarding of federal contracts, and its mandate was to see that companies the federal government did business with did not discriminate on the basis of race. The committee had no real enforcement mechanism, though, so \"affirmative action\" was intended to communicate to firms that needed to integrate their workforce something like \"Don't just stand there. Do something.\" What they were supposed to do, aside from not discriminating, was unspecified.\n\n\"Do something\" is still one of the meanings of \"affirmative action\" today. Many firms and educational institutions have affirmative-action or diversity officers. Their job is to insure not only that hiring and promotion are handled in a color-blind manner but that good-faith efforts are made to include racial minorities (and sometimes individuals in other categories, such as women or veterans or disabled persons) in the hiring pool, and, if they are qualified, to attempt to recruit them. In this context, \"affirmative\" means: demonstrate that you did your best to find and promote members of underrepresented groups. You do not have to give them preferential treatment.\n\nSince the late nineteen-sixties, however, affirmative action has also had a more proactive meaning, as the name of an effort to attain a certain number, or, as it's called today, \"critical mass,\" of underrepresented groups in a business or an educational institution by, if necessary, giving applicants from those groups preference over similarly or better qualified whites. This form of affirmative action is usually branded by those who disapprove of it with the dreaded Q-word, \"quota.\" After 1978, when the Supreme Court declared racial quotas unconstitutional, affirmative-action programs avoided any suggestion of the Q-word. But that is essentially what affirmative action in this second sense entails. You can use terms like \"targets\" and \"goals,\" both of which are constitutionally legit, but if you have an idea of the point at which you would attain a critical mass then you have a quota.\n\nApart from stone-cold racists, everyone is happy, or claims to be happy, with affirmative action in the first sense. And many people are happy, or will say they are, with affirmative action in the second sense so far as the outcome is concerned. Legally, we want the system to be color-blind; we want everyone to have the same rights. But socially we understand that people don't want their racial or gender identities to be ignored. They want them to be recognized and respected. People take a civic pride in having a racially diverse workplace or educational institution. It's just that many would rather not contemplate too closely the means used to achieve it.\n\nOf the people who like racial diversity but don't like affirmative action in the preferential sense, there are two types. One type believes that we can ban all forms of preferential treatment and, so long as we enforce existing laws against discrimination, still achieve equality of result. These people see affirmative action as unfairly penalizing those who are not biased themselves and who have enjoyed no personal benefit from discrimination, and they see it as stigmatizing members of underrepresented groups with the suspicion that they are underqualified for the jobs they hold or the school they attend.\n\nThe other type of affirmative-action skeptic is the person who knows that this is wishful thinking but is unable to get his or her head around the idea that the way to end discrimination is by discriminating. The law professor Melvin Urofsky, in \" The Affirmative Action Puzzle \" (Pantheon), says he is agnostic on the issue, but he would seem to be a person of the second type. He wants racial diversity, and he knows that it is not going to come about on its own very soon, but he thinks that specific goals or targets are at odds with the rights of individuals. That's why he calls it a puzzle.\n\nThe history of affirmative action is woven into the history of American race relations, and the history of American race relations is woven into the history of America. It is the eternal bone in the national throat. So when Urofsky takes us through the history of affirmative action-he starts with Reconstruction, but the story really begins in the nineteen-sixties-he is giving us what amounts to a history of the country from John F. Kennedy to Donald Trump.\n\nYou see the decades go past as you read, and the special flavor of each Presidency comes back: Kennedy's uncomfortable recognition that civil rights was a moral issue that transcended his customary political pragmatism, Johnson's miraculous emergence as the Moses of racial equality, Nixon's inveterate scheming, Reagan's bland duplicity, Obama's undramatic realism. Then we get to Trump, who, Urofsky points out, \"is the first Republican since the civil rights revolution to reach the White House without campaigning against affirmative action.\" Urofsky doesn't say so, but one reason Trump ignored the issue is probably that politicians who oppose affirmative action normally do so in the name of color blindness, and Trump is not color-blind. (Alternative-facts explanation: Donald Trump is the least racist person you have ever met.)\n\nThere is a whole library on racial inequality and efforts to address it, and \"The Affirmative Action Puzzle\" does not offer many novelties. But the book, just by the accumulation of sixty years' worth of evidence, allows us to reach some useful conclusions, and the most important of these is that affirmative action worked. The federal government, with the backing of the courts, weaponized the 1964 Civil Rights Act and its legislative progeny-notably the Education Amendments of 1972, home to the notorious (in the R.B.G. sense) Title IX, banning sex discrimination in federally assisted educational institutions-and forced businesses to hire women and racial minorities.\n\nLink copied\n\nAnd they did. Study after study suggests that it is just not the case that \"it would have happened anyway.\" In 1981, for example, as Urofsky tells us, the Reagan Labor Department commissioned a report on gains in hiring among African-Americans and women. It found that between 1974 and 1980 the rate of minority employment in businesses that contracted with the federal government, and were therefore susceptible to being squeezed, rose by twenty per cent, and the rate of employment of women rose by 15.2 per cent. In companies that did not contract with the government, the rates were twelve per cent and 2.2 per cent, respectively.\n\nThis was so contrary to everything that Reagan had been saying about affirmative action that the Labor Department hired an outside consulting firm to vet its own report. When the firm returned with the news that the methods and the conclusions were valid, the Administration did the only thing it could do. It refused to release the report, thus allowing politicians to go on telling the public that affirmative action didn't work.\n\nBut it did. And guess what? So did the War on Poverty. In 1959, the poverty rate was an estimated twenty-two per cent; in 1975, it was below twelve per cent, which is about where it is today. (That is still thirty-eight million people, more than the population of Canada.) The claim that government programs always backfire was Reagan's campaign calling card-even though he did not eliminate a single major spending program during the eight years he was in office-and it has become one of the most dangerous canards in American politics. Politicians repeat it, and people nod their heads. Meanwhile, the rich get richer.\n\nDid white men suffer as a result of affirmative action? That turns out to be a difficult question to answer. \"There is very little hard evidence to prove that a minority hire almost always took place at the expense of a better-qualified white person,\" Urofsky says. He also tells us that there are \"no reliable data\" on whether men were shut out of jobs that were offered to women.\n\n\"Almost always\" would indeed be hard to prove. Obviously, just by the nature of the policy, some significant number of whites and males who would have been admitted or hired before affirmative-action programs were in place were not. But, since no employer or admissions officer ever says, \"You were not hired because you're white\" or \"You were admitted because you're black,\" proving discrimination is complicated. Americans have come to accept that race and gender are always in the mix, but we can't be certain that either one made the difference in any particular case.\n\nUrofsky's view is that, over all, white men did not go without jobs or the chance to attend college. Turned down by one place, they went someplace else. The number who were \"victimized\" by affirmative action, he says, is \"minuscule.\" Certainly this is true in the case of college admissions. Most colleges accept almost everyone who applies, so when we talk about race-conscious admissions we are talking about policies that affect a relatively small number of people. Urofsky borrows from Thomas Kane, of the Brookings Institution, an analogy to handicapped parking spaces: a driver looking to park who does not have a permit might feel \"excluded\" driving past an empty handicapped spot, but he or she usually finds a place to park.\n\nThe main source of Urofsky's frustration is the Supreme Court, which, he complains, has spent fifty years kicking around the constitutionality of race-conscious hiring and admissions practices without ever coming up with what he calls \"a workable jurisprudence.\" There is no Brown v. Board of Education or Roe v. Wade for affirmative action, no well-established precedent. A lot of the cases that people rely on about university admissions are 5-4 decisions. And some of the Court's opinions have suggested that, insofar as affirmative action constitutes an exception to the equal-protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, it will eventually time out (much as a majority of the Court recently decided, in Shelby v. Holder, that part of the Voting Rights Act has outlived our need for it).\n\nThe Court's unpredictability in such cases not only distresses law professors like Urofsky. It also creates uncertainty in the marketplace. The judicial parameters are known: to pass constitutional muster, an affirmative-action program must serve a compelling state interest, it must be narrowly tailored, and it must survive strict scrutiny. But one can never be sure how the Court will apply these criteria, or whether it will one day decide that all affirmative-action programs are unconstitutional per se and close out the exception. So groups that oppose racial preferences keep relitigating what is basically the same case, in the hope that a shift in the Court's makeup will produce a definitive result. The Court is effectively inviting these lawsuits.\n\nThe marketplace matters because the biggest defenders of affirmative action are not the N.A.A.C.P. and the Democratic National Committee. The biggest defenders are corporations and the military. Thousands of firms adopted affirmative-action programs after 1969, when the Nixon Administration began insisting on diversity benchmarks for government contractors, and \"in little more than a decade,\" Urofsky says, \"affirmative action became a way of life for many large corporations.\" Once those programs were put into place, they remained.\n\nThe same thing happened with the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The most controversial part of that act was Title II, which applies to public accommodations, like restaurants and hotels. This struck at what was, along with suppression of African-American voting rights, one of the pillars of Jim Crow: social segregation. In December, 1964, five months after the Civil Rights Act was signed into law, the Supreme Court, in Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States, upheld the constitutionality of Title II under the commerce clause. All public accommodations that fell within the reach of Congress's power were prohibited from discriminating.\n\nThis was not a blow to business. On the contrary. From a business viewpoint, refusing to serve people who want to rent a room in your hotel or order a sandwich at your lunch counter is irrational. The only economic incentive for denying them service is a fear of their driving white customers away. Once the Court made it clear that every hotel and lunch counter must serve every customer regardless of race, that fear was significantly reduced.\n\nUnder Jimmy Carter, affirmative-action requirements were extended to virtually all firms, educational institutions, and state and local governments that received contracts or grants from the federal government-which covers a lot of the national waterfront. By and large, the courts went along. And so did businesses. When a company is serving customers of different races, it wants to present a diversified face. If you are selling cars to African-Americans, you do not want all the salesmen in your showroom to be white.\n\nIf, to achieve this result, a company diversifies on its own, it is open to lawsuits claiming reverse discrimination. But when a company (or a police department or a fire department) adopts a race-conscious hiring program under government guidance it is immunized. When Reagan made noises about abolishing affirmative-action requirements, the National Association of Manufacturers lobbied him to leave the program alone. It was helping manufacturing companies do what they could not have done without it. The biggest problem businesses had wasn't that they couldn't find qualified women and minorities. It was dealing with labor unions, whose seniority systems overwhelmingly favored white male workers. (Small businesses also resented the paperwork.)\n\nThe extent of the corporate buy-in was put on dramatic display in 2003, when the Supreme Court heard Grutter v. Bollinger, another admissions case, this one involving the University of Michigan Law School. The Court received sixty-nine amicus briefs (a lot) arguing in favor of Michigan's affirmative-action admissions program, and among the amici were General Motors, Dow Chemical, and Intel, along with the largest federation of unions in the United States, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. They supported affirmative-action admissions because they wanted universities to produce educated people for a diversified workforce.\n\nThe Court also received, in Grutter, what became known as \"the military brief.\" This was an amicus brief signed by big-name generals like Norman Schwarzkopf, Wesley Clark, and John Shalikashvili; by a former Defense Secretary, William Cohen; and by former superintendents of the service academies, all of which, of course, are government agencies. \"At present,\" they told the Court, \"the military cannot achieve an officer corps that is both highly qualified and racially diverse unless the service academies and the ROTC use limited race-conscious recruiting and admissions policies.\" They were saying that if the Court ruled against Michigan it would be upending efforts, up to that point highly successful, to maintain a diverse officer corps. The Court voted to uphold the Michigan program, but it was a 5-4 decision.\n\nNo sector is more committed to diversity than higher education is, but it has proved to be one of the stickiest areas for affirmative action, both legally and practically. Urofsky, perhaps because he is an academic, is more patient with the trouble that universities have had in achieving diversity than he is with the problems of labor unions, to which, in general, he is uncharitable. It is true that probably the main reason Nixon promoted affirmative-action programs was to pit African-Americans against labor, both traditionally Democratic voting bases. And, by many accounts, he succeeded, and created Archie Bunker-the Reagan Democrat, a man who resents special government help for minorities. Still, the leadership of unions like the United Auto Workers, though sometimes fighting their own membership, were active in support of civil rights.\n\nHigher education and unions have a similar problem when it comes to changing the demographics: we are dealing with a cake that cannot be unbaked. The undergraduate population turns over every four years, but the faculty turns over every forty years. When the new students arrive on campus, they often wonder where the professors of color are. The answer is: wait twenty years, and they will show up.\n\nEven so, the lag in diversification between university faculties and their student bodies is striking. As late as 1969, less than five per cent of all professors had African or Asian ancestry, and around eighty per cent were men. Schools like Harvard and Stanford have had trouble even getting to gender balance. In 1976, women made up 1.6 per cent of the arts and sciences faculty at Yale and one per cent at Princeton, although both schools had been admitting women for seven years. Even at Berkeley, which had been admitting women since 1871, women made up just 5.6 per cent of the faculty. Today, less than thirty per cent of all university faculty at Stanford are women, and seven per cent are classified as underrepresented minorities. At Harvard, twenty-seven per cent of tenured faculty are women, and eight per cent are underrepresented minorities.\n\nOn the other hand, student bodies, where race- and gender-conscious admissions policies can have an effect more quickly, have diversified. In 1976, eighty-three per cent of university students were white; in 2016, fifty-seven per cent were white. The percentage of black students in that period increased from ten to fourteen; the percentage of students that the government categorizes as Hispanic increased from less than four to more than eighteen. The percentage of black and Latinx graduates (as opposed to enrollees) also increased (although graduation rates for both groups are lower than for whites).\n\nDid affirmative-action admissions help? Starting in the mid-nineties, opponents of affirmative action were able to get laws passed prohibiting the use of race in admissions at public universities in several states, including Michigan, Washington, and California. The top public universities in those states tried to attract minority students by other means, but Urofsky says that the percentage of black and Hispanic students has dropped significantly.\n\nDo students admitted under affirmative-action criteria benefit from their educations? Historically, black students as a group have tended to underperform academically-to get lower grades than their SAT scores predict. (So do varsity athletes.) Nevertheless, William Bowen and Derek Bok showed, in \" The Shape of the River \" (1998)-the most rigorous statistical analysis of race-conscious college admissions to that point-that of seven hundred black students who entered twenty-eight selective schools under race-preferential criteria in 1976, thirty-two per cent attained doctorates or professional degrees, as compared with thirty-seven per cent of white students. Nearly a hundred and twenty-five of the black students were business executives, and more than three hundred were \"civic leaders\" (running youth or community groups, for example). Race-conscious admissions policies, Bowen and Bok concluded, have been \"highly successful\" in advancing educational and societal goals.\n\nAs many writers have pointed out, when we are considering colleges and jobs, there is a pipeline problem. That's why, as Urofsky notes, the greatest beneficiaries of affirmative action have been white women. They went to the same high schools that their brothers did (and most of them probably got better grades). That's also why Barack Obama seemed to be focussed more on improving K-12 for minority children than on expanding access to post-secondary education. The success of affirmative action in employment and university admissions has not eliminated the education and income gaps between whites and blacks. Although the poverty rate for blacks and Hispanics has dropped some since 1970, it is still more than double the rate for whites. Americans of color are starting from much farther behind. Millions never get on board a train that most whites were born on.\n\nLink copied\n\nThe Supreme Court case that admissions offices rely on today is Regents of the University of California v. Bakke. It was decided in 1978, and, despite several attempts to relitigate it, it is still the law of the land. Bakke is a good example of the jurisprudential confusion around affirmative action: the Court managed to produce six opinions in that case. The plurality opinion, by Lewis Powell, struck down an admissions program at the University of California at Davis School of Medicine, from which Allan Bakke, a white man, had been twice rejected, but it upheld the right of schools to use race-conscious admissions programs.\n\nThe problem at Davis was that the medical school basically ran two admissions processes, one for everybody and one that effectively considered only minority applicants, for whom sixteen places were set aside. Bakke was able to show that his record was superior to the records of some of the students who had been admitted through the special program.\n\nThe Davis program was obviously not narrowly tailored. One consideration that the university offered in the way of compelling state interest was its belief that minority M.D.s might end up practicing in underserved communities. Powell found no evidentiary basis for this, and it was arguably a racist assumption. The school could have investigated whether applicants had worked with underserved communities in the past. They did not, and Powell suggested that such a standard might be a better proxy than race. Another consideration Davis offered was the aim of \"countering the effects of societal discrimination.\" But Powell, though he allowed that specific race-conscious remedies could be justified by specific instances of discrimination, dismissed the general invocation of discrimination as \"an amorphous concept of injury that may be ageless in its reach into the past.\"\n\nStill, Powell did think that the goal of a diversified medical-school class was constitutionally permissible, and he played a trump card that is almost never mentioned in discussions of the case, including Urofsky's. Admissions programs determined by race are in violation of both the equal-protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which outlaws racial discrimination in institutions that receive federal funding. Those rights were largely on Bakke's side: you couldn't discriminate against whites simply because nonwhites had once been discriminated against. Powell argued, however, that another right was in play: the First Amendment; specifically, the right of academic freedom. There is no constitutional right of academic freedom, but Powell cited a 1957 case, Sweezy v. New Hampshire, in which Felix Frankfurter, in a concurring opinion, quoted South African jurists to the effect that the principle of academic freedom allows a university to determine who will teach its classes and who will sit in its classrooms.\n\nPowell concluded that, since Davis could reasonably decide that a diverse class provides a better learning environment, considerations of an applicant's race-as one factor among others-can fall within the exercise of a constitutionally protected right. (Under the Court's ruling, Bakke was admitted to Davis and he became a doctor; Urofsky says that he went on to work at the Mayo Clinic, where one of his patients was Lewis Powell.)\n\nThe Michigan case, Grutter v. Bollinger, in 2003, was basically a relitigation of Bakke. As was Fisher v. Texas, in 2013, and the second round of that case, known as Fisher II, in 2016. The Fisher cases involved a white woman who was turned down for admission to the University of Texas at Austin, U.T.'s flagship campus. Her lawyers argued that, even if she were rejected solely because of her grades and not her race, she could still claim a \"Constitutional injury\" from being subjected to an unfair admissions process. Each time, the Court upheld the constitutionality of using race as a factor in admissions, but they were close calls. The vote in Fisher II was 4-3.\n\nThe current Harvard College admissions case, Students for Fair Admission v. Harvard, is the same case one more time. The person behind both Fisher and the Harvard case is Edward Blum, a man who for whatever reason has decided to devote his time to preventing a small number of black and brown teen-agers from attending colleges that are desperate to have them.\n\nHarvard won at the trial level because the judge ruled that its admissions program is consistent with other Supreme Court decisions, such as Bakke. That's not surprising, since Powell's decision cited the Harvard admissions program as a model. But, given the composition of the Supreme Court, it is all too likely that it will decide that the country has timed out of this particular form of remediation.\n\nFor remediation is fundamentally what affirmative action is. Affirmative action has expanded to cover many kinds of difference, and, since Bakke, to be thought of as in service to a general social commitment to diversity per se-so that now people say things like \"What about diversity of ideology?,\" as though that somehow presented the same moral demand as a commitment to racial diversity.\n\nBut the reason we have affirmative action is that we once had slavery and Jim Crow and redlining and racial covenants, and that we once had all-white police forces and all-white union locals and all-white college campuses and all-white law firms. To paraphrase George Shultz, Nixon's Secretary of Labor: for hundreds of years, the United States had a racial quota. It was zero. Affirmative action is an attempt to redress an injustice done to black people. The Fourteenth Amendment protects white people, too, but that is not why it needed to be written.\n\nThe Court's decision in Shelby v. Holder vacating a central provision of the Voting Rights Act has backfired. It turns out that, when you remove enforcement mechanisms and remedial oversight, things tend to revert to the status quo ante. The whole history of affirmative action shows, as Urofsky somewhat reluctantly admits, that when the programs are shut down minority representation drops. Diversity, however we define it, is politically constructed and politically maintained. It doesn't just happen. It's a choice we make as a society.\n\nIt is possible to understand the opposition to affirmative action of white conservatives, like Ronald Reagan, who regard civil-rights laws as federal overreach and affirmative action as enshrining the un-American notion of group rights. And it is possible to understand the opposition of black conservatives, like Clarence Thomas, who see it as patronizing to African-Americans.\n\nBut it is hard to understand the opposition, often diehard, of many white liberals that has persisted since the nineteen-seventies. Did these people really imagine that passing a law against discrimination would reset race relations overnight? Do they really think that white Americans, wherever they work or go to college, do not carry a lifelong advantage because of the color of their skin? Do they really believe that there should be no sacrifice to make or price to pay for the systematic damage done to the lives of millions of American citizens and the men and women who are their ancestors? ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "Affirmative action: It's time for liberals to admit it isn't working.\n\nPhoto courtesy Cecil Stoughton/White House Press Office\n\nI.\n\nIn 2009, I attended the NAACP's 100 th annual convention at the Midtown Hilton in New York. Not just the centenary celebration for the nation's oldest civil rights organization, this was also the group's first convention under our newly inaugurated black president. The theme of the week's events was to pay homage to the great civil rights victories of the past while at the same time defining a new mission for the next century. But on the night NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous took the stage for his big speech, when the subject turned to affirmative action, he didn't sound like he was charting a new course so much as doubling down on the orthodoxy of the past. \"The only question about affirmative action,\" Jealous declared , \"isn't whether or not we need the hammer. The only question is whether or not the hammer is big enough!\"\n\nThe line was met with thunderous applause. At the time, this didn't really stand out to me, because, like a lot of well-intentioned but minimally informed white liberals, I believed in affirmative action. I didn't have terribly strong convictions about it, but given America's history it generally seemed like \"the right thing to do.\" That was five years ago. Then, in the course of writing a book about the history of the color line and our efforts to erase it, I took a closer look at the origins of affirmative action, and its results. Having done so, I'm a believer no more.\n\nIn part because of recent Supreme Court cases like Fisher v. Texas , the current national conversation about affirmative action has focused mostly on its use in college admissions, but my focus here will be on affirmative action in the white-collar workplace, the failure of which I observed up close during my years in the advertising industry. Race-conscious policies in college admissions and corporate hiring are different creatures, with different pros and cons, but I came to see that they also share some common, troubling flaws.\n\nWhen I think back now to the rousing applause affirmative action earned at that Hilton ballroom, I can't help but wonder why, 45 years down the line, liberals like Jealous are still so fervently devoted to a program so plainly inadequate and ill-conceived from the start. Having botched the effort to integrate American schools through the overzealous misuse of an otherwise valuable instrument, the school bus, the left's second great blunder on race was pinning the economic fortunes of black America on affirmative action.\n\nII.\n\nProponents of affirmative action tend to glorify the program by lumping it in with the great liberal victories of the civil rights movement. The phrase \"affirmative action\" first appeared in President Kennedy's Executive Order 10925, which called for \"affirmative action\" to be taken to ensure people were employed \"without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\" And Lyndon Johnson is usually given credit for enunciating the principles of affirmative action when he called for reparative economic justice for black America in his famous \"To Fulfill These Rights\" speech at Howard University, saying, \"You do not take a person who, for years, has been hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race and say, 'You are now free to compete with all the others,' and still justly believe that you have been completely fair.\"\n\nBut neither Kennedy nor Johnson ever implemented anything resembling what we now describe as affirmative action-i.e., quotas and set-asides-on the economic front, largely because the Democratic party was beholden to Big Labor, whose unions were adamantly opposed to quotas of any kind. So while the great liberal crusade of the 1960s produced victories in the area of civil rights, it did little in the way of producing actual jobs for black Americans; in some states, black unemployment under Kennedy and Johnson actually went up, hence the frustration that exploded in the urban riots of Watts, Newark, and elsewhere. When Vietnam forced Johnson out of office, the task of implementing a program of reparative economic justice for the victims of slavery and segregation fell to our 37 th president, Richard Milhous Nixon.\n\nThat Richard Nixon was racist is well beyond dispute-he believed that, moral objections to abortion aside, the practice was justified in the case of mixed-race pregnancies . When giving instructions to the aide who scheduled his appointments and photo ops, Nixon said the Oval Office calendar should have \"just enough blacks to show that we care\"-setting a precedent for Republican racial engagement that stands to this day. But Nixon wasn't just racist in the sense of thinking blacks inferior; he was racist in the sense that he subscribed to an actual taxonomy and hierarchy of race-the idea that different groups possess inherent qualities. Asians are smart and industrious. Jews are crafty but lack moral fiber, and so on. When the first wave of studies were published purporting to show that blacks have lower IQs than whites, Nixon, in a conversation with domestic aide Daniel Patrick Moynihan, said he \"couldn't agree more\" with the findings. The president was quite generous on the subject of what black people were good at: \"Athletics isn't a bad achievement. You look at the World Series. What would Pittsburgh be without a hell of a lot of blacks?\" But he was far less charitable when it came to black talent in other areas: \"... when you get to some of the more shall we say profound, rigid disciplines, basically, they have a hell of a time makin' it. ... In terms of good lawyers, even though a lot of them go to law schools, I mean, it is not really their dish of tea.\"\n\nMarion S. Trikosko/U.S. News & World Report Magazine Photograph Collection/Library of Congress\n\nRacist as he may have been, Nixon was also a pragmatist. With America's cities beset by riots, he knew he had to take steps \"not to have the goddamn country blow up.\" Blacks needed jobs. And as someone who had grown up poor, Nixon did believe in the basic principle of what he called a man's \"right to earn.\" Everyone, black or white, had a right to earn a decent living for his family. Nixon just had a limited opinion of what blacks were capable of earning. Another thing the president told Moynihan was that it was his job as president to be aware of the fact that blacks have \"basic weaknesses,\" and that those weaknesses needed to be taken into account when it came to formulating policy.\n\nThe way in which affirmative action was implemented speaks volumes about the motivations behind it. Nixon's first task upon taking office was to resolve the impasse between civil rights leaders and skilled labor unions. In his first address to Congress, the president announced what became known as the Philadelphia Plan, which imposed goals and timetables for race-based hiring in the city's unions. Prior to the Philadelphia Plan, under Kennedy and Johnson, affirmative action had always meant to take affirmative action to ensure discrimination was not taking place. Now, affirmative action meant imposing racial preferences and quotas. After its launch in Philadelphia, the program was rolled out in dozens of other cities nationwide. In the meantime, the White House was busy stuffing racial-preference policies into the federal bureaucracy wherever it could find room. In the spring of 1969, Nixon expanded affirmative action mandates from government procurement contracts and applied them to any institution that received any federal funds of any kind, which brought universities, research institutions-basically everyone-into the fold. Then Nixon issued Executive Order 11478, which called for affirmative action in all government employment, bringing huge numbers of black workers onto the federal payroll. Racial preferences, as we know them today, were now sewn into the fabric of the country.\n\nPhoto courtesy Jack E. Kightlinger/White House Photo Office/National Archives and Records Service\n\nAnd affirmative action \"worked.\" The most immediate and measurable impact was in government hiring. Blacks had always enjoyed relatively better employment prospects in the public sector, and affirmative action greatly enhanced that. By the early 1970s, 57 percent of black male college graduates and 72 percent of black female college graduates were employed in government positions. The private sector also went on a hiring binge. Impelled by the fear of more urban riots, the Fortune 500 launched a flotilla of affirmative action programs aimed at getting as many black hires in the door as quickly as possible. After decades of economic stagnation, between 1969 and 1972, total black income rose from $38.7 billion to $51.1 billion, a 32 percent jump in just three years.\n\nRichard Nixon put more money in black wallets than JFK, LBJ, and MLK combined. While they never embraced Nixon, black Americans and their white liberal champions fell in love with quotas and set-asides. Many of the moderate and liberal Republicans in the White House had faith in affirmative action, too. Nixon's Secretary of Labor George Shultz, upon his nomination, acknowledged that black unemployment was the most pressing labor issue in the country, and believed that the Philadelphia Plan would offer a useful model for cities across the country. Even some conservatives were on board. Prominent Nixon-supporter William F. Buckley called for \"a pro-Negro discrimination\" in order to address the problem of unemployment.\n\nThe president, however, felt differently. Just weeks after calling the Philadelphia Plan \"historic and critical\" in Congress, Nixon jotted a note to domestic aide John Erlichman calling it \"an almost hopeless holding action at best,\" saying \"let's limit our public action and $-to the least we can get away with.\" Nixon's primary concern in the Oval Office was to make his mark as a great foreign policy leader. Vietnam, China, the Soviet Union-these were his main preoccupations. He wanted the home front happy and humming along so that he'd be free to spend his political capital overseas, and his approach to the volatile issues of race reflected this. Staunch opposition to school busing and fair housing would appease suburban white voters. Affirmative action on the jobs front would appease middle-class black voters, end the riots threatening corporate America's bottom line, and generally keep the racial question tamped down long enough for Nixon to win re-election in '72.\n\nGiven the immediate positive impact that affirmative action had, it was perfectly reasonable for liberals to want to believe that it could be, at long last, an answer to economic discrimination and structural inequality. But it wasn't. Not remotely. For starters, the quotas and mandates put in place were almost comically easy to evade. The skilled labor unions required to admit blacks engaged in practices known as checkerboarding (putting all the black hires on government-contracted job sites while ignoring the quotas everywhere else) and motorcycling (shuffling black hires from job site to job site depending on where federal inspectors were slated to show up). Quotas may have seemed like a positive development, and they did produce some jobs, but they also turned black employment into a numbers game-and gave employers a way to game the numbers.\n\nAffirmative action in state, local, and federal government offered decent jobs with decent wages, but the side effect of all this government hiring was to relieve the white collar private sector from having to truly confront the issue in its own staffing. For the minimal hiring it did do, corporate America made sure to meet its new quotas in the least disruptive way possible, hiring blacks for back-office roles in the accounting department, for example, or creating make-work departments that had no power and did nothing, like the community outreach or \"social responsibility\" department. Again, these were decent jobs with decent wages, but they diverted blacks from the business units where real decisions were made. Affirmative action offered the illusion of reparative justice wrapped up in the rhetoric of empowerment, but its net result was to absorb and neutralize black demands for equality, not fulfill them.\n\nPhoto courtesy Oliver F. Atkins/National Archives and Records Administration\n\nAnother effect of affirmative action was that it created a short-term labor shortage in the black middle class, because that's who affirmative action was designed to help. In Nixon's taxonomy of race, there was a clear division between \"the good blacks\" and the rest of urban America. \"There are 35 percent of blacks we can do good with,\" he told his staff. And it was squarely at this group that he aimed his policies. If you look at the areas where affirmative action was implemented-college admissions, corporate hiring, minority business loans, skilled labor unions, government office jobs-you'll notice that most of them aren't really things that will help you if you've never graduated from high school.\n\nThe urban poor were hopeless, just \"little black bastards on the welfare rolls at $2,400 a family,\" Nixon said, and for this group his policy aims were clear. Meeting notes taken by Nixon's Chief of Staff H.R.

During his 1968 campaign, against the backdrop of violent riots in America's inner cities, the candidate made repeated and thinly veiled calls for \"law and order,\" criminalizing the urban poor in the nation's mind and promising his silent majority that lawbreakers would be dealt with harshly under his administration. Once in office, Nixon launched his now infamous \"War on Drugs,\" planting the seeds that have grown, decades later, into a system of mass incarceration-something all-too-familiar to the unemployed black male teenager of today. As the 1970s progressed, the black underclass was increasingly left behind while the black middle class was movin' on up -not to the East Side, typically, but to majority black suburbs where they continued to be isolated from the schools and social networks that offered access to greater economic opportunity.\n\nDid millions of people do well under affirmative action? Yes. A bribe only works if you actually give somebody something. But the benefits that accrued to black America under affirmative action could almost be considered a byproduct of the program's actual endgame: to give black people just enough to stop rioting and leave the white establishment to go about its business. While some black people used quotas and set-asides as a foothold to climb into genuine positions of power, the effect of affirmative action overall was to funnel upwardly mobile blacks into a separate employment pipeline where their aspirations were held in check, where they exercised very little authority, and where their progress depended on government intervention. Thanks to affirmative action, the black middle class was now vested in the very system the civil rights revolution had sought to overthrow.\n\nIII.\n\nWhen affirmative action was first implemented, it was not met with a broad backlash from white America. Like Nixon, the average white voter was inclined to do something \"not to have the goddamn country blow up.\" Then the 1970s recession hit and access to jobs felt more like a zero-sum game. It was then that white people began to use phrases like \"reverse racism\" and \"haven't we done enough for them already?\" The parties flip-flopped. Liberals, who had once disdained racial quotas as being antithetical to true liberty and justice, embraced them for the short-term leverage they provided. Republicans, once in favor of set asides and preferences as a cheap and easy solution for appeasing blacks, now saw them as a wedge issue useful for stirring up disaffected whites. Then Ronald Reagan was elected president and started undermining racial preferences just as quickly as Richard Nixon had put them in place.\n\nPhoto courtesy White House Photographic Office/National Archives and Records Administration\n\nTo this day, Reagan is vilified by the left as the man who crushed America's dream of racial equality by rolling back affirmative action. But of course Reagan started rolling back affirmative action. Why wouldn't he? Affirmative action was created by the Republican establishment to protect the Republican establishment. Once that group felt protected, once it was Morning in America and the riots had been reduced to occasional flare-ups in Liberty City and Crown Heights, affirmative action had largely fulfilled its purpose: Blacks had been pacified enough that their needs could be safely ignored. So why not start winding it down?\n\nThe problem with winding it down was that black Americans were now invested in it, had banked their hopes on it. By embracing affirmative action as a solution to economic disparity, the liberal establishment encouraged black Americans to double down on something that was never intended to close the economic gap in the first place. As a result, they were promised something that the government can't actually deliver.\n\nFor starters, the government doesn't actually enforce affirmative action. The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs is technically responsible for ensuring that America's affirmative action policies are carried out. Every year, every company with at least 50 employees doing at least $50,000 worth of business with the government has to file an Affirmative Action Plan with the OFCCP. This report tracks every interaction that takes place between that company and minority job candidates: new hires, promotions, demotions, department transfers, etc. All of this information is diligently, exhaustively compiled. Then nobody reads it. To police affirmative action in the largest economy in the world, the OFCCP has about 600 staffers. In a good year they review around 4 percent of these AAP filings. Of that, they investigate less than 1 percent.\n\nBut even if the government were keeping better tabs on affirmative action, the bigger problem is that its jurisdiction doesn't reach the parts of the economy where affirmative action is most desperately needed: the places where real money is made and real power is allocated. The best example of this is the industry that dominates so much of our economy today: the technology sector. Silicon Valley's racial diversity is pretty terrible, the kind of gross imbalance that inspires special reports on CNN .\n\nIt's a dismal state of affairs, but how could it really be otherwise? Silicon Valley isn't just an industry; it's a social and cultural ecosystem that grew out of a very specific social and cultural setting: mostly West Coast, upper-middle-class white guys who liked to tinker with motherboards and microchips. If you were around that culture, you became a part of it. If you weren't, you didn't. And because of the social segregation that pervades our society, very few black people were around to be a part of it.\n\nSome would purport to remedy this by fixing the tech industry job pipeline: more STEM graduates , more minority internships and boot camps , etc. And that will get you changes here and there, at the margins, but it doesn't get at the real problem. The big success stories of the Internet age-Instagram, YouTube, Twitter-all came about in similar ways: A couple of people had an idea, they got together with some of their friends, built something, called some other friends who knew some other friends who had access to friends with serious money, and then the thing took off and now we're all using it and they're all millionaires. The process is organic, somewhat accidental, and it moves really, really fast. And by the time those companies are big enough to worry about their \"diversity,\" the ground-floor opportunities have already been spoken for.\n\nA place like Silicon Valley doesn't have an established pipeline where the government can mandate there be X number of minority applicants per year who can then be tracked up the corporate ladder each fiscal quarter. A system has to have rules in order for authorities to make sure that those rules are being applied fairly to people of color. The legal profession is very mature. It has lots of rules. Municipal labor unions have rules. Silicon Valley doesn't have any rules. Hollywood doesn't have any rules. Media and publishing used to have rules, sort of, but Silicon Valley is destroying those rules as we speak and doesn't seem to be replacing them with any new ones.\n\nAffirmative action treats workplace discrimination like a bureaucratic, process-based problem. In reality, workplace discrimination stems from a very nebulous social and cultural problem. The government claims it can regulate the racial composition of our professional lives, but too much of what we call \"work\" is actually rooted in the messy, socially segregated realm of our personal lives. How many affirmative action compliance officers were stationed in Steve Jobs' garage while he and his buddy Steve Wozniak assembled the first Apple? Zero. It's possible to track what goes on in the human resources department and in the minutes of corporate board meetings, but too much of the economic life of this country transpires in the spaces in between. Racial preferences can provide just enough jobs and material support to keep up the illusion that we're moving toward equality, but no program can give black Americans real, sustained access to the places where the prerogatives of wealth and power are exercised. Only social and cultural integration can do that-the kind of integration Nixon opposed while he was advancing affirmative action.\n\nPhoto by Tony Avelar/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOf course, at first blush, the case against workplace affirmative action would seem to make the case for collegiate affirmative action: Admit black students to majority white colleges, and maybe a black student ends up in Mark Zuckerberg's dorm room when he starts Facebook. And to an extent that's true. Unlike the Hobbesian state of nature that is the 21 st -century job market, college admissions are a methodical, bureaucratic process where the special circumstances of minority students can be given extra weight and duly monitored for enforcement. And no matter what apoplectic conservatives say, racial diversity is no more \"unfair\" a standard than legacy status or geographic distribution or any of the other subjective criteria used in assembling a freshman class.\n\nBut does collegiate affirmative action, like its workplace cousin, just come too late in the game? In his memoir Reflections of an Affirmative Action Baby , Yale Law professor Stephen Carter-who describes himself as both a beneficiary and a victim of racial preferences-makes a sound argument. Because of the thorny politics and stigmas that inevitably come with race-conscious remedies, those remedies should start aggressively at a very young age and then, for everyone's good, taper off over time. If a 5-year-old from a disadvantaged background is given a leg-up to get into a good elementary school, that is not likely to be a stigma he will carry around as an adult-and you really have to try hard to begrudge helping out a 5-year-old. By contrast, for the thirtysomething black professional forced to walk in the door with whispers of \"diversity hire\" trailing her down the hallway, affirmative action can be a real problem. It serves as a diminishment of her talent and hard work. As much as affirmative action might help her get a foot in the door, it becomes a burden she has to carry from that day forward.\n\nStarting young would also likely increase the effectiveness of affirmative action. Thanks to structural inequality in access to resources, the statistical gaps between black and white Americans start the day we're born, with disparities in birth outcomes and infant mortality rates. Those gaps get wider with each passing year, as privileged kids get greater access to pre-K and extra tutoring until, come college application time, the gaps have become chasms. You've got a legion of helicopter-parented white kids, their resumes crammed full with every AP course and extracurricular whatnot under the sun-up against black students from working- and low-income backgrounds whose resumes are more likely to show a lot of unrealized potential, because AP physics and summer language camps in Vermont simply weren't available to them. We're asking a hell of a lot of college admissions officers if we expect them to close that gap with nothing more than a weighted point system for processing applications. In the end, most colleges end up cherry-picking the black kids with the best SAT scores in order to show their \"commitment to diversity,\" while the real problems of inequality go unaddressed. That hardly seems like a solution.\n\nAffirmative action becomes more contentious, more stigmatizing, harder to enforce, and less effective the older its purported beneficiaries are. Which means we're investing a lot of time and energy at the end of the pipeline that should be invested at the front of the pipeline. You integrate the workplace by integrating the high school cafeteria. Or, better yet, the elementary school playground. Racial preferences in college admissions may be better than racial preferences at the office, but that's not saying much. Affirmative action remains exactly what Richard Nixon said it was. It's a holding action, and a pretty hopeless one at that.\n\nIV.\n\nToday, the statistics on black and white inequality are so unchanging that they can be recited by rote: The black unemployment rate holds steady at double the white unemployment rate; the median net worth for black households is about 7 percent of white households; annual per capita income for blacks is 62 cents for every dollar of per capita income for whites. * When presented with these figures, supporters of affirmative action typically use them as evidence that conservatives kept affirmative action from working. Others say the statistics are proof that affirmative action didn't really work that well to begin with. But there's always the third option to consider: that persistent racial inequality is, at least in part, the result of affirmative action working exactly as it was intended to.\n\nPhoto courtesy Oliver F. Atkins/National Archives and Records Administration\n\nIt's not an accident that affirmative action and Nixon's \"law and order\" campaign are both rooted in the same historical moment: the backlash to civil rights. Liberals want to believe that affirmative action is a social good and mass incarceration is an unalloyed evil. The left wants to enshrine the former and abolish the latter. But affirmative action and mass incarceration are just two sides of the same coin: one program to manage the aspirations of the black middle class, one to contain the anger of the black underclass. Both are forms of social control, and neither has anything whatsoever to do with repairing the real damage wrought by slavery and segregation.\n\nIf we ever want to start fixing these problems, we can start by being honest about what affirmative action really is. Some advocates are doing just that. In The New Jim Crow , Michelle Alexander writes candidly about the symbiotic relationship between affirmative action and mass incarceration, saying \"perhaps the two are more linked than we realize,\" and asking blacks to consider if they've been \"bought off\" by a bribe. The consensus is starting to crack, a little. But to judge from the rhetoric that still surrounds the issue, most progressives are nowhere near ready to admit the truth: that the liberal establishment pinned the economic hopes of the civil rights revolution on a program set up by a president whose racial philosophy was based on the idea that blacks make great athletes and Asians are good at math.\n\nThe latest idea, floated by those who've started to admit the shortcomings of race-based affirmative action, is to replace it with class-based affirmative action. But that's an equally unpromising idea. The nature of affirmative action is that it skims. It elevates the best and the brightest of a disadvantaged group while doing nothing to eliminate the root causes of that group's disadvantage. Just as cherry-picking all the black kids with good SAT scores hasn't brought about the end of racism, cherry-picking all the poor kids with good SAT scores isn't going to do much to end poverty.\n\nAs big a detour as it's been, you can't just get rid of affirmative action. There is a separate and unequal economy that depends on it. Racial preferences may have taken black America into a socioeconomic cul de sac, but you can't just tear up the road and leave people with no way to get out. Fortunately, the one thing the left does have is the leverage and the political capital to end affirmative action in the right way. Right now, the Democratic party and the racial justice movement are sitting on a junk heap of racial preference programs that aren't doing anyone much good, and they lack the substantive programs they need: a true, New Deal-style reformation that repairs the infrastructure of our cities, ends mass incarceration, provides access to early education and paid family leave and job training and other programs that put all of black America on more solid footing. Since Republicans seem to want affirmative action gone so badly, if it were me, I'd be out horse trading. Just as the Obama administration is letting Washington and Colorado opt out of federal marijuana prohibition, let state and local governments opt out of affirmative action mandates, but only in exchange for opting in on universal pre-K and other things that working families actually need.\n\nIf conservative politicians and judges are allowed to end affirmative action for the wrong reasons-a very real and immediate possibility-it's safe to say that race relations in our great land will not improve. The onus falls on liberals to end it for the right reasons and to use that opportunity to replace it with something meaningful. Otherwise the status quo is never going to change, and America will keep on wandering in circles well short of the Promised Land.\n\nNext week: How the left failed to answer the most fundamental question of the civil rights era.\n\nCorrection, Feb. 11, 2014: This article previously stated that black workers make .62 cents for every dollar white workers make.

      "text": "Affirmative action: It's time for liberals to admit it isn't working.\n\nPhoto courtesy Cecil Stoughton/White House Press Office\n\nI.\n\nIn 2009, I attended the NAACP's 100 th annual convention at the Midtown Hilton in New York. Not just the centenary celebration for the nation's oldest civil rights organization, this was also the group's first convention under our newly inaugurated black president. The theme of the week's events was to pay homage to the great civil rights victories of the past while at the same time defining a new mission for the next century. But on the night NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous took the stage for his big speech, when the subject turned to affirmative action, he didn't sound like he was charting a new course so much as doubling down on the orthodoxy of the past. \"The only question about affirmative action,\" Jealous declared , \"isn't whether or not we need the hammer. The only question is whether or not the hammer is big enough!\"\n\nThe line was met with thunderous applause. At the time, this didn't really stand out to me, because, like a lot of well-intentioned but minimally informed white liberals, I believed in affirmative action. I didn't have terribly strong convictions about it, but given America's history it generally seemed like \"the right thing to do.\" That was five years ago. Then, in the course of writing a book about the history of the color line and our efforts to erase it, I took a closer look at the origins of affirmative action, and its results. Having done so, I'm a believer no more.\n\nIn part because of recent Supreme Court cases like Fisher v. Texas , the current national conversation about affirmative action has focused mostly on its use in college admissions, but my focus here will be on affirmative action in the white-collar workplace, the failure of which I observed up close during my years in the advertising industry. Race-conscious policies in college admissions and corporate hiring are different creatures, with different pros and cons, but I came to see that they also share some common, troubling flaws.\n\nWhen I think back now to the rousing applause affirmative action earned at that Hilton ballroom, I can't help but wonder why, 45 years down the line, liberals like Jealous are still so fervently devoted to a program so plainly inadequate and ill-conceived from the start. Having botched the effort to integrate American schools through the overzealous misuse of an otherwise valuable instrument, the school bus, the left's second great blunder on race was pinning the economic fortunes of black America on affirmative action.\n\nII.\n\nProponents of affirmative action tend to glorify the program by lumping it in with the great liberal victories of the civil rights movement. The phrase \"affirmative action\" first appeared in President Kennedy's Executive Order 10925, which called for \"affirmative action\" to be taken to ensure people were employed \"without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\" And Lyndon Johnson is usually given credit for enunciating the principles of affirmative action when he called for reparative economic justice for black America in his famous \"To Fulfill These Rights\" speech at Howard University, saying, \"You do not take a person who, for years, has been hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race and say, 'You are now free to compete with all the others,' and still justly believe that you have been completely fair.\"\n\nBut neither Kennedy nor Johnson ever implemented anything resembling what we now describe as affirmative action-i.e., quotas and set-asides-on the economic front, largely because the Democratic party was beholden to Big Labor, whose unions were adamantly opposed to quotas of any kind. So while the great liberal crusade of the 1960s produced victories in the area of civil rights, it did little in the way of producing actual jobs for black Americans; in some states, black unemployment under Kennedy and Johnson actually went up, hence the frustration that exploded in the urban riots of Watts, Newark, and elsewhere. When Vietnam forced Johnson out of office, the task of implementing a program of reparative economic justice for the victims of slavery and segregation fell to our 37 th president, Richard Milhous Nixon.\n\nThat Richard Nixon was racist is well beyond dispute-he believed that, moral objections to abortion aside, the practice was justified in the case of mixed-race pregnancies . When giving instructions to the aide who scheduled his appointments and photo ops, Nixon said the Oval Office calendar should have \"just enough blacks to show that we care\"-setting a precedent for Republican racial engagement that stands to this day. But Nixon wasn't just racist in the sense of thinking blacks inferior; he was racist in the sense that he subscribed to an actual taxonomy and hierarchy of race-the idea that different groups possess inherent qualities. Asians are smart and industrious. Jews are crafty but lack moral fiber, and so on. When the first wave of studies were published purporting to show that blacks have lower IQs than whites, Nixon, in a conversation with domestic aide Daniel Patrick Moynihan, said he \"couldn't agree more\" with the findings. The president was quite generous on the subject of what black people were good at: \"Athletics isn't a bad achievement. You look at the World Series. What would Pittsburgh be without a hell of a lot of blacks?\" But he was far less charitable when it came to black talent in other areas: \"... when you get to some of the more shall we say profound, rigid disciplines, basically, they have a hell of a time makin' it. ... In terms of good lawyers, even though a lot of them go to law schools, I mean, it is not really their dish of tea.\"\n\nMarion S. Trikosko/U.S. News & World Report Magazine Photograph Collection/Library of Congress\n\nRacist as he may have been, Nixon was also a pragmatist. With America's cities beset by riots, he knew he had to take steps \"not to have the goddamn country blow up.\" Blacks needed jobs. And as someone who had grown up poor, Nixon did believe in the basic principle of what he called a man's \"right to earn.\" Everyone, black or white, had a right to earn a decent living for his family. Nixon just had a limited opinion of what blacks were capable of earning. Another thing the president told Moynihan was that it was his job as president to be aware of the fact that blacks have \"basic weaknesses,\" and that those weaknesses needed to be taken into account when it came to formulating policy.\n\nThe way in which affirmative action was implemented speaks volumes about the motivations behind it. Nixon's first task upon taking office was to resolve the impasse between civil rights leaders and skilled labor unions. In his first address to Congress, the president announced what became known as the Philadelphia Plan, which imposed goals and timetables for race-based hiring in the city's unions. Prior to the Philadelphia Plan, under Kennedy and Johnson, affirmative action had always meant to take affirmative action to ensure discrimination was not taking place. Now, affirmative action meant imposing racial preferences and quotas. After its launch in Philadelphia, the program was rolled out in dozens of other cities nationwide. In the meantime, the White House was busy stuffing racial-preference policies into the federal bureaucracy wherever it could find room. In the spring of 1969, Nixon expanded affirmative action mandates from government procurement contracts and applied them to any institution that received any federal funds of any kind, which brought universities, research institutions-basically everyone-into the fold. Then Nixon issued Executive Order 11478, which called for affirmative action in all government employment, bringing huge numbers of black workers onto the federal payroll. Racial preferences, as we know them today, were now sewn into the fabric of the country.\n\nPhoto courtesy Jack E. Kightlinger/White House Photo Office/National Archives and Records Service\n\nAnd affirmative action \"worked.\" The most immediate and measurable impact was in government hiring. Blacks had always enjoyed relatively better employment prospects in the public sector, and affirmative action greatly enhanced that. By the early 1970s, 57 percent of black male college graduates and 72 percent of black female college graduates were employed in government positions. The private sector also went on a hiring binge. Impelled by the fear of more urban riots, the Fortune 500 launched a flotilla of affirmative action programs aimed at getting as many black hires in the door as quickly as possible. After decades of economic stagnation, between 1969 and 1972, total black income rose from $38.7 billion to $51.1 billion, a 32 percent jump in just three years.\n\nRichard Nixon put more money in black wallets than JFK, LBJ, and MLK combined. While they never embraced Nixon, black Americans and their white liberal champions fell in love with quotas and set-asides. Many of the moderate and liberal Republicans in the White House had faith in affirmative action, too. Nixon's Secretary of Labor George Shultz, upon his nomination, acknowledged that black unemployment was the most pressing labor issue in the country, and believed that the Philadelphia Plan would offer a useful model for cities across the country. Even some conservatives were on board. Prominent Nixon-supporter William F. Buckley called for \"a pro-Negro discrimination\" in order to address the problem of unemployment.\n\nThe president, however, felt differently. Just weeks after calling the Philadelphia Plan \"historic and critical\" in Congress, Nixon jotted a note to domestic aide John Erlichman calling it \"an almost hopeless holding action at best,\" saying \"let's limit our public action and $-to the least we can get away with.\" Nixon's primary concern in the Oval Office was to make his mark as a great foreign policy leader. Vietnam, China, the Soviet Union-these were his main preoccupations. He wanted the home front happy and humming along so that he'd be free to spend his political capital overseas, and his approach to the volatile issues of race reflected this. Staunch opposition to school busing and fair housing would appease suburban white voters. Affirmative action on the jobs front would appease middle-class black voters, end the riots threatening corporate America's bottom line, and generally keep the racial question tamped down long enough for Nixon to win re-election in '72.\n\nGiven the immediate positive impact that affirmative action had, it was perfectly reasonable for liberals to want to believe that it could be, at long last, an answer to economic discrimination and structural inequality. But it wasn't. Not remotely. For starters, the quotas and mandates put in place were almost comically easy to evade. The skilled labor unions required to admit blacks engaged in practices known as checkerboarding (putting all the black hires on government-contracted job sites while ignoring the quotas everywhere else) and motorcycling (shuffling black hires from job site to job site depending on where federal inspectors were slated to show up). Quotas may have seemed like a positive development, and they did produce some jobs, but they also turned black employment into a numbers game-and gave employers a way to game the numbers.\n\nAffirmative action in state, local, and federal government offered decent jobs with decent wages, but the side effect of all this government hiring was to relieve the white collar private sector from having to truly confront the issue in its own staffing. For the minimal hiring it did do, corporate America made sure to meet its new quotas in the least disruptive way possible, hiring blacks for back-office roles in the accounting department, for example, or creating make-work departments that had no power and did nothing, like the community outreach or \"social responsibility\" department. Again, these were decent jobs with decent wages, but they diverted blacks from the business units where real decisions were made. Affirmative action offered the illusion of reparative justice wrapped up in the rhetoric of empowerment, but its net result was to absorb and neutralize black demands for equality, not fulfill them.\n\nPhoto courtesy Oliver F. Atkins/National Archives and Records Administration\n\nAnother effect of affirmative action was that it created a short-term labor shortage in the black middle class, because that's who affirmative action was designed to help. In Nixon's taxonomy of race, there was a clear division between \"the good blacks\" and the rest of urban America. \"There are 35 percent of blacks we can do good with,\" he told his staff. And it was squarely at this group that he aimed his policies. If you look at the areas where affirmative action was implemented-college admissions, corporate hiring, minority business loans, skilled labor unions, government office jobs-you'll notice that most of them aren't really things that will help you if you've never graduated from high school.\n\nThe urban poor were hopeless, just \"little black bastards on the welfare rolls at $2,400 a family,\" Nixon said, and for this group his policy aims were clear. Meeting notes taken by Nixon's Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman detail the president's directives:\n\nShift of policy of helping and backing the strong-instead of putting all effort into raising the weak\n\nbuild incentives for the strong + positive\n\ngive the fellowships to them instead\n\ndon't aim manpower programs at unemployed black male teenager ...\n\nFor the unemployed black male teenager, Nixon had a very different social program to offer. During his 1968 campaign, against the backdrop of violent riots in America's inner cities, the candidate made repeated and thinly veiled calls for \"law and order,\" criminalizing the urban poor in the nation's mind and promising his silent majority that lawbreakers would be dealt with harshly under his administration. Once in office, Nixon launched his now infamous \"War on Drugs,\" planting the seeds that have grown, decades later, into a system of mass incarceration-something all-too-familiar to the unemployed black male teenager of today. As the 1970s progressed, the black underclass was increasingly left behind while the black middle class was movin' on up -not to the East Side, typically, but to majority black suburbs where they continued to be isolated from the schools and social networks that offered access to greater economic opportunity.\n\nDid millions of people do well under affirmative action? Yes. A bribe only works if you actually give somebody something. But the benefits that accrued to black America under affirmative action could almost be considered a byproduct of the program's actual endgame: to give black people just enough to stop rioting and leave the white establishment to go about its business. While some black people used quotas and set-asides as a foothold to climb into genuine positions of power, the effect of affirmative action overall was to funnel upwardly mobile blacks into a separate employment pipeline where their aspirations were held in check, where they exercised very little authority, and where their progress depended on government intervention. Thanks to affirmative action, the black middle class was now vested in the very system the civil rights revolution had sought to overthrow.\n\nIII.\n\nWhen affirmative action was first implemented, it was not met with a broad backlash from white America. Like Nixon, the average white voter was inclined to do something \"not to have the goddamn country blow up.\" Then the 1970s recession hit and access to jobs felt more like a zero-sum game. It was then that white people began to use phrases like \"reverse racism\" and \"haven't we done enough for them already?\" The parties flip-flopped. Liberals, who had once disdained racial quotas as being antithetical to true liberty and justice, embraced them for the short-term leverage they provided. Republicans, once in favor of set asides and preferences as a cheap and easy solution for appeasing blacks, now saw them as a wedge issue useful for stirring up disaffected whites. Then Ronald Reagan was elected president and started undermining racial preferences just as quickly as Richard Nixon had put them in place.\n\nPhoto courtesy White House Photographic Office/National Archives and Records Administration\n\nTo this day, Reagan is vilified by the left as the man who crushed America's dream of racial equality by rolling back affirmative action. But of course Reagan started rolling back affirmative action. Why wouldn't he? Affirmative action was created by the Republican establishment to protect the Republican establishment. Once that group felt protected, once it was Morning in America and the riots had been reduced to occasional flare-ups in Liberty City and Crown Heights, affirmative action had largely fulfilled its purpose: Blacks had been pacified enough that their needs could be safely ignored. So why not start winding it down?\n\nThe problem with winding it down was that black Americans were now invested in it, had banked their hopes on it. By embracing affirmative action as a solution to economic disparity, the liberal establishment encouraged black Americans to double down on something that was never intended to close the economic gap in the first place. As a result, they were promised something that the government can't actually deliver.\n\nFor starters, the government doesn't actually enforce affirmative action. The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs is technically responsible for ensuring that America's affirmative action policies are carried out. Every year, every company with at least 50 employees doing at least $50,000 worth of business with the government has to file an Affirmative Action Plan with the OFCCP. This report tracks every interaction that takes place between that company and minority job candidates: new hires, promotions, demotions, department transfers, etc. All of this information is diligently, exhaustively compiled. Then nobody reads it. To police affirmative action in the largest economy in the world, the OFCCP has about 600 staffers. In a good year they review around 4 percent of these AAP filings. Of that, they investigate less than 1 percent.\n\nBut even if the government were keeping better tabs on affirmative action, the bigger problem is that its jurisdiction doesn't reach the parts of the economy where affirmative action is most desperately needed: the places where real money is made and real power is allocated. The best example of this is the industry that dominates so much of our economy today: the technology sector. Silicon Valley's racial diversity is pretty terrible, the kind of gross imbalance that inspires special reports on CNN .\n\nIt's a dismal state of affairs, but how could it really be otherwise? Silicon Valley isn't just an industry; it's a social and cultural ecosystem that grew out of a very specific social and cultural setting: mostly West Coast, upper-middle-class white guys who liked to tinker with motherboards and microchips. If you were around that culture, you became a part of it. If you weren't, you didn't. And because of the social segregation that pervades our society, very few black people were around to be a part of it.\n\nSome would purport to remedy this by fixing the tech industry job pipeline: more STEM graduates , more minority internships and boot camps , etc. And that will get you changes here and there, at the margins, but it doesn't get at the real problem. The big success stories of the Internet age-Instagram, YouTube, Twitter-all came about in similar ways: A couple of people had an idea, they got together with some of their friends, built something, called some other friends who knew some other friends who had access to friends with serious money, and then the thing took off and now we're all using it and they're all millionaires. The process is organic, somewhat accidental, and it moves really, really fast. And by the time those companies are big enough to worry about their \"diversity,\" the ground-floor opportunities have already been spoken for.\n\nA place like Silicon Valley doesn't have an established pipeline where the government can mandate there be X number of minority applicants per year who can then be tracked up the corporate ladder each fiscal quarter. A system has to have rules in order for authorities to make sure that those rules are being applied fairly to people of color. The legal profession is very mature. It has lots of rules. Municipal labor unions have rules. Silicon Valley doesn't have any rules. Hollywood doesn't have any rules. Media and publishing used to have rules, sort of, but Silicon Valley is destroying those rules as we speak and doesn't seem to be replacing them with any new ones.\n\nAffirmative action treats workplace discrimination like a bureaucratic, process-based problem. In reality, workplace discrimination stems from a very nebulous social and cultural problem. The government claims it can regulate the racial composition of our professional lives, but too much of what we call \"work\" is actually rooted in the messy, socially segregated realm of our personal lives. How many affirmative action compliance officers were stationed in Steve Jobs' garage while he and his buddy Steve Wozniak assembled the first Apple? Zero. It's possible to track what goes on in the human resources department and in the minutes of corporate board meetings, but too much of the economic life of this country transpires in the spaces in between. Racial preferences can provide just enough jobs and material support to keep up the illusion that we're moving toward equality, but no program can give black Americans real, sustained access to the places where the prerogatives of wealth and power are exercised. Only social and cultural integration can do that-the kind of integration Nixon opposed while he was advancing affirmative action.\n\nPhoto by Tony Avelar/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOf course, at first blush, the case against workplace affirmative action would seem to make the case for collegiate affirmative action: Admit black students to majority white colleges, and maybe a black student ends up in Mark Zuckerberg's dorm room when he starts Facebook. And to an extent that's true. Unlike the Hobbesian state of nature that is the 21 st -century job market, college admissions are a methodical, bureaucratic process where the special circumstances of minority students can be given extra weight and duly monitored for enforcement. And no matter what apoplectic conservatives say, racial diversity is no more \"unfair\" a standard than legacy status or geographic distribution or any of the other subjective criteria used in assembling a freshman class.\n\nBut does collegiate affirmative action, like its workplace cousin, just come too late in the game? In his memoir Reflections of an Affirmative Action Baby , Yale Law professor Stephen Carter-who describes himself as both a beneficiary and a victim of racial preferences-makes a sound argument. Because of the thorny politics and stigmas that inevitably come with race-conscious remedies, those remedies should start aggressively at a very young age and then, for everyone's good, taper off over time. If a 5-year-old from a disadvantaged background is given a leg-up to get into a good elementary school, that is not likely to be a stigma he will carry around as an adult-and you really have to try hard to begrudge helping out a 5-year-old. By contrast, for the thirtysomething black professional forced to walk in the door with whispers of \"diversity hire\" trailing her down the hallway, affirmative action can be a real problem. It serves as a diminishment of her talent and hard work. As much as affirmative action might help her get a foot in the door, it becomes a burden she has to carry from that day forward.\n\nStarting young would also likely increase the effectiveness of affirmative action. Thanks to structural inequality in access to resources, the statistical gaps between black and white Americans start the day we're born, with disparities in birth outcomes and infant mortality rates. Those gaps get wider with each passing year, as privileged kids get greater access to pre-K and extra tutoring until, come college application time, the gaps have become chasms. You've got a legion of helicopter-parented white kids, their resumes crammed full with every AP course and extracurricular whatnot under the sun-up against black students from working- and low-income backgrounds whose resumes are more likely to show a lot of unrealized potential, because AP physics and summer language camps in Vermont simply weren't available to them. We're asking a hell of a lot of college admissions officers if we expect them to close that gap with nothing more than a weighted point system for processing applications. In the end, most colleges end up cherry-picking the black kids with the best SAT scores in order to show their \"commitment to diversity,\" while the real problems of inequality go unaddressed. That hardly seems like a solution.\n\nAffirmative action becomes more contentious, more stigmatizing, harder to enforce, and less effective the older its purported beneficiaries are. Which means we're investing a lot of time and energy at the end of the pipeline that should be invested at the front of the pipeline. You integrate the workplace by integrating the high school cafeteria. Or, better yet, the elementary school playground. Racial preferences in college admissions may be better than racial preferences at the office, but that's not saying much. Affirmative action remains exactly what Richard Nixon said it was. It's a holding action, and a pretty hopeless one at that.\n\nIV.\n\nToday, the statistics on black and white inequality are so unchanging that they can be recited by rote: The black unemployment rate holds steady at double the white unemployment rate; the median net worth for black households is about 7 percent of white households; annual per capita income for blacks is 62 cents for every dollar of per capita income for whites. * When presented with these figures, supporters of affirmative action typically use them as evidence that conservatives kept affirmative action from working. Others say the statistics are proof that affirmative action didn't really work that well to begin with. But there's always the third option to consider: that persistent racial inequality is, at least in part, the result of affirmative action working exactly as it was intended to.\n\nPhoto courtesy Oliver F. Atkins/National Archives and Records Administration\n\nIt's not an accident that affirmative action and Nixon's \"law and order\" campaign are both rooted in the same historical moment: the backlash to civil rights. Liberals want to believe that affirmative action is a social good and mass incarceration is an unalloyed evil. The left wants to enshrine the former and abolish the latter. But affirmative action and mass incarceration are just two sides of the same coin: one program to manage the aspirations of the black middle class, one to contain the anger of the black underclass. Both are forms of social control, and neither has anything whatsoever to do with repairing the real damage wrought by slavery and segregation.\n\nIf we ever want to start fixing these problems, we can start by being honest about what affirmative action really is. Some advocates are doing just that. In The New Jim Crow , Michelle Alexander writes candidly about the symbiotic relationship between affirmative action and mass incarceration, saying \"perhaps the two are more linked than we realize,\" and asking blacks to consider if they've been \"bought off\" by a bribe. The consensus is starting to crack, a little. But to judge from the rhetoric that still surrounds the issue, most progressives are nowhere near ready to admit the truth: that the liberal establishment pinned the economic hopes of the civil rights revolution on a program set up by a president whose racial philosophy was based on the idea that blacks make great athletes and Asians are good at math.\n\nThe latest idea, floated by those who've started to admit the shortcomings of race-based affirmative action, is to replace it with class-based affirmative action. But that's an equally unpromising idea. The nature of affirmative action is that it skims. It elevates the best and the brightest of a disadvantaged group while doing nothing to eliminate the root causes of that group's disadvantage. Just as cherry-picking all the black kids with good SAT scores hasn't brought about the end of racism, cherry-picking all the poor kids with good SAT scores isn't going to do much to end poverty.\n\nAs big a detour as it's been, you can't just get rid of affirmative action. There is a separate and unequal economy that depends on it. Racial preferences may have taken black America into a socioeconomic cul de sac, but you can't just tear up the road and leave people with no way to get out. Fortunately, the one thing the left does have is the leverage and the political capital to end affirmative action in the right way. Right now, the Democratic party and the racial justice movement are sitting on a junk heap of racial preference programs that aren't doing anyone much good, and they lack the substantive programs they need: a true, New Deal-style reformation that repairs the infrastructure of our cities, ends mass incarceration, provides access to early education and paid family leave and job training and other programs that put all of black America on more solid footing. Since Republicans seem to want affirmative action gone so badly, if it were me, I'd be out horse trading. Just as the Obama administration is letting Washington and Colorado opt out of federal marijuana prohibition, let state and local governments opt out of affirmative action mandates, but only in exchange for opting in on universal pre-K and other things that working families actually need.\n\nIf conservative politicians and judges are allowed to end affirmative action for the wrong reasons-a very real and immediate possibility-it's safe to say that race relations in our great land will not improve. The onus falls on liberals to end it for the right reasons and to use that opportunity to replace it with something meaningful. Otherwise the status quo is never going to change, and America will keep on wandering in circles well short of the Promised Land.\n\nNext week: How the left failed to answer the most fundamental question of the civil rights era.\n\nCorrection, Feb. 11, 2014: This article previously stated that black workers make .62 cents for every dollar white workers make.

      "text": "What Justice Anthony Kennedy might have been thinking on affirmative action.\n\nAndrew Burton/Getty Images\n\nAs we break our breakfast (and go back to the fast, I guess), I wanted to say a few words in response to Dahlia's elegant and incisive critique of Justice Anthony Kennedy's opinion for the court in the Texas affirmative action case Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin ( Fisher II ). She found the opinion rather \"confusing,\" filled with \"rigor[ous] ... mushiness.\"\n\nHere are three takes on the Kennedy opinion in response.\n\nTake One (the Cynic) : This is just the sort of opinion one might expect from a swing justice who wants to keep his options open in future cases. We saw similar stuff from previous swing justices like Sandra Day O'Connor and Lewis Powell. On the one hand, the Fisher II opinion can, in the future, be limited to its unique facts, involving the general background of the University of Texas' uncontested Ten Percent Plan : Affirmative action was OK on this day, in this time, at this place, and in this way, but not in other situations of Kennedy's choosing. (If the swing justice is so inclined and the court's makeup allows it.) On the other hand, if the future swing justice would like to swing left rather than right, the Fisher II opinion can become a base from which further doctrinal expansion and evolution might occur: Strict scrutiny is evidently not fatal to affirmative action, in fact, and nondeferential review may involve rather more judicial deference than previously thought. (The deference, like the devil, is in the details, and the details are ultimately to be assessed by the swing justice.)\n\nTake Two (the Shrink): This is classic Kennedy. Sonorous and soaring, full of high-minded earnestness-and, of course, dignity-but at times gauzy and hard to understand in all its twists and turns. The opinion is especially awkward because Kennedy is trying to faithfully follow a landmark 2003 case in which he personally dissented , Grutter v. Bollinger . But what's up with his pointed citation to the dissent (by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg) in Fisher I , a case Kennedy himself authored only a few years ago-involving the very same parties as the case at hand?\n\nTake Three (the Generous Reader): The opinion reflects the intrinsic difficulties of affirmative action policy and affirmative action doctrine. Modern affirmative action is about history, about past governmental and societal discrimination, about black America in particular. But to openly admit all this is to risk stigma, stereotyping, and backlash. So instead we talk the happier talk of \"diversity\" in which no fingers of blame are pointed at past actors and actions, and fewer uncomfortable things are said or strongly implied about why these policies might be necessary.\n\nI myself am inclined to the third take. Perhaps it's because I have always been a fan of Justice Kennedy's, even though we do not always agree. Candidly, I just plain like him as a human being, and I am thus inclined to think that his music, like Wagner's, is actually better than it sounds.\n\nAnd speaking of liking people, it has been such great fun to breakfast with you all; you are a truly dazzling breakfast club! Thanks again for inviting me.\n\nRead the previous entry. | Read the next entry.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Why Some Asian-American Groups Are Supporting a Conservative Effort to Attack Affirmative Action\n\nBOSTON- About 100 people, half of the original crowd, remained in Copley Square on Sunday as a rally against Harvard reached its fourth hour.\n\nThe protesters, mostly Asian Americans, sat in a dozen rows of white folding chairs listening to speakers on the massive stage that the Asian American Coalition for Education, an advocacy group based in New Jersey, had rented for the event. The master of ceremonies, AACE Co-Founder Swan Lee, declared, \"We have gathered here to demand the equal protection promised in our country's constitution, and legal protection from discrimination based on our race!\" Her voice boomed from the excessive number of loudspeakers placed throughout the square, overpowering the beat of drums from a nearby union strike at the Westin hotel.\n\nIt was the day before a much-discussed lawsuit alleging anti-Asian bias in the university's admissions policies went to trial, and the square was festooned with American flags and posters with slogans like, \"Harvard Stop Asian Quota.\" Local political candidates had set up stands to hand out stickers on the perimeter. Elementary school children, no doubt restless from the drawn-out proceedings, zigzagged aimlessly through the crowd holding signs supporting the plaintiff.\n\n\"Asian people are so stubborn,\" the protester next to me murmured. \"They'll sit out in the cold for three hours.\" Though temperatures were dropping into the low 50s, the rally would last for another hour and a half.\n\nIf not for some measure of stubbornness, the coalition of Asian-American groups attending the rally would not likely have found themselves in Boston last weekend. The Students for Fair Admissions' lawsuit against Harvard, filed in 2014, gained steam over the past year as it moved closer to trial, but the contingent of the Asian-American community actively supporting the plaintiffs has been mobilizing around the issue of race in education since earlier this decade. Janelle Wong, a professor at the University of Maryland who studies Asian-American politics, said that the movement had in many ways originated in California in response to a state constitutional amendment proposed in 2012 that would have re-introduced race into admissions for local public universities.\n\n\"What is surprising is that you see that [this mobilization] is grassroots,\" Wong said. \"There's a lot of passion, and it's visible, but you don't see it in the public opinion data because it's still a minority of the Asian-American population that have these really strong feelings about this particular issue.\"\n\nIndeed, while polls have consistently found that most Asian Americans believe that affirmative action policies are good and necessary, academics have observed that the faction of largely Chinese American (and some South Asian) activists who are supporting SFFA's lawsuit have outsize visibility on the national stage. Many of the same groups are fighting New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's proposal to increase the number of black and Hispanic students at prestigious high schools in the city, a debate that has also captured national attention.\n\n\"In some ways, quite frankly, I'm kind of in awe of how organized and politically engaged they are,\" said OiYan Poon, the director of the Center for Racial Justice in Education at Colorado State University, who has studied and advocated for affirmative action for more than a decade. \"That's just very unique from most immigrant communities.\"\n\nSFFA founder Edward Blum has made it his mission to eradicate explicit considerations of race from all facets of American life . Blum, who is white, is a noted conservative activist with ties to an extensive GOP donor network. In fact, he ran in 1992 as a Republican congressional candidate in Houston. He lost and filed his first major lawsuit as a result, alleging that the district's distorted shape was the product of racial gerrymandering. Blum took the case all the way to the Supreme Court and won there in 1996. Since then, he's mounted more than two dozen lawsuits attempting to kneecap various voting rights and affirmative action policies throughout the U.S.\n\nBlum more recently engineered a 2013 Supreme Court case that devastated the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which was meant to ensure that black citizens were not deprived of their right to vote. He and SFFA were also behind the 2016 Supreme Court case Fisher v. University of Texas , which involved a white applicant named Abigail Fisher accusing the university of committing racial discrimination through its affirmative action policies. The court ruled in the school's favor.\n\nIn 2014, SFFA filed its lawsuit against Harvard alleging anti-Asian discrimination, the case that is currently before a federal court in Boston. The plaintiffs, Asian-American students who were rejected from Harvard, are unnamed. However, a groundswell of Asian-American groups have openly supported Blum, drawing the ire of liberal critics who argue that they're being used for a campaign that will ultimately hurt all people of color.\n\nThere are clear generational and class divides between the Asian-American supporters and critics of the lawsuit, according to Poon. The most active supporters of the lawsuit tend to be recent immigrants from mainland China who are highly educated-the type of skilled professionals who benefited from H1B and EB1 visas in the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\n\"Their immigration patterns are very different than for earlier waves of Chinese immigrants who came when immigration policies in the U.S. allowed for more family reunification [in the 1960s and 1970s],\" Poon says. And perhaps because the groups on this side of the debate have more recent ties to China, they typically discuss affirmative action and rally their adherents on the Chinese social media platform WeChat, where people who do not understand English can find Chinese-language summaries of documents from the lawsuit. A few of the protesters I spoke to at the rally said that I needed to download the app to properly cover the movement.\n\nThe coalition of Asian Americans opposing the lawsuit tends to be more ethnically diverse, Poon says, encapsulating a wider array of East, South, and Southeast Asians. The pre-eminent groups in this space, such as the National Council of Asian Pacific Americans (NCAPA) and Asian Americans Advancing Justice (AAAJ), were largely founded in the civil rights movement era.* There are also a wide range of student culture groups at Harvard, such as the South Asian Association and the Asian American Women's Association, that have recently formed a coalition called Defend Diversity to endorse Harvard's use of race in admissions.\n\nIn fact, these student activists held a counterprotest on Sunday only a few miles away at Harvard Square. A slightly smaller group, about 150 students and locals, congregated for speeches, musical acts, and call-and-response chants like \"No Justice, No Peace.\" The crowd was younger than the one at Copley Square, which was largely middle-aged parents. Students turned the raised platform next to a nearby Boston Metro entrance into a makeshift stage to sermonize about the value of learning alongside a diverse set of peers and the benefits that affirmative action affords to students of all ethnicities. Thang Diep, a Vietnamese Harvard student, talked about how he likely benefited from the admissions officers considering his race as an Asian American. \"The Asian-American-Pacific Islander community is often represented as a monolith. Supporting affirmative action means actively challenging that stereotype,\" he told the crowd.\n\nDespite the turnout there on Sunday, the issue generally has a large enthusiasm gap. Wong, the University of Maryland professor, has seen more protests among the Asian Americans on the other side of the debate. \"This is the issue that we see Asian Americans coming out in large numbers for,\" says Wong, who noted that she has not seen nearly as many Asian Americans come out for DACA or voting rights rallies. \"People who are pro-affirmative action care deeply, but it's not triggering the same level of in-person mobilization.\"\n\nThe protest at Copley Square featured an eclectic, and at times outlandish, lineup of speakers. It was a grab bag of leaders from Asian-American organizations, politicians, writers, and a couple of Harvard students. Vijay Jojo Chokal-Ingam, actress Mindy Kaling's brother, recounted his much-publicized tale of disguising himself as a black man while applying to medical school. A dozen children from the ages of 5 to 12 described their dream professions. Shiva Ayyadurai, an Independent Massachusetts Senate candidate who claims to be the \" inventor of email ,\" called on Harvard to be investigated for racketeering. Blum, the conservative activist who orchestrated SFFA's challenge to Harvard, brought up the history of Jewish exclusion at the university in a speech that received a standing ovation and shouts of \"Thank you, Ed!\"\n\nThe prevailing motif was the pursuit of a colorblind America, along with repeated invocations of Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream.\" Conservatives have long appropriated King's dictums during his campaign to end segregation for their own attacks on affirmative action. Yet, Asian Americans who oppose affirmative action have also taken to interpreting their own traumatic history in the U.S. to vouch for colorblindness. \"Asian Americans have suffered from race-based policies before,\" Yukong Zhao, president of the Asian American Coalition for Education, told me. \"[Affirmative action] is institutionalized discrimination in modern America. We cannot allow it to continue.\"\n\nAs Poon and other researchers have noted, these activists often take painful memories of the Chinese Exclusion Act, Japanese internment, racially segregated schooling, and other injustices in Asian-American history as proof that considerations of race tend to be perilous. An amicus brief submitted by the Asian American Legal Foundation and the AACE for a previous affirmative action case read, in part, \"[O]ur country's history has always, in the end, demonstrated that classification and discrimination by race was a mistake.\" (Scholars tend to attribute these policies instead to white supremacy.)\n\nThere is a more directly analogous event in Asian-American history that has sown mistrust toward university admissions. In the 1980s, the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights launched an investigation into Harvard, the University of California at Los Angeles, and the University of California at Berkeley in light of allegations that they were placing unconstitutional quotas on Asian Americans in favor of white applicants. While the department cleared Harvard after finding that the discrepancy between Asian and white admittances was due to preferences for legacies and athletes , rather than illegal quotas, both UC schools ended up apologizing for discriminating against Asians.\n\nThe impetus behind this discrimination, however, was what scholars now refer to as \"negative action,\" the preferential treatment of white over Asian-American applicants, rather than affirmative action, the consideration of race in admissions to boost underrepresented minorities and foster diversity. As Poon wrote in the book Contemporary Asian America, \"The experience with negative action in the 1980s contributed to a collective memory for Asian Americans and wariness of possible anti-Asian quotas.\"\n\nCritics contend that these groups have been duped by white conservatives' specious claims of anti-Asian discrimination and are now consigned to serve as racial mascots in a pernicious effort to dismantle all race-conscious policies for the ultimate benefit of white people. Academics and affirmative action advocates have often accused conservatives of using these Asian Americans as a \"wedge\" that prevents people of color from banding together. \"Affirmative action opponents are strategically using the argument of discrimination against Asian Americans to condemn the policy, seeking to split interracial coalitions that support the policy,\" writes Poon . \"This time they are capitalizing on a unique and recent rise of Chinese American immigrant opposition to affirmative action.\"\n\nIndeed, conservatives and the GOP had a marked presence at the rally. Tyrell Brown, the youngest black Republican ever elected in Connecticut, gave a speech about the faults of judging people based on race. Some people handed out fliers printed in Chinese promoting the re-election campaign for Massachusetts' Republican Gov. Charlie Baker. Ayyadurai, the Independent Massachusetts Senate candidate who gave a speech, has expressed pro-Trump sympathies , and his supporters handed out pamphlets at the rally attacking Elizabeth Warren with the slogan , \"Only a real Indian can beat a fake Indian.\"\n\nHowever, most of the Asian Americans associated with SFFA seemed skittish at the prospect of bringing explicit partisanship into the debate. For instance, a scuffle ensued early in the rally as a group of activists from Chinese Americans for Trump (CAFT) brought out two 10-foot-by-50-foot banners reading, \"Thank You President Trump 4 Meritocracy\" and \"Chinese Americans © Trump\" printed in MAGA-hat red. The Justice Department, under Trump, has written a brief in support of the lawsuit and is currently investigating Yale's admissions for proof of anti-Asian discrimination.\n\nProtesters with SFFA ran to block the banners from view with their own signs and argued bitterly with the Trump supporters in Mandarin. They even asked nearby police officers to remove the CAFT representatives-but to no avail, because the square is public property. \"They're really hurting our cause,\" said Yingchao Liu, a member of the Asian American Rights Association. \"Trump has a 40 percent approval rating. More Americans support our cause.\"\n\nThere seems to be disagreement among the Chinese supporters of SFFA's case over what, exactly, they are fighting for: the elimination of race-conscious admissions or an adjustment to the policy. Asian Americans are not, after all, a monolith.\n\nBlum has stated that his goal with the SFFA lawsuit is to eradicate all considerations of race from Harvard's admissions, yet \"affirmative action\" was never explicitly mentioned on the signs or literature at the rally. I asked a half-dozen people in the crowd whether they opposed the idea of using race in admissions, and all but one told me they weren't. Xiaodong Lu, one of the audience members, said, \"I am not 100 percent against affirmative action. For Asian Americans there is discrimination.\" S.B. Woo, founder of 80 20, an organization that has donated $35,000 to the lawsuit and the rally, said in his speech, \"We are not opposed to [affirmative action]. We are only opposed to Harvard's upside-down way of applying affirmative action to discriminate against us.\" On the other hand, Liu, the Asian American Rights Association member, told me that simply reforming the use of race factors in admissions instead of erasing it would be akin to \"making it to the Super Bowl, but not winning.\"\n\nAt the end of the trial's first day on Monday, I caught up with Zhao, the AACE president, who had come along with a couple dozen other protesters in a show of support for SFFA. I brought up the case's scope: At this stage in the litigation, the issue before the court is whether Harvard improperly applies its affirmative action policies to disadvantage Asian Americans, primarily in relation to white students. The judge has already ruled that Harvard may continue to use race in its admissions process, so that issue is off the table until a potential appeal. As the plaintiff's lawyer Adam Mortara said in his opening argument, \"The future of affirmative action is not on trial over the next three weeks.\"\n\nI asked Zhao whether he would be satisfied with a limited ruling that keeps affirmative action in place for underrepresented minorities but alters the policies just enough so that white applicants wouldn't get an advantage over Asian Americans.\n\nHe scoffed. \"We want take race out the equation absolutely,\" he told me. \"Even Dr. Martin Luther King would say the children in our nation should be judged by the content of their character and not the color of their skin. ... We'll continue to have lawsuits. This battle, like the Civil Rights movement, will take many years.\"\n\nCorrection, Oct. 23, 2018: This post originally misidentified the acronym for Asian Americans Advancing Justice as \"AAAJC.\" It is in fact \"AAAJ.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Clarence Thomas Benefited From Race-Based Preferences Throughout His Career\n\nThis is part of Opinionpalooza , Slate's coverage of the major decisions from the Supreme Court this June. We consider this piece so essential that we're making it free for all readers. Sign up for the pop-up newsletter to receive our latest updates, and support our groundbreaking work when you join Slate Plus . And listen to this season of Slow Burn: Becoming Justice Thomas .\n\nOn Thursday, the Supreme Court effectively struck down affirmative action, outlawing race-conscious admissions and overturning nearly 50 years of precedent. While John Roberts authored the opinion , Clarence Thomas wrote his own concurrence with the decision.\n\nAt his Supreme Court confirmation hearing in 1991, Clarence Thomas said that affirmative action can undermine the \"self-esteem and self-respect\" of the people it's supposedly helping. On that day, Thomas sat before the U.S. Senate having accumulated decades of achievement-and having benefited from race-based preferences every step of his way.\n\nThomas, who went to college in the late 1960s, was part of the first generation of Black Americans who came of age in the affirmative action era.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy was the first president to call for \"affirmative action\" in the modern sense of the term. His successor, Lyndon Johnson, tried to make that bold idea into the law of the land. But Johnson's affirmative action proposal was mired in controversy, and ultimately got scrapped. The concept was then revived under a Republican president, Richard Nixon.\n\nOne of the main proponents of \"positive discrimination\" was Nixon's assistant secretary of labor. He was a Black Republican named Arthur Fletcher . He's known as the \"father of affirmative action.\" Fletcher, who in 1950 became the first Black player for the NFL's Baltimore Colts, was focused on getting government contractors to hire more minority workers.\n\nBut affirmative action wouldn't be limited to the public sector. \"Private organizations see the writing on the wall and begin to institute their own version of affirmative action,\" said Leah Wright Rigueur, a history professor at Johns Hopkins University. Among those private organizations were institutions of higher learning.\n\nThomas enrolled at the College of the Holy Cross in 1968 as a second-year transfer. He got admitted thanks to his good grades and a recommendation from a nun-and maybe in part because the school was actively looking for Black students.\n\nThree years later, in 1971, he got accepted to multiple law schools. One of them was Harvard, which had just adopted a \"race-conscious\" admissions policy . Thomas had once fantasized about going to Harvard Law. But when it came time to choose, he decided on Yale because he thought it would be a better fit for his liberal politics.\n\nThomas arrived at Yale at the exact moment it created its first explicit affirmative action program. It was designed to set minority enrollment at about 10 percent of the incoming class.\n\nDuring his Supreme Court confirmation hearing, Thomas said that he believed he'd earned his spot at Yale, and hadn't received any special treatment due to his race.\n\nWhat Thomas said in 1991 isn't wrong: Yale did open its doors to minority students that it felt were qualified. But the New York Times' reporting that same year uncovered the whole truth: Yale did evaluate Black applicants like Thomas separately, and they did get special consideration.\n\nThomas was one of 12 Black students in the first-year class of 175. Yale had a reputation as a proving ground for the academic elite, a place that counted seven Supreme Court justices among its former students. And when Thomas got there, he started to question whether he belonged.\n\nMost days, he would get up before dawn, go to class, and study until he fell asleep. He also worked 15 hours a week at a legal clinic. But no matter how hard he tried, it didn't feel like it would ever be good enough. During his time at Yale, a member of the law school's admissions committee told a group of Black students that none of them were qualified to be there.\n\nAs Thomas continued at Yale, he started scouting out job opportunities. During his last year, he interviewed with some big-city firms, and figured he'd get a bunch of lucrative job offers. But as his classmates zoomed off to start their careers, Thomas heard no after no after no. Years later, he said in an interview that he'd held on to all of those rejection letters.\n\nThomas suspected that those top law firms doubted his qualifications. What good was a Yale Law degree if everyone who mattered thought it was tainted by affirmative action? After Thomas finished up in New Haven, he stuck a 15-cent-cigar sticker on his diploma. To him, that's all it was worth.\n\nWhen Thomas did finally get a job, however, it was at least in part because of his race. That's what his political mentor John Danforth, who was then the attorney general of Missouri, told me. \"My ambition was that the AG's office was to be the best law office in the state. Did I also think that it was important to have a diverse office? Yes, I did,\" said Danforth, who later became a U.S. senator. \"And did I think that it was important, that it would be wonderful to hire Clarence Thomas for that reason? Yes.\"\n\nIncidentally, before the Supreme Court's decision today, Danforth also told me that affirmative action should be upheld. \"I think that slavery and Jim Crow are serious stains on our country, and the consequences can be measured in life expectancy, health care, wealth, income, transportation, housing. Statistically, African Americans are not doing as well as the rest of us,\" he said. \"I believe that when a problem exists, it should be addressed affirmatively.\"\n\nThomas would eventually leave Danforth's office for Monsanto, at a time when the chemical company was looking to hire Black lawyers. He'd then go to work for Danforth in Washington, D.C., when the new senator was looking to diversify his staff. After that, he'd get a job at Reagan's Department of Education, one that Thomas believed he'd been offered only because he was Black. He then became the chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a position that six Black women had turned down before Thomas accepted it. From there, he was nominated to a federal judgeship by President George H.W. Bush, and then to the Supreme Court.\n\n\"Of course, every job he'd ever gotten was because he was Black,\" his former girlfriend Lillian McEwen, a retired administrative law judge at the Securities and Exchange Commission, told me. \"That was his whole life.\"\n\nI grew up in the affirmative action era, too, albeit a generation later than Clarence Thomas. Still, when I went to high school and college in the 1990s, I heard the same stuff Thomas heard, about how I was only there because of affirmative action. It was a familiar refrain, one that I knew didn't have much to do with me or my academic qualifications. I gradually came to understand that the white people who said that to me would never believe I was qualified, no matter what.\n\nBut Thomas, apparently, has taken those insults much more personally. Juan Williams, his friend and a former Washington Post reporter, saw that frustration up close.\n\nIn 1986, Thomas was sworn in for his second term as chairman of the EEOC. Several high-ranking members of the Reagan administration were there, including William Bradford Reynolds, a white official from the Department of Justice. Reynolds raised his glass for a toast and said , \"Clarence Thomas is the epitome of the right kind of affirmative action working the right way.\"\n\n\"And Thomas just seethes over this comment, because I can tell you he has never seen himself as an example of affirmative action,\" Williams told me. \"He's seen himself as having earned and worked hard to earn advancement.\"\n\nWilliams remembered it as \"a pained response-you know, 'This shit never stops with white people.' \"\n\nDid Clarence Thomas benefit from affirmative action-or did it hold him back?\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Martin Luther King Jr. Had a Dream for Economic Affirmative Action. The Supreme Court Failed Him.\n\nThis essay has been adapted from the forthcoming book Class Matters: The Fight to Get Beyond Race Preferences, Reduce Inequality, and Build Real Diversity at America's Colleges .\n\nIn the era of Donald Trump, many liberals understandably look back with fondness at the time when Republican moderates recognized that racial diversity strengthens institutions.\n\nSuch nostalgia can include favorable feelings for three Republican-appointed Supreme Court justices who, over the course of nearly four decades, provided the crucial swing votes to sustain racial affirmative action in higher education. Nixon appointee Lewis F. Powell Jr. did so in the 1978 Bakke decision. Reagan appointee Sandra Day O'Connor did so in the 2003 Grutter ruling. And another Reagan appointee, Anthony Kennedy, did so in the 2016 Fisher case.\n\nBut what if that view is wrong? Looking back today, after the Supreme Court's 2023 Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard decision, which struck down racial preferences, a very different picture emerges. Many (though not all) colleges have managed to preserve previous levels of racial diversity by adopting new programs to admit more low-income and working-class students of all races.\n\nIn light of this emerging evidence, the efforts of moderate Republican-appointed justices to fortify racial preferences takes on a different light. After all, the old admissions regime tended to benefit well-off Black and Hispanic students, and it provided political cover for a larger system of preferences for the mostly white children of alumni, donors, and faculty that is now coming under attack . What if the Republican moderates weren't so much champions of racial justice as economic elitists who fulfilled the worst stereotypes of Republicans from that era?\n\nIndeed, in the early discussions of affirmative action in the 1960s, racial preferences were not the favored path of many liberal heroes.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr., for example, argued that with passage of civil rights laws, affirmative action programs should be aimed at supporting economically disadvantaged people of all races. King proposed a Bill of Rights for the Disadvantaged rather than a Bill of Rights for Black people. He suggested that an economic approach to affirmative action would disproportionately benefit Black people, who suffered the economic legacy of racial discrimination, and that poor white people should also be included as \"a simple matter of justice.\" King also predicted-accurately-that racial preferences would fracture his dream of a multiracial progressive coalition of working-class people.\n\nIn 1974, King's idea of economic affirmative action was picked up by Justice William O. Douglas, who is largely viewed as one of the Supreme Court's most liberal members. When a low-income white Jewish applicant, Marco DeFunis, challenged racial preferences at the University of Washington Law School, Douglas wrote that admissions boosts should be provided on the basis of class disadvantage, not race.\n\nDouglas wrote :\n\nA black applicant who pulled himself out of the ghetto into a junior college may thereby demonstrate a level of motivation, perseverance, and ability that would lead a fair-minded admissions committee to conclude that he shows more promise for law study than the son of a rich alumnus who achieved better grades at Harvard. That applicant would be offered admissions not because he is black, but because as an individual he has shown he has the potential, while the Harvard man may have taken less advantage of the vastly superior opportunities offered him.\n\nDouglas did not prevail. A majority of the justices in the case ruled that it was moot because DeFunis had already graduated from law school. But the larger issue did not go away. In 1978, Allan Bakke, who was white and the son of a milkman, filed a lawsuit after being denied admission to the University of California at Davis Medical School, despite having stronger academic credentials than many of the minority students admitted through a racial quota that set aside 16 out of 100 seats.\n\nThe court was split. Four conservatives said the quotas were a violation of the Civil Rights Act. Four liberals backed class-blind racial quotas. When one member of the liberal group, Justice William Brennan, asked Justice Thurgood Marshall whether Marshall's economically privileged Black son deserved a preference, Marshall replied : \"Damn right. They owe us.\"\n\nThe swing vote was Lewis Powell Jr., who was looking for a compromise. Powell could have picked up on Douglas' approach, but, unsurprisingly, he did not. The two justices were about as far apart on issues of class as imaginable.\n\nDouglas, raised by a struggling single mother, and appointed to his seat in 1939 by Franklin Roosevelt, saw the importance of class inequality in virtually all his jurisprudence. He joined in decisions striking down California's \"anti-Okie\" law that made it a crime to transport a poor individual into the state, providing the right of counsel to indigent criminal defendants, and invalidating poll taxes that required people to pay to exercise their right to vote.\n\nPowell, by contrast, was born into a prosperous family and attended private schools. As a corporate lawyer, he worked closely with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and represented tobacco giant Philip Morris. On the Supreme Court, Powell authored a major decision that denied protections to economically disadvantaged children seeking equal educational funding.\n\nIn the Bakke case, Powell took his cue from Harvard University, which argued that racial preferences were justified not as a remedy for America's history of racial oppression but in order to provide the educational benefits of a diverse student body. Harvard, of course, had an enormous financial self-interest in avoiding Douglas' class-based approach to affirmative action. Students admitted under such a plan would need financial aid. Racial preferences were much cheaper. Data later showed that nearly three-quarters of Black and Hispanic students at Harvard were from the richest one-fifth of the Black and Hispanic populations nationally.\n\nPowell, the former corporate lawyer and decisive vote in Bakke , ultimately diverted the dream of class-based affirmative action that King and Douglas had championed. Powell's worldview helped set the tone on the issue for decades to come.\n\nThe American public never agreed with Powell's support for racial preferences, and in a series of referenda, including in California in 1996 and Washington in 1998, voters rejected such policies. By 2003, opponents of racial preferences were back in the Supreme Court challenging the use of race at the University of Michigan, and they had good reason to believe that they might prevail. The swing vote on the court, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, had been a skeptic of racial preferences and had authored a 1995 decision saying that institutions needed to try \"race-neutral alternatives\" to achieve racial diversity before resorting to racial preferences.\n\nThere was growing evidence that the Douglas-King approach could work to produce high levels of racial diversity, but O'Connor voted to preserve racial preferences and said she took Michigan \"at its word that it would 'like nothing better than to find a race-neutral admissions formula' and will terminate its race-conscious admissions program as soon as practicable.\" Like Powell, she ignored the massive financial incentive universities had to stretch the truth to claim that class-based affirmative action wouldn't work.\n\nJustice Anthony Kennedy dissented in the Michigan case, believing that O'Connor had been too deferential to the university. But when the Supreme Court took up a challenge to racial preferences at the University of Texas at Austin 13 years later, Kennedy would end up rejecting the King-Douglas approach as well.\n\nThe Texas case presented the issue of race-neutral alternatives squarely. In the face of a circuit court ruling banning racial preferences in the 1990s, the state Legislature, working with Gov. George W. Bush, had created the Top Ten Percent Plan to admit students from across the state who graduated with the highest grades in their high school classes, coupled with consideration of economic status rather than race. Suddenly, students from poor and working-class high schools that had sent few students to the flagship, UT Austin, had access. The result was higher levels of racial diversity, and much greater socioeconomic diversity, than under the old system of racial preferences.\n\nNevertheless, when O'Connor gave the green light to use race in admissions in 2003, UT reinstated its racial preferences for a portion of the class, while also retaining the Top Ten Percent Plan. Everything seemed queued up for a victory for class-based affirmative action. But in a 2016 opinion, Kennedy balked. He wrote that Texas' Top Ten Percent Plan and enhanced consideration of socioeconomic disadvantage was not a viable alternative in part because \"the Equal Protection Clause does not force universities to choose between a diverse student body and a reputation for academic excellence.\"\n\nThe elitist subtext of this passage was that programs that relied on recruiting economically disadvantaged students from working-class high schools inherently conflicted with high academic standards. Kennedy provided no evidence for his position, presumably because there was plenty of evidence contradicting it. Justice Samuel Alito noted in his dissent in the case that Top Ten Percent Plan students didn't struggle academically; in fact, they received \"higher college grades than the African-American and Hispanic students admitted under the race-conscious program.\"\n\nIn the most recent round of litigation, the 2023 case of Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard , elites finally lost. Harvard trotted out the old argument that if it admitted more low-income and working-class students in order to achieve high levels of racial diversity, the academic caliber of the institution would suffer great harm. As an expert witness in the case, however, I demonstrated , in collaboration with a Duke University economist, that if Harvard increased its preferences for economically disadvantaged students and ended its preferences for the children of alumni and faculty, it could produce almost as much racial diversity as through its use of racial preferences, and mean SAT scores would still be at the 98 th percentile.\n\nHarvard also claimed that Black representation would plummet from 14 percent to 6 percent if it couldn't use racial preferences. But when it reported its data in 2024, after the use of race had been banned, the Black share of the student body was not 6 percent but 14 percent, a modest decrease from the previous year. Hispanic representation actually grew from 14 percent to 16 percent, and Asian representation held steady at 37 percent. A decade earlier, around the time the litigation was filed, just 7 percent of Harvard students were the first in their families to attend college. By 2024, under intense public scrutiny from the litigation, that share tripled to 21 percent.\n\nOther institutions, such as Yale and Dartmouth , maintained high levels of racial diversity and reported record levels of socioeconomic diversity.\n\nParadoxically, a right-wing court decision helped bring universities back full circle to the economic approach to affirmative action backed by Martin Luther King Jr. and William O. Douglas. Justices Powell, O'Connor, and Kennedy no longer look like moderate heroes for saving racial preferences, but rather like guardians of privilege. Today, decades later, selective universities are finally opening their doors to meaningful numbers of talented working-class students of all races.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

A 1996 state proposition banned race-based affirmative action from the University of California.\n\nPhoto by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling in Fisher v. University of Texas won't end race-based affirmative action. The court made it harder for schools to defend their policies but not impossible. Justice Anthony Kennedy said for the majority, about any court faced with a challenge to a university's affirmative-action policy, \"The reviewing court must ultimately be satisfied that no workable race-neutral alternatives would produce the educational benefits of diversity.\"\n\nStill, this decision could-and should-lead to a smarter kind of affirmative action that is mostly based on class rather than race. Ten states have banned race-based affirmative action, usually by voter initiative. After the bans passed, an initial dip in minority enrollment often followed. But then in most of these states, schools created new programs to promote racial and ethnic diversity indirectly by giving an admissions preference to low-income students, boosting financial aid, and reducing reliance on test scores. I show this in a report I wrote with Halley Potter, A Better Affirmative Action: State Universities that Created Alternatives to Racial Preferences (PDF).\n\nThe new affirmative action, based primarily on economic disadvantage, better addresses the glaring inequities students face. As you can see from the chart below, a student who is socioeconomically disadvantaged, in a variety of ways, scores on average 399 points lower on the SAT than a wealthy student. By contrast, the average SAT difference between African-American and white students of the same socioeconomic status is only 56 points. * In other words, the SAT class gap is seven times as large as the SAT race gap.\n\nSource: Anthony P. Carnevale and Jeff Strohl, \"How Increasing College Access Is Increasing Inequality, and What to Do about It,\" in Rewarding Strivers: Helping Low-Income Students Succeed in College, Richard D. Kahlenberg, ed., (New York: Century Foundation Press, 2010), 170, Table 3.7.\n\nIf universities wanted to be truly meritocratic in admissions, they would weight socioeconomic status heavily and race lightly. In fact, research shows that selective universities do the opposite.\n\nSource: Thomas J. Espenshade and Alexandria Walton Radford, No Longer Separate, Not Yet Equal (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2009), 92, Table 3.5.\n\nCurrently, selective schools boost the chances of admission of black and Hispanic students by 28 percentage points. That is, if a white candidate has a 30 percent chance of being admitted based on her record, an African-American or Latino student with the same record has a 58 percent chance. By contrast, low-income students receive no boost whatsoever.\n\nNote: Figures refer to 1995 applicant pool.

Tobin, Equity and Excellence in American Higher Education (Charlottesville, VA: University of Virginia Press, 2005), 105, Table 5.1.\n\nColleges and universities say they care about economic diversity among students. But 74 percent of students at the most selective 146 schools come from the top socioeconomic quarter of the population, while just 3 percent come from the poorest quarter. Put differently, you are 25 times as likely to run into a rich kid as a poor kid on these campuses.\n\nSource: Anthony P. Carnevale and Stephen J.

Kahlenberg (ed), America's Untapped Resource: Low Income Students in Higher Education (The Century Foundation, 2004), p. 106, Table 3.1.\n\nWhat happens to racial diversity when colleges stop using racial preferences in admissions? The numbers of minority students don't necessarily drop. After the University of Texas at Austin was barred from considering race by a 1996 court decision , officials started factoring in socioeconomic status. Then the university began admitting students who graduate in the top 10 percent of their high school class. By 2004, these race-neutral plans, coupled with growing diversity statewide, produced more racial and ethnic diversity at UT-Austin than had been achieved in 1996 using race.\n\nSource: Brief for Petitioner in Abigail Noel Fisher v.

Those schools are UC-Berkeley, UCLA, and the University of Michigan. They are the three most selective schools in the study Halley Potter and I did, and the most likely to draw from a national pool of applicants. That's important because Berkeley, UCLA, and Michigan were competing for minority students with other universities that could continue to use racial preferences in admission. Given that uneven playing field, it's not surprising that these three universities have had difficulty in recruitment.\n\nSource: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/\n\nSome studies find that income-based affirmative action won't produce much racial diversity. That's true in part because, on average, compared with whites of the same income level, black and Latino students face extra obstacles-they are more likely to live in neighborhoods with concentrated poverty, and to have less family wealth. UCLA Law School developed a definition of socioeconomic disadvantage that includes family wealth and neighborhood poverty, as well as income. Using those measures, the school admitted far more black and Latino students than it did using the regular admissions standards that didn't include these factors.\n\nSource: Karman Hsu, director of admissions, UCLA Law School, email to Halley Potter on September 4, 2012.\n\nIf schools admit more low-income students, will graduation rates drop (because of poor preparation in K-12)? A simulation of admissions at the most selective 146 universities shows that graduation rates would slightly rise if the proportion of students from the less wealthy half of the population rose increased from 10 percent to 38 percent, using admissions standards based on merit plus class-based affirmative action, and compared with current admissions policies that take into account merit, race, athletic status, and legacy status.\n\nSource: Anthony P.

      "text": "Between a Quota and a Hard Place\n\nPhotograph by Erich Schlegel/Getty Images.\n\nAs I listened to the Supreme Court wrestle with the lion that is affirmative action this morning, I kept thinking about the enduring view of the leaders of big business, small business, and the military. In 2003, the last time race in college admissions came before the court, Wall Street, Main Street, and retired military leaders said that diversity in college is crucial, for training people of different races and ethnic backgrounds and for exposing them to each other. This time, the same constituencies are back, calling diversity in school an economic imperative. Who, then, should get to decide how admissions play out in practice-the universities or the court?\n\nIt was Justice Stephen Breyer who framed the case of Abigail Fisher, a white applicant to the University of Texas-Austin who was denied admission four years ago, in terms of the job of the court versus the job of the schools. He pointed out that the court's 2003 ruling, in Grutter v. Bollinger , was built to last 25 years, in the words of its author, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. \"I know time flies,\" Breyer said to Fisher's lawyer, Bert Rein. \"But are you asking us to overrule\" Grutter ? And if so, why, given that the case \"took so much time and thought and that so many people across the country rely on it?\" Later, Breyer said he'd tried to figure out exactly how many universities have affirmative action plans like the one permitted in Grutter , which allowed race to be a factor in actions if schools don't resort to quotas. He's not sure of the exact number, but it's a lot.\n\nRein won't concede that he wants the court to overrule Grutter . He also doesn't agree when Justice Sonia Sotomayor says, \"You just want us to gut it.\" * But that's the vulnerability in Rein's argument: It's hard to differentiate the way in which UT takes race into account from the way the University of Michigan approaches it, something the court permitted nine years ago. Indeed, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg calls UT's policy \"more modest.\" (We didn't get to hear from Justice Elena Kagan today. She recused herself from the case.)  The university admits up to 80 percent of its class by automatically admitting the top 10 percent of high school graduates across the state. The rest of the spots are allotted based on academic performance and an index of personal achievement that includes a host of attributes, from essays to leadership to community service to socioeconomic status and, yes, race. It's individualized and holistic-the magic Grutter words. No quota.\n\nHere's the conservative line of attack on UT, which Justices Antonin Scalia, Samuel Alito, and Chief Justice John Roberts take turns pursuing: How do you know when you've arrived? Grutter allowed universities to think in terms of admitting a \"critical mass\" of minority students. How many is that?\n\nSotomayor brings up a survey UT did, which showed minority students feel isolated. Breyer says that before Grutter , UT was 4 percent African-American and that today it's 6 percent African-American, compared with 12 percent of the population of Texas. The school still has a ways to go toward admitting its fair share of black students? Well, that depends. Sotomayor thinks the demographics matter-she says Rein \"can't seriously suggest\" otherwise. But when he doesn't contradict her, Scalia does. \"Why don't you seriously suggest that the demographic makeup of the state has nothing to do \" with determining whether it has a critical mass of minority students, Scalia urges.\n\nThe problem for UT is that if critical mass turns into a specific number, it \"sounds an awful lot like a quota,\" as Sotomayor puts it. This is a trap that Greg Garre, the lawyer for UT, tries hard not to fall into. He goes back to the university's study of minority students' feelings of isolation and to the school's lower minority enrollment in earlier years. Finally, pressed, he throws out the figure of 20 percent for critical mass. He must mean this for each minority group separately, since the majority of UT's student body is now made up of minorities, if you include Asians.\n\nIn any case, Garre spends most of his time parrying, as Scalia, Alito, and Roberts make UT's admissions policy sound like the worst kind of intrusive bean counting. Roberts wants to know if you can check the box for being a member of a minority if you're one quarter Japanese. Scalia asks, \"If this person looks 1/32 Hispanic, is that enough?\" He and Alito are especially scathing about UT's effort to promote diversity in the classroom: How could the university ever ensure minorities were adequately represented in each course? Later, Scalia asks how many people UT employs to monitor its \"ambitious racial program.\" * All of this echoes Roberts' past words, \"it's a sordid business, this divvying us up by race.\" To him, it doesn't matter whether the government is divvying people by race to benefit historically disadvantaged groups. In Roberts' eyes, it's still very, very bad.\n\nThe member of the court who will decide this case, Justice Anthony Kennedy, takes a while to speak and starts off sounding relatively mild. But the thrust of his question to Garre spells trouble for affirmative action policies. Kennedy is concerned that UT's admissions policy favors some privileged minorities over poorer white people. Alito is also upset about this: He says that the whole purpose of affirmative action is to help underprivileged groups, but that UT is trying to admit wealthy minority students to achieve the sort of all-around diversity it seeks. \"What if they're in the top 1 percent,\" he says. \"Do they deserve a leg up over a white applicant who is absolutely average?\"\n\nThis is a tough one for Garre, and then for Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, who takes UT's side on behalf of the Obama administration. Verrilli's answer is about \"individualized review of applications that furthers the educational mission.\" He brings up the hypothetical African-American fencer or the Hispanic who has mastered Greek. These students serve the education mission because they \"play against stereotype,\" he says.\n\nVerrilli also tries to argue, if I understood correctly, that race never necessarily determines whether UT admits a particular applicant. Scalia is incredulous. Kennedy says he doesn't understand the argument. Verrilli tries to explain that UT's consideration of race \"functions more subtly.\" It doesn't quite work in the courtroom, but I think what he's after is the idea that when you're weighing any number of personal attributes, as many parts of a whole, it's actually not clear that one candidate's race, as opposed to the way in which his background helps shape his life experience or leadership potential, vaults him over another candidate. Stanford law professor Richard Thompson Ford makes the point that in this sense, universities are like employers who use qualitative measures-\"soft skills\"-rather than objective ones when choosing among candidates to fill an opening. How exactly do you know that race, per se, is playing a defining role?\n\nMaybe this is what Grutter is striving for: You don't. You can have affirmative action without the rote selection of minority applicants over white ones. Except that this is not how people like Abigail Fisher will ever see it. Justice O'Connor was also in court today, resplendent in purple. If she'd been sitting on the bench, maybe the idea that race is worth considering, among many factors, would have at least 16 more years of staying power. But Alito has her seat and he doesn't share her timeline.\n\nCorrection , Oct. 11, 2012 : This article originally misspelled Justice Sonia Sotomayor's first name. ( Return to the corrected sentence.)

      "text": "The Supreme Court Just Bulldozed Affirmative Action-With Two Bizarre Loopholes\n\nThis is part of Opinionpalooza , Slate's coverage of the major decisions from the Supreme Court this June. We consider this piece so essential that we're making it free for all readers. Sign up for the pop-up newsletter to receive our latest updates, and support our groundbreaking work when you join Slate Plus .\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that race-conscious admissions programs at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violate the 14 th Amendment's equal protection clause-effectively outlawing overt considerations of race at civilian institutions of higher education, public and private. It is a sprawling 237-page decision , including multiple concurrences and dissents, and lower courts will spend years fighting over its proper interpretation. At the outset, though, one thing is clear: Chief Justice John Roberts' opinion for the court carves two loopholes-the strength of which are to be determined-into its otherwise emphatic holding. First, he wrote that schools can still consider how \"an applicant's discussion of how race affected his or her life\" in an essay, so long as they are still \"treated based on his or her experiences as an individual-not on the basis of race.\" Second, Roberts exempted military academies from his holding altogether, for now.\n\nThese qualifications make the chief justice's otherwise thunderous opinion rather puzzling. It will undoubtedly curtail universities' use of race in building each incoming class, outlawing \"check the box\"-style racial identifications that make admissions officers' work easier. And that sea change will absolutely damage schools' efforts to aid underrepresented racial minorities who've received none of the privileges that many white applicants take for granted. In that respect, the decision is a massive blow to racial justice, one with noxious consequences throughout society that we will feel for the rest of our lives. \"The absence of race-conscious college admissions,\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in dissent, \"will decrease the pipeline of racially diverse college graduates to crucial professions,\" including business, public service, science, technology, and medicine . This lack of diversity doesn't just hurt racial minorities. It hurts everyone.\n\nBut in a direct response to the incandescent dissents by Sotomayor and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, Roberts' opinion leaves some room for admissions officers to undertake what might be called a \"holistic review\" of each applicant, including their racial identity as it relates to their life experiences. A \"holistic review,\" however, was already required by the precedents that Roberts effectively overturned on Thursday. Thus, the decision substitutes one vague regime with an even more ambiguous one-inviting, as Sotomayor noted, \"a plethora of litigation\" that will \"promote chaos\" rather than establishing a workable new order.\n\nStudents for Fair Admissions is the opinion that Roberts has always wanted to write. The chief justice believes in a \"colorblind\" 14 th Amendment, one that was ratified not to help Black Americans achieve equal citizenship-through race-conscious measures when necessary-but to abolish the government's ability to classify citizens on the basis of race. And so, in his opinion, he traced the familiar history of Plessy v. Ferguson (which authorized \"separate but equal\") to Brown v. Board of Education (which did away with it) and the decades of decisions implementing Brown 's promise. Affirmative action, he wrote, was always an aberration. The Supreme Court decisions allowing this practice have always subjected it to strict scrutiny, demanding proof that any race-conscious program is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling interest.\n\nFor nearly half a century, the court has held that diversity in the classroom provides \"education benefits,\" which satisfies the compelling interest requirement. Much of Roberts' opinion is devoted to shooting down that principle. These \"benefits,\" he wrote, are not \"sufficiently measurable\" to be \"subjected to meaningful judicial review.\" Goals like \"training future leaders\" and \"promoting the robust exchange of ideas\" are \"commendable,\" but they are not \"sufficiently coherent\" to satisfy strict scrutiny, because courts cannot measure them. Nor can universities \"articulate a meaningful connection\" between these goals and their actual race-conscious admissions programs. Harvard and UNC, he wrote, use \"opaque racial categories\" that are \"arbitrary\" and \"often operate as a stereotype,\" harming Asian applicants (by allegedly viewing their race as a \"negative factor\") and Black applicants (by viewing their race as a positive factor) alike. There is \"no logical end point\" to this \"discrimination,\" Roberts wrote. All of which proves that the universities are in ongoing violation of the equal protection clause.\n\nSo: Did Roberts \"overturn\" affirmative action? The maddening answer is yes and no. The chief justice did not declare that the leading precedents, Grutter and Fisher , have been formally overruled. Instead, he wrote that Harvard and UNC had failed to comply with their dictates. In doing so, though, the chief justice redefined these precedents' requirements so narrowly and stringently that they are now impossible to comply with, at least as affirmative action is currently practiced. (In dissent, Sotomayor accused him of overruling these precedents while pretending not to, which is correct.) Grutter and Fisher tacitly deferred to universities' own view about the educational benefits of race-conscious admissions, assuming that they could measure the classroom impact of diversity in good faith. Roberts shatters that deference, putting Harvard's and UNC's programs under a microscope and finding them severely lacking. It is difficult to see how any such program that includes an overt consideration of an applicant's race can survive the type of extraordinarily skeptical review that the chief justice now demands.\n\nAnd yet, Roberts did not slam the door shut on all considerations of an applicant's race; his opinion provides two concessions. First, he exempted all military academies from his analysis \"in light of the potentially distinct interests\" that they \"may present.\" Roberts said that military academies are not \"party to these cases\" and that \"none of the courts below addressed the propriety of race-based admissions systems in that context,\" suggesting that it is a question for another day. (This caveat may have been a response to Sotomayor, who wrote an extensive reflection on how the decision could imperil national security, noting the military's belief that diversity \"is essential to achieving a mission-ready\" force.)\n\nSo West Point and the Virginia Military Institute can, for now, continue to apply the relaxed Grutter / Fisher standard that Roberts disavowed for civilian universities. Second, at the very end of his opinion, Roberts offered a potentially hard-to-parse compromise-apparently in response to Sotomayor and Jackson, who warned that his \"colorblind\" approach could have the real-world effect of discriminating against racial minorities by denying them an ability to express how \"race is a crucial component of their identity.\" They cited students of color who testified at trial that \"racial self-identification was an important component of their application because without it they would not be able to present a full version of themselves.\"\n\nRoberts tried, perhaps in vain, to assuage these concerns. He wrote that \"nothing in this opinion should be construed as prohibiting universities from considering an applicant's discussion of how race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration, or otherwise.\" A benefit \"to a student who overcame racial discrimination, for example, must be tied to that student's courage and determination. Or a benefit to a student whose heritage or culture motivated him or her to assume a leadership role or attain a particular goal must be tied to that student's unique ability to contribute to the university. In other words, the student must be treated based on his or her experiences as an individual-not on the basis of race.\"\n\nCourts are going to be parsing this oblique approval of some collateral racial considerations for years to come. But the dissenters believe that, even if universities adapt to it, they cannot possibly reach the same levels of diversity that they achieved through direct affirmative action. And that, Jackson wrote, \"is truly a tragedy for us all.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Supreme Court discovers that ending affirmative action is hard\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nNot that anything is likely to stop them from doing it anyway.\n\nby Ian Millhiser\n\nThe Supreme Court spent an inordinate amount of time on Monday hearing arguments in two cases about affirmative action in university admissions . Virtually nothing said in those arguments is likely to change the final outcome.\n\nThe six justices appointed by Republican presidents appeared determined from the beginning to implement the Republican Party's preferred approach to race and the Constitution, while the three justices appointed by Democrats appeared equally determined to adopt the Democratic Party's stance. That means that the Court is highly likely to implement the GOP's longtime position that affirmative action should be illegal.\n\nThat said, at least some of the Court's conservatives seemed bothered by several difficult questions that are likely to arise if they hand down a decision banning affirmative action.\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh, for example, asked several questions about whether outwardly \"race neutral\" programs - such as admitting the top graduates from every high school in a state, a program implemented by Texas Gov. George W. Bush in the 1990s - are permissible even if those programs are enacted for the purpose of fostering racial diversity. Chief Justice John Roberts suggested that maybe affirmative action should still be allowed at service academies like West Point or the Naval Academy, after Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued that the military's \"strength, cohesiveness, and military readiness\" will suffer without a diverse officer corps.\n\nOne of the biggest issues that plagued the justices is what to do about a university that decides to admit a student who writes a compelling essay focusing on their experience as a person of color. As Justice Amy Coney Barrett admitted at one point, it is \"slicing the salami very finely\" to say that a university cannot give a slight preference to a student who checks a box on their application identifying themselves as Latino, but that the university can give a preference to the same student if they write an essay expressing pride in their Mexican American culture.\n\nThe Court heard two cases over the course of its interminable arguments on Monday, Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina and Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard . Students for Fair Admissions is largely a front group for Ed Blum , a white activist who frequently advances lawsuits attacking programs such as affirmative action or the Voting Rights Act.\n\nBut the stakes in these cases go far beyond the UNC and Harvard admissions policies that Blum and his legal team targeted in his most recent trip to the Supreme Court. Even if one of the conservative justices who expressed some reservations today surprises us, that would still likely leave five votes teed up against affirmative action. The Court, then, could very well forbid all universities, except for maybe the service academies, from explicitly considering race when making admissions decisions.\n\nThe Supreme Court's previous affirmative action decisions are complicated and nuanced . Although the Constitution's 14th Amendment, which restricts race discrimination, was originally understood to permit government programs that seek to lift up a disadvantaged racial group , modern precedents acknowledge that the Constitution casts a very skeptical eye on government programs (including programs led by state schools) that draw distinctions on the basis of race. At the same time, the Court has acknowledged that society as a whole benefits from increased racial diversity, especially among its college-educated leaders.\n\n(Although Harvard is a private university, the Court's decision in 1978's Regents of the University of California v. Bakke held that private schools are subject to the same rules governing race that the Constitution imposes on their public counterparts.)\n\nAs the Court explained in Grutter v. Bollinger (2003), \"numerous studies show that student body diversity promotes learning outcomes, and 'better prepares students for an increasingly diverse workforce and society, and better prepares them as professionals.'\" Students who learn to interact with people of diverse backgrounds and experiences in college are more likely to succeed when they graduate into their chosen professions.\n\nIndeed, one perennial ritual that plays out every single time the Court hears a case about affirmative action in college admissions is that a raft of major employers file amicus briefs begging the Court not to overrule cases like Grutter .\n\nThis time around, dozens of major companies - ranging from Apple to Ikea to Starbucks - all joined a brief arguing that \"racial diversity improves decision-making by increasing creativity, communication, and accuracy within teams.\" A long list of the nation's largest law firms warned that \"the private bar and the legal profession\" must \"have a racially diverse pool of talent from which to recruit.\" A group of retired admirals and generals told the Court that \" diversity in the halls of academia directly affects performance in the theaters of war .\"\n\nThough the Court has historically paid some heed to these calls, it's also placed strict limits on just how much of a role race can play in university admissions. The Court's decisions forbid quota systems - a system where a certain number of seats are set aside for applicants from certain racial backgrounds. They also forbid \"points\" systems where applicants of a certain race are given a mathematically precise advantage over other applicants.\n\nInstead, race may only be considered as part of a \"holistic\" process that, in Grutter 's words, considers \" all pertinent elements of diversity ,\" and that will sometimes \"select nonminority applicants who have greater potential to enhance student body diversity over underrepresented minority applicants.\"\n\nIn the UNC case, for example, the university says that it considers \" more than forty criteria \" when determining which students to admit, ranging from academic record to \"athletic or artistic talents\" to the student's status as a veteran. A Black or Latino candidate might receive a slight bump if their racial background will add diversity to an incoming class, but the school also gives a bump to students from rural areas and students who served in the military.\n\nAs a practical matter, this complicated system means that race won't push a mediocre applicant into the pool of admitted students, but it may serve as a tiebreaker between multiple students with similar records - all of whom are likely to thrive at a particular university. A federal court found that \" race plays a role in a very small percentage of decisions \" at UNC, \"1.2% for in-state students and 5.1% for out-of-state students.\"\n\nThe conservative response to Grutter 's core argument - the argument that society's collective interest in having a leadership class that respects and draws from all parts of the nation justifies giving a slight advantage to individual college applicants from certain racial backgrounds - has historically been \"so what?\"\n\nAs Blum's legal team argued in their briefs, the United States must be \"colorblind.\" Under this approach, any system that takes explicit account of race is forbidden - regardless of whether it seeks to lift up historically marginalized groups or whether it benefits society as a whole.\n\nIt would be astonishing if the Court's Republican appointees do not all share this view. Although some of them asked questions about how a decision overruling Grutter would operate around the margins, all six of them seemed committed to the colorblind theory - some of them very stridently.\n\nWhen Seth Waxman, the lawyer defending the Harvard policy, compared Grutter 's diversity rationale to a university's decision to admit an oboe player because it needs one for its campus orchestra, Roberts quipped back that \"we did not fight a civil war over oboe players.\" The idea is that any form of race-conscious program is uniquely suspect because of America's dark history with race.\n\nThe prize for the cleverest argument for overruling Grutter goes to Justice Clarence Thomas, who pointed to the lower court's finding that race only plays a role in a tiny percentage of applicants in the UNC case. If race really is only a factor in 1.2 percent of cases, Thomas seemed to argue, does UNC's affirmative action program actually do enough to foster diversity in order to justify its existence?\n\nMultiple conservative justices, including Roberts, Kavanaugh, and Barrett, pointed to language in Grutter predicting that \"25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today,\" or to language in Grutter suggesting that affirmative action must eventually have an \"end point.\" The clear implication was that we have reached that end point - even though 25 years have not passed since Grutter was decided in 2003.\n\nIn any event, a party-line decision overruling Grutter should not surprise anyone. Although conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy surprised most Court observers when he voted twice during the Obama administration to weaken, but not forbid, affirmative action programs, every Republican appointed to the Supreme Court since Thomas's appointment in 1991 has consistently opposed affirmative action. Roberts, the least conservative member of the Court's GOP-appointed majority, is known for his famously simplistic approach to questions of race : \"The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\"\n\nAnd even if the Court follows Kennedy's path and imposes new restrictions on university admissions without outright prohibiting it, the Court has already imposed such severe restrictions on affirmative action programs that a more restrictive approach is likely to function much like an absolute ban.\n\nAt least some of the Court's Republican appointees appeared concerned that a too-aggressive opinion overruling Grutter could lead to undesirable outcomes. Roberts, for example, appeared open to the possibility that affirmative action could be permissible at the service academies - the Court has historically shown more deference to the military than to other institutions.\n\nKavanaugh, and, to a lesser extent, Roberts, also had several questions about what universities are still allowed to do if Grutter is overruled. What happens, for example, if Harvard replaces its race-conscious program with a new system that preferences traits - like a low-income upbringing or status as an immigrant - that correlate with race? Or what happens if Blum's legal team, fresh off their victory in Harvard and UNC, decide to celebrate by targeting former President Bush's signature Top Ten admissions policy in Texas?\n\nMuch of Team Blum's arguments in the Harvard case focused on statistical evidence that Asian applicants are particularly unlikely to be admitted. If Harvard abandons its explicitly race-conscious policies, but Asian applicants continue to be admitted at lower rates than they apply, does it risk being sued again? For that matter, does every single university where white or Asian applicants are statistically less likely to be admitted than Black or Latino applicants become the target of someone like Blum?\n\nAt one point, Justice Samuel Alito appeared to take the extraordinary position that universities cannot even gather information on the racial backgrounds of their applicants, such as by asking them to check a box indicating which racial group or groups they identify with. But even many of Alito's fellow Republican appointees - most notably Barrett - seemed to accept that admissions cannot be completely race-blind.\n\nAnd, notably, both of the lawyers arguing against affirmative action on Monday acknowledged that a university could decide to admit a student based on an admissions essay that discusses the student's racial background.\n\nI want to acknowledge that the questions raised by affirmative action policies are difficult. Just how much race consciousness should we tolerate in service of diversity? And exactly how racially diverse should campuses be to serve the interests of employers? How racially diverse does the military's officer corps need to be in order to inspire confidence in the men and women they lead? How does a court draw a line between admitting a student because they are Black and admitting them because they write eloquently about their experience as a Black person?\n\nThese questions are so difficult that, in the Bakke decision that first held that universities may take some limited account of race in admissions, Justice Lewis Powell called for a degree of deference to universities . \"It is the business of a university to provide that atmosphere which is most conducive to speculation, experiment and creation,\" Powell wrote in Bakke, while quoting from a 1957 opinion. And Powell acknowledges that universities \"must be accorded the right to select those students who will contribute the most to the 'robust exchange of ideas.'\"\n\nThis Court, by contrast, largely rejects judicial restraint as a virtue , and rarely sees the value in deferring to institutions with greater expertise than the justices themselves. That's a recipe for a bold decision that could overrule every one of the Court's university admissions decisions since Bakke .\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby Libby Nelson\n\nby Libby Nelson\n\nIn the US, young whites are far more likely to get a bachelor's degree than young blacks and Hispanics:\n\nAffirmative action refers to policies that give students from underrepresented minority groups a boost in the college or university admissions process. The term affirmative action can also refer to policies that boost minority prospects in employment or contracting, but this cardstack will focus on race-based affirmative action in US higher education.\n\nRationales : Supporters cite three main reasons affirmative action policies are helpful or necessary.\n\nHow it works : In the US, public colleges and universities -€\" and private colleges receiving federal funding, which is virtually all - have to be very careful about how they use race in their admissions processes. They are only allowed to consider race as one of many factors in weighing an application. They aren't allowed to create a racial quota (reserving, say, 10 percent of spots for a certain group) or to use a standardized racial bonus (giving 20 extra points to each minority applicant);€\" both of these approaches have been ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, in the Regents v. Bakke and Gratz v. Bollinger cases.\n\nStill, the overall effect is to admit more students from underrepresented minorities, even though many have lower test scores than other admitted applicants. Of course, that happens in other contexts, too: colleges often admit certain students despite lower-than-average test scores - say, athletes, or children of wealthy alumni.\n\nThe controversy : There are several common criticisms of the use of affirmative action in university admissions. Most prominently, o pponents argue that the programs themselves are racially discriminatory, since they favor certain racial groups and not others. Several white students have sued universities, arguing that their scores would have qualified them for admission if not for affirmative action programs. And some argue that the programs can hurt Asian-Americans, restricting their admissions opportunities in elite schools despite high test scores.\n\nOthers argue that affirmative action programs currently help many members of minority groups who are already wealthy or well-connected, and don't need a boost, and that the programs should help disadvantaged people of all races instead. Finally, some critics maintain that these programs may have unintended consequences, and hurt the people they're intended to help, by dropping them into academic situations they're not prepared for.\n\nCard written by Andrew Prokop\n\nIt depends on how you word the question. Generally, Americans don't seem to mind the idea of giving racial minorities a leg up, but their opinion changes if they're told those students aren't as academically qualified.\n\nGallup asked in 2013 whether \"students should be admitted solely on the basis of merit, even if that results in few minority students being admitted\" or \"an applicant's background should be considered to help promote diversity on college campuses, even if that means admitting some minority students who would not otherwise be admitted.\"\n\nA strong majority - 67 percent - opposed the consideration of race in college admissions when the question was phrased that way. Whites were the least likely to favor it, but a majority of Hispanics also said students should be admitted based solely on merit. Although a higher proportion of Democrats favored affirmative action than Republicans or Independents, a majority of respondents from all parties opposed it, Gallup found.\n\nBut the same Gallup poll found that Americans don't necessarily the concept of affirmative action; 58 percent said they generally favor \"affirmative action programs for racial minorities,\" including a slim majority (51 percent) of whites.\n\nThe Pew Research Center asked the college admissions question in a different way in 2014: \"In general, do you think affirmative action programs designed to increase the number of black and minority students on college campuses are a good thing or a bad thing?\"\n\nNearly two-thirds of respondents - 63 percent - said they thought affirmative action described that way was a good thing, including 55 percent of whites, 80 percent of Hispanics and 84 percent of black respondents.\n\nOne sociologist has found that the definition of merit in college admissions could be changing for white people feeling threatened by Asian-American students' success. White Americans are more likely to support taking intangible quantities like leadership into account, rather than just grades and test scores, given a prompt that notes the high proportion of students of Asian descent at the University of California at Berkeley.\n\nAffirmative action based on economic circumstances - giving poor students a boost, regardless of their skin color - is often suggested as a replacement for race-based affirmative action in college admissions.\n\nClass-based affirmative action is sometimes seen as simply an end run around bans on racial preferences. In states that bar race-based affirmative action, colleges can turn to class as an alternative. Since black and Latino families are more likely to be poor than white families are, class can serve as a proxy for race, a way to make sure that colleges have racial diversity even if they can't take race into consideration outright. (The two aren't mutually exclusive; colleges can give preferences to students based both on race and family income.)\n\nBut others see it as a superior system , not an inferior proxy. One argument for class-based affirmative action could be termed the Malia Obama argument. If colleges think about diversity solely in terms of race, President Obama's daughters will get an edge in college admissions that white children who grew up in poverty will not. (Obama has said he doesn't think that would be fair.) Wealthy students are already vastly overrepresented at colleges, particularly selective colleges. In 2006, just 5 percent of students at selective colleges came from the bottom income quartile, says Anthony Carnavale, director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce.\n\nThere are a few critiques of class-based affirmative action, particularly if it's used as the only form of affirmative action.\n\nFirst, some argue that it isn't as effective at creating racial diversity as race-based affirmative action is. Others argue that the legacy of racial discrimination is weightier than the challenges low-income students have accessing higher education. Black students were systematically shut out of higher education; poor students were not. There is also still a pervasive wealth gap between black and Latino families and white ones, even at high incomes. Class-based affirmative action can encourage stereotyping, critics argue , if the only students of color on campus are poor.\n\nThe best comparison of the effects of considering class versus race so far was at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Colorado came close to banning affirmative action in 2008, although the initiative ultimately failed; before the vote, though, the university had already developed a race-neutral plan to take students' incomes into account. Researchers found that underrepresented minority students were more likely to be admitted under class-based affirmative action than they were under race-based policies: admission rates were 9 percentage points higher for underrepresented minorities. For students from disadvantaged backgrounds of all races, admission rates were 20 percentage points higher under class-based affirmative action.\n\nMany high-achieving students from Asian backgrounds believe that they're discriminated against in college admissions and that colleges often set de facto quotas for Asian students when they take race into account in admissions.\n\nThere is some evidence that Asian-American students' chances for admission are harmed by affirmative action programs. In 2005, a study from two Princeton University researchers found that without affirmative action, the admission rate for black and Latino college applicants would fall sharply. But white students would be largely unaffected - students of Asian descent would be the beneficiaries, getting about 80 percent of the slots no longer filled by other students of color.\n\nAt colleges where affirmative action is banned or race is not taken into account, there is a much higher proportion of Asian-American students within the student body; at the University of California at Berkeley, for example, Asian-American students make up 39 percent of the student body - more than double their share of the state population.\n\nOn the other hand, even as the share of college-aged Americans who are Asian has grown nationally, the proportion of Asian students at Ivy League colleges has remained flat, The American Conservative found in a review of demographic data. Ivy League colleges practice affirmative action; the California Institute of Technology, also a private college, focuses almost solely on academic achievement among applicants, and its Asian enrollment more closely tracks national population trends (while black and Hispanic students are underrepresented ).\n\nSource: The American Conservative\n\nBecause of this, some Asian-American groups oppose affirmative action. Organized Asian-American opposition was key to defeating an attempt to reinstate affirmative action in California in 2014.\n\nBut opinion is not monolithic among Asian-Americans, nor are all Asian-American students academic achievers from professional backgrounds. Some Asian-American subgroups have higher poverty rates than Americans as a whole and Cambodian, Laotian and Hmong-Americans have among the lowest college attendance rates in the country.\n\nThe first Supreme Court decision on affirmative action, Regents of the University of California v. Bakke , was decided in 1978. It held that strict racial quotas should not be used in college and university admissions, but that affirmative action could be constitutional in some circumstances if race was considered as just one of many factors. In the 35 years since Bakke, this has remained the court's basic approach to affirmative action.\n\nThe court reopened the issue 25 years after Bakke , in G rutter v. Bollinger . In that 5-4 decision, the court ruled that colleges could take race into account as one factor in a holistic review when admitting applicants. The court found that the educational benefits of diversity were a compelling reason to create a diverse student body, but that affirmative action programs would need to be \"narrowly tailored\" - essentially decided on a student-by-student basis. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the majority, said she expected the Grutter decision to stand for 25 years.\n\nIt's important to note that neither case was a complete victory for the university involved, and both upheld the principle of affirmative action in theory while rolling it back in practice. In Bakke , the University of California's quota system was thrown out; in Gratz v. Bollinger , a case rolled into the Grutter decision, the University of Michigan law school was forbidden to use a point system that awarded additional points to applicants if they were from underrepresented minorities. In the 25 years between the two landmark cases, t he court's rationale for allowing affirmative action shifted, from remedying past racial discrimination in Bakke to benefiting the entire student body in Grutter .\n\nTwo more recent cases have also weighed in on affirmative action. Schuette v. BAMN , decided in April 2014, sprung from the Grutter case; Michigan voters banned affirmative action by ballot initiative with a 58 percent majority not long after the Supreme Court decision . The court found those bans are constitutional, which could spur similar efforts in other states and left state bans elsewhere in place.\n\nThe most direct challenge to the precedents set in Bakke and Grutter, though , was Fisher v. Texas , a lawsuit over the University of Texas's consideration of race in admissions. The University of Texas at Austin admits most of its students by letting in students from the top 10 percent of every high school class. For other slots in the freshman class, it considers a range of factors - including race. Abigail Fisher, a Texas resident who didn't make the 10 percent cutoff and wasn't admitted using other criteria, sued, arguing her rights were violated.\n\nIn a 7-1 decision in 2013, the Supreme Court sent the Fisher case back to a court of appeals for further review. The lower court hadn't used a strict enough standard when evaluating Texas' affirmative action plan, the justices argued. The case returned to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals , where it was reargued in November 2013. In July 2014, a panel of three justices again upheld Texas's affirmative action policy.\n\nThe majority of colleges and universities in the US take everyone, or nearly everyone, who applies. So the debate about affirmative action is usually confined to a smaller universe of prestigious colleges and law schools. It is especially contentious because research has found that attending a highly selective college is more likely to affect lifetime earnings for students from low-income or minority backgrounds than for white, upper middle class students. So the stakes are high.\n\nIn a 1998 book on affirmative action, The Shape of the River , two former Ivy League university presidents - Derek Bok, the former president of Harvard, and William Bowen, the former president of Princeton - argued that affirmative action benefits both the individual students admitted under the policies and the campus as a whole. They compared white and black students who graduated in 1976 and 1989 from 28 prestigious public and private colleges. They found that black students who benefited from affirmative action generally succeeded despite their lower test scores; they graduated and went on to have successful lives, earning an average of $71,000 by their mid-30s and demonstrating high levels of civic participation.\n\nHowever, some researchers continue to argue that, particularly in law school, affirmative action is harmful to students' later careers. This is an idea that researchers describe as \"mismatch\": graduates helped by affirmative action might struggle at schools or jobs that are too tough for them. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas is an adherent of mismatch theory and uses it to argue that affirmative action actually harms minority students.\n\nOne of the more prominent debates in this area surrounded a 2004 Stanford Law Review article by UCLA law professor Richard Sander, about the effects of affirmative action on law students' post-graduation prospects.\n\nFocusing solely on black and white law school students from 1994-96, he found that 88 percent of accredited law school grads passed the bar on the first try, and that 95 percent passed eventually. However, the pass rates for blacks were substantially lower: 61.4 for first-timers and 77.6 percent after five tries. Because affirmative action hurts black students by putting some in schools where they won't perform as well, Sander argued, it lowers the number of them that pass the bar. Eliminating race-based preferences, he calculated, would have boosted the number of black students who passed the bar among 2001 matriculants by 7.9 percent.\n\nHowever, there are plenty of detractors to Sander's arguments. One Yale law student , Daniel Ho, wrote in response that Sander performed his analysis incorrectly and failed to prove that affirmative action at law schools causes lower bar-passage rates. Another pair of law school professors found that getting rid of affirmative action would decrease the number of black lawyers by 12.7 percent.\n\nOther research has cast doubt on the mismatch theory, at least as it applies to undergraduate students. A study at the University of California found that students who had just made the admissions cutoff - those most likely to be mismatched - earned slightly lower grades than other students, but the difference disappeared when they were compared only to students with a similar educational background. While California doesn't have affirmative action, the study suggests that students with lower grades and test scores still benefit from attending a selective college.\n\nBesides Michigan, seven states currently ban affirmative action in public college admissions.\n\nMost of these bans were passed directly by the voters and not by the state legislature.\n\nA study in 2013 from the American Educational Research Association found that the bans work as intended: they eliminate the edge that underrepresented minorities have in college admissions, and the effect even spreads to neighboring states.\n\nIn some states with bans, the proportion of black and Hispanic freshmen at state flagship colleges and universities declined . Before California banned affirmative action in 1998, the proportion of black college freshmen at the University of California-Berkeley and the University of California-Los Angeles was about the same as the proportion of black college-aged students in the state.\n\nAfter the affirmative action ban was passed, though, the proportion of black students on campus declined, the New York Times found in an examination of the data . Black students are 9 percent of the state's college-aged population, but only 2 percent of the student body at Berkeley.\n\nOther states have seen different effects. In Florida, black students are underrepresented at state colleges and universities; while Hispanic students are still underrepresented, too, they haven't lost any ground since affirmative action was banned.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nGiven the Court's Republican supermajority, this case is unlikely to end well for trans people.\n\nLearn about saving, spending, investing, and more in a monthly personal finance advice column written by Nicole Dieker.\n\nThe latest news, analysis, and explainers coming out of the GOP Iowa caucuses.\n\nThe economy's stacked against us.\n\nA Texas judge issued a national ruling against medication abortion.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby Libby Nelson\n\nby Libby Nelson\n\nIn the US, young whites are far more likely to get a bachelor's degree than young blacks and Hispanics:\n\nAffirmative action refers to policies that give students from underrepresented minority groups a boost in the college or university admissions process. The term affirmative action can also refer to policies that boost minority prospects in employment or contracting, but this cardstack will focus on race-based affirmative action in US higher education.\n\nRationales : Supporters cite three main reasons affirmative action policies are helpful or necessary.\n\nHow it works : In the US, public colleges and universities -€\" and private colleges receiving federal funding, which is virtually all - have to be very careful about how they use race in their admissions processes. They are only allowed to consider race as one of many factors in weighing an application. They aren't allowed to create a racial quota (reserving, say, 10 percent of spots for a certain group) or to use a standardized racial bonus (giving 20 extra points to each minority applicant);€\" both of these approaches have been ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, in the Regents v. Bakke and Gratz v. Bollinger cases.\n\nStill, the overall effect is to admit more students from underrepresented minorities, even though many have lower test scores than other admitted applicants. Of course, that happens in other contexts, too: colleges often admit certain students despite lower-than-average test scores - say, athletes, or children of wealthy alumni.\n\nThe controversy : There are several common criticisms of the use of affirmative action in university admissions. Most prominently, o pponents argue that the programs themselves are racially discriminatory, since they favor certain racial groups and not others. Several white students have sued universities, arguing that their scores would have qualified them for admission if not for affirmative action programs. And some argue that the programs can hurt Asian-Americans, restricting their admissions opportunities in elite schools despite high test scores.\n\nOthers argue that affirmative action programs currently help many members of minority groups who are already wealthy or well-connected, and don't need a boost, and that the programs should help disadvantaged people of all races instead. Finally, some critics maintain that these programs may have unintended consequences, and hurt the people they're intended to help, by dropping them into academic situations they're not prepared for.\n\nCard written by Andrew Prokop\n\nIt depends on how you word the question. Generally, Americans don't seem to mind the idea of giving racial minorities a leg up, but their opinion changes if they're told those students aren't as academically qualified.\n\nGallup asked in 2013 whether \"students should be admitted solely on the basis of merit, even if that results in few minority students being admitted\" or \"an applicant's background should be considered to help promote diversity on college campuses, even if that means admitting some minority students who would not otherwise be admitted.\"\n\nA strong majority - 67 percent - opposed the consideration of race in college admissions when the question was phrased that way. Whites were the least likely to favor it, but a majority of Hispanics also said students should be admitted based solely on merit. Although a higher proportion of Democrats favored affirmative action than Republicans or Independents, a majority of respondents from all parties opposed it, Gallup found.\n\nBut the same Gallup poll found that Americans don't necessarily the concept of affirmative action; 58 percent said they generally favor \"affirmative action programs for racial minorities,\" including a slim majority (51 percent) of whites.\n\nThe Pew Research Center asked the college admissions question in a different way in 2014: \"In general, do you think affirmative action programs designed to increase the number of black and minority students on college campuses are a good thing or a bad thing?\"\n\nNearly two-thirds of respondents - 63 percent - said they thought affirmative action described that way was a good thing, including 55 percent of whites, 80 percent of Hispanics and 84 percent of black respondents.\n\nOne sociologist has found that the definition of merit in college admissions could be changing for white people feeling threatened by Asian-American students' success. White Americans are more likely to support taking intangible quantities like leadership into account, rather than just grades and test scores, given a prompt that notes the high proportion of students of Asian descent at the University of California at Berkeley.\n\nAffirmative action based on economic circumstances - giving poor students a boost, regardless of their skin color - is often suggested as a replacement for race-based affirmative action in college admissions.\n\nClass-based affirmative action is sometimes seen as simply an end run around bans on racial preferences. In states that bar race-based affirmative action, colleges can turn to class as an alternative. Since black and Latino families are more likely to be poor than white families are, class can serve as a proxy for race, a way to make sure that colleges have racial diversity even if they can't take race into consideration outright. (The two aren't mutually exclusive; colleges can give preferences to students based both on race and family income.)\n\nBut others see it as a superior system , not an inferior proxy. One argument for class-based affirmative action could be termed the Malia Obama argument. If colleges think about diversity solely in terms of race, President Obama's daughters will get an edge in college admissions that white children who grew up in poverty will not. (Obama has said he doesn't think that would be fair.) Wealthy students are already vastly overrepresented at colleges, particularly selective colleges. In 2006, just 5 percent of students at selective colleges came from the bottom income quartile, says Anthony Carnavale, director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce.\n\nThere are a few critiques of class-based affirmative action, particularly if it's used as the only form of affirmative action.\n\nFirst, some argue that it isn't as effective at creating racial diversity as race-based affirmative action is. Others argue that the legacy of racial discrimination is weightier than the challenges low-income students have accessing higher education. Black students were systematically shut out of higher education; poor students were not. There is also still a pervasive wealth gap between black and Latino families and white ones, even at high incomes. Class-based affirmative action can encourage stereotyping, critics argue , if the only students of color on campus are poor.\n\nThe best comparison of the effects of considering class versus race so far was at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Colorado came close to banning affirmative action in 2008, although the initiative ultimately failed; before the vote, though, the university had already developed a race-neutral plan to take students' incomes into account. Researchers found that underrepresented minority students were more likely to be admitted under class-based affirmative action than they were under race-based policies: admission rates were 9 percentage points higher for underrepresented minorities. For students from disadvantaged backgrounds of all races, admission rates were 20 percentage points higher under class-based affirmative action.\n\nMany high-achieving students from Asian backgrounds believe that they're discriminated against in college admissions and that colleges often set de facto quotas for Asian students when they take race into account in admissions.\n\nThere is some evidence that Asian-American students' chances for admission are harmed by affirmative action programs. In 2005, a study from two Princeton University researchers found that without affirmative action, the admission rate for black and Latino college applicants would fall sharply. But white students would be largely unaffected - students of Asian descent would be the beneficiaries, getting about 80 percent of the slots no longer filled by other students of color.\n\nAt colleges where affirmative action is banned or race is not taken into account, there is a much higher proportion of Asian-American students within the student body; at the University of California at Berkeley, for example, Asian-American students make up 39 percent of the student body - more than double their share of the state population.\n\nOn the other hand, even as the share of college-aged Americans who are Asian has grown nationally, the proportion of Asian students at Ivy League colleges has remained flat, The American Conservative found in a review of demographic data. Ivy League colleges practice affirmative action; the California Institute of Technology, also a private college, focuses almost solely on academic achievement among applicants, and its Asian enrollment more closely tracks national population trends (while black and Hispanic students are underrepresented ).\n\nSource: The American Conservative\n\nBecause of this, some Asian-American groups oppose affirmative action. Organized Asian-American opposition was key to defeating an attempt to reinstate affirmative action in California in 2014.\n\nBut opinion is not monolithic among Asian-Americans, nor are all Asian-American students academic achievers from professional backgrounds. Some Asian-American subgroups have higher poverty rates than Americans as a whole and Cambodian, Laotian and Hmong-Americans have among the lowest college attendance rates in the country.\n\nThe first Supreme Court decision on affirmative action, Regents of the University of California v. Bakke , was decided in 1978. It held that strict racial quotas should not be used in college and university admissions, but that affirmative action could be constitutional in some circumstances if race was considered as just one of many factors. In the 35 years since Bakke, this has remained the court's basic approach to affirmative action.\n\nThe court reopened the issue 25 years after Bakke , in G rutter v. Bollinger . In that 5-4 decision, the court ruled that colleges could take race into account as one factor in a holistic review when admitting applicants. The court found that the educational benefits of diversity were a compelling reason to create a diverse student body, but that affirmative action programs would need to be \"narrowly tailored\" - essentially decided on a student-by-student basis. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the majority, said she expected the Grutter decision to stand for 25 years.\n\nIt's important to note that neither case was a complete victory for the university involved, and both upheld the principle of affirmative action in theory while rolling it back in practice. In Bakke , the University of California's quota system was thrown out; in Gratz v. Bollinger , a case rolled into the Grutter decision, the University of Michigan law school was forbidden to use a point system that awarded additional points to applicants if they were from underrepresented minorities. In the 25 years between the two landmark cases, t he court's rationale for allowing affirmative action shifted, from remedying past racial discrimination in Bakke to benefiting the entire student body in Grutter .\n\nTwo more recent cases have also weighed in on affirmative action.

In the 25 years between the two landmark cases, t he court's rationale for allowing affirmative action shifted, from remedying past racial discrimination in Bakke to benefiting the entire student body in Grutter .\n\nTwo more recent cases have also weighed in on affirmative action. Schuette v. BAMN , decided in April 2014, sprung from the Grutter case; Michigan voters banned affirmative action by ballot initiative with a 58 percent majority not long after the Supreme Court decision . The court found those bans are constitutional, which could spur similar efforts in other states and left state bans elsewhere in place.\n\nThe most direct challenge to the precedents set in Bakke and Grutter, though , was Fisher v. Texas , a lawsuit over the University of Texas's consideration of race in admissions. The University of Texas at Austin admits most of its students by letting in students from the top 10 percent of every high school class. For other slots in the freshman class, it considers a range of factors - including race. Abigail Fisher, a Texas resident who didn't make the 10 percent cutoff and wasn't admitted using other criteria, sued, arguing her rights were violated.\n\nIn a 7-1 decision in 2013, the Supreme Court sent the Fisher case back to a court of appeals for further review. The lower court hadn't used a strict enough standard when evaluating Texas' affirmative action plan, the justices argued. The case returned to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals , where it was reargued in November 2013. In July 2014, a panel of three justices again upheld Texas's affirmative action policy.\n\nThe majority of colleges and universities in the US take everyone, or nearly everyone, who applies. So the debate about affirmative action is usually confined to a smaller universe of prestigious colleges and law schools. It is especially contentious because research has found that attending a highly selective college is more likely to affect lifetime earnings for students from low-income or minority backgrounds than for white, upper middle class students. So the stakes are high.\n\nIn a 1998 book on affirmative action, The Shape of the River , two former Ivy League university presidents - Derek Bok, the former president of Harvard, and William Bowen, the former president of Princeton - argued that affirmative action benefits both the individual students admitted under the policies and the campus as a whole. They compared white and black students who graduated in 1976 and 1989 from 28 prestigious public and private colleges. They found that black students who benefited from affirmative action generally succeeded despite their lower test scores; they graduated and went on to have successful lives, earning an average of $71,000 by their mid-30s and demonstrating high levels of civic participation.\n\nHowever, some researchers continue to argue that, particularly in law school, affirmative action is harmful to students' later careers. This is an idea that researchers describe as \"mismatch\": graduates helped by affirmative action might struggle at schools or jobs that are too tough for them. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas is an adherent of mismatch theory and uses it to argue that affirmative action actually harms minority students.\n\nOne of the more prominent debates in this area surrounded a 2004 Stanford Law Review article by UCLA law professor Richard Sander, about the effects of affirmative action on law students' post-graduation prospects.\n\nFocusing solely on black and white law school students from 1994-96, he found that 88 percent of accredited law school grads passed the bar on the first try, and that 95 percent passed eventually. However, the pass rates for blacks were substantially lower: 61.4 for first-timers and 77.6 percent after five tries. Because affirmative action hurts black students by putting some in schools where they won't perform as well, Sander argued, it lowers the number of them that pass the bar. Eliminating race-based preferences, he calculated, would have boosted the number of black students who passed the bar among 2001 matriculants by 7.9 percent.\n\nHowever, there are plenty of detractors to Sander's arguments. One Yale law student , Daniel Ho, wrote in response that Sander performed his analysis incorrectly and failed to prove that affirmative action at law schools causes lower bar-passage rates. Another pair of law school professors found that getting rid of affirmative action would decrease the number of black lawyers by 12.7 percent.\n\nOther research has cast doubt on the mismatch theory, at least as it applies to undergraduate students. A study at the University of California found that students who had just made the admissions cutoff - those most likely to be mismatched - earned slightly lower grades than other students, but the difference disappeared when they were compared only to students with a similar educational background. While California doesn't have affirmative action, the study suggests that students with lower grades and test scores still benefit from attending a selective college.\n\nBesides Michigan, seven states currently ban affirmative action in public college admissions.\n\nMost of these bans were passed directly by the voters and not by the state legislature.\n\nA study in 2013 from the American Educational Research Association found that the bans work as intended: they eliminate the edge that underrepresented minorities have in college admissions, and the effect even spreads to neighboring states.\n\nIn some states with bans, the proportion of black and Hispanic freshmen at state flagship colleges and universities declined . Before California banned affirmative action in 1998, the proportion of black college freshmen at the University of California-Berkeley and the University of California-Los Angeles was about the same as the proportion of black college-aged students in the state.\n\nAfter the affirmative action ban was passed, though, the proportion of black students on campus declined, the New York Times found in an examination of the data . Black students are 9 percent of the state's college-aged population, but only 2 percent of the student body at Berkeley.\n\nOther states have seen different effects. In Florida, black students are underrepresented at state colleges and universities; while Hispanic students are still underrepresented, too, they haven't lost any ground since affirmative action was banned.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nGiven the Court's Republican supermajority, this case is unlikely to end well for trans people.\n\nLearn about saving, spending, investing, and more in a monthly personal finance advice column written by Nicole Dieker.\n\nThe latest news, analysis, and explainers coming out of the GOP Iowa caucuses.\n\nThe economy's stacked against us.\n\nA Texas judge issued a national ruling against medication abortion.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nWe are cast as victims in a pernicious story about race.\n\nby Alvin Chang\n\nI first heard about the \"penalty\" my junior year of high school. I was sitting in an SAT prep class because I had barely broken 1000 on my first practice SAT. During a snack break, another Asian kid in the class said to me, \"You know we have to do better than even the white kids, right?\"\n\nI had never heard affirmative action framed that way - as a \"bonus\" for black and brown people and a \"penalty\" for white and especially Asian people.\n\nAt the time, I didn't understand just how pernicious it was to think about affirmative action in those terms. Not only does that frame gloss over the reasons why race-conscious policies are necessary; it's also the first step toward arguing that all race-conscious policies are unfair.\n\nBut I was fed a certain story about affirmative action, so when I saw this data a few years later, it only solidified this mental model:\n\nThe data is from an influential 2009 book in which two Princeton sociologists, Thomas Espenshade and Alexandra Radford, quantified how well you needed to score on your SATs to have an equal chance of admission as someone of another race. It implies that a black student who scores 1000 on her SATs would have an equal chance of admission as a white student who scores 1310 or an Asian-American student who scores 1450.\n\nThis study gave legs to a longstanding conservative argument that affirmative action is a misguided progressive policy to help black and Hispanic people while unfairly penalizing Asian and white people.\n\nAnd the argument is resurfacing again.\n\nWhen Trump first took office, the Justice Department dug up a two-year-old complaint against Harvard that alleges the school has quotas on how many Asian Americans it accepts. It opened an investigation into Harvard's admissions practices, which many feared would create a chilling effect on other schools with affirmative action programs.\n\nThen in October, a federal court heard arguments on a lawsuit that alleges the same thing. And in the lead-up to thetrial, the Trump administration wrote a statement of support for the plaintiffs, who echoed the exact argument conservatives have been making for decades:\n\n...the record evidence demonstrates that Harvard's race-based admissions process significantly disadvantages Asian-American applicants compared to applicants of other racial groups - including both white applicants and applicants from other racial minority groups.\n\nIn short, conservatives are taking another swing at dismantling affirmative action - hoping the case makes it to the Supreme Court, where a new conservative majority could rule broadly and outlaw affirmative action. And, yet again, they are centering the debate around Asian Americans.\n\nThis story, of racial bonuses and penalties due to affirmative action, has created an internal tension for Asian Americans: Many of us know race-conscious policies are necessary to remedy systemic racism. But we are also told that Asian Americans are penalized for those same policies.\n\nIt's a tension white affirmative action opponents have exploited, time and again, to make their argument against race-conscious policies and to seek a broader coalition for their movement.\n\nBut if Asian Americans have long resisted being recruited to their cause, this latest campaign has a new wrinkle. \"This time around, there is a wealthier, very small, and extremely vocal group of Asians who are on board - and very willing to play the part,\" said Colorado State University education professor OiYan Poon, who has been studying this group.\n\nThe story on which this movement is built contains some fundamental misunderstandings. The idea that affirmative action doles out bonuses and penalties obscures the far more complicated reality of how the policy actually works. But of greater concern is that this story - of merit artificially tweaked to engineer a certain racial demographic - implies that there is an objective way to measure who is deserving and who isn't. And it suggests that if we went purely by this idea of merit, it is white and Asian people who would be on top, and that that is the natural state of the world.\n\nThe use of Asian Americans as a political prop isn't new.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Asian-American groups started to uncover admissions practices that hurt Asian applicants. Eventually, top schools like Stanford and Brown conceded there was real bias against Asians in their admissions policies.\n\nThe Reagan administration saw an opportunity in these controversies.\n\nWilliam Bradford Reynolds, then the head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and a longtime opponent of affirmative action, said in a 1988 speech that Asian Americans faced discrimination because of efforts to help other minority groups:\n\nWhile university officials are understandably loath to admit that they are discriminating against qualified Asian-Americans, rejection of such applicants ironically appears to be driven by the universities' \"affirmative action\" policies aimed at favoring other, preferred racial minorities.\n\nBut Asian-American leaders were horrified that their cause was being co-opted by conservatives to dismantle policies that helped other racial minorities - and they refused to play the part.\n\nUC Berkeley professor L. Ling-Chi Wang wrote to Reynolds , \"At no time has anyone in the Asian American community linked these concerns to the legitimate affirmative action program for the historically discriminated, underrepresented minorities.\"\n\nLaw professor and activist Mari Matsuda argued Asians shouldn't be used to \"deny educational opportunities to the disadvantaged and to preserve success only for the privileged.\"\n\nDePaul professor Sumi Cho coined a term for this conservative tactic: \" racial mascotting .\"\n\nThis fight over admissions at highly selective private schools might seem inconsequential for most people. But as Harvard education professor Natasha Warikoo wrote in her recent book, The Diversity Bargain :\n\nI see these elite universities as sites for symbolic meaning-making around merit and race. The universities hold symbolic value not only for their students, but also in the wider society. They are especially important for our understanding of meritocracy, because many see admissions to those universities as the ultimate demonstration of merit.\n\nIn short, these fights shape the ways we talk about who is worthy, who is not - and why.\n\nAnd 30 years later, we're back here again, having the same debate with affirmative action opponents, who are again using Asian Americans as mascots. And again, there's a large group of Asian-American leaders rejecting this role in the debate.\n\nBut now another group of Asian Americans is making this debate more confusing.\n\nThe latest challenge to affirmative action began with a lawsuit filed by Edward Blum , who also launched the previous attack on affirmative action. In that case, Blum recruited Abigail Fisher, a white student who claimed she was rejected by the University of Texas Austin because of her race. That case went to the Supreme Court , and many believed it would finally strike down affirmative action - but it didn't.\n\nFor his next act, Blum took another swing at affirmative action - this time, using Asian Americans as the victims in a lawsuit against Harvard.\n\nBut shortly after Blum filed his lawsuit, something interesting happened: A coalition of more than 60 Asian-American groups filed a Justice Department complaint largely mimicking Blum's lawsuit.\n\nLeading that charge was a Chinese-American man named Yukong Zhao, a Florida businessman in his 50s.\n\nZhao is the president of the Asian American Coalition for Education, the collection of groups that filed the DOJ complaint. And he and his followers are ideal allies for white, anti-affirmative action conservatives. They not only claim that race-conscious policies are unfair but argue convincingly that they are victims.\n\nWhat's unique about Zhao is his large audience; he's a star on the Chinese social media platform WeChat, which has turned into a kind of \" virtual Chinatown ,\" as activist Steven Chen puts it. It's an isolated place populated by mostly first-generation immigrants from mainland China, with high barriers to entry for everyone else. And it has become an echo chamber for stories of anti-Asian discrimination.\n\nZhao has been one of the loudest voices on this front. \"In the future,\" he told me, \"our dream, just like Martin Luther King, is we want every child to be judged on their talent and content of their character, not by their skin color.\"\n\nThis group can feel large in numbers and has earned a lot of media attention . They can be especially intimidating in the WeChat world.\n\nBut Poon, the education researcher, found that they're actually much smaller and more homogenous than the coalition's profile suggests.\n\nShe interviewed 36 Asian Americans last year who have advocated for or against affirmative action. And she found that those who have advocated against affirmative action are almost entirely recent immigrants from mainland China - the same group that spends time on WeChat. They tend to be affluent and educated, but also racially isolated. They work in places that are predominantly white, and occupy social spaces that are predominantly Chinese.\n\nPoon also said most of them had stories about experiencing racial discrimination. If you combine that with Zhao's rhetoric that affirmative action penalizes them in favor of black and Hispanic applicants, you can see how they might believe the US is anti-Asian:\n\nZhao says the way to address racial discrimination is to remove all race-based policies, echoing other affirmative action opponents. Otherwise, he says, Asian Americans become victims - perhaps like his son, who he says experienced racial discrimination from at least two Ivy League schools who rejected him, despite an application that was more than deserving.\n\n\"We're hardworking, we never ask for any government favors,\" he told me. \"But you blame us as overrepresented. We contribute to society. ... Why are Asian Americans being punished?\"\n\nThen Zhao dials down the rhetoric and presents data that Asians are being hurt by affirmative action: the Espenshade data, which seems to prove affirmative action penalizes Asians while helping black and Hispanic people.\n\nOnce evidence of a \"penalty\" for Asian Americans is introduced in the conversation, it can be difficult to rebut.\n\nThe myth of a racial bonus/penalty persists, especially in more isolated Asian-American communities, where anecdotes about anti-Asian discrimination inform a certain worldview.\n\nAnd sometimes, those anecdotes prove true, like when a federal investigation unveiled documents that showed admissions officers at Princeton wrote disparagingly of Asian-American applicants, stereotyping them with labels like \"standard premeds.\" (They also wrote disparagingly of black and Hispanic applicants.)\n\nBut this simplistic framework doesn't reflect the long, winding journey affirmative action has taken - and just how much it's been stripped down along the way.\n\nWhen the Supreme Court first ruled on affirmative action in 1978, it ruled that affirmative action could not specifically help black and Hispanic students at the expense of other students.\n\nHowever, schools could consider race if the practice was \"narrowly tailored\" to serve a \"compelling\" interest. The Court ruled that the goal of remedying structural racism wasn't narrow enough. So that left only a single path for affirmative action to walk: Race could only be considered to create diversity on campuses.\n\nFrom there, affirmation action was further limited with each successive ruling.\n\nIn the 2003 decision Grutter v. Bollinger , Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote in the majority opinion that race should be considered alongside \"all factors that may contribute to student body diversity.\"\n\nThis meant schools could only consider a student's race as one factor among many others in a \"holistic\" review of an application. It essentially turned race into a peripheral characteristic, alongside things like whether you played sports.\n\nThen in 2013 , the Court laid out strict rules for when race can be used in a holistic review, further limiting affirmative action:\n\nMost recently, in a 2016 decision , the Court further constrained the consideration of race.\n\nJustice Anthony Kennedy wrote it can only be a \"factor of a factor of a factor.\"\n\nLet's say a school is looking for strong leadership qualities, and an applicant lists leadership experience that is grounded in their racial identity. Only then can a school consider their race.\n\nUltimately, this means that schools are severely limited in how they can think about race in admissions.\n\nIf we look more closely at the Espenshade data within this context, we begin to see why the chart of racial bonuses and penalties paints a misleading picture of affirmative action. For one, Espenshade and Radford used data from just a handful of schools in 1997, and it was data from before major court rulings changed how schools can consider race.\n\nBut more importantly, the Espenshade analysis paints a picture of an alternate reality in which we went down a caricatured version of the other path. It portrays a world where racial bonuses are awarded to disadvantaged groups and racial penalties are levied against Asian and white students.\n\nThat's just not the reality of affirmative action. As even Espenshade has reiterated time and again , his study doesn't prove discrimination against Asian Americans.\n\nThat hasn't stopped affirmative action opponents from using Espenshade - and from reaching for other arguments to make their case.\n\nIn 2012, Ron Unz, a former publisher of the American Conservative, argued that Ivy League schools have an Asian quota . His main piece of evidence was the lack of growth in the Asian-American population at Ivy League schools, despite the growing percentage of college-age Asians nationwide. As a counterexample, he compared Asian enrollment at these schools to Caltech, where they don't have affirmative action:\n\nThere are several flaws with this analysis. It assumes the quality of the Asian applicant pool has stayed the same as the population grows, as Poon points out.\n\nIt also only looks at how many students enroll in the school, and not how many students are admitted to the school. Jenn Fang, who writes at Reappropriate.co , found that the limited growth in Asian-Americans students at Harvard wasn't out of the ordinary:\n\nAnother popular argument is that after California passed Proposition 209, which banned affirmative action, Asian-American enrollment increased at the most competitive California schools, like UC Berkeley:\n\nBut, again, this just looks at enrollment numbers, not admission rates.\n\nSo when Poon looked into Asian admissions rates, she found that after affirmative action was banned, the schools admitted a smaller percentage of Asian applicants - even though more Asian students ended up enrolling at the selective schools:\n\nNone of this means that discrimination against Asian Americans doesn't exist in admissions.\n\nBut the fact that we're focused so much on this question - and will be focusing on it again with the Trump administration - shows just how successful conservatives have been in the affirmative action debate. They've managed to make the affirmative action debate about Asian Americans - and white people - being victims of a zero-sum game.\n\nIf you ask Americans whether they favor affirmative action for racial minorities, most of them say they do.\n\nBut it's easy to change those views.\n\nThat's because the process of applying to elite schools is often framed like a game, where every attribute on your application is either a bonus or a penalty. So it's easy to talk about racial identity as if it's one of those scored attributes, in which schools are artificially awarding extra \"points\" to black and brown applicants while taking away \"points\" from Asian and white students.\n\nWhen there's even a hint that your race can help or hurt your chances of success, support for affirmative action plummets.\n\nThis latter frame - of people being hurt based on their race - is exactly how affirmative action opponents want to tell this story. And they've been wildly successful.\n\nThis version of the story may be a contributing factor in why most white Americans believe that discrimination against them is a major problem.\n\nUnderlying this thinking is the idea that there is some unadulterated metric that measures merit - one that often puts white people on top - but affirmative action takes away that advantage.\n\nBut it's important to understand that our measures of merit are, themselves, flawed. As Jerome Karabel wrote in his 2005 book The Chosen :\n\n... the definition of \"merit\" is fluid and tends to reflect the values and interests of those who have the power to impose their particular cultural ideals.\n\nIn other words, people who have economic and political clout - people who are predominantly white - decide what we measure and how we measure those things. That is how \"merit\" is engineered into the American education system, which in turn recreates wealth and power in America.\n\nThat's why the stories we tell about affirmative action - especially the characters we cast and the roles we accept - are crucial.\n\nOne story is about how race-based disadvantages exist, and how we perpetuate them using the American education system.\n\nAnother story implies racial hierarchies are the natural state of the world, and that any race-based remedy is a form of charity - and even unjust. In this narrative, Asian people are the victims of any racial remedies. The long history of discrimination against Asians - and the real struggle Asians face in accruing cultural clout and ascending to the highest echelons of politics and business - are tied to the anchor of affirmative action.\n\nThat some Asian Americans are now more receptive to this story doesn't make it any more true.\n\nIt's a compelling story, though, and it may well be winning.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby Libby Nelson\n\nby Libby Nelson\n\nIn the US, young whites are far more likely to get a bachelor's degree than young blacks and Hispanics:\n\nAffirmative action refers to policies that give students from underrepresented minority groups a boost in the college or university admissions process. The term affirmative action can also refer to policies that boost minority prospects in employment or contracting, but this cardstack will focus on race-based affirmative action in US higher education.\n\nRationales : Supporters cite three main reasons affirmative action policies are helpful or necessary.\n\nHow it works : In the US, public colleges and universities -€\" and private colleges receiving federal funding, which is virtually all - have to be very careful about how they use race in their admissions processes. They are only allowed to consider race as one of many factors in weighing an application. They aren't allowed to create a racial quota (reserving, say, 10 percent of spots for a certain group) or to use a standardized racial bonus (giving 20 extra points to each minority applicant);€\" both of these approaches have been ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, in the Regents v. Bakke and Gratz v. Bollinger cases.\n\nStill, the overall effect is to admit more students from underrepresented minorities, even though many have lower test scores than other admitted applicants. Of course, that happens in other contexts, too: colleges often admit certain students despite lower-than-average test scores - say, athletes, or children of wealthy alumni.\n\nThe controversy : There are several common criticisms of the use of affirmative action in university admissions. Most prominently, o pponents argue that the programs themselves are racially discriminatory, since they favor certain racial groups and not others. Several white students have sued universities, arguing that their scores would have qualified them for admission if not for affirmative action programs. And some argue that the programs can hurt Asian-Americans, restricting their admissions opportunities in elite schools despite high test scores.\n\nOthers argue that affirmative action programs currently help many members of minority groups who are already wealthy or well-connected, and don't need a boost, and that the programs should help disadvantaged people of all races instead. Finally, some critics maintain that these programs may have unintended consequences, and hurt the people they're intended to help, by dropping them into academic situations they're not prepared for.\n\nCard written by Andrew Prokop\n\nIt depends on how you word the question. Generally, Americans don't seem to mind the idea of giving racial minorities a leg up, but their opinion changes if they're told those students aren't as academically qualified.\n\nGallup asked in 2013 whether \"students should be admitted solely on the basis of merit, even if that results in few minority students being admitted\" or \"an applicant's background should be considered to help promote diversity on college campuses, even if that means admitting some minority students who would not otherwise be admitted.\"\n\nA strong majority - 67 percent - opposed the consideration of race in college admissions when the question was phrased that way. Whites were the least likely to favor it, but a majority of Hispanics also said students should be admitted based solely on merit. Although a higher proportion of Democrats favored affirmative action than Republicans or Independents, a majority of respondents from all parties opposed it, Gallup found.\n\nBut the same Gallup poll found that Americans don't necessarily the concept of affirmative action; 58 percent said they generally favor \"affirmative action programs for racial minorities,\" including a slim majority (51 percent) of whites.\n\nThe Pew Research Center asked the college admissions question in a different way in 2014: \"In general, do you think affirmative action programs designed to increase the number of black and minority students on college campuses are a good thing or a bad thing?\"\n\nNearly two-thirds of respondents - 63 percent - said they thought affirmative action described that way was a good thing, including 55 percent of whites, 80 percent of Hispanics and 84 percent of black respondents.\n\nOne sociologist has found that the definition of merit in college admissions could be changing for white people feeling threatened by Asian-American students' success. White Americans are more likely to support taking intangible quantities like leadership into account, rather than just grades and test scores, given a prompt that notes the high proportion of students of Asian descent at the University of California at Berkeley.\n\nAffirmative action based on economic circumstances - giving poor students a boost, regardless of their skin color - is often suggested as a replacement for race-based affirmative action in college admissions.\n\nClass-based affirmative action is sometimes seen as simply an end run around bans on racial preferences. In states that bar race-based affirmative action, colleges can turn to class as an alternative. Since black and Latino families are more likely to be poor than white families are, class can serve as a proxy for race, a way to make sure that colleges have racial diversity even if they can't take race into consideration outright. (The two aren't mutually exclusive; colleges can give preferences to students based both on race and family income.)\n\nBut others see it as a superior system , not an inferior proxy. One argument for class-based affirmative action could be termed the Malia Obama argument. If colleges think about diversity solely in terms of race, President Obama's daughters will get an edge in college admissions that white children who grew up in poverty will not. (Obama has said he doesn't think that would be fair.) Wealthy students are already vastly overrepresented at colleges, particularly selective colleges. In 2006, just 5 percent of students at selective colleges came from the bottom income quartile, says Anthony Carnavale, director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce.\n\nThere are a few critiques of class-based affirmative action, particularly if it's used as the only form of affirmative action.\n\nFirst, some argue that it isn't as effective at creating racial diversity as race-based affirmative action is. Others argue that the legacy of racial discrimination is weightier than the challenges low-income students have accessing higher education. Black students were systematically shut out of higher education; poor students were not. There is also still a pervasive wealth gap between black and Latino families and white ones, even at high incomes. Class-based affirmative action can encourage stereotyping, critics argue , if the only students of color on campus are poor.\n\nThe best comparison of the effects of considering class versus race so far was at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Colorado came close to banning affirmative action in 2008, although the initiative ultimately failed; before the vote, though, the university had already developed a race-neutral plan to take students' incomes into account. Researchers found that underrepresented minority students were more likely to be admitted under class-based affirmative action than they were under race-based policies: admission rates were 9 percentage points higher for underrepresented minorities. For students from disadvantaged backgrounds of all races, admission rates were 20 percentage points higher under class-based affirmative action.\n\nMany high-achieving students from Asian backgrounds believe that they're discriminated against in college admissions and that colleges often set de facto quotas for Asian students when they take race into account in admissions.\n\nThere is some evidence that Asian-American students' chances for admission are harmed by affirmative action programs. In 2005, a study from two Princeton University researchers found that without affirmative action, the admission rate for black and Latino college applicants would fall sharply. But white students would be largely unaffected - students of Asian descent would be the beneficiaries, getting about 80 percent of the slots no longer filled by other students of color.\n\nAt colleges where affirmative action is banned or race is not taken into account, there is a much higher proportion of Asian-American students within the student body; at the University of California at Berkeley, for example, Asian-American students make up 39 percent of the student body - more than double their share of the state population.\n\nOn the other hand, even as the share of college-aged Americans who are Asian has grown nationally, the proportion of Asian students at Ivy League colleges has remained flat, The American Conservative found in a review of demographic data. Ivy League colleges practice affirmative action; the California Institute of Technology, also a private college, focuses almost solely on academic achievement among applicants, and its Asian enrollment more closely tracks national population trends (while black and Hispanic students are underrepresented ).\n\nSource: The American Conservative\n\nBecause of this, some Asian-American groups oppose affirmative action. Organized Asian-American opposition was key to defeating an attempt to reinstate affirmative action in California in 2014.\n\nBut opinion is not monolithic among Asian-Americans, nor are all Asian-American students academic achievers from professional backgrounds. Some Asian-American subgroups have higher poverty rates than Americans as a whole and Cambodian, Laotian and Hmong-Americans have among the lowest college attendance rates in the country.\n\nThe first Supreme Court decision on affirmative action, Regents of the University of California v. Bakke , was decided in 1978. It held that strict racial quotas should not be used in college and university admissions, but that affirmative action could be constitutional in some circumstances if race was considered as just one of many factors. In the 35 years since Bakke, this has remained the court's basic approach to affirmative action.\n\nThe court reopened the issue 25 years after Bakke , in G rutter v. Bollinger . In that 5-4 decision, the court ruled that colleges could take race into account as one factor in a holistic review when admitting applicants. The court found that the educational benefits of diversity were a compelling reason to create a diverse student body, but that affirmative action programs would need to be \"narrowly tailored\" - essentially decided on a student-by-student basis. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the majority, said she expected the Grutter decision to stand for 25 years.\n\nIt's important to note that neither case was a complete victory for the university involved, and both upheld the principle of affirmative action in theory while rolling it back in practice. In Bakke , the University of California's quota system was thrown out; in Gratz v. Bollinger , a case rolled into the Grutter decision, the University of Michigan law school was forbidden to use a point system that awarded additional points to applicants if they were from underrepresented minorities. In the 25 years between the two landmark cases, t he court's rationale for allowing affirmative action shifted, from remedying past racial discrimination in Bakke to benefiting the entire student body in Grutter .\n\nTwo more recent cases have also weighed in on affirmative action. Schuette v. BAMN , decided in April 2014, sprung from the Grutter case; Michigan voters banned affirmative action by ballot initiative with a 58 percent majority not long after the Supreme Court decision . The court found those bans are constitutional, which could spur similar efforts in other states and left state bans elsewhere in place.\n\nThe most direct challenge to the precedents set in Bakke and Grutter, though , was Fisher v. Texas , a lawsuit over the University of Texas's consideration of race in admissions. The University of Texas at Austin admits most of its students by letting in students from the top 10 percent of every high school class. For other slots in the freshman class, it considers a range of factors - including race. Abigail Fisher, a Texas resident who didn't make the 10 percent cutoff and wasn't admitted using other criteria, sued, arguing her rights were violated.\n\nIn a 7-1 decision in 2013, the Supreme Court sent the Fisher case back to a court of appeals for further review. The lower court hadn't used a strict enough standard when evaluating Texas' affirmative action plan, the justices argued. The case returned to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals , where it was reargued in November 2013. In July 2014, a panel of three justices again upheld Texas's affirmative action policy.\n\nThe majority of colleges and universities in the US take everyone, or nearly everyone, who applies. So the debate about affirmative action is usually confined to a smaller universe of prestigious colleges and law schools. It is especially contentious because research has found that attending a highly selective college is more likely to affect lifetime earnings for students from low-income or minority backgrounds than for white, upper middle class students. So the stakes are high.\n\nIn a 1998 book on affirmative action, The Shape of the River , two former Ivy League university presidents - Derek Bok, the former president of Harvard, and William Bowen, the former president of Princeton - argued that affirmative action benefits both the individual students admitted under the policies and the campus as a whole. They compared white and black students who graduated in 1976 and 1989 from 28 prestigious public and private colleges. They found that black students who benefited from affirmative action generally succeeded despite their lower test scores; they graduated and went on to have successful lives, earning an average of $71,000 by their mid-30s and demonstrating high levels of civic participation.\n\nHowever, some researchers continue to argue that, particularly in law school, affirmative action is harmful to students' later careers. This is an idea that researchers describe as \"mismatch\": graduates helped by affirmative action might struggle at schools or jobs that are too tough for them. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas is an adherent of mismatch theory and uses it to argue that affirmative action actually harms minority students.\n\nOne of the more prominent debates in this area surrounded a 2004 Stanford Law Review article by UCLA law professor Richard Sander, about the effects of affirmative action on law students' post-graduation prospects.\n\nFocusing solely on black and white law school students from 1994-96, he found that 88 percent of accredited law school grads passed the bar on the first try, and that 95 percent passed eventually. However, the pass rates for blacks were substantially lower: 61.4 for first-timers and 77.6 percent after five tries. Because affirmative action hurts black students by putting some in schools where they won't perform as well, Sander argued, it lowers the number of them that pass the bar. Eliminating race-based preferences, he calculated, would have boosted the number of black students who passed the bar among 2001 matriculants by 7.9 percent.\n\nHowever, there are plenty of detractors to Sander's arguments. One Yale law student , Daniel Ho, wrote in response that Sander performed his analysis incorrectly and failed to prove that affirmative action at law schools causes lower bar-passage rates. Another pair of law school professors found that getting rid of affirmative action would decrease the number of black lawyers by 12.7 percent.\n\nOther research has cast doubt on the mismatch theory, at least as it applies to undergraduate students. A study at the University of California found that students who had just made the admissions cutoff - those most likely to be mismatched - earned slightly lower grades than other students, but the difference disappeared when they were compared only to students with a similar educational background. While California doesn't have affirmative action, the study suggests that students with lower grades and test scores still benefit from attending a selective college.\n\nBesides Michigan, seven states currently ban affirmative action in public college admissions.\n\nMost of these bans were passed directly by the voters and not by the state legislature.\n\nA study in 2013 from the American Educational Research Association found that the bans work as intended: they eliminate the edge that underrepresented minorities have in college admissions, and the effect even spreads to neighboring states.\n\nIn some states with bans, the proportion of black and Hispanic freshmen at state flagship colleges and universities declined . Before California banned affirmative action in 1998, the proportion of black college freshmen at the University of California-Berkeley and the University of California-Los Angeles was about the same as the proportion of black college-aged students in the state.\n\nAfter the affirmative action ban was passed, though, the proportion of black students on campus declined, the New York Times found in an examination of the data . Black students are 9 percent of the state's college-aged population, but only 2 percent of the student body at Berkeley.\n\nOther states have seen different effects. In Florida, black students are underrepresented at state colleges and universities; while Hispanic students are still underrepresented, too, they haven't lost any ground since affirmative action was banned.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nGiven the Court's Republican supermajority, this case is unlikely to end well for trans people.\n\nLearn about saving, spending, investing, and more in a monthly personal finance advice column written by Nicole Dieker.\n\nThe latest news, analysis, and explainers coming out of the GOP Iowa caucuses.\n\nThe economy's stacked against us.\n\nA Texas judge issued a national ruling against medication abortion.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nPreliminary data shows a negative impact on Black enrollment at some universities.\n\nby Nicole Narea\n\nNew college admissions data for the first group of admitted students since the US Supreme Court sharply limited affirmative action last year suggests that the decision has had a negative impact on Black enrollment at some universities.\n\nWhile some colleges have seen major fluctuations in the enrollment of students of color in the class of 2028, including notable declines among Black and African American students, the impact has appeared more muted elsewhere. Many universities have yet to release their data, however, so a more clear picture may emerge throughout the fall.\n\nThe most dramatic change was at MIT, which saw an 8 percentage point dropoff in Black and African American enrollment, down from 13 percent enrollment on average in the four years prior , and a 6 percentage point boost in Asian American enrollment, up from 41 percent. Washington University in St. Louis and Tufts University also saw a significant decline in Black and African American enrollment, which sank by 4 and almost 3 percentage points at each school, respectively.\n\nYale University saw no change in enrollment among Black and African American students, but it reported a 6 percentage point decline among Asian Americans.\n\nAnd at schools such as the University of Virginia , demographic changes in enrollment were fairly negligible across demographic groups, moving no more than a few percentage points in either direction.\n\nAll that data should be taken with a grain of salt; with only a few dozen schools reporting on their enrollments, many of them selective private institutions, \"we still can't definitively speak to how racially diverse this first post-affirmative action class will be,\" Michaele Turnage Young, senior counsel and comanager of the Equal Protection Initiative at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, told Vox.\n\nBut so far, there isn't much good news in the data for students of color. And many schools have yet to implement race-neutral policies aimed at fostering diversity in their classes, which would comply with the Supreme Court's decision.\n\n\"I don't see many steps forward. I see more steps backward,\" said Wil Del Pilar, the senior vice president of Ed Trust, a think tank focusing on racial and economic barriers in American education.\n\nExperts in higher education policy have predicted since 2023 that the Supreme Court's decision would hurt diversity on college campuses, starting with incoming first-years in 2024.\n\nThe Court's 6-3 decision found that race-conscious admissions programs at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race and other factors. In the majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts ruled that the way those universities' admissions offices considered race was not narrowly tailored enough to meet the standard required by the Constitution, but he left open the possibility that race could still be considered in the context of essays describing an applicant's personal experiences.\n\nExperts have based their predictions about the impact of the ruling in part on what happened in the 1990s and mid-2000s, when states including California, Michigan, and Washington banned affirmative action at public universities.\n\n\"What we saw overwhelmingly at selective public institutions was significant decreases in the number of Black students enrolled, and most of those institutions, especially the most selective, never recovered,\" Del Pilar said.\n\nPreliminary 2024 enrollment figures suggest that at least some selective schools have seen similar declines in enrollment among students of color. According to Del Pilar, that's because they largely haven't overhauled what they value in admissions. \"All we did was take one factor out without really adjusting for the other factors that continue to disadvantage students of color,\" he said.\n\nBut the results vary, sometimes widely, by institution. At this point, it's hard to say exactly what's driving the differences in outcomes.\n\nSome universities have tried to mitigate the impact of the end of affirmative action with race-neutral policies aimed at bolstering diversity. For example, Duke University unveiled a new program in 2023 to waive tuition for lower-income North and South Carolinians. UVA followed in December, waiving tuition for lower-income in-state admits .\n\nThat may be part of the reason those schools didn't see dramatic fluctuations in the makeup of their incoming classes. Duke even increased the combined share of Black and Hispanic enrollment by one percentage point in its incoming class for 2024 compared to 2023.\n\nEven predating the Supreme Court's decision, many schools had also given applicants the option to write a \"diversity statement\" explaining how their background, including their race, may have impacted their life experiences. Schools may come to rely more heavily on diversity statements as part of a holistic admissions process going forward, though it's not clear that they're doing so just yet.\n\n\"I think that a lot of schools are certainly going to avail themselves of that option and utilize that experience,\" Bryan J. Cook, director of higher education policy at the Center on Education Data and Policy at the Urban Institute, told Vox.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision didn't just impact admissions deliberations but potentially also who's applying where. After California banned affirmative action at public universities in 1996, Cook said, more students of color with the academic qualifications to apply to Berkeley or UCLA chose instead to apply to less selective California institutions.\n\nIf the Supreme Court's 2023 decision has had a similar impact on where students choose to apply, selective institutions may have to work harder to recruit diverse applicants.\n\n\"Based on what we've seen thus far and the speculation after the ruling last summer, we would probably see more of an impact in the highly selective institutions in terms of what the makeup of the fall cohort looks like,\" Cook said.\n\nSome colleges - for instance, those participating in a pilot program launched in 2023 by the state of Minnesota - have tried to address the recruitment problem by increasing their direct admissions, in which students who meet certain academic criteria are automatically granted admission. But that's not happening at the most selective colleges, where admission rates are often in the single digits.\n\n\"They continue to operate the way they've always operated,\" Del Pilar said. \"Unless institutions really begin to change where they're recruiting, how they're recruiting, who they're talking to, their availability of need-based aid, we're not going to see a ton of advances in enrolling a more diverse class.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nWe are cast as victims in a pernicious story about race.\n\nby Alvin Chang\n\nI first heard about the \"penalty\" my junior year of high school. I was sitting in an SAT prep class because I had barely broken 1000 on my first practice SAT. During a snack break, another Asian kid in the class said to me, \"You know we have to do better than even the white kids, right?\"\n\nI had never heard affirmative action framed that way - as a \"bonus\" for black and brown people and a \"penalty\" for white and especially Asian people.\n\nAt the time, I didn't understand just how pernicious it was to think about affirmative action in those terms. Not only does that frame gloss over the reasons why race-conscious policies are necessary; it's also the first step toward arguing that all race-conscious policies are unfair.\n\nBut I was fed a certain story about affirmative action, so when I saw this data a few years later, it only solidified this mental model:\n\nThe data is from an influential 2009 book in which two Princeton sociologists, Thomas Espenshade and Alexandra Radford, quantified how well you needed to score on your SATs to have an equal chance of admission as someone of another race. It implies that a black student who scores 1000 on her SATs would have an equal chance of admission as a white student who scores 1310 or an Asian-American student who scores 1450.\n\nThis study gave legs to a longstanding conservative argument that affirmative action is a misguided progressive policy to help black and Hispanic people while unfairly penalizing Asian and white people.\n\nAnd the argument is resurfacing again.\n\nWhen Trump first took office, the Justice Department dug up a two-year-old complaint against Harvard that alleges the school has quotas on how many Asian Americans it accepts. It opened an investigation into Harvard's admissions practices, which many feared would create a chilling effect on other schools with affirmative action programs.\n\nThen in October, a federal court heard arguments on a lawsuit that alleges the same thing. And in the lead-up to thetrial, the Trump administration wrote a statement of support for the plaintiffs, who echoed the exact argument conservatives have been making for decades:\n\n...the record evidence demonstrates that Harvard's race-based admissions process significantly disadvantages Asian-American applicants compared to applicants of other racial groups - including both white applicants and applicants from other racial minority groups.\n\nIn short, conservatives are taking another swing at dismantling affirmative action - hoping the case makes it to the Supreme Court, where a new conservative majority could rule broadly and outlaw affirmative action. And, yet again, they are centering the debate around Asian Americans.\n\nThis story, of racial bonuses and penalties due to affirmative action, has created an internal tension for Asian Americans: Many of us know race-conscious policies are necessary to remedy systemic racism. But we are also told that Asian Americans are penalized for those same policies.\n\nIt's a tension white affirmative action opponents have exploited, time and again, to make their argument against race-conscious policies and to seek a broader coalition for their movement.\n\nBut if Asian Americans have long resisted being recruited to their cause, this latest campaign has a new wrinkle. \"This time around, there is a wealthier, very small, and extremely vocal group of Asians who are on board - and very willing to play the part,\" said Colorado State University education professor OiYan Poon, who has been studying this group.\n\nThe story on which this movement is built contains some fundamental misunderstandings. The idea that affirmative action doles out bonuses and penalties obscures the far more complicated reality of how the policy actually works. But of greater concern is that this story - of merit artificially tweaked to engineer a certain racial demographic - implies that there is an objective way to measure who is deserving and who isn't. And it suggests that if we went purely by this idea of merit, it is white and Asian people who would be on top, and that that is the natural state of the world.\n\nThe use of Asian Americans as a political prop isn't new.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Asian-American groups started to uncover admissions practices that hurt Asian applicants. Eventually, top schools like Stanford and Brown conceded there was real bias against Asians in their admissions policies.\n\nThe Reagan administration saw an opportunity in these controversies.\n\nWilliam Bradford Reynolds, then the head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and a longtime opponent of affirmative action, said in a 1988 speech that Asian Americans faced discrimination because of efforts to help other minority groups:\n\nWhile university officials are understandably loath to admit that they are discriminating against qualified Asian-Americans, rejection of such applicants ironically appears to be driven by the universities' \"affirmative action\" policies aimed at favoring other, preferred racial minorities.\n\nBut Asian-American leaders were horrified that their cause was being co-opted by conservatives to dismantle policies that helped other racial minorities - and they refused to play the part.\n\nUC Berkeley professor L. Ling-Chi Wang wrote to Reynolds , \"At no time has anyone in the Asian American community linked these concerns to the legitimate affirmative action program for the historically discriminated, underrepresented minorities.\"\n\nLaw professor and activist Mari Matsuda argued Asians shouldn't be used to \"deny educational opportunities to the disadvantaged and to preserve success only for the privileged.\"\n\nDePaul professor Sumi Cho coined a term for this conservative tactic: \" racial mascotting .\"\n\nThis fight over admissions at highly selective private schools might seem inconsequential for most people. But as Harvard education professor Natasha Warikoo wrote in her recent book, The Diversity Bargain :\n\nI see these elite universities as sites for symbolic meaning-making around merit and race. The universities hold symbolic value not only for their students, but also in the wider society. They are especially important for our understanding of meritocracy, because many see admissions to those universities as the ultimate demonstration of merit.\n\nIn short, these fights shape the ways we talk about who is worthy, who is not - and why.\n\nAnd 30 years later, we're back here again, having the same debate with affirmative action opponents, who are again using Asian Americans as mascots. And again, there's a large group of Asian-American leaders rejecting this role in the debate.\n\nBut now another group of Asian Americans is making this debate more confusing.\n\nThe latest challenge to affirmative action began with a lawsuit filed by Edward Blum , who also launched the previous attack on affirmative action. In that case, Blum recruited Abigail Fisher, a white student who claimed she was rejected by the University of Texas Austin because of her race. That case went to the Supreme Court , and many believed it would finally strike down affirmative action - but it didn't.\n\nFor his next act, Blum took another swing at affirmative action - this time, using Asian Americans as the victims in a lawsuit against Harvard.\n\nBut shortly after Blum filed his lawsuit, something interesting happened: A coalition of more than 60 Asian-American groups filed a Justice Department complaint largely mimicking Blum's lawsuit.\n\nLeading that charge was a Chinese-American man named Yukong Zhao, a Florida businessman in his 50s.\n\nZhao is the president of the Asian American Coalition for Education, the collection of groups that filed the DOJ complaint. And he and his followers are ideal allies for white, anti-affirmative action conservatives. They not only claim that race-conscious policies are unfair but argue convincingly that they are victims.\n\nWhat's unique about Zhao is his large audience; he's a star on the Chinese social media platform WeChat, which has turned into a kind of \" virtual Chinatown ,\" as activist Steven Chen puts it. It's an isolated place populated by mostly first-generation immigrants from mainland China, with high barriers to entry for everyone else. And it has become an echo chamber for stories of anti-Asian discrimination.\n\nZhao has been one of the loudest voices on this front. \"In the future,\" he told me, \"our dream, just like Martin Luther King, is we want every child to be judged on their talent and content of their character, not by their skin color.\"\n\nThis group can feel large in numbers and has earned a lot of media attention . They can be especially intimidating in the WeChat world.\n\nBut Poon, the education researcher, found that they're actually much smaller and more homogenous than the coalition's profile suggests.\n\nShe interviewed 36 Asian Americans last year who have advocated for or against affirmative action. And she found that those who have advocated against affirmative action are almost entirely recent immigrants from mainland China - the same group that spends time on WeChat. They tend to be affluent and educated, but also racially isolated. They work in places that are predominantly white, and occupy social spaces that are predominantly Chinese.\n\nPoon also said most of them had stories about experiencing racial discrimination. If you combine that with Zhao's rhetoric that affirmative action penalizes them in favor of black and Hispanic applicants, you can see how they might believe the US is anti-Asian:\n\nZhao says the way to address racial discrimination is to remove all race-based policies, echoing other affirmative action opponents. Otherwise, he says, Asian Americans become victims - perhaps like his son, who he says experienced racial discrimination from at least two Ivy League schools who rejected him, despite an application that was more than deserving.\n\n\"We're hardworking, we never ask for any government favors,\" he told me. \"But you blame us as overrepresented. We contribute to society. ... Why are Asian Americans being punished?\"\n\nThen Zhao dials down the rhetoric and presents data that Asians are being hurt by affirmative action: the Espenshade data, which seems to prove affirmative action penalizes Asians while helping black and Hispanic people.\n\nOnce evidence of a \"penalty\" for Asian Americans is introduced in the conversation, it can be difficult to rebut.\n\nThe myth of a racial bonus/penalty persists, especially in more isolated Asian-American communities, where anecdotes about anti-Asian discrimination inform a certain worldview.\n\nAnd sometimes, those anecdotes prove true, like when a federal investigation unveiled documents that showed admissions officers at Princeton wrote disparagingly of Asian-American applicants, stereotyping them with labels like \"standard premeds.\" (They also wrote disparagingly of black and Hispanic applicants.)\n\nBut this simplistic framework doesn't reflect the long, winding journey affirmative action has taken - and just how much it's been stripped down along the way.\n\nWhen the Supreme Court first ruled on affirmative action in 1978, it ruled that affirmative action could not specifically help black and Hispanic students at the expense of other students.\n\nHowever, schools could consider race if the practice was \"narrowly tailored\" to serve a \"compelling\" interest. The Court ruled that the goal of remedying structural racism wasn't narrow enough. So that left only a single path for affirmative action to walk: Race could only be considered to create diversity on campuses.\n\nFrom there, affirmation action was further limited with each successive ruling.\n\nIn the 2003 decision Grutter v. Bollinger , Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote in the majority opinion that race should be considered alongside \"all factors that may contribute to student body diversity.\"\n\nThis meant schools could only consider a student's race as one factor among many others in a \"holistic\" review of an application. It essentially turned race into a peripheral characteristic, alongside things like whether you played sports.\n\nThen in 2013 , the Court laid out strict rules for when race can be used in a holistic review, further limiting affirmative action:\n\nMost recently, in a 2016 decision , the Court further constrained the consideration of race.\n\nJustice Anthony Kennedy wrote it can only be a \"factor of a factor of a factor.\"\n\nLet's say a school is looking for strong leadership qualities, and an applicant lists leadership experience that is grounded in their racial identity. Only then can a school consider their race.\n\nUltimately, this means that schools are severely limited in how they can think about race in admissions.\n\nIf we look more closely at the Espenshade data within this context, we begin to see why the chart of racial bonuses and penalties paints a misleading picture of affirmative action. For one, Espenshade and Radford used data from just a handful of schools in 1997, and it was data from before major court rulings changed how schools can consider race.\n\nBut more importantly, the Espenshade analysis paints a picture of an alternate reality in which we went down a caricatured version of the other path. It portrays a world where racial bonuses are awarded to disadvantaged groups and racial penalties are levied against Asian and white students.\n\nThat's just not the reality of affirmative action. As even Espenshade has reiterated time and again , his study doesn't prove discrimination against Asian Americans.\n\nThat hasn't stopped affirmative action opponents from using Espenshade - and from reaching for other arguments to make their case.\n\nIn 2012, Ron Unz, a former publisher of the American Conservative, argued that Ivy League schools have an Asian quota . His main piece of evidence was the lack of growth in the Asian-American population at Ivy League schools, despite the growing percentage of college-age Asians nationwide. As a counterexample, he compared Asian enrollment at these schools to Caltech, where they don't have affirmative action:\n\nThere are several flaws with this analysis. It assumes the quality of the Asian applicant pool has stayed the same as the population grows, as Poon points out.\n\nIt also only looks at how many students enroll in the school, and not how many students are admitted to the school. Jenn Fang, who writes at Reappropriate.co , found that the limited growth in Asian-Americans students at Harvard wasn't out of the ordinary:\n\nAnother popular argument is that after California passed Proposition 209, which banned affirmative action, Asian-American enrollment increased at the most competitive California schools, like UC Berkeley:\n\nBut, again, this just looks at enrollment numbers, not admission rates.\n\nSo when Poon looked into Asian admissions rates, she found that after affirmative action was banned, the schools admitted a smaller percentage of Asian applicants - even though more Asian students ended up enrolling at the selective schools:\n\nNone of this means that discrimination against Asian Americans doesn't exist in admissions.\n\nBut the fact that we're focused so much on this question - and will be focusing on it again with the Trump administration - shows just how successful conservatives have been in the affirmative action debate. They've managed to make the affirmative action debate about Asian Americans - and white people - being victims of a zero-sum game.\n\nIf you ask Americans whether they favor affirmative action for racial minorities, most of them say they do.\n\nBut it's easy to change those views.\n\nThat's because the process of applying to elite schools is often framed like a game, where every attribute on your application is either a bonus or a penalty. So it's easy to talk about racial identity as if it's one of those scored attributes, in which schools are artificially awarding extra \"points\" to black and brown applicants while taking away \"points\" from Asian and white students.\n\nWhen there's even a hint that your race can help or hurt your chances of success, support for affirmative action plummets.\n\nThis latter frame - of people being hurt based on their race - is exactly how affirmative action opponents want to tell this story. And they've been wildly successful.\n\nThis version of the story may be a contributing factor in why most white Americans believe that discrimination against them is a major problem.\n\nUnderlying this thinking is the idea that there is some unadulterated metric that measures merit - one that often puts white people on top - but affirmative action takes away that advantage.\n\nBut it's important to understand that our measures of merit are, themselves, flawed. As Jerome Karabel wrote in his 2005 book The Chosen :\n\n... the definition of \"merit\" is fluid and tends to reflect the values and interests of those who have the power to impose their particular cultural ideals.\n\nIn other words, people who have economic and political clout - people who are predominantly white - decide what we measure and how we measure those things. That is how \"merit\" is engineered into the American education system, which in turn recreates wealth and power in America.\n\nThat's why the stories we tell about affirmative action - especially the characters we cast and the roles we accept - are crucial.\n\nOne story is about how race-based disadvantages exist, and how we perpetuate them using the American education system.\n\nAnother story implies racial hierarchies are the natural state of the world, and that any race-based remedy is a form of charity - and even unjust. In this narrative, Asian people are the victims of any racial remedies. The long history of discrimination against Asians - and the real struggle Asians face in accruing cultural clout and ascending to the highest echelons of politics and business - are tied to the anchor of affirmative action.\n\nThat some Asian Americans are now more receptive to this story doesn't make it any more true.\n\nIt's a compelling story, though, and it may well be winning.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Harvard and a companion lawsuit against the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the conservative majority on the Supreme Court discarded decades of legal precedent by ruling that colleges may no longer consider race when admitting students.\n\nThe Court was unmoved by the near-unanimous belief among people who run colleges that student diversity is essential for education, or by the many barriers that continue to stand between students of color and college degrees. Because nearly all private colleges, including Harvard, receive federal funding, they are now subject to the court's brand-new interpretation of the 14th Amendment's ban on racial discrimination.\n\nThat creates an enormous challenge for college leaders and admissions staff. The higher education institutions affected by this ruling will almost certainly not relent on their stated commitment to recruiting a diverse student body. But they'll need to find new ways of making good on that commitment with methods that (they hope) won't run afoul of the Supreme Court.\n\nHistory suggests it will be difficult to fully replace the strategies that the Court just declared illegal, particularly at first. That's especially true given that many forms of affirmative action for the white and wealthy still stand: The Ivy League crew team recruit with mediocre grades won't be touched by this decision.\n\nA diverse higher ed landscape is still possible after SFFA v. Harvard , but will colleges, especially of the elite variety, be willing to upend the old ways of doing things and commit to new investments to achieve it?\n\nSFFA v. Harvard goes into effect in a few months, when early-decision applications start arriving for the entering Class of 2028. Colleges have already admitted most of the students who will matriculate this fall. The ruling doesn't affect them or those who are still finalizing their choices.\n\nHere's another thing to understand: Affirmative action has never been a dominant force in admissions. The college destination of the large majority of students will be unaffected by its demise.\n\nOf the roughly 1,600 colleges that report admissions statistics to the federal government, only 350 admit 60 percent of applicants or less, and those include a dozen large universities in states that have already banned the use of race by public institutions when considering applications. Fewer than 100 colleges have admission rates below 30 percent, and they only enroll about 10 percent of all students. And most students of color who attend selective colleges would likely have been admitted to the same college or somewhere similar without racial preferences.\n\nSo we're really talking about the elite tier of schools in the US - a relatively small swath. But it's a consequential swath: Elite diplomas are an irreplaceable credential for entry into the halls of influence and wealth.\n\nThe corporate leaders who employ us and politicians who represent us are disproportionately selective college graduates, as are the barons of media, finance, and technology. Harvard and Yale educate eight hundredths of 1 percent of American undergraduates and gave us 89 percent of the current Supreme Court.\n\nBlack and Hispanic students in particular have historically been denied an equal opportunity to earn valuable college degrees. If history is a guide, SFFA v. Harvard will immediately make that problem worse.\n\nThis isn't the first time some colleges have been legally prohibited from using race in admissions. Nine states have passed laws or referendums that bar affirmative action in public universities. Often, the results have been the same: a swift decline in admissions rates for Black and Hispanic students, with damaging long-term consequences.\n\nCalifornia was the first and largest state to ban affirmative action, in 1996. Black and Hispanic representation at the flagship Berkeley and UCLA campuses immediately dropped .\n\nBut as a recent study found, the total damage was much larger and long-lasting. The ban cascaded down through California's public higher education system, altering admissions at less-exclusive institutions and knocking some students out of the system altogether.\n\nSome affirmative action opponents had theorized that this would actually be a good thing because of the so-called \"mismatch hypothesis,\" which supposes that students are harmed by admission to colleges where they can't keep up academically. Ending affirmative action would mean they would end up going to colleges appropriate to their achievement level and would consequently thrive there and beyond, or so the thinking went.\n\nThe California study, which examined the entire population of people who applied to the University of California over nearly two decades, totally demolished this idea. Ending racial preferences, it turned out, was nothing but bad for Black and Hispanic students. They were less likely to finish college, major in science and engineering, or go to graduate school. Hispanic students in particular were shut out of high-earning careers.\n\nThat's because selective colleges also tend to be rich colleges, with unmatched resources to help students learn, graduate, and connect to the social and employment networks that determine success. The end of affirmative action in California basically closed off those networks for many students of color.\n\nThe results in Michigan, which banned affirmative action in 2006, were similar. Despite extensive recruitment efforts, Black enrollment at the flagship University of Michigan declined from 7 percent in 2006 to less than 4 percent in 2021, even as the Black college-age population in the state increased. Hispanic enrollment grew in Michigan (and California) but that was likely the result of a significant increase in the overall size of the Hispanic population.\n\nThe damage will also be felt by students who don't directly benefit from racial preferences, in the form of increasingly homogenous student bodies and diminished educational experiences. A fragmented nation that provides young people with woefully few opportunities to build authentic relationships with people from different backgrounds will have fewer still. And it's unclear whether SFFA v. Harvard will ultimately reduce the often-justified sense among many Asian Americans that they are penalized by their racial and ethnic identity when applying to top schools.\n\nFortunately, colleges have options to maintain the racial diversity of their student bodies, even under the strictures of SFFA . Much will depend on their creativity and commitment, and how much they're willing to back their ideals with cold, hard cash.\n\nTo start, colleges will need to communicate what the Supreme Court's ruling does and doesn't mean.\n\nAmong the many sobering findings in the California study was a decline in highly qualified Black and Hispanic applicants to the UC system. In other words, the publicity surrounding the ban may have mistakenly convinced some students they shouldn't bother to apply.\n\nThe decision may also prompt more colleges to implement \"test-optional\" policies of not requiring SAT and ACT scores for admission, a practice that was widely adopted during the pandemic and would likely benefit Black and Hispanic students with lower test scores but strong high school grades.\n\nWhile the Supreme Court has barred the direct consideration of race, colleges can still legally consider other factors that have the effect of increasing racial and ethnic diversity. Texas, for example, enacted a well-known \"Top 10 Percent Plan\" in 1997 that guarantees the top 10th of every high school's graduating class admission to the University of Texas.\n\nSince some Texas school districts have very high concentrations of Black and Hispanic students, this effectively increased access to selective universities like UT-Austin, which admits so many students this way that it had to narrow its criteria to the top 6 percent.\n\nPercent plans are a start. But one study found they only bring back a fifth of the students lost to an affirmative action ban. They also depend, ironically, on states having a significant number of racially segregated school districts, many of which have roots in racist \"redlining\" policies and other forms of discrimination. Colleges will have to do more.\n\nColleges can also give preference to low-income students. Since centuries of structural racism have left Black and Hispanic households with less income and wealth than their white counterparts, class preferences would increase racial diversity without formally considering race. This is the hoped-for outcome proposed by Richard Kahlenberg , a liberal scholar who nonetheless served as an expert witness for the plaintiffs in SFFA v. Harvard.\n\nClass-based preferences, Kahlenberg notes, are far more popular among the general public than policies centered on race. He believes that wealthy Black and Hispanic students, who compose a significant percentage of students at universities like Harvard, would be replaced by more economically needy students of color.\n\n\"I've long argued a conservative decision on race will yield a liberal public policy result,\" Kahlenberg says.\n\nColleges could also give a boost to students from certain places . Harvard already does this with an admissions bump for residents of so-called \"Sparse Country\" states, predominantly rural areas in the West and Great Plains whose residents happen to be overwhelmingly white.\n\nColleges could target metropolitan areas, cities, or even neighborhoods with large non-white populations. In other words, like the percent plans, such an approach would leverage America's shameful history of racialized housing discrimination to get around our new, judicially mandated prohibition against helping people who continue to suffer from its effects.\n\nBut geographic plans may also cross the line the Supreme Court drew prohibiting policies that act as racial preferences in all but name, which could spur government investigations and more litigation.\n\nIn the majority opinion, Chief Justice Roberts wrote, \"Universities may not simply establish through application essays or other means the regime we hold unlawful today.\" And low-income students recruited through class-based affirmative action have less money to pay tuition. Harvard, with a $51 billion endowment, can afford to pay their bills. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the other defendant in the SFFA decision, has an endowment one-tenth that size and more than double the student body - and it's still richer than many selective schools.\n\nA signal moment in the aftermath of SFFA will come next spring, when Harvard announces the racial/ethnic composition of its graduating Class of 2028. Harvard may, through great effort and expense, be able to legally recreate the Class 2027 's mix of 15 percent African American/Black, 11 percent Latinx, and 3 percent Native American and Native Hawaiian students. But Harvard can take on more low-income students and build out the kind of recruitment operation a school needs to diversify the student body in a post- SFFA world. Other selective colleges that lack Harvard's billions might not be able to do the same.\n\nAnd even for Harvard, getting there might require heavy expenditure of a currency that's even more valuable to elite colleges than money: social prestige.\n\nThe SFFA decision left a range of admissions preferences that primarily benefit white people untouched. They include legacy admissions, bumps for the children of faculty, athletic recruitment, and the less formal but widely acknowledged preference for the underqualified children of people who are famous, powerful, or make enormous financial contributions, a.k.a. \"the Jared Kushner rule.\"\n\nFor a Kahlenberg-style class-based affirmative action plan to work, Harvard can't just increase preferences for low-income students. It also has to decrease preferences for legacies and the rich.\n\nHarvard is among a small handful of \"need-blind\" colleges and universities that don't penalize students who can't afford to pay full tuition. It also offers generous aid to those who can't afford a $ 59,000 tuition bill . In 2010, Harvard had, by one estimate , 14 times more students from the top 20 percent of household income than from the bottom 20 percent. It is not wealth-, fame-, or status-blind.\n\nLarge parts of the American power elite are nominally sympathetic to the virtues of race-conscious college admissions and also deeply committed to the cause of getting their own children into an Ivy League or similar institution. They won't go down without a fight.\n\nAnd that's before addressing the most powerful admissions preference of all: athletics. Harvard found that its preference for top athletes is nearly three times stronger than the boost for legacies and Black applicants, and more than six times the preference for students of low or modest income. Remember the \"Operation Varsity Blues\" scandal that involved wealthy parents bribing college sports coaches to pretend their children were great athletes? Top colleges will all but ignore their academic standards for people who are good at hitting a ball with a racket.\n\nDuke University economist Peter Arcidiacono did most of the number-crunching for the plaintiffs in SFFA. \"Going into this, I thought what I'd find going on with legacies is more disturbing than with athletics, but that's not the case,\" he says. \"If you eliminate athletic preferences at Harvard, white admission rates go down, Black admission rates stay the same, and Hispanic and Asian rates go up. Over 16 percent of white admits are athletes at Harvard, which is significantly higher than for Black students.\"\n\nTo increase racial diversity, colleges could eliminate preferences for expensive niche sports, like fencing and squash, that are mostly played by wealthy white people. Says Arcidiacono, \"It seems crazy to me to have such massive advantages for people on the sailing team.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court has undoubtedly made it more difficult for selective colleges to build undergraduate classes that reflect the whole American community, or to compensate for the structural racism that still keeps many students down. It would be naive to think that the damage wrought by the SFFA decision can be entirely avoided.\n\nBut the end of affirmative action doesn't have to mean the end of campus diversity. There is a big difference between doing nothing to blunt the Court's decision and adopting the many strategies that some colleges have already pioneered. In the coming years, we'll find out which colleges are willing to spend what it takes to make good on their lofty ideals.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nTrump's lawyers asked the Supreme Court to reinstate his ban on trans military service, after a lower court blocked it.\n\nMany of the justices seemed eager to impose impossible burdens on schools.\n\nThe two Republican justices appeared open to an attack on Obamacare, but ultimately seemed likely to reject it.\n\n﻿In an unusual overnight order, most of the justices voted to halt several illegal deportations.\n\nHow can you punish Trump officials for violating the law, when federal law enforcement is controlled by Trump?\n\nThe Oklahoma charter school case is one of two April cases seeking to remake schools in the religious right's image.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby Vox Staff\n\nThe Supreme Court severely curtailed the use of affirmative action in higher education, ruling that universities cannot explicitly consider race in granting admission and effectively reversing nearly 50 years of precedent . The 6-person majority's opinion is likely to radically transform the college admissions process.\n\nJustices heard two cases in October 2022 on affirmative action, one on race-conscious admissions policies at Harvard University and one from the University of North Carolina. The immediate question in the two lawsuits was whether the Court should overrule Grutter v. Bollinger, the 2003 case that held that race may play a limited role in college admissions. Chief Justice John Roberts's opinion today does not explicitly overrule that precedent, but it finds that the two universities' programs violate the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause. Though the Court said colleges may still consider how race has affected an individual's life, they left few to no practical avenues to do so.\n\nAffirmative action has been used for more than half a century by colleges and universities, initially to encourage the participation of historically marginalized groups and mitigate the effects of decades of segregation by university systems.\n\nDecades of research supports the conclusion that more diverse campuses benefit all students, but colleges continue to struggle to foster diversity . Advocates say affirmative action is still necessary even as America rapidly diversifies .\n\nThis is a developing story. Follow here for news and updates on the fallout of the affirmative action decision.\n\nFabiola Cineas\n\nThe Supreme Court 's decision to effectively ban the consideration of race in college admissions reversed more than 40 years of precedent. It also left other kinds of admission preferences in place - ones that often benefit white students.\n\nFor decades, the Court held that schools could consider race as one of many factors in the holistic review of an applicant, a consideration that could help foster diversity on campus.\n\nFabiola Cineas\n\nCorporations have already scaled back the diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts they launched in 2020 amid an ultimately stunted racial reckoning. Now the question is whether the Supreme Court's ban on race-conscious admissions will lead them to further rein in these programs to avoid potential legal challenges.\n\nOne thing is clear: The laws surrounding affirmative action in employment haven't changed.\n\nLi Zhou\n\nOn June 29, the Supreme Court effectively ended affirmative action in a 6-3 decision that drastically limits public and private universities from using race-conscious admissions policies. The case's plaintiff, a group called the Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA), argued that such provisions discriminate against Asian American students.\n\nEffectively, SFFA suggested, the institutions targeted in these suits - Harvard and the University of North Carolina - used race-conscious policies that hurt Asian Americans' chances of being accepted, while unfairly boosting opportunities for Black and Latino students. The Court seemed swayed by this notion, finding that affirmative action leads to discrimination.\n\nFabiola Cineas and Ian Millhiser\n\nThe Supreme Court has ruled that affirmative action policies at two colleges, Harvard University and the University of North Carolina, are illegal, a decision that is likely to drastically limit admissions officers' consideration of race as a factor in college applications, and has the potential to transform the makeup of the American student body.\n\nThe Court has supported the use of race in admissions for nearly 50 years, but what's different now is its new conservative supermajority. Out of nine justices, six are conservative, and with Chief Justice John Roberts's acknowledgment of his preference for race-neutral admissions policies, sweeping restrictions on affirmative action were all but certain. In the Court's decision, those six justices all voted to effectively end race-conscious admissions, arguing that such policies violate the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution.\n\nFabiola Cineas\n\nWhen Clarence Thomas started his first semester of law school during the summer of 1971, a familiar fear set over him: He knew he could succeed academically, but he was intimidated by his new surroundings on Yale's tree-lined urban campus - and also terrified to fail.\n\nDuring his first week of classes, he wondered how his peers were already comfortably decoding legal doctrine and whether he'd ever be able to catch up, he would later recount in his memoir My Grandfather's Son . Thomas spent part of his childhood in a rural Georgia community, where he lived in a shack, fetched water from the woods in lard buckets, and slept in a chair for a year when he was 6 years old. He questioned his abilities not because he was Black, but because he had grown up poor.\n\nIan Millhiser\n\nThe Supreme Court 's much-anticipated affirmative action decision Thursday does not explicitly overrule the Court's previous decisions permitting race-conscious university admissions, but it will almost certainly have the same effect as a total ban.\n\nAnd that will \"impair the military's ability to maintain diverse leadership, and thereby seriously undermine its institutional legitimacy and operational effectiveness .\"\n\nKevin Carey\n\nAffirmative action as we know it is gone. In a 6-3 ruling today in the case of Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard and a companion lawsuit against the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the conservative majority on the Supreme Court discarded decades of legal precedent by ruling that colleges may no longer consider race when admitting students.\n\nThe Court was unmoved by the near-unanimous belief among people who run colleges that student diversity is essential for education, or by the many barriers that continue to stand between students of color and college degrees. Because nearly all private colleges, including Harvard, receive federal funding, they are now subject to the court's brand-new interpretation of the 14th Amendment's ban on racial discrimination.\n\nIan Millhiser\n\nThe Supreme Court spent an inordinate amount of time on Monday hearing arguments in two cases about affirmative action in university admissions . Virtually nothing said in those arguments is likely to change the final outcome.\n\nThe six justices appointed by Republican presidents appeared determined from the beginning to implement the Republican Party's preferred approach to race and the Constitution, while the three justices appointed by Democrats appeared equally determined to adopt the Democratic Party's stance. That means that the Court is highly likely to implement the GOP's longtime position that affirmative action should be illegal.\n\nIan Millhiser\n\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson was hearing only the third case of her career as a Supreme Court justice when she went after one of her conservative colleagues' most sacred cows: the idea that the Constitution requires all US laws to be colorblind.\n\nThe Court's right flank - now in the majority - has long argued that US laws cannot draw distinctions on the basis of race. As Chief Justice John Roberts argued in Parents Involved v. Seattle School District (2007), a case about whether public school districts may take voluntary steps to racially integrate its schools, \"the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

      "text": "Supreme Court affirmative action decision could impact racial equity in higher ed\n\nThe debate over affirmative action highlights higher education diversity needs.\n\nThe Supreme Court decided Thursday to set new limits on affirmative action, striking down the current race-conscious admissions policies in place at University of North Carolina and Harvard University .\n\nThe decision sided in part with Students for Fair Admissions, a conservative group that challenged the admissions policies . Members argued that the affirmative action policies at the schools were discriminatory against white and Asian students.\n\nThe decision states that admissions programs at Harvard and UNC \"lack sufficiently focused and measurable objectives warranting the use of race, unavoidably employ race in a negative manner, involve racial stereotyping, and lack meaningful end points, those admissions programs cannot be reconciled with the guarantees of the Equal Protection Clause\" of the 14th Amendment.\n\nThe decision, however, states that \"nothing prohibits universities from considering an applicant's discussion of how race affected the applicant's life, so long as that discussion is concretely tied to a quality of character or unique ability that the particular applicant can contribute to the university.\"\n\nThis alters more than 40 years of legal precedent that supports consideration of race in college admissions.\n\nInstitutions that use affirmative action policies take an individual student's race or ethnicity into account during the college admissions selection process. It rose to popularity in the 1960s to address racial inequities in access to higher education.\n\nThe Supreme Court issued its landmark ruling in 1978 in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which cemented the place of affirmative action policies in college and university admissions.\n\nThe average Black-to-white student graduation rate gap at the top dozen public universities that do not use affirmative action was 10.1%, according to research from the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nThe average gap at the top dozen public universities with affirmative action was 6%.\n\nSocial inequities that impact access to higher education - such as economic inequality, segregation and academic inequity in K-12 schools - as well as the lasting impact of historical exclusion from colleges and universities against Black and brown students have led to the continued underrepresentation in four-year institutions, researchers told ABC News.\n\n\"During Reconstruction, we had a mere 12 years of Black achievement in policy, politics, the arts and sciences, and education that were followed by 70 years of state-sanctioned Jim Crow,\" the Congressional Black Caucus said in a statement, criticizing the court's decision. \"We didn't stop fighting for equality then and we won't stop now because too much is at stake to allow extremists to turn back the clock on progress.\"\n\nAffirmative action has contributed to the rise in students of color attending colleges and universities, experts say.\n\nResearchers fear the progress made in racial equity in higher education will be reversed, even though they say affirmative action has not been a perfect solution.\n\n\"Historically, some of these places like [the University of North Carolina], you literally couldn't go to UNC if you're Black,\" said Natasha Warikoo, a sociologist at Tufts University and researcher of racial inequity in education.\n\n\"HBCUs [were] chronically underfunded and were a way to not allow Black students to attend the state universities, and then over generations, that compounds itself, as wealth does,\" Warikoo said.\n\nColleges and universities have long struggled to reverse the inequities that drive low diversity rates in higher education, according to research from the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nNine states have banned affirmative action, and the decision affected their enrollment almost instantaneously: \"the number of underrepresented minorities never gets back to pre-ban levels,\" said Warikoo.\n\nOpponents of affirmative action say it violates the Equal Protection clause of the 14th Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits racial discrimination any place that receives federal funding.\n\n\"The reason why colleges are not proportionally diverse has nothing to do with bias or exclusion,\" said the Students for Fair Admissions in an April post. \"The reason is large racial differences in academic skills.\"\n\nThey argue affirmative action discriminates against Asian American and white applicants.\n\nSupporters of affirmative action argue that using race as one factor among many in a holistic review of a student's attributes is not exclusionary or harmful to other students.\n\n\"It's well proven ... that having a more diverse student population adds value to students' learning and experiences,\" said Mitchell Chang, a professor and the associate vice chancellor of equity, diversity and inclusion at UCLA.\n\nWarikoo argues that college admissions processes similarly take into account other attributes to diversify their student body.\n\nThese could include where applicants are from, if their parents were alumni, if they're a great athlete or if they are choosing a major they need students for and more.\n\n\"They're in the business of rejection,\" said Warikoo. \"The president of Harvard once said they could fill their freshman class with valedictorians twice over, but you can't accept all the valedictorians, right?\"\n\nShe continued, \"Colleges are trying to build a cohort, a diverse community with a lot of different kinds of skills.\"\n\nSarah Zhang, who goes to the University of North Carolina, started the Affirmative Action Coalition to bring awareness to the impact that diversity has had on the community.\n\n\"I grew up in a predominantly white community, and my parents are both immigrants,\" Zheng said in an interview. \"But I was often the only person of color in a classroom and that was a really isolating experience for me.\"\n\nShe continued, \"Coming to UNC was such a breath of fresh air, because I could finally hear people who didn't have that perspective I'd grown up with my entire life.\"\n\nHer group is focusing on how to preserve diversity on campuses, including demands to hire and retain more teachers of color.\n\n\"For me to have those role models when I was growing up, that would have been amazing,\" she added.\n\nAyan Kent, a student at Columbia University who is the incoming president of the school's Black Students Organization, says her group is urging higher education institutions to direct more resources to helping students succeed after they're admitted, which can be helpful to maintain a diverse population.\n\n\"It's great that universities are taking steps to make sure that they're admitting a diverse population ... but once you let people in, you can't just be like, 'Ok, now figure it out,'\" she said.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Williams told ABC News. \"Because of the attention that HBCUs are getting around the country, especially since this recent Supreme Court decision, they're anticipating an influx of students considering HBCUs, which is going to put a spotlight on our institutions.\"\n\nDuring the next three years, the number of students enrolled at HBCUs is expected to increase by 90,000, according to the HBCU Transformation Project, a collaboration between TMCF and the United Negro College Fund (UNCF).\n\nThat would be a sizable increase: According to federal government statistics, there were about 287,000 students enrolled at HBCUs in 2021.\n\nStill, some experts also worried there could be added complications for Black students' college plans at the same time HBCUs continue to push for more financial support in order to meet students' goals, given the persistent funding gap between those schools and their predominantly white peer institutions.\n\nNational Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education President Paulette Granbury Russell struck a cautious tone.\n\n\"There's a lot of unknowns here,\" she said, adding, \"The unfortunate part is, we may very well see a decline in students who may otherwise want to opt into an HBCU experience. Affordability is a driving concern for them.\"\n\nDr. Michael L. Lomax, president and CEO of the UNCF, which like the Thurgood Marshall College Fund financially supports HBCU students, believes the Supreme Court decision will harm historically Black schools if there's no way of \"navigating\" through it.\n\nThe affirmative action decision, he said, was \"deeply concerning\" -- and reversed roughly 40 years of precedent -- but was not a surprise.\n\n\"I think it was harmful for Black students who want to attend elite [predominately white] institutions,\" Lomax said. But, he said, \"I think the smart money is on HBCUs. They continue to provide outstanding education for the students who attend them at a lower price, by the way -- about a third less than their comparable white institutions.\"\n\nEnrollment at North Carolina's Saint Augustine's University, a historically Black school, has increased slightly over the past two school years, according to President Christine McPhail.\n\nThough McPhail described the affirmative action ruling as a \"blow,\" she said it was too early to tell how it will impact the recruitment of future students.\n\n\"Saint Augustine's University, from the beginning, was built for you [Black students],\" McPhail said.\n\n\"Our cultures, our values, embrace you. I don't have to pass a diversity, equity, inclusion policy,\" she said. \"I was built on diversity, equity and inclusion for students who had those needs, that wanted to see faculty that look like them, that had similar values with them.\"\n\nDr. Quinton T. Ross Jr., president of Alabama State University, said some HBCUs have already received a boost but said they will also need increased funding to supplement projected enrollment hikes in the years to come.\n\n\"When we talk about an HBCU, we've always been affirmative action,\" Ross, TMCF's 2023 educational leadership award recipient, said. \"We're equal opportunity, and so we welcome all those who seek an opportunity to come to our institutions. Now in terms of, you know, the number of individuals that want to come -- from the HBCU standpoint -- we still suffer from infrastructure issues where we can be able to accommodate those that may want to continue to come.\"\n\nFrench, with Clark Atlanta University, echoed that on ABC News Live this summer. \"When our minorities are turned away from [predominantly white institutions], based on this decision, they will have nowhere to go unless we build the capacity at HBCUs.\"\n\nAt the start of the 2023-2024 school year, TMCF and UNCF received a $124 million gift for the HBCU Transformation Project. Forty HBCUs received money through the project, for resources, infrastructure and financial aid investments.\n\nWilliams said the schools needed the investment \"badly,\" but that gift was only the beginning.\n\nHBCU students like Howard University's Taylor Campbell are helping the next generation. Campbell, a third-year student who said she cried when opening her acceptance letter to Howard in Washington, runs a mentorship program called Bison Buddies.\n\n\"I'm helping them not even with applications but helping them even see that college is an option,\" Campbell told ABC News.\n\n\"They [the students] live down the street from Howard and have never even stepped foot on our campus,\" she said.\n\nCampbell said she is exposing mentees to the benefits of the same HBCU experience she had.\n\n\"The legacy and the core family that you can build ... I don't think that experience can be replicated,\" she said.\n\nWhile the ruling has forced some applicants to mull their options, experts make one critical distinction.\n\n\"HBCUs may absorb a portion of these students, but by no means are HBCUs secondary choices,\" Montague said in his statement.\n\n\"HBCUs produce the most Black doctors, lawyers, teachers and other professionals,\" he said. \"This was true while affirmative action was in place and will remain so after its downfall.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Justices Thomas and Sotomayor, who say they benefitted from affirmative action, divide on its future\n\nIn a rare move, both of them read their opinions from the bench on Thursday.\n\nThis story was originally published on June 12 and has been updated.\n\nThe Supreme Court's most senior conservative, Justice Clarence Thomas , and its most senior liberal, Justice Sonia Sotomayor , both rose from humble beginnings to join the elite ranks of Yale Law School -- and both have publicly credited race-based affirmative action initiatives with helping them get there.\n\nBut both justices staked out starkly opposite positions on whether the policy should be allowed to continue, facing off in a pair of blockbuster cases that were decided on Thursday and sharply limited the use of race in private and public college admissions going forward.\n\nThe court held, in a 6-3 opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts, that Harvard University and the University of North Carolina's admissions programs violate the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. However, the majority decision appears to preserve consideration of race in a narrowly tailored way, as in through an individual applicant's essay or narrative.\n\nWhile the court's conservative wing ruled against affirmative action, the three liberal-leaning justices dissented.\n\nThomas filed a concurring opinion to Roberts' majority ruling. Both he and Sotomayor read their opinions from the bench -- a rare move underlining how strongly each views the issue.\n\n\"While I am painfully aware of the social and economic ravages which have befallen my race and all who suffer discrimination, I hold out enduring hope that this country will live up to its principles so clearly enunciated in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States: that all men are created equal, are equal citizens, and must be treated equally under the law,\" Thomas wrote.\n\nSotomayor, in dissenting, argued the majority was acting with willful ignorance to the discrimination still snaking through the world.\n\n\"Today, this Court stands in the way and rolls back decades of precedent and momentous progress. It holds that race can no longer be used in a limited way in college admissions to achieve such critical benefits. In so holding, the Court cements a superficial rule of colorblindness as a constitutional principle in an endemically segregated society where race has always mattered and continues to matter,\" she wrote. \"The Court subverts the constitutional guarantee of equal protection by further entrenching racial inequality in education, the very foundation of our democratic government and pluralistic society. Because the Court's opinion is not grounded in law or fact and contravenes the vision of equality embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment, I dissent.\"\n\nEarlier this year, ABC News took a close look at Sotomayor and Thomas' views on affirmative action through the years.\n\n\"Even as these people have very similar experiences across the board, the way that they react to them is radically different,\" Leah Wright Rigueur, an associate professor of history at Johns Hopkins University who specializes in race, politics and civil rights, previously said.\n\n\"Both had radicalizing experiences with racism and discrimination, and if it's true that those radicalizing experiences can push someone to the left, then it's also true that those radicalized experiences can push someone to the right,\" she said.\n\nIn many ways, Sotomayor and Thomas' disagreement mirrors public opinion , said Sarah Isgur, an ABC News legal contributor and former Justice Department attorney. \"Their positions are really the epitome of the nuanced argument that we've been having around affirmative action for decades in this country,\" Isgur said.\n\nPolls show a strong majority of Americans both supporting the promotion of diversity on college campuses while also opposing explicit consideration of the race of student applicants.\n\n\"The divide is why states like California and Michigan -- which are not red states -- have banned affirmative action many years ago now,\" Isgur added. \"It's because both sides make compelling points.\"\n\nThomas, the court's only Black man, grew up poor in still-segregated rural Georgia before getting accepted to Yale Law School in 1971.\n\n\"The effort on the part of Yale during my years there was to reach out and open its doors to minorities whom it felt were qualified,\" Thomas testified during his 1991 Senate confirmation hearing, \"and I took them at their word on that, and I have advocated that very kind of affirmative action.\"\n\nJust five years later, Sotomayor, who would become the court's first and only Latina member, tread a similar path to Yale from the Bronx in New York City.\n\n\"[It was] one of the poorest neighborhoods in the United States when I was growing up,\" Sotomayor said last year during a discussion at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation. \"And yet none of those challenges have stopped me reaching where I have, and I attributed all of it to my education.\"\n\nSotomayor has called the use of race in college admissions an extension of the civil rights movement of the 1960s.\n\n\"Schools were saying, 'We're not diverse. We're not giving opportunity to people from different backgrounds. That's important for the society,'\" she said in a 2014 appearance at Yale, discussing the origins of affirmative action.\n\n\"Without affirmative action, I couldn't even have participated in the race of a good education because I didn't even know that there was a race being run,\" Sotomayor said.\n\nIn a series of decisions over 40 years, before Thursday's decision, the Supreme Court had reaffirmed that schools can consider race in deciding which students to accept, endorsing the idea that a richly diverse learning environment on campus benefits all students.\n\n\"The court determined that the law school's use of race as only one factor among many others, with no presumption of admission whatsoever, was appropriate under the circumstances,\" Sotomayor said during her 2009 Senate confirmation hearing.\n\nBut now, the high court's new conservative majority -- led by Thomas -- has changed course.\n\n\"By and large what they're going to say is that race itself cannot be a determinative factor in one's admission because a benefit to one race, quote unquote, is a detriment to another,\" Isgur predicted ahead of the ruling.\n\nThomas has for years been the justice most publicly outspoken against affirmative action.\n\n\"Once again, it's the elites. I mean, they're telling us what we need,\" he lamented of affirmative action programs in an appearance last year at a conservative legal conference.\n\nBut Thomas once seemed to support the necessity of race-conscious programs.\n\n\"I have initiated affirmative programs, I have supported affirmative action programs. Whether or not I agree with all of them, I think, is a matter of record. But the fact that I don't agree with all of them does not mean that I am not a supporter of the underlying effort,\" he testified during his 1991 Senate confirmation hearings.\n\nAs the only Black student in his boarding school seminary class, Thomas was later encouraged to apply to the College of the Holy Cross in 1968 and given a scholarship for racial minorities.\n\n\"I don't think anyone who was a beneficiary of that, of those programs or that action, should apologize for it,\" said Vincent Rougeau, president of Holy Cross and the school's first lay and first Black leader.\n\n\"Clarence Thomas was a great student here. I mean, he was highly admired and respected,\" Rougeau said, \"and I have the deepest respect for his accomplishments and for his work at Holy Cross in terms of fighting for racial justice here.\"\n\nThomas graduated with honors in the top 2% of his class, going on to Yale Law School at the same time it was openly recruiting more minority students.\n\n\"There's a real pressure on us to be in boxes, and I would not be kept in a box during segregation, and I don't like boxes now,\" Thomas told ABC News in a 2007 interview. \"I think that's quite unfortunate. I wasn't raised that way. I was raised trying to get out of them.\"\n\nLooking back on his experience, Thomas now calls affirmative action paternalistic -- criticizing it in his dissents as a \"faddish theory\" that stigmatizes minorities, even if it extends an opportunity.\n\n\"One of the things that would happen when I was nominated to the court [was that people would assume] that I couldn't possibly be as good as the white Yale graduates, because I obviously went to Yale because of the color of my skin,\" he said in 2007.\n\n\"He's saying that affirmative action hurt him overall, and that as the only Black member of the court, he's an important and unique voice on that front,\" Isgur said.\n\nSome of Thomas' critics see hypocrisy.\n\n\"That's an absolutely fair criticism. He'd argue that he's evolved, that his thinking has changed. And we do know, particularly when it comes to affirmative action, that people's opinions change all the time,\" said Rigueur.\n\n\"What I do see, however, somebody like Justice Clarence Thomas ... is deeply cynical about the process. Justice Sotomayor takes a very different approach,\" she said.\n\nSotomayor, who has publicly praised Thomas as a colleague and friend, described their difference of opinion as philosophical and foundational.\n\n\"It's between the image of the person who pulls themselves up by the bootstraps and the person who believes that you need a lift to get you up sometimes,\" she said at the Aspen Institute in 2017.\n\nThe contrast was on full display during oral arguments last year in the pair of cases that pit Harvard and UNC -- which consider race in admissions -- against a group of Asian American student challengers led by conservative legal activist Edward Blum.\n\n\"These two cases are about the restoration of the founding principles of our civil rights movement,\" said Blum, founder of the group Students for Fair Admissions, which brought the suits. \"Those principles are: A student's race or ethnicity should not be used to help him or harm him in his chances of gaining admission to a competitive college.\"\n\nBefore Thursday's ruling, the schools said alternatives to affirmative action, such as a focus on socioeconomic status, simply aren't as effective and that if the court struck down the practice, it would mean fewer minorities on campuses nationwide.\n\nIn a statement after the Supreme Court decision, UNC Chancellor Kevin Guskiewicz said, in part, that the school \"remains firmly committed to bringing together talented students with different perspectives and life experiences and continues to make an affordable, high-quality education accessible to the people of North Carolina and beyond.\"\n\nFordham University President Tania Tetlow said in an interview last year: \"We would like to match the demographics of this generation as best we can because when we're not doing that, we know we're just missing talent,\"\n\nIn the most recent Supreme Court decision to uphold affirmative action, from 2003, then-Justice Sandra Day O'Connor famously predicted that in 25 years \"the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary\" in America.\n\nSotomayor has said she agrees that affirmative action can't be used forever, but told ABC News in 2014, \"You got to find other ways to improve the selection process, but we haven't found those ways just yet.\"\n\nFor his part, Thomas insists the program never should have been allowed to begin with. \"Show me in the Constitution where you get a right to separate citizens based on race,\" he said in a 2020 documentary, \"Created Equal.\"\n\n\"What we've become comfortable with is thinking there is some good discrimination and some bad discrimination. Well, who gets to determine that?\" Thomas said.\n\nBoth justices share a belief in equality and the power of education, but both are now deeply divided on the law and the future of affirmative action in America.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Mixed results in college admissions diversity post-SCOTUS affirmative action decision\n\nColleges have seen mixed results after high court limited affirmative action.\n\nColleges and universities are seeing mixed results in the diversity of their incoming freshman classes after the Supreme Court set new limits on the use of affirmative action in college admissions.\n\nFor example, the Yale University class of 2028 saw no difference from the class of 2027 when it came to the percentage of African American students and Native American students. The Hispanic/Latino and International student populations remained roughly the same, dropping and rising, respectively, by 1%. However, the Asian American population dropped by 6%, the white population rose by 4%.\n\nWhen comparing Massachusetts Institute of Technology's class of 2027 to 2028, the Black population dropped from 15% to 5%, the Hispanic/Latino population dropped from 16% to 11%, and the white population decreased by 1%.\n\nThe Asian American population increased from 40% to 47% and both the American Indian/Alaskan Native and international populations increased by 1%.\n\nAffirmative action policies allowed institutions to take into account an individual student's race or ethnicity as one factor of many during the college admissions selection process. It rose to popularity in the 1960s to address racial inequities in access to higher education.\n\nResearchers previously told ABC News that societal injustices - such as economic inequality, segregation and academic inequity in K-12 schools - as well as the lasting impact of historical exclusion from colleges and universities against Black and brown students have led to the continued underrepresentation in four-year institutions.\n\nA landmark Supreme Court ruling in 1978 - in the case of Regents of the University of California v. Bakke - cemented affirmative action policies in college and university admissions for decades and led to an increase in diversity on campuses.\n\nHowever, the 2023 decision by the Supreme Court sided in part with Students for Fair Admissions, a conservative group that challenged race-related admissions policies. Members argued that the affirmative action policies at the schools were discriminatory against white and Asian students.\n\nNow, as a new class of students head back to campus, many are looking at how schools might feel the impact of the required policy change.\n\nHere's a look at the difference in student diversity at several other institutions that have published their class breakdown:\n\nThe University of North Carolina, which was at the center of the Supreme Court case, saw slight differences in its incoming class diversity.\n\nThe percentage of Asian or Asian American students make up 25.8% of the class of 2024, growing by .8% from last year. The white student population also grew by .8%, making up 63.8% of the class.\n\nThe Black student population comprised a smaller portion of the incoming class, decreasing from 11% last year to 7.8% this year. The Hispanic and American Indian/Alaska Native portions both dropped by .9%.\n\n\"t's really too soon to know if that's a pattern or a 1-year change,\" said Rachelle Feldman, the vice provost of enrollment at UNC-Chapel Hill, in a press conference on Thursday.\n\n\"I just really wanted to emphasize that at Chapel Hill we're following the law in every way in our admissions process, but we also take very seriously our service to the state and trying to reach students and applicants in all 100 counties, and make sure that anyone from any background within North Carolina or beyond that earns their way here finds it truly affordable, and finds themselves welcomed and supported and able to thrive.\"\n\nPrinceton University saw a decrease in its Asian population and International incoming populations, both of which dropped by about 2%. The Black or African American incoming population saw a .1% dip, and the Hispanic/Latino population saw a 1% dip.\n\nHowever, at least 7.7% of the class' racial or ethnic identity is unknown. Princeton did not publish the percentage of white students in its class of 2027, but noted that 31.3% of students in the class of 2028 are white.\n\nAmherst College in Massachusetts reported larger drops in the Black and Latinx incoming student population. The incoming Black student population decreased from 19% to 9% and the Latinx population decreased from 14% to 10%, the American Indian or Alaska Native incoming population dropped by 1%.\n\nThe percentage of white students rose by 2% and the Asian student percentage increased by 1%.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

The recent lawsuit challenging an apprenticeship program designed to expand opportunities for people of color is likely to give us more data. And although many in the civil-rights community are understandably wary, I think there's a fair chance the program survives the challenge. If it doesn't, we'll wind up with a peculiarly unpleasant chicken-and-egg problem.\n\nThe suit was filed against Meta Platforms Inc. and two other defendants on behalf of James Harker, an experienced lighting technician who claims that he's been denied an opportunity to work on a commercial because he is White. In particular, he alleges that the \"Double the Line\"  minority apprenticeship program violates his rights against employment discrimination. Under DTL, as it is known, the producer who is shooting a commercial agrees to select a member of a racial minority for a short-term paid post learning alongside the crew member who already has a budget line; hence the name of the program."

In an age when battles over immigrant family separation, abortion rights, police reform and other important issues have captivated the nation, the issue of who gets into Harvard can seem trivial. Furthermore, even if elite private universities have an admissions process that is less than perfectly meritocratic, the fact that these schools admit so few students in the first place, and funnel so many of them into jobs of questionable social value , means that the nationwide economic consequences of the lawsuit's outcome may be slim to none.\n\nBut the true stakes are actually rather high, because the case will probably determine the future of affirmative-action policies throughout the U.S. Edward Blum , the leader of the group suing on behalf of Asian applicants, is a longtime opponent of all racial-admissions preferences. If the court orders Harvard to evaluate Asians and whites purely on merit - based on things like test scores, grade-point averages and extracurricular activities, but not on subjective assessments of applicants' personalities - it will establish a legal precedent that will then be invoked to attack preferences in favor of blacks, Hispanics and other minorities."

For example, students might be asked how they would contribute to campus diversity in their personal statements.

Yes, it will have to,\" says Danielle Ren Holley, the incoming president of Mount Holyoke College. \"It's a complex process, and this decision will make it even more complex.\""

And with Justice Neil Gorsuch in place and the possibility that Kennedy might retire in the next few years, the challenge could succeed. The legal reality is that higher ed affirmative action is now vulnerable.\n\nThe sense of security that followed Kennedy's June 2016 opinion in Fisher v. Texas was a false one. Along with Kennedy's liberal vote the same term in an important abortion case, Whole Women's Health v. Hellerstedt , the affirmative-action decision seemed like Kennedy's attempt to cement his liberal legacy. Given that most observers expected Democrat Hillary Clinton to be elected president, Kennedy's legacy was expected to remain intact when she nominated successor justices to Antonin Scalia and eventually to Kennedy himself."

      "text": "What is affirmative action? History behind race-based college admissions practices the Supreme Court overruled\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nJune 29, 2023 / 5:07 PM EDT / CBS News\n\nThe United States Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that affirmative action programs at Harvard College and the University of North Carolina are unconstitutional, finding in two majority opinions authored by Chief Justice John Roberts that race-conscious policies, which are used in admissions offices to increase diversity on campuses and broaden access to educational opportunity, violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.\n\nRoberts concluded that candidates applying as hopeful students to higher education institutions need to be evaluated based on their experiences \"as an individual - not on the basis of race.\"\n\n\"Many universities have for too long done just the opposite,\" Roberts wrote. \"And in doing so, they have concluded, wrongly, that the touchstone of an individual's identity is not challenges bested, skills built, or lessons learned but the color of their skin. Our constitutional history does not tolerate that choice.\"\n\nProponents of affirmative action , including the justices who did not vote with the majority in the Harvard and University of North Carolina cases, have expressed fears that doing away with affirmative action policies will lead to a substantial decrease in representation of Black and Hispanic students at higher education institutions, especially elite schools.\n\nIn the dissenting opinion in the Harvard case, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the majority opinion is \"not grounded in law or fact and contravenes the vision of equality embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment,\" and argued that the decision \"subverts the constitutional guarantee of equal protection by further entrenching racial inequality in education, the very foundation of our democratic government and pluralistic society.\"\n\nAffirmative action refers to any set of policies in place to ensure equal opportunity and prevent discrimination based on a broad range of identities, including race, sex, gender, religion, national origin and disability. Originally introduced on a large scale in the 1960s to address racial discrimination, affirmative action policies typically appear in employment and education contexts.\n\nThey are most often discussed in relation to college admissions decisions in the United States, since a number of schools have established protocols that aim to increase the diversity of their student bodies by considering applicants' race. Affirmative action programs with similar goals exist in hiring processes across governments and individual businesses.\n\n\"The purpose of affirmative action is to ensure equal employment opportunities for applicants and employees. It is based on the premise that, absent discrimination, over time a contractor's workforce generally will reflect the demographics of the qualified available workforce in the relevant job market,\" the U.S. Department of Labor writes in a \"frequently asked questions\" page on its website with guidelines for federal contractors.\n\nThe description goes on to note that affirmative action requirements are meant to ensure that applicants -in this case, for employment, although the same idea applies for college acceptance- have equal opportunities \"for recruitment, selection, advancement, and every other term and privilege associated with employment, without regard to their race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, or status as a protected veteran.\"\n\nSupporters of affirmative action programs in higher education say they are important because they allow for holistic evaluation of potential candidates and ensure underrepresented groups have equal access to those institutions. As proponents note, the programs have a documented track record of increasing diversity in schools. But, for decades, critics have argued against the practice, suggesting it could be likened to racial discrimination against people who are not part of minority groups.\n\nThe first major affirmative action policy in the United States came in September 1965, when then-President Lyndon B. Johnson issued Executive Order 11246, which prohibited employment discrimination based on race, color, religion and national origin by organizations that received federal contracts and subcontracts. But it was a 2003 decision by the Supreme Court, known as Grutter v. Bollinger, that established a national precedent allowing schools to consider race when making admissions decisions.\n\nIn that ruling, the court found that affirmative action policies used in University of Michigan Law School admissions did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. Delivering the court's 5-4 opinion, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote that \"in the context of its individualized inquiry into the possible diversity contributions of all applicants, the Law School's race-conscious admissions program does not unduly harm nonminority applicants.\"\n\nNine states -Arizona, California, Florida, Idaho, Michigan, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oklahoma and Washington- have previously banned affirmative action policies at public universities. Cases that went before the Supreme Court this term involved higher education institutions based in Massachusetts and North Carolina, specifically Harvard University, the country's oldest private institution, and the University of North Carolina, the country's oldest public university.\n\nThe group Students for Fair Admissions, founded by Ed Blum, a conservative activist whose career has focused on eliminating racial preferences in various settings, brought two cases in November 2014 that respectively targeted affirmative action policies at Harvard and the University of North Carolina.\n\nThe case against Harvard alleged that the school's policies violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits racial discrimination in any program that receives federal funds, and claimed it discriminates against applicants who are Asian-American. In the University of North Carolina case, Students for Fair Admissions alleged that the school's affirmative action policies violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.\n\nMore than 40% of American universities, and 60% of selective schools, consider race to some extent when making admissions decisions, according to documents that Harvard filed in court. The Biden administration has also said that both the U.S. military and the federal government have relied on some of the Supreme Court's earlier decisions acknowledging that the benefits of diversity in education settings to justify limited consideration of race.\n\nResponding to the affirmative action ruling on Thursday, Kevin Guskiewicz, chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said in a statement that the school \"will carefully review the Supreme Court's decision and take any steps necessary to comply with the law,\" acknowledging that it was \"not the outcome we hoped for.\"\n\n\"Carolina remains firmly committed to bringing together talented students with different perspectives and life experiences and continues to make an affordable, high-quality education accessible to the people of North Carolina and beyond,\" Guskiewicz said.\n\nOfficials at Harvard emphasized the university's commitment to having a diverse student body in a separate statement, addressed to members of the Harvard community.\n\n\"For almost a decade, Harvard has vigorously defended an admissions system that, as two federal courts ruled, fully complied with longstanding precedent,\" school leaders wrote after the Supreme Court's decision. \"In the weeks and months ahead, drawing on the talent and expertise of our Harvard community, we will determine how to preserve, consistent with the Court's new precedent, our essential values.\"\n\nAlthough the majority opinion delivered by Roberts Thursday did not expressly overturn the Supreme Court's precedent allowing schools to consider race in admissions, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a concurring opinion that the 2003 Grutter v. Bollinger ruling was \"for all intents and purposes, overruled\" by the latest decision. Meanwhile, in the dissent, Stotomayor condemned the court's conservative majority for \"overruling decades of precedent.\"\n\nExactly how the impacts of the affirmative action decision will play out at different universities, and what the domino effect will look like, remains to be seen.\n\nRoberts' opinion said universities could still consider \"an applicant's discussion of how race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration, or otherwise\" when making admissions decisions, while military academies would be effectively exempt from the new ruling \"in light of the potentially distinct interests that military academies may present.\"\n\nSharp dissents respectively penned by Sotomayor and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman on the Supreme Court, warned of potentially catastrophic consequences to higher education as a result of the decision.\n\n\"Today, this Court stands in the way and rolls back decades of precedent and momentous progress. It holds that race can no longer be used in a limited way in college admissions to achieve such critical benefits,\" wrote Sotomayor in the dissenting opinion on the Harvard case. \"In so holding, the Court cements a superficial rule of colorblindness as a constitutional principle in an endemically segregated society where race has always mattered and continues to matter.\"\n\nIn her dissent in the North Carolina case, Jackson wrote, \"the race-blind admissions stance the Court mandates from this day forward is unmoored from critical real-life circumstances.\"\n\n\"Thus, the Court's meddling not only arrests the noble generational project that America's universities are attempting, it also launches, in effect, a dismally misinformed sociological experiment,\" she added.\n\nEmily Mae Czachor is a news editor at CBSNews.com.

      "text": "Opponents, supporters of affirmative action on whether college admissions can be truly colorblind\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nJune 4, 2023 / 9:13 AM EDT / CBS News\n\nEdward Blum, of Tallahassee, Fla., is not a lawyer; he retired from a job in finance. But he is founder and president of Students for Fair Admissions , a group he acknowledges starting to challenge higher education affirmative action policies in court. \"The equal rights provision of our 14th Amendment basically gets to the point that people should not be treated differently because of their race or ethnicity,\" said Blum.\n\nHe also argues that affirmative action violates the 1964 Civil Rights Act. \"The opportunities must be the same, regardless of your race or ethnicity,\" he said.\n\nAffirmative action has helped boost the number of Black, Latinx and other minorities who are under-represented at prestigious schools. But now those racial preferences may be prohibited, in large part due to Blum's efforts. The Supreme Court is now considering cases he brought targeting affirmative action at the University of North Carolina (the nation's oldest public university) and Harvard (the oldest private college).\n\nBlum said his group has 22,000 members, but none is identified by name in either court case. \"Well, in the world of social media, it is no surprise that 17- and 18-year-old kids do not want their names made public,\" he said.\n\nBlum has previously spearheaded two cases in which the Supreme Court struck down voting polices designed to help racial groups (particularly African Americans and Hispanics) that have endured prior discrimination. But he lost a 2016 case in which he backed Abigail Fisher, who unsuccessfully challenged racial consideration in admissions at the University of Texas .\n\nBut today's Supreme Court is far more conservative.\n\nBraver asked, \"Were you just determined to keep bringing cases until you got the court to agree with you?\"\n\n\"Legal advocacy requires a long-term commitment,\" Blum replied.\n\nThere are, in fact, nine states that have enacted bans on racial preferences in state colleges, with some reporting a drop in African American and Latinx admissions at top institutions.\n\nAffirmative action advocates say a nationwide ban would be disastrous.\n\nMitchell Crusto, a professor at Loyola University New Orleans College of Law , said, \"Affirmative action is really trying to treat everyone equally, recognizing that certain groups have been marginalized over the centuries.\"\n\nCrusto grew up in segregated Louisiana: \"Most of the restaurants in town did not serve Black people,\" he said. \"Water fountains were segregated, so there was a white-only and a Black-only water fountain. The Woolworth's department store, you could not have counter service if you were Black.\"\n\nHe is a descendant of generations of enslaved people, and forebears who faced prejudice after emancipation. \"A lot of the legacy of discrimination - in housing, in employment - meant that my family was set back century after century,\" he said.\n\nEven after the Supreme Court mandated school desegregation, most of Crusto's schooling was in segregated Catholic schools in New Orleans. He was a top student, and also, he acknowledges, an affirmative action beneficiary in 1971.\n\nBraver asked, \"You knew when you applied to Yale that they were in interested in you not just as a student, but because they wanted to bring in more African American students?\"\n\n\"Absolutely, absolutely,\" he replied, pointing out, \"Race is just one aspect. I wasn't accepted to Yale because I'm Black. I was accepted into Yale because of all the other things that I am as a person, of which I'm also African American.\"\n\nCrusto graduated magna cum laude from Yale College, and was admitted to Yale Law School.\n\nHe argues that the Supreme Court should uphold its previous rulings that colleges have a genuine interest in including students from different racial groups: \"For all students who are at a university, having a diverse campus of individuals with different backgrounds adds to the educational goal of the university,\" he said.\n\nFor his part, Edward Blum, a descendant of Holocaust survivors, contends that when colleges have considered ethnic backgrounds of applicants, it has hurt certain groups: \"Back in the 1920s, it's well documented by dozens of historians that Harvard had policies in place to discriminate against Jews,\" he said. \"Fast forward now to the 1990s and 2000s, we believe that Harvard has policies that diminish the likelihood that high-achieving Asians are being admitted.\"\n\nIn fact, Harvard recently announced that nearly 30% of those admitted this year are Asian-American, more than four times the representation in the total U.S. population.\n\nStill, some Asian Americans are taking a stand against affirmative action plans that tend to help other minorities.\n\nRutvij Holay, whose parents were born in India, is the founder of the Americans for Equality Political Action Committee . He said, \"Even if tomorrow they give preference to Asians, I'll be just as opposed, because the idea is that ideally we should all be treated equally, and there really should be a level playing field for all of us.\"\n\nA straight-A student in Irvine Calif., Holay was just admitted to one of the nation's top schools: Stanford University. But he also applied to Ivy League schools. \"I applied to all of them except for Harvard,\" he said.\n\nAnd did he get into any of them? \"Nope.\"\n\nBraver asked, \"Do you have a feeling that maybe racial preferences might have had something to do with that?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"Look, I look at the data, right? I'm not going off of a feeling, because the college admission process has been very good for me. But I think everyone has to acknowledge that there is a level of discrimination that occurs.\"\n\nChelsea Wang, a Harvard sophomore, is co-president of the Harvard-Radcliffe Asian American Association . She participated in a pro-affirmative action demonstration before the Supreme Court heard arguments on the cases last fall. There was also an Asian American anti -affirmative action demonstration, underscoring how divisive the issue is among Americans, of all races.\n\nWang said, \"I think this case has the potential to really pit Asian Americans against other minorities.  And I don't want that to happen. I think we should all, you know, understand, like, what other people have gone through and support them.\"\n\nWang argues that it is a question of basic fairness. \"You know what? I wish we didn't have to have affirmative action,\" she said. \"I think we have to have it, because all of the different, compounding forms of inequality that affect someone's life before they even apply for college, call for something that accounts for those factors.\"\n\nStill, Edward Blum believes there are other ways to get a diverse student body.\n\nBraver asked him, \"This is not news to you that some people think your actions over the years have showed that you're racist or bigoted in some way. How do you respond to that?\"\n\n\"I think that's an easy, sort of intellectually lazy way of making an argument,\" Blum replied. \"Let's have a debate about the policy.\"\n\n\"If these policies go away, will it not just advantage Asian American applicants, but maybe also white applicants?\"\n\n\"It's unclear who this is going to advantage,\" said Blum. \"It's going to be up to Harvard, it's going to be up to UNC to change their policies to make them, first, colorblind ... that's the goal. Make them colorblind.\"\n\nBut with many legal experts predicting that the Supreme Court will strike down affirmative action, advocates like law professor Mitchell Crusto are worried that decades of progress for underserved minorities will be set back: \"If the Supreme Court decides to ban the use of race, I think they'll go down in history as being one of the most conservative, reactionary, white supremacist Supreme Courts that we've ever seen,\" he said.\n\nFor more info:\n\nStory produced by Ed Forgotson and Robert Marston.

      "text": "Group behind Supreme Court affirmative action cases files lawsuit against West Point over admissions policies\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nSeptember 20, 2023 / 10:35 AM EDT / CBS News\n\nWashington - The anti-affirmative action group behind the pair of cases that led the Supreme Court to strike down race-conscious admissions programs at higher-education institutions has filed a lawsuit against West Point, arguing the service academy unlawfully discriminates against applicants on the basis of race through its admissions policy.\n\nFiled in federal district court in White Plains, New York, on Tuesday, the lawsuit from organization Students for Fair Admissions claims that West Point focuses on race when admitting future cadets and engages in racial balancing to meet benchmarks for the portion of African American, Hispanic and Asian students that make up each incoming class. The academy's use of racial classifications is unconstitutional, the group said, and should be declared unlawful.\n\nStudents for Fair Admissions is asking the court to prohibit West Point from \"considering or knowing applicants' race\" when making decisions about admissions.\n\n\"West Point has no justification for using race-based admissions,\" the group said in its complaint. \"Those admissions are unconstitutional for all other public institutions of higher education. The Academy is not exempt from the Constitution.\"\n\nThe U.S. Military Academy's public affairs office said it \"does not comment on pending litigation.\"\n\nThe group said its membership includes two White students who are \"ready and able\" to apply to West Point, one this fall and the other in 2025. The first student is a high school senior in the upper Midwest who is identified as \"Member A,\" and the second, identified as \"Member B,\" is a high school student in the Southeast.\n\nThe two students wish to remain anonymous because they fear reprisal from West Point and others if their participation in the lawsuit becomes public, according to the filing.\n\nStudents for Fair Admissions argued that unless West Point is ordered to stop using race as a factor in admissions, the race of members A and B will prevent them \"from competing for admission on an equal footing.\"\n\n\"If West Point is allowed to continue making admissions decisions based on applicants' race, SFFA's members - including Members A and B and other similarly-situated applicants - will suffer harm because they will be denied the opportunity to compete for a West Point appointment on equal grounds, solely because of their race,\" the group claimed.\n\nThe lawsuit states that West Point's purported racial preferences come into play during the second stage of its admissions process, after applicants have passed medical and physical-fitness tests and secured a nomination from a member of Congress, the vice president or president. While West Point has said racial diversity provides educational and military benefits, Students for Fair Admissions argues the academy can achieve a diverse student body through race-neutral means.\n\n\"West Point's status as a military academy does not mean that courts must defer to its conclusory assertions that it needs to employ racial preferences, let alone diminish\" constitutional violations, the group claimed.\n\nStudents for Fair Admissions' challenge to West Point's admissions policies is not unexpected - the organization indicated it was turning its attention to the service academy in August, when it launched a website called \"West Point Not Fair\" that sought information from prospective or unsuccessful applicants to the service academies.\n\nThe call for potential plaintiffs came on the heels of the Supreme Court's June decision that said colleges and universities could not consider race as a factor in admissions, bringing an end to affirmative action in higher education. The landmark ruling stemmed from two challenges to the race-conscious admissions programs at Harvard College and the University of North Carolina brought by Students for Fair Admissions\n\nIn the majority opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts, the court's conservative majority said race-conscious admissions policies could not be reconciled with the Constitution. The programs from Harvard and the University of North Carolina used race in a negative manner and lacked meaningful endpoints, the court found.\n\nIn a footnote, Roberts singled out the military academies and effectively exempted them from the Supreme Court's ruling, noting that the \"propriety of race-based admissions systems\" was not addressed in the context of the military academies.\n\nMelissa Quinn is a politics reporter for CBSNews.com.

That's when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in its landmark case on affirmative action, barring colleges from taking race into consideration as a factor in admission decisions.\n\nThe ruling struck down more than 50 years of legal precedent, creating newfound uncertainty for the first class of college applicants to be shaped by the decision - especially for Black and Hispanic students hoping to get into highly competitive colleges that once sought them out.\n\nIt also places the Rodriguez sisters on opposite sides of history: Ashley applied to college when schools in many states could still consider race, while Emily can expect no such advantage.\n\nTheir parents, Margarita Lopez, 38, and Rafael Rodriguez, 42, are immigrants from Mexico who moved to the United States as teenagers.\n\nAshley is the first in her family to attend college, a freshman studying child psychology on a full scholarship to prestigious Oxford College of Emory University, where annual estimated costs approached $80,000 this year.\n\nEmily is the middle daughter, a senior and mostly straight-A student at Conrad Schools of Science in Wilmington who wants to become a veterinarian, and who spent most of this fall anxiously awaiting word from her first-choice college, Cornell University.\n\nThe impact of the court's decision on enrollment at hundreds of selective colleges and universities won't start to become clear until colleges send out offers this spring and release final acceptance figures.\n\nBut many students, counselors and families view this admission cycle as the first test of whether colleges will become less diverse going forward, while cautioning it may take years before a clear pattern emerges. The Hechinger Report contacted more than 40 selective colleges and universities asking for the racial breakdown of those who applied for early decision and were accepted this year.\n\nAbout half the institutions responded and none provided the requested information. Several said that they would not have such data available even internally until after the admissions cycle wraps up next year. Some have cited advice from legal counsel in declining to release the racial and ethnic composition for the class of 2028.\n\nFor the Rodriguez family, higher education has already become a symbol of upward mobility, a life-altering path to meaningful careers and the sort of financial stability that Margarita and Rafael have never known.\n\nCollege wasn't a part of their culture, and before last year Rafael and Margarita had no idea how complicated and competitive the landscape would be for their bright, hardworking daughters. Of all U.S. racial or ethnic groups, Hispanic Americans are the least likely to hold a college degree.\n\n\"I never even dreamed about a place like Emory, or about all the schools that have really good financial aid,\" Margarita said recently. She wouldn't have looked beyond the local community college and state universities for her daughters if she hadn't learned about TeenSHARP, a nonprofit that prepares high-performing students from underrepresented backgrounds for higher education.\n\nShe immediately signed up Ashley, and later, Emily.\n\nTeenSHARP co-founder Atnre Alleyne, with his wife, Tatiana Poladko, and team of advisers, guided Ashley and Emily through their high school course selection and college essays, while pointing out leadership opportunities and colleges with good track records of offering scholarships.\n\nRelated: College advisors vow to kick the door open for Black and Hispanic students despite affirmative action ruling\n\nEmory is one. The school admitted no Black students until 1963, but has aggressively recruited students from underrepresented backgrounds in recent years. Hispanic enrollment had been growing before the Supreme Court's decision, from 7.5 percent in 2017 to 9.2 percent in 2021. Ashley's class at Oxford is 15 percent Hispanic.\n\n\"I felt like I was right at home here,\" Ashley said, shortly after arriving in August. The entire Rodriguez family dropped her off and stayed for a few days until she was settled. \"It felt very homey to me,\" she said. \"Everybody is so welcoming.\"\n\nStill, Ashley worried about her grades as she adjusted to her new workload. She fielded constant texts and calls from her family, who were adjusting to having her away from home for the first time.\n\nEmily missed her sister terribly - together they'd started their high school's club for first-generation scholars, helping others navigate college choices. \"She has the brain and I like to talk,\" Emily joked.\n\nThis fall, Emily set her sights on some of the most selective colleges in the country, many of which had terrible track records on diversity even before the Supreme Court's decision. She approached her search knowing that she was unlikely to get any boost based on her ethnicity.\n\nThat makes her angry.\n\n\"We have so much history behind us as people of color,\" Emily said. \"So why would we be put at the same level as somebody whose family has benefited off of the harm done to communities of color?\"\n\nEmily also knew she would need a hefty scholarship to attend one of her dream schools; her family can't afford the tuition, and they've been loath to saddle their daughters with loans.\n\nElite schools like those on Ashley and Emily's lists are more likely to be filled with wealthy students : Families from the top 0.1 percent are more than twice as likely to get in as other applicants with the same test scores. But such schools also offer the most generous scholarship and aid packages, and Emily and Ashley believed they presented the best shot at a different life from their parents'.\n\n\"Ever since I was little, I knew that college was the ticket to break this cycle our family has been in for generations and generations, of not knowing, of not being educated,\" Emily said. \"And because of that, having to work with their backs instead of their brains.\"\n\nThat the Rodriguez sisters could even consider top-tier colleges is a credit to their mother.\n\n\"I want them to have the opportunity I never had,\" Margarita said. \"I know that life after education will be easier for them. I don't want them to be working 12, 14 hours like their dad did.\"\n\nRafael Rodriguez has always worked: first, with livestock as a child in central Mexico and later, in Florida, on an orange farm until the age of 15, with a residential permit. His earnings went toward helping the rest of the family come to the United States and settle in West Grove, Pennsylvania.\n\nRafael didn't attend high school because he had to help support his parents and sisters. He now owns a trucking company.\n\nMargarita desperately wanted to go to college, but said her mother did not believe in taking out loans for higher education and refused to sign her financial aid forms.\n\nInstead, she married Rafael a few days after graduating from high school and had Ashley a year later. Emily was born 17 months later. Margarita was thinking of enrolling in community college until Brianna came along six years later. She now helps Rafael with his trucking business while working as a translator.\n\nBoth sisters are keenly aware of the gulf between their lives and their mom's. In her college essay, Ashley described being \"a daughter of two immigrant parents who undertook a dangerous journey from their native Guanajuato, Mexico, to America.\"\n\nEmily wrote about how Margarita had violated \"every norm of our Mexican community, allowing me to sacrifice my time with family on weekends and in the summer\" to attend Saturday leadership trainings with TeenSHARP, as well as college-level courses in epidemiology and health sciences at Brown, Cornell and the University of Delaware.\n\nRelated: Colleges decry Supreme Court decision on affirmative action, but most have terrible track records on diversity\n\nThe pressure Emily feels is both formidable and familiar to the immigrant experience, magnified by the divisive court decision.\n\nHamza Parker, a senior at Smyrna High School in Delaware, feels it as well. He was at first unsure of whether or not to write about race in his essay, a debate many students have been having.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote in his majority decision that race could be invoked only within the context of the applicant's life story, leaving it up to students to decide if they would use their essays to discuss their race.\n\nMeanwhile, conservative activist Edward Blum , who helped bring the case before the court, has threatened more lawsuits and said he would challenge essays \"used to ascertain or provide a benefit based on the applicant's race.\"\n\nHamza wavered at first, then rewrote his essay to describe his family's move to the United States from Saudi Arabia in sixth grade and the racism he subsequently experienced. He applied early decision to Union College in upstate New York; earlier this month, he learned via email that he did not get in.\n\nNeither Hamza nor his father, Timothy Parker, an engineer, know why, or what role affirmative action played in Union's decision: Rejections never come with explanations.\n\nParker hopes his son will now consider an HBCU like the one he attended, Hampton University, in Virginia. He worries that if Hamza ends up at a school where he is clearly in the minority, he could be made to feel as though he doesn't belong.\n\nRelated: Beyond the Rankings: College Welcome Guide\n\n\"I'm letting it be his choice,\" Parker said, noting that Hamza might also feel more comfortable at an HBCU given the nation's divisive political climate. With the end of affirmative action, he added, \"It feels like we are going backwards not forward.\"\n\nHBCUs are becoming more competitive after the court's decision. Chelsea Holley, director of admissions at Spelman College in Atlanta, said Black high schoolers may be choosing HBCUs because they fear further assaults on diversity and inclusion and believe they'll feel more comfortable on predominantly Black campuses.\n\nParker is now finishing his applications to Denison University, the University of Maryland, the University of Delaware, and Carleton College. He's not sure if Hampton will be on his list.\n\nAlleyne, Hamza's adviser, said that while they will never know if the court's decision had any impact on Hamza's rejection from Union, he's concerned about what it portends for other TeenSHARP seniors.\n\n\"There are so many factors at play with every application,\" Alleyne said. \"We definitely feel that this year, the window is narrower for students whose GPA does not tell the full story of their brilliance and the challenges they've overcome.\"\n\nAlleyne is also concerned that scholarships once available for students like Parker are disappearing. Some of the race-based scholarships his students applied for in past years are no longer listed on college websites, he said.\n\nAt the same time, there are plenty who believe that the court's decision was a much-needed correction, including Richard Kahlenberg, an author and scholar at Georgetown University who testified in the case. He argues that the ban will lead to a fairer landscape for low-income students for all races.\n\nKahlenberg is in favor of using affirmative action based on class instead of race. \"I don't think it's a bad thing if poor whites now benefit from affirmative action,\" Kahlenberg said.\n\nRelated: A poster child for protesting affirmative action now says he never meant for it to be abolished\n\nFor the Rodriguez family, Cornell's early decision announcement was long anticipated, to be marked on the magnetic calendar attached to their refrigerator as soon as they knew it. Ashley would be home from Emory for winter break and would hear the news alongside her sister.\n\nFor weeks, the family had prepared themselves for bad news: Cornell had announced it was limiting the number of students it would accept early decision, in what the university said was \"an effort to increase equity in the admissions process.\"\n\nStill, Emily had spent a summer studying at Cornell and gotten to know some faculty and advisers there. She had fallen in love with the animal science program, and the lively upstate New York college town of Ithaca, set amid stunning gorges and waterfalls.\n\n\"Let's go, let's go!\" Rafael said as they huddled together in front of Emily's laptop. Emily wore a white t-shirt with \"Cornell\" emblazoned in bold red letters on the front, for good luck. She wavered, then clicked.\n\n\"Congratulations, you have been admitted to the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences: College major: Animal Science at Cornell University for the fall of 2024. Welcome to the Cornell community!\" said the email on her screen, adorned with red confetti. Annual estimated costs for next year would be $92,682 - but Cornell pledged to meet all of it.\n\nEmily screamed, and the room erupted in cheers. Every member of the family began sobbing. Cinnamon, the family's three-year-old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, barked wildly.\n\nEmily jumped up and down. \"Ivy League!\" she shouted. \"Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. I did it.\"\n\nBrianna, a sixth grader who will work with TeenSHARP once she's in high school, hugged both of her sisters.\n\nIt will be her turn next.\n\nAdditional reporting was contributed by Sarah Butrymowicz.\n\nThis story about the end of affirmative action is the second in a series of articles accompanying a documentary produced by The Hechinger Report in partnership with Soledad O'Brien Productions , about the impact of the Supreme Court ruling on race-based affirmative action.

      "text": "Opponents, supporters of affirmative action on whether college admissions can be truly colorblind\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nJune 4, 2023 / 9:13 AM EDT / CBS News\n\nEdward Blum, of Tallahassee, Fla., is not a lawyer; he retired from a job in finance. But he is founder and president of Students for Fair Admissions , a group he acknowledges starting to challenge higher education affirmative action policies in court. \"The equal rights provision of our 14th Amendment basically gets to the point that people should not be treated differently because of their race or ethnicity,\" said Blum.\n\nHe also argues that affirmative action violates the 1964 Civil Rights Act. \"The opportunities must be the same, regardless of your race or ethnicity,\" he said.\n\nAffirmative action has helped boost the number of Black, Latinx and other minorities who are under-represented at prestigious schools. But now those racial preferences may be prohibited, in large part due to Blum's efforts. The Supreme Court is now considering cases he brought targeting affirmative action at the University of North Carolina (the nation's oldest public university) and Harvard (the oldest private college).\n\nBlum said his group has 22,000 members, but none is identified by name in either court case. \"Well, in the world of social media, it is no surprise that 17- and 18-year-old kids do not want their names made public,\" he said.\n\nBlum has previously spearheaded two cases in which the Supreme Court struck down voting polices designed to help racial groups (particularly African Americans and Hispanics) that have endured prior discrimination. But he lost a 2016 case in which he backed Abigail Fisher, who unsuccessfully challenged racial consideration in admissions at the University of Texas .\n\nBut today's Supreme Court is far more conservative.\n\nBraver asked, \"Were you just determined to keep bringing cases until you got the court to agree with you?\"\n\n\"Legal advocacy requires a long-term commitment,\" Blum replied.\n\nThere are, in fact, nine states that have enacted bans on racial preferences in state colleges, with some reporting a drop in African American and Latinx admissions at top institutions.\n\nAffirmative action advocates say a nationwide ban would be disastrous.\n\nMitchell Crusto, a professor at Loyola University New Orleans College of Law , said, \"Affirmative action is really trying to treat everyone equally, recognizing that certain groups have been marginalized over the centuries.\"\n\nCrusto grew up in segregated Louisiana: \"Most of the restaurants in town did not serve Black people,\" he said. \"Water fountains were segregated, so there was a white-only and a Black-only water fountain. The Woolworth's department store, you could not have counter service if you were Black.\"\n\nHe is a descendant of generations of enslaved people, and forebears who faced prejudice after emancipation. \"A lot of the legacy of discrimination - in housing, in employment - meant that my family was set back century after century,\" he said.\n\nEven after the Supreme Court mandated school desegregation, most of Crusto's schooling was in segregated Catholic schools in New Orleans. He was a top student, and also, he acknowledges, an affirmative action beneficiary in 1971.\n\nBraver asked, \"You knew when you applied to Yale that they were in interested in you not just as a student, but because they wanted to bring in more African American students?\"\n\n\"Absolutely, absolutely,\" he replied, pointing out, \"Race is just one aspect. I wasn't accepted to Yale because I'm Black. I was accepted into Yale because of all the other things that I am as a person, of which I'm also African American.\"\n\nCrusto graduated magna cum laude from Yale College, and was admitted to Yale Law School.\n\nHe argues that the Supreme Court should uphold its previous rulings that colleges have a genuine interest in including students from different racial groups: \"For all students who are at a university, having a diverse campus of individuals with different backgrounds adds to the educational goal of the university,\" he said.\n\nFor his part, Edward Blum, a descendant of Holocaust survivors, contends that when colleges have considered ethnic backgrounds of applicants, it has hurt certain groups: \"Back in the 1920s, it's well documented by dozens of historians that Harvard had policies in place to discriminate against Jews,\" he said. \"Fast forward now to the 1990s and 2000s, we believe that Harvard has policies that diminish the likelihood that high-achieving Asians are being admitted.\"\n\nIn fact, Harvard recently announced that nearly 30% of those admitted this year are Asian-American, more than four times the representation in the total U.S. population.\n\nStill, some Asian Americans are taking a stand against affirmative action plans that tend to help other minorities.\n\nRutvij Holay, whose parents were born in India, is the founder of the Americans for Equality Political Action Committee . He said, \"Even if tomorrow they give preference to Asians, I'll be just as opposed, because the idea is that ideally we should all be treated equally, and there really should be a level playing field for all of us.\"\n\nA straight-A student in Irvine Calif., Holay was just admitted to one of the nation's top schools: Stanford University. But he also applied to Ivy League schools. \"I applied to all of them except for Harvard,\" he said.\n\nAnd did he get into any of them? \"Nope.\"\n\nBraver asked, \"Do you have a feeling that maybe racial preferences might have had something to do with that?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"Look, I look at the data, right? I'm not going off of a feeling, because the college admission process has been very good for me. But I think everyone has to acknowledge that there is a level of discrimination that occurs.\"\n\nChelsea Wang, a Harvard sophomore, is co-president of the Harvard-Radcliffe Asian American Association . She participated in a pro-affirmative action demonstration before the Supreme Court heard arguments on the cases last fall. There was also an Asian American anti -affirmative action demonstration, underscoring how divisive the issue is among Americans, of all races.\n\nWang said, \"I think this case has the potential to really pit Asian Americans against other minorities.  And I don't want that to happen. I think we should all, you know, understand, like, what other people have gone through and support them.\"\n\nWang argues that it is a question of basic fairness. \"You know what? I wish we didn't have to have affirmative action,\" she said. \"I think we have to have it, because all of the different, compounding forms of inequality that affect someone's life before they even apply for college, call for something that accounts for those factors.\"\n\nStill, Edward Blum believes there are other ways to get a diverse student body.\n\nBraver asked him, \"This is not news to you that some people think your actions over the years have showed that you're racist or bigoted in some way. How do you respond to that?\"\n\n\"I think that's an easy, sort of intellectually lazy way of making an argument,\" Blum replied. \"Let's have a debate about the policy.\"\n\n\"If these policies go away, will it not just advantage Asian American applicants, but maybe also white applicants?\"\n\n\"It's unclear who this is going to advantage,\" said Blum. \"It's going to be up to Harvard, it's going to be up to UNC to change their policies to make them, first, colorblind ... that's the goal. Make them colorblind.\"\n\nBut with many legal experts predicting that the Supreme Court will strike down affirmative action, advocates like law professor Mitchell Crusto are worried that decades of progress for underserved minorities will be set back: \"If the Supreme Court decides to ban the use of race, I think they'll go down in history as being one of the most conservative, reactionary, white supremacist Supreme Courts that we've ever seen,\" he said.\n\nFor more info:\n\nStory produced by Ed Forgotson and Robert Marston.

      "text": "What is affirmative action? History behind race-based college admissions practices the Supreme Court overruled\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nJune 29, 2023 / 5:07 PM EDT / CBS News\n\nThe United States Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that affirmative action programs at Harvard College and the University of North Carolina are unconstitutional, finding in two majority opinions authored by Chief Justice John Roberts that race-conscious policies, which are used in admissions offices to increase diversity on campuses and broaden access to educational opportunity, violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.\n\nRoberts concluded that candidates applying as hopeful students to higher education institutions need to be evaluated based on their experiences \"as an individual - not on the basis of race.\"\n\n\"Many universities have for too long done just the opposite,\" Roberts wrote. \"And in doing so, they have concluded, wrongly, that the touchstone of an individual's identity is not challenges bested, skills built, or lessons learned but the color of their skin. Our constitutional history does not tolerate that choice.\"\n\nProponents of affirmative action , including the justices who did not vote with the majority in the Harvard and University of North Carolina cases, have expressed fears that doing away with affirmative action policies will lead to a substantial decrease in representation of Black and Hispanic students at higher education institutions, especially elite schools.\n\nIn the dissenting opinion in the Harvard case, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the majority opinion is \"not grounded in law or fact and contravenes the vision of equality embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment,\" and argued that the decision \"subverts the constitutional guarantee of equal protection by further entrenching racial inequality in education, the very foundation of our democratic government and pluralistic society.\"\n\nAffirmative action refers to any set of policies in place to ensure equal opportunity and prevent discrimination based on a broad range of identities, including race, sex, gender, religion, national origin and disability. Originally introduced on a large scale in the 1960s to address racial discrimination, affirmative action policies typically appear in employment and education contexts.\n\nThey are most often discussed in relation to college admissions decisions in the United States, since a number of schools have established protocols that aim to increase the diversity of their student bodies by considering applicants' race. Affirmative action programs with similar goals exist in hiring processes across governments and individual businesses.\n\n\"The purpose of affirmative action is to ensure equal employment opportunities for applicants and employees. It is based on the premise that, absent discrimination, over time a contractor's workforce generally will reflect the demographics of the qualified available workforce in the relevant job market,\" the U.S. Department of Labor writes in a \"frequently asked questions\" page on its website with guidelines for federal contractors.\n\nThe description goes on to note that affirmative action requirements are meant to ensure that applicants -in this case, for employment, although the same idea applies for college acceptance- have equal opportunities \"for recruitment, selection, advancement, and every other term and privilege associated with employment, without regard to their race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, or status as a protected veteran.\"\n\nSupporters of affirmative action programs in higher education say they are important because they allow for holistic evaluation of potential candidates and ensure underrepresented groups have equal access to those institutions. As proponents note, the programs have a documented track record of increasing diversity in schools. But, for decades, critics have argued against the practice, suggesting it could be likened to racial discrimination against people who are not part of minority groups.\n\nThe first major affirmative action policy in the United States came in September 1965, when then-President Lyndon B. Johnson issued Executive Order 11246, which prohibited employment discrimination based on race, color, religion and national origin by organizations that received federal contracts and subcontracts. But it was a 2003 decision by the Supreme Court, known as Grutter v. Bollinger, that established a national precedent allowing schools to consider race when making admissions decisions.\n\nIn that ruling, the court found that affirmative action policies used in University of Michigan Law School admissions did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. Delivering the court's 5-4 opinion, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote that \"in the context of its individualized inquiry into the possible diversity contributions of all applicants, the Law School's race-conscious admissions program does not unduly harm nonminority applicants.\"\n\nNine states -Arizona, California, Florida, Idaho, Michigan, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oklahoma and Washington- have previously banned affirmative action policies at public universities. Cases that went before the Supreme Court this term involved higher education institutions based in Massachusetts and North Carolina, specifically Harvard University, the country's oldest private institution, and the University of North Carolina, the country's oldest public university.\n\nThe group Students for Fair Admissions, founded by Ed Blum, a conservative activist whose career has focused on eliminating racial preferences in various settings, brought two cases in November 2014 that respectively targeted affirmative action policies at Harvard and the University of North Carolina.\n\nThe case against Harvard alleged that the school's policies violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits racial discrimination in any program that receives federal funds, and claimed it discriminates against applicants who are Asian-American. In the University of North Carolina case, Students for Fair Admissions alleged that the school's affirmative action policies violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.\n\nMore than 40% of American universities, and 60% of selective schools, consider race to some extent when making admissions decisions, according to documents that Harvard filed in court. The Biden administration has also said that both the U.S. military and the federal government have relied on some of the Supreme Court's earlier decisions acknowledging that the benefits of diversity in education settings to justify limited consideration of race.\n\nResponding to the affirmative action ruling on Thursday, Kevin Guskiewicz, chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said in a statement that the school \"will carefully review the Supreme Court's decision and take any steps necessary to comply with the law,\" acknowledging that it was \"not the outcome we hoped for.\"\n\n\"Carolina remains firmly committed to bringing together talented students with different perspectives and life experiences and continues to make an affordable, high-quality education accessible to the people of North Carolina and beyond,\" Guskiewicz said.\n\nOfficials at Harvard emphasized the university's commitment to having a diverse student body in a separate statement, addressed to members of the Harvard community.\n\n\"For almost a decade, Harvard has vigorously defended an admissions system that, as two federal courts ruled, fully complied with longstanding precedent,\" school leaders wrote after the Supreme Court's decision. \"In the weeks and months ahead, drawing on the talent and expertise of our Harvard community, we will determine how to preserve, consistent with the Court's new precedent, our essential values.\"\n\nAlthough the majority opinion delivered by Roberts Thursday did not expressly overturn the Supreme Court's precedent allowing schools to consider race in admissions, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a concurring opinion that the 2003 Grutter v. Bollinger ruling was \"for all intents and purposes, overruled\" by the latest decision. Meanwhile, in the dissent, Stotomayor condemned the court's conservative majority for \"overruling decades of precedent.\"\n\nExactly how the impacts of the affirmative action decision will play out at different universities, and what the domino effect will look like, remains to be seen.\n\nRoberts' opinion said universities could still consider \"an applicant's discussion of how race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration, or otherwise\" when making admissions decisions, while military academies would be effectively exempt from the new ruling \"in light of the potentially distinct interests that military academies may present.\"\n\nSharp dissents respectively penned by Sotomayor and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman on the Supreme Court, warned of potentially catastrophic consequences to higher education as a result of the decision.\n\n\"Today, this Court stands in the way and rolls back decades of precedent and momentous progress. It holds that race can no longer be used in a limited way in college admissions to achieve such critical benefits,\" wrote Sotomayor in the dissenting opinion on the Harvard case. \"In so holding, the Court cements a superficial rule of colorblindness as a constitutional principle in an endemically segregated society where race has always mattered and continues to matter.\"\n\nIn her dissent in the North Carolina case, Jackson wrote, \"the race-blind admissions stance the Court mandates from this day forward is unmoored from critical real-life circumstances.\"\n\n\"Thus, the Court's meddling not only arrests the noble generational project that America's universities are attempting, it also launches, in effect, a dismally misinformed sociological experiment,\" she added.\n\nEmily Mae Czachor is a news editor at CBSNews.com.

      "text": "Supreme Court rejects affirmative action, ending use of race as factor in college admissions\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  June 29, 2023 / 9:30 PM EDT / CBS News\n\nWashington - The Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that race-conscious admission policies of Harvard College and the University of North Carolina violate the Constitution, bringing an end to affirmative action in higher education in a decision that will reverberate across campuses nationwide.\n\nThe court ruled 6-3 along ideological lines in the University of North Carolina case, and 6-2 in the Harvard dispute, as Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson recused herself. Chief Justice John Roberts authored the majority opinion , joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Thomas read a concurring opinion from the bench. Justice Sonia Sotomayor also read her dissent aloud, the first time a dissenting justice has done so this term.\n\n\"The Harvard and UNC admissions programs cannot be reconciled with the guarantees of the Equal Protection Clause,\" Roberts wrote. \"Both programs lack sufficiently focused and measurable objectives warranting the use of race, unavoidably employ race in a negative manner, involve racial stereotyping, and lack meaningful end points. We have never permitted admissions programs to work in that way, and we will not do so today.\"\n\nBut Roberts wrote that universities can still consider \"an applicant's discussion of how race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration, or otherwise.\" Military academies are effectively exempt from the decision, due to the \"potentially distinct interests\" they present.\n\nStudents, the chief justice concluded, must be evaluated based on their experiences \"as an individual - not on the basis of race.\"\n\n\"Many universities have for too long done just the opposite,\" Roberts said. \"And in doing so, they have concluded, wrongly, that the touchstone of an individual's identity is not challenges bested, skills built, or lessons learned but the color of their skin. Our constitutional history does not tolerate that choice.\"\n\nIn a fierce dissent , Sotomayor said the majority opinion is \"not grounded in law or fact and contravenes the vision of equality embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n\n\"Today, this Court stands in the way and rolls back decades of precedent and momentous progress. It holds that race can no longer be used in a limited way in college admissions to achieve such critical benefits,\" she wrote. \"In so holding, the Court cements a superficial rule of colorblindness as a constitutional principle in an endemically segregated society where race has always mattered and continues to matter.\"\n\nJoined by Justice Elena Kagan and Jackson, Sotomayor said the court's decision \"subverts the constitutional guarantee of equal protection by further entrenching racial inequality in education, the very foundation of our democratic government and pluralistic society.\"\n\nIn a separate dissent penned in the University of North Carolina case, Jackson, the first Black woman to sit on the Supreme Court, lambasted the court's decision, writing that the majority \"surges to vindicate equality, but Don Quixote style - pitifully perceiving itself as the sole vanguard of legal high ground when, in reality, its perspective is not constitutionally compelled.\"\n\n\"Simply put, the race-blind admissions stance the Court mandates from this day forward is unmoored from critical real-life circumstances,\" she wrote. \"Thus, the Court's meddling not only arrests the noble generational project that America's universities are attempting, it also launches, in effect, a dismally misinformed sociological experiment.\"\n\nThough Roberts' majority opinion did not explicitly overturn the court's precedent allowing schools to consider race when making admissions decisions - namely a 2003 case known as Grutter v. Bollinger - Thomas wrote in his concurring opinion that the 2003 decision is \"for all intents and purposes, overruled,\" while Sotomayor accused the conservative majority of \"overruling decades of precedent.\"\n\nThe ruling is the latest in which the Supreme Court's conservative majority has upended decades of past decisions involving issues that have shaped American life, underscoring the impact that former President Donald Trump's three appointed justices have had on the court.\n\nIn its last term, the Supreme Court reversed its landmark decision in Roe v. Wade, unwinding the constitutional right to an abortion recognized since 1973. That ruling amplified concerns that other longstanding precedents were at risk of being jettisoned, including those affirming that race-conscious admissions programs are within constitutional bounds.\n\nThe assumption that affirmative action would not withstand the Supreme Court's scrutiny has now come to fruition. While the decision will be felt most acutely at highly competitive schools, universities have warned that ending race-conscious admissions programs would lead to a significant drop in representation of Black and Hispanic students, particularly at elite institutions.\n\nMore than 40% of universities, and 60% of selective schools, consider race to some degree in admissions decisions, according to Harvard's filings with the court. Additionally, institutions such as the service academies, the U.S. military and the federal government have relied on the Supreme Court's past decisions recognizing that the educational benefits of diversity justify limited consideration of race in admissions, according to the Biden administration.\n\nPresident Biden, in remarks from the White House, condemned the court's rejection of affirmative action in higher education and said racial diversity makes not only colleges but the whole nation stronger.\n\n\"We cannot let this decision be the last word,\" he said. \"While the court can render a decision, it cannot change what America stands for. America is an idea, an idea unique in the world. An idea of hope and opportunity, of possibilities, of giving everyone a fair shot, of leaving no one behind. We've never fully lived up to it, but we've never walked away from it either. We will not walk away fro it now.\"\n\nAsked by a reporter whether the Supreme Court is \"rogue,\" Mr. Biden replied, \"This is not a normal court.\"\n\nAffirmative action refers to policies established by schools or employers aimed at increasing the diversity of a student body or workforce through the consideration of candidates' race. The concept originated in the 1960s to address racial discrimination and has been controversial ever since, with critics saying the practice itself is tantamount to racial discrimination against non-minorities. Proponents of affirmative action policies in higher education argue that race should be considered as part of a \"holistic\" evaluation of candidates, and say the policies are crucial for increasing diversity and ensuring underrepresented groups have equal access to institutions.\n\nNine states have banned affirmative action at public universities: Arizona, California, Florida, Idaho, Michigan, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oklahoma and Washington.\n\nThe cases before the court this term involved Harvard, the nation's oldest private institution, and the University of North Carolina, the oldest public university. Both disputes were brought in November 2014 by the group Students for Fair Admissions, founded by conservative activist Ed Blum, who for years has fought to end the use of racial preferences in American life.\n\nIn the Harvard case, the organization claimed the school's race-conscious admissions policies violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits racial discrimination in any program or activity that receives federal funds, by discriminating against Asian-American applicants. Students for Fair Admissions accused Harvard of assigning Asian-American students lower ratings on personality traits than other races and limiting the number of Asian-American applicants it admits.\n\nIn the University of North Carolina fight, Students for Fair Admissions accused the university of violating the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, as it overlooks race-neutral alternatives available to achieve diversity among its student body.\n\nBoth universities denied discriminating against Asian-American applicants.\n\nLower courts upheld the policies at each of the schools, finding that race was one factor among many considered in the schools' holistic processes, and that they were consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in Grutter, the 2003 decision that said the narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions is allowed under the Constitution.\n\nWriting for the majority in Grutter, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor suggested that \"25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary.\" That proposed 2028 deadline drew questions during oral arguments in the Harvard and University of North Carolina cases of when race would no longer need to be considered in college admissions.\n\nRoberts wrote for the majority that neither Harvard nor the University of North Carolina indicated to the court that their race-based admissions programs had end points.\n\n\"In short,\" he said, \"there is no reason to believe that respondents will - even acting in good faith - comply with the Equal Protection Clause any time soon.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court last considered the lawfulness of race-conscious admissions programs in 2016, in a challenge to the policies at the University of Texas at Austin that was also backed by Blum. In that case, a divided court again said race could be considered to ensure student-body diversity.\n\nBut the composition of the court changed dramatically since then, with Sotomayor the only remaining justice who was in the majority seven years ago. (Kagan recused herself from the case.)\n\nThe Supreme Court agreed to wade into the debate over affirmative action again in January 2022. While the Harvard and University of North Carolina cases were originally consolidated, they were unlinked after Jackson joined the court and recused herself from the Harvard dispute.\n\nIn response to the decision, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Chancellor Kevin Guskiewicz said the school will take the steps necessary to comply with the ruling.\n\n\"Carolina remains firmly committed to bringing together talented students with different perspectives and life experiences and continues to make an affordable, high-quality education accessible to the  people of North Carolina and beyond,\" he said.\n\nTop officials from Harvard reiterated a commitment to diversity in its student body, which it said is \"essential to academic experience.\"\n\n\"For almost a decade, Harvard has vigorously defended an admissions system that, as two federal courts ruled, fully complied with longstanding precedent,\" school leaders wrote to members of the Harvard community. \"In the weeks and months ahead, drawing on the talent and expertise of our Harvard community, we will determine how to preserve, consistent with the Court's new precedent, our essential values.\"\n\nMelissa Quinn is a politics reporter for CBSNews.com.

      "text": "Supreme Court guts affirmative action in college admissions\n\nThe Supreme Court says colleges and universities can no longer take race into consideration as a specific basis for granting admission, a landmark decision overturning long-standing precedent that has benefited Black and Latino students in higher education.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote the opinion for the conservative majority, saying the Harvard and University of North Carolina admissions programs violated the Equal Protection Clause because they failed to offer \"measurable\" objectives to justify the use of race. He said the programs involve racial stereotyping and had no specific end point.\n\nRelated article Supreme Court guts affirmative action in college admissions\n\n\"The Harvard and UNC admissions programs cannot be reconciled with the guarantees of the Equal Protection Clause. Both programs lack sufficiently focused and measurable objectives warranting the use of race, unavoidably employ race in a negative manner, involve racial stereotyping, and lack meaningful end points. We have never permitted admissions programs to work in that way, and we will not do so today,\" Roberts wrote.\n\nThe majority opinion claims that the court was not expressly overturning prior cases authorizing race-based affirmative action and suggested that how race has affected an applicant's life can still be part of how their application is considered. But even if the court did not formally end race-based affirmative action in higher education, its analysis will make it practically impossible for colleges and universities to take race into account - as the three Democratic appointees stressed in dissent.\n\nIn a lengthy concurrence, Justice Clarence Thomas , the second Black person to join the Supreme Court , spoke in unusually personal terms as he criticized the use of affirmative action policies by colleges and universities, which he described as \"rudderless, race-based preferences designed to ensure a particular racial mix in their entering classes.\"\n\n\"While I am painfully aware of the social and economic ravages which have befallen my race and all who suffer discrimination, I hold out enduring hope that this country will live up to its principles so clearly enunciated in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States: that all men are created equal, are equal citizens, and must be treated equally before the law,\" Thomas wrote.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justice Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, issued a fiery dissent, saying the opinion \"rolls back decades of precedent and momentous progress.\"\n\n\"The result of today's decision is that a person's skin color may play a role in assessing individualized suspicion, but it cannot play a role in assessing that person's individualized contributions to a diverse learning environment,\" Sotomayor wrote. \"That indefensible reading of the Constitution is not grounded in law and subverts the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of equal protection.\"\n\nIn a demonstration of the controversial nature of the case, justices read their dissents from the bench for the first time since 2019.\n\n\"The devastating impact of this decision cannot be overstated,\" Sotomayor said while reading a synopsis from the bench.\n\nIn ending her dissent, Sotomayor quoted Dr. Martin Luther King attempting to end the opinion on an optimistic note.\n\n\"As has been the case before in the history of American democracy, 'the arc of the moral universe' will bend toward racial justice despite the Court's effort to impede its progress,\" she said. Sotomayor pointedly did not use the customary language \"I respectfully dissent.\"\n\nIn her own dissent, Jackson, the only Black woman on the bench, accused the majority of having a \"let-them-eat-cake obliviousness\" in how the ruling announced \"'colorblindness for all' by legal fiat.\"\n\n\"But deeming race irrelevant in law does not make it so in life,\" she said, joined by the court's two other liberals.\n\nJackson wrote that the majority had \"detached itself from this country's actual past and present experiences.\"\n\n\"No one benefits from ignorance,\" she added.\n\nThe ruling says that US military service academies can continue to take race into consideration as a factor in admissions.\n\nIn a footnote in the majority opinion,  Roberts said that the cases before the court did \"not address the issue\" and left open the possibility that there are \"potentially distinct interests that military academies may present\" in a future case.\n\nDuring oral arguments, Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar stressed the unique interests of the military and argued that race-based admissions programs further the nation's compelling interest of diversity.\n\nJackson called out the caveat in her dissent.\n\n\"The court has come to rest on the bottom-line conclusion that racial diversity in higher education is only worth potentially preserving insofar as it might be needed to prepare Black Americans and other underrepresented minorities for success in the bunker, not the boardroom (a particularly awkward place to land, in light of the history the majority opts to ignore),\" Jackson wrote.\n\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy hailed the affirmative action decision, saying that the justices \"just ruled that no American should be denied educational opportunities because of race.\" And Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement, \"This is a great day for all Americans.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump called Thursday a \"great day for America.\"\n\n\"People with extraordinary ability and everything else necessary for success, including future greatness for our country, are finally being rewarded,\" Trump said on Truth Social. \"This is the ruling everyone was waiting and hoping for and the result was amazing.\"\n\nTrump transformed the court when he nominated three of the justices in the conservative majority.\n\nAnother 2024 GOP contender, former Vice President Mike Pence, also celebrated the ruling.\n\n\"There is no place for discrimination based on race in the United States, and I am pleased that the Supreme Court has put an end to this egregious violation of civil and constitutional rights in admissions processes, which only served to perpetuate racism,\" Pence said.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called the Supreme Court affirmative action ruling \"a giant roadblock in our country's march toward racial justice.\"\n\n\"The consequences of this decision will be felt immediately and across the country, as students of color will face an admission cycle next year with fewer opportunities to attend the same colleges and universities than their parents and older siblings,\" the New York Democrat said.\n\nCNN Chief Legal Analyst Laura Coates said the Supreme Court's decision will have sweeping changes to education in the US.\n\n\"This opinion, make no mistake about it, it is going to change the landscape of education, and this is what the majority has asked for,\" she said.\n\nSteve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said the decision will still not end the legal fight over college admissions.\n\n\"In those states that have already banned racial preferences and gone after diversity statements and other softer uses of race in admissions, the decision is going to make it virtually impossible for colleges and universities to take race into account in any specific admissions decision,\" Vladeck said.\n\n\"But in states that continue to permit colleges and universities to take race into account, we'll surely see efforts to encourage the kinds of uses the majority does not expressly disavow -whether in diversity statements or elsewhere - and litigation challenging those efforts as being inconsistent with the spirit, if not the letter, of today's decision.\"\n\nChallengers in the case targeted Harvard and the University of North Carolina, arguing that their programs violate equal protection principles, dashed the promise of a colorblind society and discriminated against Asian Americans. They asked the court to overturn precedent and insist that higher education should explore and further develop race-neutral alternatives to achieve diversity.\n\nA conservative group, Students for Fair Admissions was behind both challenges .\n\nRelated article Supreme Court revives case brought by postal worker seeking religious accommodations\n\nSSFA argued the UNC and Harvard policies violated Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act that prohibits schools receiving federal funds from discriminating based on race as well. The lawyers also argued that the UNC violated the 14th Amendment's guarantee of equal protection under the law, which covers state universities.\n\nLower US courts had ruled in favor of the schools, finding that that the programs used race in a sufficiently limited way to fulfill a compelling interest in diversity.\n\nAfter an eight-day trial in 2020, District Court Judge Loretta C. Biggs of the US District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina ruled in favor of the school, making special mention of its history steeped in racism.\n\n\"The University continues to face challenges admitting and enrolling underrepresented minorities particularly African American males, Hispanics, and Native Americans,\" Biggs said, adding that in 2013 enrollment of Black men in the first-year class fell below 100 students.\n\nThe Supreme Court stepped in to consider the case before it was heard by a federal appeals court.\n\nHarvard's program is like that of University of North Carolina, but the challenge focused particularly on the treatment of Asian American students and a charge that the school intentionally discriminates against them by setting higher standards for their admission. While Harvard is a private university, it is still subject to Title VI because it receives public funds.\n\nIts freshman class in 2019 had 1,600 students out of 35,000 applicants. Of the 35,000, 2,700 had perfect verbal SAT scores, 3,400 had perfect math SAT scores and more than 8,000 had perfect grade point averages. After a 15-day bench trial that featured thirty witnesses the district court ruled in favor of Harvard, finding that the school did not discriminate against Asian Americans in violation of Title VI.\n\nRelated article Challenge to Harvard's use of affirmative action was designed by a conservative to reach a friendly Supreme Court\n\nThe 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court holding that it did \"not clearly err in finding that Harvard did not intentionally discriminate against Asian Americans. \"\n\nThe admissions process at the school takes into consideration several components including pre-application recruitment efforts, applications, a \"first read\" of application materials, and interviews.   The reading procedures include guidelines to assign numerical numbers to certain categories to detail the factors admissions officers should consider. Those factors include academic ratings, extracurricular ratings, athletic ratings, and personal ratings.\n\nThe personal ratings attempt to measure how an applicant impacts people around them and contributions they might make. Considerations include perceived leadership, maturity, self-confidence, likeability, courage and kindness. After SFFA brought the suit, Harvard modified its instructions to say that an applicant's race or ethnicity should not be considered in assigning the personal ratings. Harvard has a list of so-called \"tip\" factors, including race, that are used after the first read process.\n\nCameron T. Norris, the SSFA lawyer who argued the Harvard case, charged the school with ignoring precedent and the \"mistreatment\" of Asian-American applicants. \"Its admissions process penalizes them for supposedly lacking as much leadership, confidence likability, or kindness as White applicants,\" he said, and said that Harvard \"engages in admitted racial balancing and ignores race-neutral alternatives.\"\n\nHe particularly attacked Harvard's system based on so-called \"personal ratings.\" By considering race alongside subjective criteria like \"self-confidence, likability, and courage,\" universities invite admissions officers to rely on anti-Asian stereotypes, Norris added.\n\nPrelogar supported both Harvard and the University of North Carolina, urging the justices to reject the invitation to ignore court precedent stemming from the Court's 1978 decision in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, where Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. recognized that the nation's future \"depends upon leaders trained through wide exposure to the ideas and mores of students as diverse as this Nation of many peoples.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN's Shania Shelton contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Affirmative Action Fast Facts\n\nHere is some background information about affirmative action as well as a few notable court cases.\n\nAffirmative action policies focus on improving opportunities for groups of people, like women and minorities, who have been historically excluded in United States' society. The initial emphasis was on education and employment. President John F. Kennedy was the first president to use the term in an executive order.\n\nSupporters argue that affirmative action is necessary to ensure racial and gender diversity in education and employment. Critics state that it is unfair and causes reverse discrimination.\n\nRacial quotas are considered unconstitutional by the US Supreme Court.\n\nThe state of Texas replaced its affirmative action plan with a percentage plan that guarantees the top 10% of high-school graduates a spot in any state university in Texas. California and Florida have similar programs.\n\n1954 - The US Supreme Court, in Brown v. Board of Education, rules that the \"separate but equal\" doctrine violates the Constitution.\n\n1961 - President Kennedy creates the Council on Equal Opportunity in an executive order. This ensures that federal contractors hire people regardless of race, creed, color or national origin.\n\n1964 - The Civil Rights Act renders discrimination illegal in the workplace.\n\n1978 - In Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, a notable reverse discrimination case, the Supreme Court rules that colleges cannot use racial quotas because it violates the Equal Protection Clause. As one factor for admission, however, race can be used.\n\n1995 - The University of Michigan rejects the college application of Jennifer Gratz, a top high school student in suburban Detroit who is white.\n\nOctober 14, 1997 - Gratz v. Bollinger, et al., is filed in federal court in the Eastern District of Michigan. The University of Michigan is sued by white students, including Gratz and Patrick Hamacher, who claim the undergraduate and law school affirmative action policies using race and/or gender as a factor in admissions is a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nDecember 3, 1997 - A similar case, Grutter v. Bollinger, is filed in federal court in the Eastern District of Michigan. Barbara Grutter, denied admission to the University of Michigan Law School, claims that other applicants, with lower test scores and grades, were given an unfair advantage due to race.\n\nDecember 2000 - The judge in the Gratz v. Bollinger case rules that the University of Michigan's undergraduate admissions policy does not violate the standards set by the Supreme Court.\n\nMarch 2001 - The judge in the Grutter v. Bollinger case rules the University of Michigan Law School's admissions policy is unconstitutional.\n\nDecember 2001 - The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals hears appeals in both University of Michigan cases.\n\nMay 14, 2002 - The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reverses the district court's decision in Grutter v. Bollinger.\n\nJanuary 17, 2003 - The administration of President George W. Bush files a friend-of-the-court brief with the Supreme Court, opposing the University of Michigan's affirmative action program.\n\nApril 1, 2003 - The US Supreme Court hears oral arguments on the two cases. US Solicitor General Theodore Olson offers arguments in support of the plaintiffs.\n\nJune 23, 2003 - The Supreme Court rules on Grutter v. Bollinger that the University of Michigan Law School may give preferential treatment to minorities during the admissions process.

Bollinger, the undergraduate policy in which a point system gave specific \"weight\" to minority applicants is overturned six to three.\n\nDecember 22, 2003 - The Supreme Court rules that race can be a factor in universities' admission programs but it cannot be an overriding factor.  This decision affects the Grutter and Gratz cases.\n\nNovember 7, 2006 - The Michigan electorate strikes down affirmative action by approving a proposition barring affirmative action in public education, employment, or contracting.\n\nJanuary 31, 2007 - After the Supreme Court sends the case back to district court; the case is dismissed. Gratz and Hamacher settle for $10,000 in administrative costs, but do not receive damages.\n\n2008 - Abigail Noel Fisher, a white woman, sues the University of Texas. She argues that the university should not use race as a factor in admission policies that favor African-American and Hispanic applicants over whites and Asian-Americans.\n\nJuly 1, 2011 - An appeals court overturns Michigan's 2006 ban on the use of race and/or gender as a factor in admissions or hiring practices.\n\nNovember 15, 2012 - The US Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals throws out Michigan's 2006 ban on affirmative action in college admissions and public hiring, declaring it unconstitutional.\n\nJune 24, 2013 - The Supreme Court sends the University of Texas case back to the lower court for further review without ruling.\n\nOctober 15, 2013 - The US Supreme Court hears oral arguments in a case concerning Michigan's 2006 law on affirmative action.\n\nApril 22, 2014 - In a six to two ruling, the Supreme Court upholds Michigan's ban of using racial criteria in college admissions.\n\nJuly 15, 2014 - The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upholds the use of race by the University of Texas as a factor in undergraduate admissions to promote diversity on campus.

On June 29, 2023, the US Supreme Court says colleges and universities can no longer take race into consideration as a specific basis for granting admission .\n\nOctober 5, 2023 - The US Naval Academy is sued over its use of race in its admissions practices by the Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA) group. The SFFA say that the academy \"has no justification for using race-based admissions\" and argues that its policy of using race as a factor in admissions runs afoul of the US Constitution. On December 6, 2024, US Senior District Judge Richard Bennett rejects the challenge , ruling that the school has \"established a compelling national security interest\" in maintaining diversity within the US military.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

The task, researchers and education officials say, will not be easy.\n\nWisdom Cole, national director of the NAACP Youth & College Division, called the rollback of affirmative action a \"dark day in America.\"\n\n\"Affirmative action has been a beacon of hope for generations of Black students,\" Cole said in a statement Thursday. \"It stood as a powerful force against the insidious poison of racism and sexism, aiming to level the playing field and provide a fair shot at a high-quality education for all. Students across the country are wide-awake to the clear and present danger encroaching on their classrooms.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court case was sparked by conservative activist Edward Blum, who filed lawsuits in 2014 against Harvard University and the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill challenging their use of race-conscious admissions. Blum and other critics of affirmative action have said college admissions should be based on equal standards and merit.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote the opinion on affirmative action for the conservative majority, saying the Harvard and University of North Carolina admissions programs violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment because they failed to offer \"measurable\" objectives to justify the use of race. He said the programs involve racial stereotyping and had no specific endpoint.\n\nCivil rights leaders and experts say the Supreme Court ruling is a setback for equality in education.\n\nRacial diversity at colleges and universities - particularly at competitive and Ivy League schools - may suffer, they say. A study by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce found that colleges and universities are less likely to meet or exceed their current levels of racial diversity in the absence of race-conscious admissions. They are also less likely to reflect the racial makeup of the population graduating from the nation's high schools.\n\nZack Mabel, a researcher for Georgetown's Center for Education and the Workforce , said he expects the number of Black and brown students attending selective colleges nationwide will drop from the current 20% to about 16% without affirmative action in place. Mabel said race-neutral practices have not driven the diversity many colleges hoped for and some students are simply not applying.\n\n\"The only thing it's going to do is further discourage students from underrepresented groups from applying for these institutions,\" Mabel said. \"And it's going to be harder for admissions officers to admit them because they have one eye blind when they are trying to admit these students.\"\n\nRashad Robinson, president of Color of Change, said the decision only opens the door for more people with \"privilege\" to be admitted into selective colleges. Robinson described those applicants as athletes, legacies, students with access to test preparation services and applicants who come from wealthy families.\n\nHe challenged colleges to prevent this disparity by giving applicants a holistic review that includes their socioeconomic background and the challenges they have overcome.\n\n\"We are pushing universities to make a plan and be transparent about those plans,\" Robinson said. \"Privilege-based admissions ... will only lead to a country where who you were born to and what opportunities were afforded to you at birth, that had nothing to do with your merit, determines where you get to go.\"\n\nMarshall Anthony Jr., a research director for The Institute for College Access & Success, urged President Joe Biden's administration to take action to eliminate the barriers to college access for people of color such as standardized testing mandates, application fees, legacy admission and merit-based aid.\n\n\"All of these disproportionately, negatively impact the access and success of Black and Latinx students,\" Anthony said.\n\nAffirmative action was already banned in nine states , including in Michigan and California, and these states could be case studies of what is to come for the entire country, some experts say.\n\nColleges in Michigan, which banned affirmative action in 2006, and California, which banned the practice in 1996, have tried race-neutral approaches to affirmative action including more consideration of high school class rank and socioeconomic status in the admissions process. Still, Black student enrollment dropped at flagship schools such as the University of Michigan and the University of California, Berkeley and UCLA after affirmative action ended.\n\nBlack undergraduate enrollment at the University of Michigan fell from 7% in the fall of 2006 to 4.4% in the fall of 2022. In recent years, the University of Michigan has launched programs aimed at diversifying the student body including Go Blue Guarantee which targets low and moderate-income students; Kessler Scholars which targets first-generation students; and Wolverine Pathways for students from under-resourced communities.\n\nUniversity of Michigan President Santa Ono said while the university is slowly regaining more Black students, the programs have taken time to implement and the results won't come overnight. Ono said affirmative action provides the most immediate impact on diverse student enrollment.\n\n\"I just think about the number of students who could have gone to Michigan between 2006 and today who could not,\" Ono told CNN. \"It's part of the American dream, equal opportunity requires equal access to education as a foundation.\"\n\nOno said diversity is important on college campuses because students can grow and learn from each other, hear different perspectives, and experience an environment that is a reflection of the real world.\n\nAcross the University of California system, Black enrollment fell dramatically after the state outlawed affirmative action in 1996.\n\nAccording to school data , the University of California, Berkeley's Black student enrollment was 5.9% in 1995, compared to 3.8% in 2022.\n\nOlufemi Ogundele, associate vice chancellor of admissions & enrollment at UC Berkeley, said the university has struggled to achieve the same level of diversity it saw before affirmative action ended. University officials have spent more than $500 million on outreach efforts to low-income communities, according to a Supreme Court brief filed last year by university lawyers. Still, Ogundele said it's been difficult to reach more Black students due to demographic shifts in underserved neighborhoods.\n\nHis office, he said, has found the most success with holistic review practices where they consider factors such as the academic environment of the K-12 school system the applicant attended.\n\n\"For a student who goes to a school that does not have AP Physics or AP Calculus, we don't hold that against that student,\" Ogundele said.\n\nBut more Black students could be admitted to the highly ranked UC Berkeley if affirmative action was legal in the state, he said.\n\n\"I do think that if we were able to consider (race) we would absolutely see a more much diverse class,\" Ogundele said.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "The Supreme Court may ban affirmative action, but the world that embraces diversity is here to stay\n\nA Supreme Court justice is appointed for life, is virtually impossible to impeach and has the \"unbridled\" ability to nullify any law through the power of judicial review.\n\nIt's that power that affirmative action supporters dread now that the high court has decided to consider the use of race in college admissions . They fear the conservative majority on the court will undo more than 50 years of racial progress in higher education, and the ripple effects could cause American institutions to backtrack on efforts to become more diverse.\n\nBut there is another perspective that says that the legal power of the Supreme Court cannot withstand an even more formidable power:\n\nThe will of the American people.\n\nThat perspective insists that it ultimately won't matter what conservatives on the Supreme Court decide on affirmative action.\n\nA decision banning the use of race in college admissions could cause minority enrollment in higher education to plummet, but colleges will adapt. And so will the rest of America because concepts such as diversity and inclusion are too widely accepted now to be erased, some scholars and diversity consultants say.\n\n\"Society is moving in the direction of diversity and inclusion, and there is no turning back,\" says Barry Friedman, author of \" The Will of the People: How Public Opinion Has Influenced the Supreme Court and Shaped the Meaning of the Constitution .\"\n\n\"The ultimate check on the Supreme Court is popular will.\"\n\nThe issue of affirmative action in higher education may turn out to be the ultimate test of Friedman's optimism. After years of conservative legal attacks, it has become the legal equivalent of a dead man walking - it's operating on borrowed time.\n\nTrump called him 'my African American.' His life hasn't been the same since How 'good White people' derail racial progress Am I racist? You may not like the answer I covered the Rodney King riots. This moment feels different. That's why I'm afraid Coronavirus is bringing a plague of dangerous doomsday predictions Black America is being hammered by a double pandemic Her father was called 'the most dangerous racist in America.'

That's why I'm afraid Coronavirus is bringing a plague of dangerous doomsday predictions Black America is being hammered by a double pandemic Her father was called 'the most dangerous racist in America.' She wants a different legacy for her son\n\nAffirmative action has been under attack since political leaders introduced it in the mid-1960s to improve educational and employment opportunities for racial minorities. It was instituted in part to compensate for centuries of slavery and segregation.\n\n\"A society that has done something special against the Negro for hundreds of years must now do something special for the Negro,\" the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote in his final book, \"Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community.\"\n\nAffirmative action didn't just help Black people. It expanded educational and job opportunities for other groups like women and persons with disabilities. Some studies say affirmative action has helped White women more than any other group.\n\nThe battle over affirmative action in higher education is part of a larger legal struggle. The contemporary conservative legal movement was formed in part to strike down anti-discrimination laws and race-conscious policies designed to promote diversity.\n\nThat movement says dividing people up by race is unconstitutional, that the Constitution is \"colorblind\" and that all Americans should be treated as individuals, not as members of a racial or ethnic group.\n\nA Gallup Poll last year found that 62% of Americans \"generally \"support affirmative action. But nearly three-quarters of Americans in a 2019 Pew Research Center survey said colleges and universities should not consider race or ethnicity in student admissions.\n\nThe broad opposition fell across racial and political lines: 62% of Blacks and 63% of those that either \"lean\" or identify as Democrats said race should not be a factor along with 78% of Whites holding the same views.\n\nAffirmative action in higher education survived a near-death experience in 2016 when former Justice Anthony Kennedy cast a surprising vote upholding the University of Texas' race-based admissions plan.\n\nThe makeup of the high court, however, has since become more conservative. Justices announced last month that they will reconsider race-based affirmative action in college admissions. The case in question challenges policies at Harvard and the University of North Carolina that use students' race among many criteria to decide who should gain a coveted place in an entering class.\n\nThe issue also is part of a larger debate over diversity and inclusion in the US that impact all sectors, including corporations, the military, and even the National Football League.\n\nFormer Miami Dolphins coach Brian Flores filed a class action lawsuit against the NFL and three of its teams earlier this month. He accused the league and teams of systemic racism in hiring practices for head coaches after he was fired as the Dolphins' head coach despite a winning record. About 70% of NFL players are Black; currently only two of its 32 head coaches are Black.\n\nThe NFL said that Flores' lawsuit was \"without merit\" and that \"diversity is core to everything we do.\" And the Dolphins \"vehemently\" denied the allegations, saying they are \"proud\" of the inclusion in their organization.\n\nAffirmative action has even factored in recent discussions over the nominating process for Supreme Court justices. On Friday President Joe Biden selected federal appellate court judge Ketanji Brown Jackson , who is African American, as his nominee to the high court.\n\nGOP Sen. Ted Cruz has called Biden's promise to nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court \"offensive\" and an \"insult,\" while Republican Sen. Roger Wicker said a Black woman high court nominee would be the \"beneficiary\" of an affirmative action quota.\n\nThere is, however, precedent for presidential candidates making specific promises for potential appointees, such as Reagan's promise to place a woman on the Supreme Court.\n\nDespite the constant attacks against affirmative action, though, some say the concept is here to stay.\n\nSome scholars say colleges can adapt to a Supreme Court ruling eliminating race in college admissions by shifting the focus to income.\n\nOne of the biggest proponents of this approach is Richard Kahlenberg, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, a progressive independent think tank. He says that giving a leg up to economically disadvantaged students of all races would benefit people of color because they make up a disproportionate share of the poor.\n\nIt's good politics, too, he says.\n\nAn economic version of affirmative action is fairer and more appealing - and would not be so easily used as a wedge issue between Blacks and Whites, he says. He points to a 2016 Gallup poll which said that 61% of Americans favor a college considering a family's economic circumstances when making admissions decisions.\n\n\"The notion that the poor of all races have a special claim is a fundamental tenet of most of the world's great religions,\" Kahlenberg wrote in a 2018 essay . \"This is consistent with social science research which finds that today, being economically disadvantaged in America poses seven times as large an obstacle to high student achievement as does race.\"\n\nKeeping affirmative action alive is also good business, diversity consultants say.\n\nA conservative majority on the high court can't eliminate a growing recognition that the country needs an educated and diverse workforce to remain competitive, they say.\n\nThis recognition is driven by demographic changes. The US Census' 2020 report revealed that people who identify as White alone declined for the first time since the Census began in 1790 and that the majority of Americans under 18 are now people of color.\n\nHoward Ross , a diversity consultant and social justice advocate, says corporate America and institutions like the military won't retreat from diversity efforts because they realize it's good for their bottom line. They are driven by what he calls \"enlightened self-interest.\"\n\n\"People are realizing that there is an enormous amount of talent out there that's being underutilized and that companies and leadership that reflect their customer base perform better in the stock market,\" Ross says.\n\nTo reach a more diverse customer base, companies increasingly understand they must hire diverse workers who know how to reach those customers and make them feel welcome.\n\nCorporate diversity makes dollars and sense, says Ross, author of \"Everyday Bias: Identifying and Navigating Unconscious Judgements in Our Daily Lives.\"\n\n\"When you go into a store and you see people like yourself, you feel more comfortable, and a greater sense of belonging, and you feel they may understand your needs,\" Ross says. \"That's something that may be the difference between you buying a product at that store versus another one.\"\n\nAnd Supreme Court scholars cite another point: The court can try to remake society, but it can't enforce its own rulings.\n\nFor example, the court declared in 1962 that prayer in school was unconstitutional, \"but in many schools people kept praying,\" Friedman says.\n\n\"The Supreme Court hands down decisions, but when they say everybody has to change their behavior, it's almost impossible for them to get compliance.\"\n\nBut there are others who say a high court ruling against affirmative action in higher education will be devastating in both the short term and the long term.\n\nIn the short term, minority enrollment will probably plummet at some colleges if history is a guide. In 1996, California voters passed Proposition 209 , which banned the use of what it called \"preferential treatment\" on the basis of things like race and sex in public educational settings and public sector jobs.\n\nThe ban hurt Black college applicants. From 1995 to 1998, admission offers to Black applicants at UCLA and the University of California, Berkeley, fell by 55%, according to one estimate . One UCLA faculty member told The New Yorker that his school ended up \"looking more like Ole Miss.\"\n\nIn 2020, California voters rejected Proposition 16, which would have restored the use of race and gender in public college admissions.\n\nIn the long term, economic affirmative action is not enough to help applicants of color, others say.\n\nThey point to research that shows that a focus on income alone in college admissions does not help students of color as much as other approaches that explicitly use race. This is an area of dispute among those who support affirmative action. But there is some evidence that racial diversity falls at colleges when income is used as a substitute for race in admissions decisions.\n\nAnd who says the high court can't defy popular will? They do it all the time, says Gerald N. Rosenberg, author of \" The Hollow Hope: Can Courts Bring About Social Change ?\"\n\nRosenberg cites the movement to abolish child labor in the late 19th and early 20th century. It had sympathetic victims. Smudge-faced and barefoot children were routinely employed as workers in dangerous factories, where their smaller size could help them do certain tasks and their age made them more unlikely to strike.\n\nActivists successfully persuaded the public to turn against child labor through photo exposes, pamphlets, and mass mailings. They even forced the US Congress to act.\n\nBut the Supreme Court didn't care, Rosenberg says.\n\n\"There was a majority support to abolish child labor,\" he says. The Congress passed two separate bills using two different constitutional law hours to abolish child labor. The court invalidated both those laws, postponing the end of child labor for a generation.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court is insulated against social pressure to change because the nation's political system is also designed to deflect majority will, Rosenberg says. That's because America's Founding Fathers created a government that was built to resist \"pure democracy,\" such as the direct election of presidents, he says. They feared too much democracy would degenerate into \"mobs\" and \"factions.\"\n\nThe Constitution dictates, for example, that every state gets two senators, no matter how small the state's population. And as we saw with Donald Trump in 2016, it allows that a presidential candidate can lose the popular vote but still become president through the electoral college.\n\nAny optimism about the will of the people being stronger than the high court doesn't consider the gridlock of our politics, Rosenberg says. What chance is there for Congress to pass a law overruling a high court decision when Congress barely functions?\n\n\"If we had a political system in which majority views were pretty closely translated that optimism would be well-taken,\" he says. \"But we don't have that system.\"\n\nThere are other signs that the current makeup of the Supreme Court is well-suited to ignoring popular will .\n\nThe court's conservative bloc has already moved aggressively towards overturning Roe v. Wade, despite polls showing a majority of Americans believe that abortion should be legal in all or most cases.\n\nThose who think the popular will can supplant the high court forget their history: The Supreme Court's traditional role has been to block political and social change, not validate it, scholars like Rosenberg say.\n\nThe high court has historically listened to one demographic above all: the wealthy, the powerful and the privileged, court critics say.\n\n\"I always say don't underestimate the ability of the status quo to continue,\" Rosenberg says.\n\nThe high court is expected to deliver their final say on affirmative action in higher education by June of 2023.\n\nIf the conservative bloc on the high court rules as expected, the aftershocks could ripple into other segments of a rapidly diversifying American society where buzzwords like diversity and inclusion are now taken for granted as facts of life.\n\nWe will then learn what is stronger:\n\nThe will of the Supreme court or the will of the people.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "How Asian Americans fit into the affirmative action debate\n\nAffirmative action is on trial again, and this time Asian Americans are at the center.\n\nThe conservative majority US Supreme Court heard oral arguments this week in two cases involving Harvard University and the University of North Carolina that challenge whether colleges and universities can continue to consider race as a factor in admissions decisions.\n\nIn the Harvard case, the conservative group Students for Fair Admissions is alleging that the university discriminates against Asian American applicants by rating them lower on traits such as leadership and likeability and holding them to a higher standard for admission than other applicants. By contrast, the plaintiff has claimed , Harvard's admissions policies favor Black and Latino students.\n\nRelated article Opinion: How Harvard admissions can be a barometer of our deepest divides\n\nThere are two separate issues at play here, said Kevin Kumashiro, an educational policy expert and the former dean of the School of Education at the University of San Francisco.\n\n\"We need to address anti-Asian bias,\" he said. \"But we need to be careful not to say that anti-Asian bias is a sign that affirmative action is anti-Asian. That's actually a very different question, and I think it too often gets conflated.\"\n\nThe reality of where Asian Americans stand on affirmative action is complicated. A recent Washington Post-Schar School poll found that while 65% of Asians and Pacific Islanders say that colleges shouldn't consider race in admissions, 66% also say programs designed to increase racial diversity on campus are a good thing.\n\nSuch contradictions, Kumashiro said, reflect how Asian Americans are navigating an imperfect system. CNN spoke to Kumashiro about anti-Asian bias in college admissions, why some Asian American students feel like they're losing out and what's next if the Supreme Court strikes down affirmative action.\n\nThe conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat was affirmative action designed to do, and is the policy still serving its intended purpose?\n\nIn the early 1960s, the Kennedy administration put forward the idea of affirmative action in the midst of the civil rights movement. One of the arguments of the civil rights movement was that racism is baked into many institutions in society: the criminal justice system, health care, finance, housing, and of course, education.\n\n(Affirmative action was intended as) a way to remedy historic injustices. When you compete for things like jobs and education, you're not starting on a level playing field.\n\nThe first significant shift in how we understand affirmative action, particularly with higher education admissions, comes with the Supreme Court cases - the first of them is in 1978 . The Supreme Court has actually heard affirmative action cases three times , and it's basically the same case three times. It was people claiming that White students are discriminated against in college admissions because of the consideration of race, and that this violates the 14th Amendment and the Civil Rights Act (of 1964).\n\n(The Supreme Court has previously ruled) that race can be considered in college admissions if two conditions apply. One is if race is one of a number of factors. The second is what's often called the diversity rationale, which says that race can be considered if the university argues that racial diversity contributes to the educational experience for students.\n\nIt sounds as though affirmative action in higher education has evolved over time to refer to campus diversity, which is not the same as remedying systemic discrimination.\n\nIt absolutely is much more narrow to say we want more students of color on campus, rather than to say we want to change how universities have historically served to advance certain groups more than others.\n\nThose who champion racial justice would say that affirmative action has had both pros and cons. One of the cons is that affirmative action policies aren't being developed to remedy structural racism. They've been set up to increase representation. That's not unimportant, but we need to go much farther.\n\nOne of the gains is that there's actually a lot of evidence that affirmative action policies do increase racial diversity on campuses. When you get rid of affirmative action policies, it also decreases racial diversity.\n\nSome Asian Americans feel that their race works against them in the admissions process, even though they encompass a diverse group and experience social disadvantages. Why do you think that is?\n\nWhile many Asian American students feel that the system is working for them and they're getting ahead, there are many who see that schools don't work for them. The reason why is because schools don't often work for many people. It's not just Asian Americans.\n\nThe earliest public schools were for a very small slice of the population. You had to be male and White, and your family had to own property. It paralleled the criteria for citizenship. As schools were forced to include more and more students, they came up with more and more ways to differentiate and sort them: through segregation, tracking, labeling, discipline. We might say today that the purpose is equal educational opportunity, but historically, the function of schools was always to differentiate and sort.\n\nEducation was never built to level the playing field and in many ways, it doesn't do so now, which is why there's an irony around affirmative action. Simply diversifying the pot doesn't actually change that pot. What we actually need to do is change the system, and affirmative action doesn't go that far. Asian American students who see that the system didn't work for them are very perceptive in recognizing that the system was never built for them.\n\nDespite concerns that they're being disadvantaged in college admissions, Asian Americans are demographically overrepresented at elite universities. Why is that?\n\nAsian Americans are overrepresented in both elite universities like Harvard and also in community colleges.\n\nWith the immigration reform of 1965 , there were a couple of changes to immigration patterns from Asia: More skilled labor and more international students. Both of those things actually contributed to a particular social class that becomes predominant among Asian American communities. And with a higher social class comes more access to education. With immigration reform, the pipelines into higher education did change to the benefit of Asian Americans.\n\nAnother reason is a norm among many immigrant communities, particularly middle class immigrant communities: A hyper focus on educational achievement. Asian Americans and Asian American immigrant communities often put a lot of emphasis on standard measures of educational achievement, like scoring really well on tests and doing really well in school. There's this cultural attention paid to education that is not just a stereotype.\n\nOnce you have access to education, you see that as a path. For half a century, Asian Americans have been able to tap into that path, partly because of (the 1965 Immigration Act).\n\nDoes the holistic admissions process, as opposed to prioritizing grades and test scores, disadvantage Asian Americans?\n\nThings like social class, income, where you went to school, zip code or geography often so strongly correlate with race that (considering these criteria) can increase representation among Black, Latinx, Pacific Islander and Native American students. We have all sorts of proxies that get used for race. It can be more difficult for Asian Americans to get in when these proxies are considered.\n\nSometimes people say test scores and GPA should be the primary criteria. Even those criteria are very subjective. Test scores are also highly correlated with zip code, and GPA can vary significantly, not only between schools but even within schools. Are they really objective measures of achievement or potential? No, they are a slice of who the student is. The more information we can gather to get a full picture of the students, the better able we're going to be able to make these decisions.\n\nUltimately, what you want is for students to have a high quality educational experience, and I actually would agree that having a campus that looks more like society is the kind of campus we're trying to work towards.\n\nHow should universities correct for anti-Asian bias in admissions?\n\nOne very big step that all universities should be engaging in is making sure there's training for people involved in the admissions process. Everyone brings their biases into the room with them, and sometimes we're aware of them, and sometimes we're not so aware of them.\n\nBut it's more than just diversity training. What we also need are policies that are explicitly trying to change and broaden how we think about admissions. Part of the reason biases come up and are often unrecognized is because we don't talk about how their criteria themselves are racialized. What we think of as being well prepared or being smart or being articulate or being a leader ... all of these characteristics are actually always going to be informed by culture, geography, race and social class.\n\nSo some Asian Americans feel that they face stiffer and stiffer competition for a few coveted seats at elite universities. At the same time, Asian Americans on the whole do pretty well in that system. How do you make sense of that?\n\nThe reality is that the relationship between Asian Americans and affirmative action is a very paradoxical one. On the one hand, we want what's best for our children. Maybe for some parents that's getting them into Harvard, and if affirmative action is preventing even more Asian Americans from getting into Harvard, (parents feel) it's going to be even harder for their kid.\n\nOn the other hand, what's best for our kid should be seen as what's best for every kid. That's the straddling that Asian Americans have to do as well. Do we advocate for ourselves or do we advocate for the just system? Why sometimes does that feel like it's at odds?\n\nAsian Americans are often described as a \"wedge\" in this fight - they're either being used by White people or they're standing in solidarity with Black students who are up against generations of systemic discrimination. What about their own interests here?\n\nI think that is absolutely how a lot of Asian Americans interpret this: Am I giving up my own best interests in order for others to be able to succeed or flourish?\n\nI'm not convinced that Asian Americans are sacrificing when we support affirmative action policies. If we agree that traditional measures of success like test scores and GPAs are accurate indicators of who is most accomplished and most promising - and therefore most eligible to get into a place like Harvard - then yes, affirmative action may actually harm you if you have those qualifications.\n\nBut those measures have long benefited certain groups, and they don't necessarily reflect who is the most accomplished or who is the most promising. So what should be the best ways to determine whether someone is best suited for this university versus another university or whether they're better suited than another student?\n\nI know these are much bigger questions. If someone doesn't want to hurt their child's chances (of getting into an elite university) and I'm saying, \"Let's rethink the purpose of higher ed,\" they'll say that's not what they're talking about. But that's the direction that we need to be moving in.\n\nIt seems that all of these students are in a zero sum game - that for Asian American students to succeed, Black, Latino and Native students have to lose out, and vice versa. Does it have to be this way?\n\nThere are so many narratives that pit groups against one another with the assumption that there's only so much to go around. What does it mean for us to change the terms of the debate?\n\nWe as a society still seem invested in the idea that there should be certain universities that remain at the top. But if we saw higher ed as playing much more of a democratizing role, we wouldn't want only a few small elite institutions. We'd want to really rethink what the role of institutions should be, and therefore what access should be. Too often we're debating over access to an unjust system, rather than trying to change that system.\n\nAs Black, Latino, Native and Asian students are pitted against each other, one group that's often ignored is what's known at Harvard as ALDCs : recruited athletes, legacies, those on the dean's interest list and children of faculty and staff. Those students are largely White. Should Harvard limit the numbers of those students?\n\nI absolutely think it should, particularly legacy admissions and children of donors.\n\nWe're already giving preferential admissions to other groups, and it happens to be groups that already have privilege in society. Why aren't we doing the opposite? Why aren't we trying to level the playing field using affirmative action policies to give people who have long been denied access?\n\nGiven the makeup of this Supreme Court, affirmative action seems unlikely to survive in its current form. What's the future of higher education admissions?\n\nOne of the ways that campuses can and should continue to build a diverse pool for their student body is by looking at many aspects of the student. Some of those aspects are actually so closely correlated with race that they will help to increase racial diversity, like geography, social class, type of school, and so on.\n\nThere's another part to this: What's the future for higher education if it wants to address historic problems? If we think about a university serving those loftier goals, education shouldn't be about simply preparing people to succeed in the world as it is. Education should be about making the world a better place.\n\nEvery crisis is also an opportunity. The end of affirmative action is a chance for us to hit the pause button and imagine something different.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

Those steps include releasing a report on strategies for increasing diversity and educational opportunity and providing schools with guidance on what is and isn't allowed, among other things.\n\nNot all higher education institutions will be affected by the ruling. The decision allows US military service academies to continue to take race into consideration as a factor in admissions.\n\nSteve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said that the impact could also vary depending on where schools are located.\n\nIn states that continue to permit colleges and universities to take race into account, \"we'll surely see efforts to encourage the kinds of uses the majority does not expressly disavow - whether in diversity statements or elsewhere,\" he said.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

He is a senior writer and columnist for ESPN the Magazine and ESPN.com. Follow him on Twitter: @locs_n_laughs .\n\nLZ Granderson: A lot of black professionals -- like me -- don't like affirmative action\n\nWhy? Because some whites think we got our jobs solely because of our race, he says\n\n\"Some think the word diversity is a euphemism for 'anything but white,' but I don't,\" he says\n\nGranderson: The reasons for affirmative action's creation are still with us, so we still need it\n\nIf I had a nickel each time a white guy e-mails or tweets that I have my job because I'm black, I wouldn't need the job, because I'd be rich.\n\nThis is at the heart of a little talked about secret regarding affirmative action: A lot of black professionals don't like it either. Not because they think the playing field is necessarily leveled, but rather their skills and talents are constantly being slighted by whites who think their jobs were given to them solely because of their race.\n\nIt's insulting, it's demeaning and there's not a damn thing we can do about it, because as long as race is part of the qualification metric, the perception that the bar was lowered so that we could jump over it will persist.\n\nThere are voters who think President Obama's success came easy because of affirmative action, overlooking the fact he's brilliant and oh, by the way, he and the first lady were still paying off their student loans 10 years ago. I can tell you from experience, there is nothing \"easy\" about paying back student loans.\n\nYes, there is an inherent hypocrisy of having such a policy in a post civil-rights world. But it is cynical to think we're a post-racial society just because we have a black president.\n\nShould affirmative action still exist?\n\nThat's not to characterize all that befalls blacks and other minorities as \"the man\" holding us down, but rather recognizing a freight train doesn't stop the instant the brakes are applied. Racial inequality had been moving full steam ahead for centuries in this country, starting with the attempted genocide of Native Americans. So while our present-day attitudes about race are changed, the byproducts stemming from our past attitudes - like access to a quality education and the impact of generational poverty - are still very much at play.\n\nOpinion: Keep affirmative action but reform it\n\nRelated video SCOTUS to hear affirmative action case\n\nRelated video Is affirmative action constitutional?\n\nRelated video SCOTUS to hear affirmative action case\n\nTalking about this and other topics related to race doesn't make one a racist. But denying its relevance in everyday life has the potential to hurt everyone. For example, the Florida State Board of Education has recently come under fire because the academic achievement goals it set for minority students appear to be lower than the ones set for white students. By the 2017-18 school year, the board wants to have 88% of white students at or above the grade level benchmark for reading but only 81% of Latinos and 74% of blacks.\n\nThe reason: the disparity in the current reading level. While 69% of whites reach that mark now, only 53% of Latinos and just 38% of blacks do. That's a problem, not only in terms of students' ability to get into college, but just having a workforce in the state that is literate. So though the percentages of the 2017-18 goals seem biased in favor of whites, the percentage increase seeks to aggressively address a major reading problem plaguing minorities.\n\nThis isn't racist. This is recognizing that if this racial disparity goes unchecked, it could have debilitating long-term effects on Florida's economy.\n\nSome think the word diversity is a euphemism for \"anything but white,\" but I don't. I believe in the diversity of thought, which sometimes can play out racially, but not always. Having people from different geographic locations can introduce different insight and talent to a college campus or workforce, and variations of socioeconomic status bring in diversity as well.\n\nBut don't be mistaken, race is important.\n\nOne of the elements of the infamous \"47%\" video that didn't get talked about a lot was Mitt Romney's joke that if he had Mexican heritage, he'd have \"a better shot\" at winning the election. That joke was followed by a comment from someone in the crowd who suggested Romney could claim to have some Native American heritage like Elizabeth Warren, to get a leg up. In what socioeconomic metric is there a quantifiable advantage to being Mexican or Native American in this country?\n\nThe outcry about the push for diversity in the workplace and in college admissions would lead you to believe we're overcompensating for the sins of the past. But look around: Does it really look as if the populations with the highest poverty rate - blacks, Latinos and Native Americans - are just cleaning up in the game of life?\n\n5 things to know about affirmative action\n\nTrue, there are certainly examples of unqualified or incompetent employees being placed in positions they shouldn't be because of flawed decision making from white superiors trying to be compliant with their HR department. However, that's not what affirmative action was designed to do.\n\nTake my profession, for example.\n\nAccording to an American Society of News Editors study, minorities make up 12.3% of newspaper staffs and 16.4% of online-only news staffs despite being a third of the general population. Similarly the National Association of Black Journalists released a study last month that found minorities filled 12% of the newsroom managerial positions at 295 stations owned by 19 media conglomerates.\n\nSo I ask you, if the so-called liberal media struggles to employ diversity that's representative of the people - and it has affirmative action policies in place - what makes us think completely removing such initiatives is going to improve the situation?\n\nI do not like affirmative action in its current incarnation, and I think a lot of us can agree the flaws need to be addressed. But in this conversation, let's not pretend the reasons why it was created in the first place are no longer around.\n\nFollow @CNNOpinion on Twitter\n\nJoin us at Facebook/CNNOpinion\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "'Race neutral' replaces affirmative action. What's next?\n\nA version of this story appears in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here .\n\nWhen the Supreme Court cut affirmative action out of college admissions programs Thursday, it did not outlaw the goal of achieving diversity, but it set a new \"race-neutral\" standard for considering applicants.\n\nThat term - \"race neutral\" - does not appear in the opinion of the court , written by Chief Justice John Roberts, which states that colleges and universities have \"concluded, wrongly, that the touchstone of an individual's identity is not challenges bested, skills built, or lessons learned but the color of their skin.\"\n\nBut when Roberts clarifies that students can still refer to their race in admissions essays, explaining challenges they've overcome, he and the majority are buying into the idea of race neutrality.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas, who wrote his own concurring opinion, uses the term \"race neutral\" repeatedly, offering it as an antidote to affirmative action.\n\nPointing to efforts in California and Michigan to enroll diverse classes at top universities even after voters in those states ended affirmative action, Thomas says race-neutral policies can \"achieve the same benefits of racial harmony and equality without any of the burdens and strife generated by affirmative action policies.\"\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor shot back at Thomas and the majority, rejecting the term.\n\n\"The majority's vision of race neutrality will entrench racial segregation in higher education because racial inequality will persist so long as it is ignored,\" she wrote.\n\nFor more on this view, read this piece in The Atlantic by scholars Uma Jayakumar and Ibram Kendi: \"'Race Neutral' Is the New 'Separate but Equal.'\"\n\nIf the experience of California and Michigan - where voters ended affirmative action programs years ago - is any indication, we can expect that the representation of Black and Latino students at top-level universities will fall.\n\nThose states argued in briefings to the court that their race-neutral efforts have not been completely successful, particularly at top-tier, flagship public schools, in creating environments that are inclusive for all.\n\nCalifornia has, according to its brief, tried race-neutral measures that \"run the gamut from outreach programs directed at low-income students and students from families with little college experience, to programs designed to increase UC's geographic reach, to holistic admissions policies.\"\n\nWhile it has made strides, it says, there is a shortfall \"especially apparent at UC's most selective campuses, where African American, Native American, and Latinx students are underrepresented and widely report struggling with feelings of racial isolation.\"\n\nIn California, half of the college-age population - 18-24 - is Latino, according to data from the Public Policy Institute of California . Compare that with just 27% of enrollees for 2022 at the University of California's nine undergraduate campuses who the UC system categorizes as Hispanic/Latinx.\n\nOn the other hand, less than 13% of the college-age population is Asian, compared with 38% of UC enrollees.\n\nA little more than quarter of college-age Californians are White, compared with 18% of UC enrollees.\n\nFive percent of UC enrollees are African American, which is about on par with the 5.6% of college-age Californians who are Black.\n\nThe figures change in comparison with the system overall at UC Berkeley , the system's flagship undergraduate campus, where a smaller portion of entrants in 2022 were categorized as African American / Black (3.6%) and Chicanx / Latinx (21.1%), and more were White (30.7%) and Asian (52.1%).\n\nIt's also interesting to note that the Supreme Court exempted military academies from the decision. They can, presumably, still utilize affirmative action even though they are the higher learning institutions over which the federal government has the most control. The court, according to the majority opinion, feels the academies have \"potentially distinct interests.\"\n\nThose interests were perhaps outlined by former military leaders who wrote a brief last year arguing affirmative action aided national security .\n\nMeanwhile, even though race is off the table as a determinative factor, schools like Harvard University can and still will very much take into account whether an applicant's parents went there, how much their parents might be able to donate and whether an applicant can help their sports teams.\n\n\"While the actual language of the Supreme Court will come across as very intellectualized and esoteric, as if in a classroom, in reality, how will this work?\" wondered Laura Coates, CNN's chief legal analyst, appearing on the network Thursday.\n\n\"How will you be able to have certain color blindedness but then at the same time allowed to take into account one's experiences when race has been a part of that? That's the devil in the details of every affirmative action case.\"\n\nCNN's Nicquel Terry Ellis wrote about what the data suggests will happen:\n\nA study by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce found that colleges and universities are less likely to meet or exceed their current levels of racial diversity in the absence of race-conscious admissions. They are also less likely to reflect the racial makeup of the population graduating from the nation's high schools.\n\nZack Mabel, a researcher for Georgetown's Center for Education and the Workforce, told her race-neutral practices have not driven the diversity many colleges hoped for, and some students are simply not applying. Read more from Terry Ellis .\n\nCreating a more equitable and representative workforce has been a public aim in corporate America, where companies have created diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, departments. Multiple corporations - from Apple to IKEA - asked the Supreme Court to allow affirmative action to continue so that their potential workforce is more diverse.\n\nBut efforts to recruit students of color in the race-neutral, post-affirmative-action world will be complicated in states where there is a growing backlash to diversity efforts.\n\nCNN's Leah Asmelash recently wrote :\n\nMore than a dozen state legislatures have introduced or passed bills reining in DEI programs in colleges and universities, claiming the offices eat up valuable financial resources with little impact.\n\n\"The ruling by the Court's six Republican-appointed justices prevents higher-education institutions from considering race in admissions precisely as kids of color, for the first time, comprise a majority of the nation's high-school graduates,\" writes Ronald Brownstein , a senior editor at The Atlantic and a senior political analyst for CNN.\n\nHe suggests the decision will \"widen the mismatch between a youth population that is rapidly diversifying and a student body that is likely to remain preponderantly white in the elite colleges and universities that serve as the pipeline for leadership in the public and private sectors.\"\n\nRather than ease social tension, he argues, the new race-neutral requirement could actually propel it.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

University of Texas\n\nRichard Sander, Stuart Taylor: Large racial preferences can hurt minority students\n\nThey say the court will probably not abolish affirmative action in the case\n\nWriters: Reforming affirmative action policies can improve diversity goals\n\nAffirmative action - which is coming up before the Supreme Court on Wednesday in Fisher v. University of Texas - has long been one of America's most divisive social policies. But it doesn't need to be.\n\nUniversities engage in many forms of affirmative action that are uncontroversial, such as efforts to reach out and encourage minority applicants, or initiatives to make sure that admissions officers are going beyond test scores to find the strongest candidates.\n\nThe battle is really about the use of racial preferences in admissions, especially the large preferences often used by selective schools that, in effect, add a full point to the high school grade-point average of every black applicant, and half a point to every Hispanic applicant, or otherwise adjust the academic qualifications of black and Hispanic applicants so as to make them appear, for purposes of comparison with white and Asian applicants, much more academically prepared than they actually are. These policies are often justified as ways of ensuring fair minority representation - which, in turn, is supposed to foster a better learning environment for everyone.\n\nBut a growing stack of carefully vetted research is finding that these large preferences often undermine the very goals they are intended to promote, because they do a poor job of matching students to the college environments in which they are most likely to thrive.  A student who would do extremely well at Wake Forest ends up at struggling at Duke; a student who would thrive at a strong state university gets recruited away to the Ivy League and becomes a marginal student.\n\nNews: The young woman at the center of the SCOTUS challenge\n\nFor example, students who aspire to careers in science or engineering (STEM fields), and who get into a school where they are surrounded by academically stronger students, have low odds of actually getting a STEM degree. Yet these students have what it takes to have a successful career in STEM - if they go to the right school. A careful study led by University of Virginia psychologist Fred Smyth found that the well-matched minority students were nearly 80% more likely to achieve their STEM aspirations. Three other studies have confirmed Smyth's findings.\n\nIn Fisher - the case before the Supreme Court - the University of Texas reintroduced racial preferences in 2004 because, it said, it wanted to achieve racial balancing of minority students in its classes. But it has pursued this goal with very large preferences, and since these students are likely to retreat from the most competitive and rigorous classes to softer fields, the use of racial preferences can easily have little or no effect at all upon classroom integration.\n\nThe mismatch problem undermines diversity goals in other ways, too. Undisputed research has found that students are more likely (holding other things, such as race, constant) to make friendships with other students who have comparable levels of academic preparation. When colleges use large preferences, they interfere with social assimilation, and the minorities who are the \"beneficiaries\" of these preferences often feel socially isolated and self-segregate. Indeed, preferences that are so large that they produce disparities in academic performance across racial lines are likely to foster negative stereotypes - just the opposite of what diversity programs are supposed to achieve.\n\nIn short, large racial preferences, and indeed large preferences of any other kind (e.g., for children of alumni, for athletes, etc.) are often counterproductive. Yet universities continue to use them, partly because they may not understand the consequences of mismatch, but mainly because they are under tremendous pressure to achieve a particular racial balance - at whatever cost - in their student bodies. These are exactly the situations where government regulation has a helpful role to play, and the Supreme Court is poised to play it.\n\nNews: Affirmative action under pressure in Supreme Court\n\nMany observers are predicting that the court, with five conservative votes, will simply abolish racial preferences. That strikes us as unlikely; Justice Anthony Kennedy, the swing vote, is more likely to put teeth in the court's earlier holdings and simply create some tougher tests that universities must satisfy if they use racial preferences.\n\nTwo reforms seem to us particularly important: Find a way to limit the overall size of racial preferences, and mandate a thorough transparency at any university that wants to use them.\n\nLimiting the size of racial preferences means making smaller, race-based adjustments to applicant qualifications - or, to put it differently, not ignoring very wide differences in academic preparation across racial lines. And by transparency we mean three things: Disclose to applicants the way that admissions decisions are made, provide information about how students such as the applicant have fared at that university, and make some form of all this information available to the public and to watchdog groups. In other words, students need to have all available information about whether they are jeopardizing their success in college by accepting a large preference into a more elite school.\n\nThese sorts of reforms would represent a radical departure from past practices; they would create a level of accountability that simply does not exist in colleges today. And they would almost certainly moderate the use of a controversial and often ineffective tool of social policy - racial preferences - without the heavy hand of a complete ban.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion .\n\nJoin us on Facebook/CNNOpinion .\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Richard Sander and Stuart Taylor Jr.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

The survey was conducted online between October 25 and November 9.\n\nWhen asked about the ruling's impact, about half of Black adults said the ruling will mostly or slightly have a negative impact on higher education across the country, 17% said it will have no impact and 33% said it will have a slightly or mostly positive impact, the survey found.\n\nBut similar shares of Asian, Hispanic and White adults - nearly 50% - said the ruling will have a slightly or mostly positive impact, Gallup found.\n\nThe share of respondents who said the ruling will make it harder for prospective students of their own race to attend college was larger among Black adults (52%) than the other race or ethnic groups included in the survey.\n\nAbout a third of Hispanic adults, 23% of Asian adults and 9% of White adults said it will be much or slightly harder for applicants of their race or ethnic group to attend college, according to the survey. About a third of respondents in each of the groups said it will be easier, and about half of Asian and over half of White adults said it will have no impact, the survey found.\n\nHow clashing interpretations of Martin Luther King's legacy fuels the fight over DEI and affirmative action\n\nMore respondents across all racial and ethnic groups said the ruling will result in less diverse college campuses. About 49% of Black adults and 57% of Asian adults said that would be the case, according to the survey.\n\nTye Compton, a 22-year-old political science major at Howard University is among the young adults who believes the Supreme Court ruling will make college campuses less diverse.\n\n\"There will be less students of color applying for more competitive programs and there could be less opportunities for underserved students in receiving support,\" he said, referring to scholarships, grants, fellowships earmarked for diversifying the student body.\n\nCompton said he thinks the decision to overturn affirmative action in higher education \"was flawed and has severely undermined the significance of diversity within our higher education institutions.\n\nFatimah Gilliam, CEO and founder of the consulting firm Azara Group, described how California's decision to gut affirmative action in the late 1990s impacted her own decisions to go to college.\n\nGilliam said she was accepted into the University of California Berkeley's law school but chose not attend because she felt it would be emotionally draining as one of the few Black students on campus.\n\n\"I went to Columbia Law School - a more expensive school where I took out significant student loans - when I had a financially cheaper option that was more expensive mentally,\" Gilliam, who is also author of 'Race Rules: What Your Black Friend Won't Tell You,' said.\n\n\"I opted not to go to what I deemed would be a lonely, isolating, possibly hostile, and not inclusive but exclusionary environment where I would be tokenized and expected to represent the voice of all Black people. I wasn't signing up for that emotional labor on top of the rigor of law school.\"\n\nCamille Lloyd, director for the Gallup Center on Black Voices, told CNN that many Americans, regardless of their racial or ethnic background, think admissions should be based on merit rather than race. But, Lloyd said, at the same time, they don't see the end of affirmative action as having a positive impact on people like them.\n\n\"I do think that people are more likely to say that there are negative impacts that will likely occur as a result of this, regardless of how they feel in terms of whether the decision itself is mostly good or mostly bad,\" Lloyd told CNN.\n\nThat perception seems likely to impact the decisions of prospective students, Lloyd said.\n\nA snapshot of the latest Lumina Foundation-Gallup State of Higher Education study released on Tuesday found that the ruling could be impacting the college applications of non-college graduates ages 18 to 59.\n\nAmong 1,378 respondents who said they have considered pursuing a bachelor's degree in the past two years, half of the 208 respondents who identified as Black said the ruling on affirmative action will impact \"a great deal\" or a \"fair amount\" which colleges they might apply to.\n\n\"It's not surprising, unfortunately, but disheartening to hear that this is going to impact (where they apply to college),\" said Courtney Brown, vice president of strategic impact and planning for the Lumina Foundation, a nonprofit that aims to increase participation in education beyond high school. \"We need to make sure we're actually doing something with the results.\"\n\nBrown told CNN Black students' enrollment has declined in the past decade and it's concerning that the Supreme Court ruling may become another challenge for them.\n\n\"Black students face more barriers, they have more responsibilities and so they already have all of these things piled on them and this is another burden they may be carrying,\" Brown said.\n\n\"This decision is going to impact them more because they feel like their universities may not be as diverse that they won't feel as welcome and unfortunately, my fear is that they'll be less likely to enroll and we'll see these numbers continue to decline in the future,\" Brown added.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.
